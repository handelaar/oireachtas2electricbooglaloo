Will the position and regional <Col N="1518" /> governance of those counties be clarified quickly by legislation and, if not, will the Government be unconvincing in Brussels in the sense that if it has not made its own legislative provisions for the new regions, it can hardly make a convincing case that they should be recognised in Brussels?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government hopes that the model put forward by the Department of Finance in its preliminary discussions with EUROSTAT and the Commission will require the regions to be divided by order under the Local Government Acts.  That is subject to the discussions which will now start formally with EUROSTAT and Commissioner Wulf-Mathies. It is not envisaged that primary legislation will be necessary, but if we come up with a different model or the model put forward by the Department of Finance in its preliminary discussions with the Commission requires primary legislation, we will introduce it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party is in favour of full and proper regionalisation.  Our difficulty is that we do not know what the Government is proposing.  The last part of the statement issued yesterday, which we could not discuss during Question Time or on the Order of Business but which is in today's newspapers, states that the Government has decided that a revised regional structure is needed in the context of the regionalisation proposal.  Will the Taoiseach indicate what legislation is proposed and will that indication come prior to any decision being made in Brussels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does he agree the application the Government is proceeding with in Brussels would be strengthened if there were clear and concrete legislative proposals for regionalisation which had the support of the majority of this House, including Deputy Healy-Rae?  Will he indicate to the House if we will have a comprehensive debate on what is now in front of us, which we did not have because we did not know the Government's formal decision?  Could he outline the Government's thinking on the legislative structures which will underpin regionalisation?  Does he agree the case the Government wishes to make so strongly in Brussels would be immeasurably strengthened if this House debated it and if the legislation on regional structures was put in place?  He either believes in regionalisation or he does not.  If the Taoiseach believes in it, a value judgment does <Col N="1519" /> not need to be made by EUROSTAT in Brussels, but by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his support for regionalisation in which I also believe.  I have already said the model being used by the Department of Finance at this stage, prior to formal discussions with EUROSTAT, does not require primary legislation.  That may be different after the discussions.  The decision is that the NUTS II region of Ireland will be divided into two NUTS II regions, the Border and the west, and will include Clare and Kerry.</P>

      <P>The rest of the country will include all the other NUTS III regions.  Consequently, Cork city and county will be designated as a new NUTS III region on its own.  Clare will be removed from the NUTS III region.  On the basis of this and following discussions with EUROSTAT this matter will based on one main issue.  Whatever combination we put forward as a new regional structure to EUROSTAT will have to meet the 75 per cent GNP criterion.  There are two central issues in this.  If the application does not meet that criterion or if it is refused, whatever areas remain following the conclusions on Objective One in transition will hit sudden death and will not receive any more funds.  Any counties or regions divided or included in new regions in the new system would continue possibly from 1 January 2007 to 2012 or 2013 to receive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To summarise what is in the newspaper and what the Taoiseach has said, can I take it the Government's position is that if EUROSTAT agrees to our regionalisation proposal, the Government will bring in legislation to give effect to regionalisation, but if EUROSTAT does not agree to our proposal the Government will not introduce legislation to give effect to regionalisation?  Is that an accurate summary of the Government's intention in legislative terms?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not allowed to finish my reply to the previous question.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that the model, as prepared by the Department of Finance in preliminary discussions with EUROSTAT and Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, is based on a position that would not require primary legislation to change regional structures.  They could be changed by regulation. That is the model on which we are working.  It should be understood that anything that has happened to date has been preliminary.  The process has been laid down.  Portugal and the UK have had to do this and we are following the same model.  The UK has included West Wales, the valleys and Cornwall in its regional structure.  It has not introduced a regional structure that is any different from the model being followed by the Department of Finance and Portugal has not followed a different model in its proposal to separate Lisbon and the Tagus Valley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It lost a referendum on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Portugal sought to change the existing structure of five regions to eight regions, but it got agreement to split Lisbon and the Tagus Valley.  I cannot answer Deputy Quinn's question as to whether this model will be accepted in respect of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is, it can be introduced by way of regulation and, if it is not primary legislation may be required.  That the Government has decided on this may not carry any weight with EUROSTAT and we may have to come back here with a different arrangement, but we are only&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed region for Objective One status is artificial.  The Taoiseach has ignored the advice of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies when she told him he could not presume on additional funding if he submitted this type of proposal and neither could he presume that there would be any money available for any region post 2006.  It seems he has failed to take into account the advice Mr. Poulsen gave at the conference at which he spoke last Friday, that a better approach might be to identify growth areas here and not to try to get the last penny out of Europe.  He said that was not necessarily the best way to provide for our development, that man who is responsible, on behalf of the Commission, for regional development in this country and other areas.  The Taoiseach is going against all the advice from the European Commission and the Combat Poverty Agency which argues strongly that we should not go down the road the Government is following. There is poverty, disadvantage and marginalisation in rural and urban areas in every county in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regionalisation is being considered in the context of local government.  The emphasis currently is on developing local government at county and sub-county level, which, apart from this issue, is the way we are proceeding.  I heard what Mr. Poulsen said, I spoke to Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and I listened to the advice they gave.  I am sure Deputy De Rossa would accept that practically every country in the Community has gone down the regionalisation route.  Germany and other member states have gone down that route.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the importance of what we are endeavouring to do, Deputy De Rossa in his presentations on this issue continues to ignore the fact that public expenditure is £16 billion of which 7.5 per cent is co-financed.  The Deputy mentioned the report of the Combat Poverty Agency and I noted what it states.  We have a figure of £11 billion for social expenditure of which 2 per cent is co-financed.  We must be honest in this discussion.  This proposal will not make any difference to 98 per cent of social expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not have any effect on that.  The existing programmes will continue and the only ones under threat are those the Commissioner may exclude because she may decide to remove the EU's programmes and reduce the number to three.  They have allowed some of the important programmes, INTERREG and the Leader programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also refuses to accept a second point.  He does not want to hear what I have to say.  If we do not have a regionalisation programme, Objective One in transition will be all we can get because we have a rate of 104 per cent of GDP for the whole country and we will not be able to obtain higher State aid in any part of the country.  If one believes in regionalisation as I do, surely the way to deal with congestion and over population in some parts of the country is to use parts of the country to obtain higher State aids and more benefits, which will allow this country to properly regionalise and develop into the future.</P>

      <P>Before I call on Deputy Bruton, I remind the House that I have allowed a good deal of latitude on this matter.  I will allow a final round of questions, not statements, from the leaders of the parties. I call Deputy Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing a degree of latitude on this matter.  It is good that the House can respond quickly to issues that are matters of public controversy.  The Chair's rulings have been good in that regard, although they place him in some difficulty.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach see a risk that the Government will appear faintly ridiculous in Brussels because of its indecision on this matter over many months and that appearing ridiculous is the worst possible position in which a sovereign state can place itself?  In its consideration of the matter will the Government consider the possibility of allowing district electoral divisions, by means of an amendment to section 43 of the Local Government Act, to be included in contiguous regions which are being included in the proposal for Objective One status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make this suggestion in view of the fact that there are a number of regions in west Cork, west Limerick, Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary and other counties with incomes which fall well below the level required to qualify for Objective One status. By virtue of a simple change in section 43 of the <Col N="1523" /> Local Government Act, they could be included with the other areas that will be considered for Objective One status.  Such action would ensure that the regions in question, which will otherwise become centres of industrial blight because industries will not establish there and will insist on siting their operations in Objective One areas, will be treated fairly.  In view of the fact that the Taoiseach stated that the NUTS regions are not necessarily based on existing administrative structures, does he accept that this course of action is open to the Government?</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that he will be asked questions about statements made by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, on 11 June?  At that stage, the Minister of State indicated:</P>
    <P>The Commission has made it clear it could not support proposals to change the current regional map basis for Objective One status which were not adequately based in terms of regional administration.  In addition, it is clear the Commission fears the precedent effect of such a proposal.</P>
    <P>How can the Taoiseach reconcile his earlier comments with those made by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance on 11 June and how will he answer questions about inconsistencies between their respective statements?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that this debate has the potential to be highly divisive and not only will it affect his party but it will also set one region against another?  Does he agree that this island has suffered in the past from such divisions and that this debate is in no one's interest?  Will the Taoiseach publish a White Paper to articulate and defend the Government's argument on this issue and will he provide time for the House to debate that White Paper?  If he is serious about regionalisation, will the Taoiseach not introduce legislation &mdash; irrespective of EUROSTAT's concerns &mdash; to give effect to the devolution of powers?  If these things are done, the country will be able to unite behind the Government to try to maximise the interests everyone supports.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that the way and manner in which the debate has unfolded has been highly divisive and that the case being put forward by the Government in Brussels has been weakened as a result?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that it would be better for Ireland to base its regionalisation plans on the real incomes of the regions, rather than the distorted GDP figure applied by the European Union to the allocation of funding in different states?  Will the Taoiseach indicate why, if European Union funding is unimportant to places such as Knocknaheeny, Darndale, <Col N="1524" /> Ballymun and Ballybeg, the Government has decided to divide the country down the middle and set one area against another?  This is one of the most divisive decisions to be taken in the past decade by any Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton inquired if the Government will be embarrassed.  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Since March, the Department of Finance has been involved in active discussions &mdash; admittedly on a preliminary basis &mdash; with EUROSTAT and the Commission.  I discussed this issue on two occasions with the Commissioner who is well aware of the Government's views on it.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-divisions, the position outlined by Deputy Bruton was considered by and received no support from the Commissioner, the Commission or EUROSTAT.  It would have been good if blackspots in Dublin and other cities could have been taken into account for Objective One status but that was comprehensively ruled out.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas which have so far been considered under the regionalisation proposal and discussed in a preliminary way with the Commission are the existing NUTS III regions.  I will not repeat the entire list but, as Deputy Quinn stated, these include the Border region and the midlands.  When the Commission considered the NUTS III regions to see if the pro-gramme could be made more ambitious, it reached the opinion that it could allow the addition of Clare and Kerry to the area already included in those three regions to form an extended Objective One area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is clearly believed by every member state that as and from 1 January 2007 areas that still have Objective One status will be allowed to phase it out on some basis, by way of Objective One in transition, by getting more funds in Objective Two status or more funds in Objective Three.  As Commissioner Wulf-Mathies said recently, she cannot answer for what might happen at the end of 2006 and I do not ask her to.  The clear view of everybody is that those areas that now hold Objective One status will be allowed to transfer out.</P>
      <P>If people are against this system they need to answer two questions honestly.  First, they need to say which counties they believe should not have any funding after December 2006 that are clearly entitled to it under the GDP ratio put down by Europe.  Second, they should say they do not want to see counties having the opportunity to get higher State aid for the next six, seven or perhaps 12 years.  They should answer those questions.  Our view is that we should try to maximise the amount of money we can receive legitimately &mdash; no begging bowl, no breaking of rules &mdash; as Portugal and every other country is doing.  Should the Government, just to make an easy decision, keep one region and have dead end in December 2006 with lower State aid?  That would be nonsensical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is hardly an issue that inspires such widespread unanimity across this Chamber than the need for greater safety on our national transport networks, in particular, the railways, the report on the safety on which has been recently published.</P>
      <P>Before looking in detail at the recommendations of this report, I will look briefly at the background to the drafting of such a composite study.  Following the derailment of a passenger train at Knockcroghery in November 1997, the Government commissioned an independent review into all aspects of railway safety.  The study, <i>de facto</i>, was to analyse the safety record and operations primarily of Iarnród Éireann which is a State company charged with responsibility for the nation's railway system.  It operates a range of passenger and freight services and is responsible for the renewal and maintenance of the railway infrastructures such as track signalling and level crossing services.  It also operates a passenger rail service jointly with Northern Ireland Railways and operates rail freight services into Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The overall objective of the study was to determine whether the risks posed to passengers, staff and members of the public arising from the national railway system are currently acceptable and to identify the principal options for addressing unreasonable risks and to estimate the broad cost of safety improvements.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, in April 1998, International Risk Management Services, in association with its partner consultants, were appointed to conduct a railway safety study of the Irish national railway network. The principal elements of the study included: a review of the initial information provided by Iarnród Éireann on railway operations; determination of the benchmarks to be used during the review in assessing the safety performance of the railway, taking into account the best practise of other railway operators world-wide, and consideration of Iarnród Éireann's safety performance through analysis of safety statistics covering the last five years of operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report states that a high proportion of facilities such as signalling, telecommunications and level crossings are in poor condition and that <Col N="1529" /> much of the signalling is in need of repair.  A number of level crossings have inadequate train braking distances and signalling overlaps and much of the equipment is in a poor state of repair.</P>
    <P>The consultants also carried out a risk assessment into the whole area of train accidents.  The conclusion of the assessment is that a carefully targeted total expenditure of £225 million could be justified on safety grounds alone.  Such expenditure would reduce current risk levels by 50 per cent on our national railway system over a 30 year period.</P>
    <P>It has been noted in the report that the risk on a line where the infrastructure is in generally good condition, but where there is a very regular service at high speed, may exceed that for a line where infrastructure is in poor condition, but with only an infrequent service operating at low speeds.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the issue of the adequacy or otherwise of safety.  Questionnaires were issued to all the staff working at Iarnród Éireann seeking their opinion with regard to safety procedures in operation.  There was a wide variation in the scoring of different aspects within the audit.  For example, the score in safety policy and procedures was quite high, while the score for the training and development of the staff was quite low.  This shows that certain areas of safety management at Iarnród Éireann require more urgent attention than others.</P>
    <P>A picture has certainly emerged in the minds of the consultants that Iarnród Éireann is an organisation that has learned much in the recent past about the best international safety manage-ment practices that are needed, but there is little sign that this is being translated on the ground into a strong safety culture across the organisation.</P>
    <P>Senior management appear to have a strong commitment to safety, but this has yet to be reflected in a corresponding improvement in the working conditions at ground level.  Implementation of the safety system relies on the co-operation of everyone in the company.  Therefore, much needs to be done to address staff morale in order that staff, supervisors and middle manage-ment can believe in the commitment of senior management and develop the motivation to put these safety systems in place.  Staff need to see the evidence of this commitment within their own workplace.</P>
    <P>The consultants have estimated that a 15-year safety investment programme needs to be implemented.  Overall expenditure includes about £230 million for a programme of improvements to rectify safety deficiencies in the railway infrastructure to include track, signalling bridges and level crossings About £60 million is earmarked for the improved management of infrastructural safety measures.  The consultants suggested the expenditure of a further £60 million to improve safety management systems generally throughout the rail network and £20 million per annum over a 15-year period on the renewal of the permanent <Col N="1530" /> way.  About £23 million of the figure of £590 million needs to be spent immediately.  The Government is committed to spending a minimum of £26 million on upgrading the mainline rail network between now and the year 2000.  This is separate from the amount to be spent by Iarnród Éireann over this period.</P>
    <P>I support the allocation of greater financial resources to ensure the implementation of the report's recommendations within the specified timeframe.  I commend the Minister for responding positively to them.  Last week she announced that CIE is to begin implementing the recommendations at once, giving particular attention to the immediate safety needs identified by the consultants.</P>
    <P>As recommended, a high level task force comprising officials of the Departments of Public Enterprise and Finance and CIE is being established which will report to Government by the end of January with prioritised recommendations to address the issues identified in the consultancy review.  Pending consideration by Government of the task force report, CIE is to be authorised to undertake borrowing to finance the implementation of safety measures.  The recruitment of two additional railway inspecting officers in the Department of Public Enterprise will begin immediately.  A regular safety progress audit will be submitted to the Minister and published.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to participate in a number of regional workshops at which the findings of the review will be presented to Iarnród Éireann staff at all levels.  This will ensure they will have an opportunity to express their views directly to the Government on all aspects of rail safety.  This is a first step in bringing together the board of CIE, Iarnród Éireann management, the trade unions and every member of staff, with a sense of urgency and common purpose, to fully implement the consultants recommendations.</P>
    <P>The report produced by International Risk Management Services is professional and far-reaching. While it is critical in part of some aspects of rail safety policies, its conclusions should not be forgotten.  It states that Iarnród Éireann provides a safe service with a level of reportable accidents and casualties comparable to that on any other rail network in Europe.  In recent years, however, there has been a shortfall in investment which is now impacting on safety. The reliance of Iarnród Éireann on the skill and experience of individual staff members is being undermined as the older generation retire or leave as a result of company downsizing.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the infrastructure safety adequacy review group and the safety management systems audit must be implemented in their entirety.  I commend the Minister for commissioning what is a much needed report on the safety of the rail network and for reacting swiftly to implement its recommendations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> The train is my preferred mode of transport but I do not use it any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> I availed of the service on the Dublin-Ballina-Westport line for many years.  If people are to avail of a service, there should be certain minimum guarantees.  The train should leave and arrive on time, and people should be assured of a seat and be able to travel in safety.  On the line mentioned one cannot be guaranteed that the train will leave on time.  Because of speed restrictions and other unforeseen circumstances, it invariably arrives in Dublin 30 to 45 minutes late. People cannot be guaranteed that they will arrive on time for a hospital appointment, to catch a bus to Dublin airport to catch a vital flight or for a sitting of the Dáil.  It is no longer practical to use the train much as one would like to use it.  There are thousands of commuters in that position.  One can quote anecdotes until the cows come home but this is the daily reality.</P>
    <P>Last Friday the 4.38 p.m. service from Heuston Station to Westport left 20 minutes late, there was no tannoy, no trolley service, no heating and the lights flickered on and off.  The train was delayed in Portarlington and Castlerea and arrived in Ballyhaunis 45 minutes late.  To establish progress one had to read the signs in the stations along the route having cleared the condensation off the window.  This is not an acceptable standard of service.</P>
    <P>Heuston Station on a Thursday, Friday and Saturday evening is something to behold.  A huge crowd builds up 45 minutes before the departure of the 6.5 p.m. service.  Their tickets are checked and they queue.  About ten minutes before the specified time of departure the charge of the light brigade begins and it is survival of the fittest.  I have seen passengers pushed and jostled.  I have seen passengers hobble along the platform having undergone a hip replacement operation at Cappagh Hospital.  I have seen elderly persons stand throughout the entire journey to the west.  To be guaranteed a seat one has to be first in the queue. Passengers cannot get to the toilet because the aisles are so crowded.  It is a recipe for disaster. It is more like downtown Calcutta than a train service to Castlebar.</P>
    <P>A decision was taken about ten years ago to allow the line become derelict to the point where it would have to be abandoned.  The most crucial decision, however, was taken in 1994 when the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, returned from Brussels with the pot of gold which was found to contain £6 billion, not £8 billion, and it was stated that there would be a massive enhancement programme across a range of areas. I do not know what the rationale was but when the national development plan was submitted to the European Commission only two rail lines were excluded &mdash; the Dublin-Ballina-Westport and Rosslare lines.  There was a sop and a promise.</P>
    <P>The national plan stated that a further pro-gramme of co-financed investment involving expenditure of an additional £90 million approximately, subject to resources being made available <Col N="1532" /> to CIE, would be implemented to upgrade and develop a number of other rail links, including the Dublin-Westport-Ballina and Dublin Rosslare lines.  Obviously, the resources were not made available.  In one of the CIE documents, a CIE executive said: &ldquo;I regret the resources were not made available to CIE to upgrade and to develop these lines&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Insult was added to injury when in 1996 the Cohesion Funds unit of the EU Commission engaged Goodbody economic consultants to review possible railway upgrading projects for Cohesion Fund assistance.  This was the mid-term review.  Goodbody was instructed to confine its analysis to the Galway, Sligo, Tralee, Waterford and Rosslare lines.  Rosslare, which was not included in 1994, was now included.  I have no problem with all the lines in the country being included, but this meant segregation and discrimination was reinforced further.  It now happens that the only line not included for co-financing from Cohesion Funds is the Dublin-Westport-Ballina line.  When the money for Luas became available because the project was not ready, this was the only line which did not qualify.</P>
    <P>It is now in a sorry state.  There are 86 miles of old, jointed track, some of it dating back to the 19th century.  The sleepers are made of timber, some of which are acknowledged by CIE to be 70 years old.  There is a spate of speed restrictions varying from 25 to 70 miles per hour.  At times the trains slow to a speed scarcely faster than that of a tractor.  Such a situation is a potential hazard or death trap.  If the condition of the lines are such as acknowledged by CIE, Iarnród Éireann and the two reports &mdash; tracks almost 100 years old and sleepers 70 years old resulting in speed restrictions of 25 miles an hour &mdash; that is a recipe for disaster.</P>
    <P>The £23 million being made available by the Minister is inadequate to provide the necessary upgrading on this line alone.  Massive investment is urgently needed.  I took comfort from a letter received from the chief executive of Iarnród Éireann, Mr. Maher, in which he stated in the clearest possible terms that we cannot afford to wait until the next round of EU funding to begin substantial investment on the Westport line.  He said consultants recently engaged to review the safety of the railway infrastructure stated clearly that investment was urgently required to upgrade the infrastructure on the line.  He also said they recently submitted a comprehensive and essential safety investment programme to the Minister for Public Enterprise seeking Exchequer support for railway investment.</P>
    <P>I believe in investment in the railway structure. I wish the Minister well because she will have a tough battle at Cabinet.  From the point of view of the environment, an efficient transport service and disentangling the gridlock, investment in the structure makes absolute sense.  There is huge commuter support for the rail service.  It could be viable but will not be so until such time as certain minimum guarantees are set down, so that trains <Col N="1533" /> will leave and arrive on time and people will be assured of a seat and of arriving safely.  Unfortunately, these standards do not apply, not only on the line of which I speak but on most others.  I hope as a result of the Minister's efforts at Cabinet, she will ensure the finance, which is imperative for upgrading the transport service as we approach the next century and millennium, will be made available as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the important subject of the review of rail safety.

The commissioning of the independent study was supported by the Opposition and welcomed in the Dáil last December.  I thank the Minister for sending copies of the consultants' report to Members of this House and of Seanad Éireann following its publication.  I also welcome the fact that she will send copies of the report to every worker in Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>The report is very detailed.  The consultants in their conclusions state: &ldquo;It is important to acknowledge that Iarnród Éireann's safety performance over the years compares well with other national railway systems&rdquo;.  The good safety record of our railways is due in large measure to the skill and experience of railway staff over the years. This has also been acknowledged by the consultants. However, they point out that there is a need for significant improvement in the safety of railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last major railway accident in Ireland was in 1983 at Cherryville when seven people died. However, since this, a number of near misses with derailments have occurred.  We must now take every precaution to avoid accidents.  I will highlight the situation on the Tralee to Mallow line, especially the line from Tralee to Killarney.  I was a passenger on the 7.30 a.m. train from Tralee on Tuesday, 18 November 1997.  A major accident was avoided due to the efficiency and expertise of the driver, Billy Irwin, in the way he brought the engine to a halt in a matter of seconds following a landslide.  I have already thanked him and the other staff on the train.  I also thanked the workers of Iarnród Éireann for their expertise in piping a drain at the side of the train and erecting a road across it to enable passengers, many of whom were very frightened, to disembark.  I have spoken with the Minister on the condition of the line, and she has also received a deputation from Tralee Urban District Council highlighting the situation.  While funding has been provided for the Killarney to Mallow line, no funding has yet been provided for the Tralee to Killarney line. Even at this late stage, I appeal to the Minister to make the necessary funding available which I <Col N="1534" /> understand is in the region of £10 million.  I also understand that the Tralee to Mallow line is one of the profitable lines for Iarnród Éireann.  As Kerry is a major tourism county, it is fundamental to the future development of tourism and industrial development within Kerry that the Tralee to Mallow line is upgraded sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Thirty five people died in rail accidents between 1955 and 1983, and it is because of a series of incidents and near misses in recent years that the current report was commissioned.  Given recent derailments, serious concerns have been expressed.  The report pinpoints the outdated nature of the signalling system on our rundown rail network as the most likely cause of an accident. The review states that, while our railways have been historically safe, a shortfall in recent years has not impacted on safety.  The reliance, skill and expertise of individual staff members was being undermined as many of the older generation left the service through retirement.</P>
    <P>The independent consultants' report has highlighted the massive underfunding of the rail network resulting in major safety implications for the travelling public.  The report contains a number of alarming findings.  These include serious faults in the signalling system and some tracks in very poor condition.  That certainly applies to the Tralee to Killarney line.  The consultants acknowledge that the condition of much of the track and structures is poor, while the condition of rolling stock is on the whole satisfactory.  The most serious shortcoming was the lack of a systematic approach to identifying safety hazards, deciding on priority and implementing remedial action.  While an encouraging start has been made at senior management level on introducing a systematic approach to addressing safety on the railway, the consultants emphasised the importance of instilling a safety culture throughout the organisation.</P>
    <P>The consultants recommended that £590 million should be spent over the next 15 years, and that £230 million of this sum should be spent on tackling safety deficiencies.  It is estimated that if this sum is spent on safety measures, risk levels to the travelling public could be reduced by 50 per cent over a 30 year period.  Approximately £60 million is required to improve safety manage-ment systems and £20 million per year over 15 years for ongoing renewal of the permanent way.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise responded quickly to the report.  She announced that, following her meeting with the CIE board &mdash; directly following the publication of the consultants' report &mdash; she gave them permission to borrow £23 million towards the cost of tackling safety issues.</P>
    <P>As recommended in the report, a high level task force comprising officials of the Departments of Public Enterprise and Finance and CIE is being established.  The task force will report to the Government by the end of January with priority recommendations to address the issues identified in the consultancy review.  Pending consideration of the task force report by the Government, <Col N="1535" /> CIE has to be authorised to undertake borrowings to finance the putting in train of safety measures.</P>
    <P>The recruitment process for two additional railway inspecting officers in the Department of Public Enterprise will begin immediately.  I was alarmed to discover there was only one inspector responsible for rail safety throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report stressed the need to create a safety culture that pervades Iarnród Éireann.  They have made it abundantly clear that safety related investment in the railway infrastructure, while essential, will not be enough.  The public wants them to tackle the management aspects of safety also.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that it is her intention to participate in a number of regional workshops at which the findings of the review will be presented to Iarnród Éireann staff at all levels. The staff, who give a tremendous service, are concerned also and these workshops will give them an opportunity to put forward their views on all aspects of rail safety.</P>
    <P>The issue of rail safety should not be made a political football by parties who were in Government in recent years but who achieved nothing on this issue.  It is ironic that Deputy Yates is now stressing the importance of investment in rail. Frustrated rail commuters should not forget that Fine Gael in Government was responsible for inflicting a major blow on the rail system from which we are now only beginning to recover.  That was done under the 1984 Government plan, Building on Reality.  In that plan Fine Gael stated that a package of retrenchment measures would be implemented on the passenger rail side which meant there would not be any new substantial investment in railways.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has little credibility on this issue.  All the improvements in the rail system, and in particular all the decisions on new investment with European aid, have taken place under Fianna Fáil Governments since 1987.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the future of our railway system.  This debate is long overdue and is one I have called for frequently, but to no avail.  I also welcome the report commissioned by Minister O'Rourke but there is little new information contained therein.</P>
      <P>More reports have been commissioned on Irish Rail than on any other body.  The Minister's office could be papered ten times over with the various reports produced on Irish Rail.  We had two McKinsey reports; in 1992 we had a report from the Departments of Finance and Transport, Energy and Communications and earlier this year a report was commissioned by Irish Rail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Options were put forward in the 1992 report regarding a total closure of the rail network, having a spinal network or retaining the full network. The final recommendation, supported by a thorough cost benefit analysis, was that the mainline <Col N="1536" /> network should be retained and developed not only with EU grant assistance but also with Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>What does the latest report tell us that we did not already know?  The average age of the locomotive fleet is 23 years &mdash; 54 per cent of locomotives are between 33 and 37 years old.  The existing carriage fleet has an average age of 16 years and 30 per cent of carriages have an average age of 39 years.  Apart from the Dublin to Belfast, Cork, Limerick and Galway routes, the rest of the track consists of old jointed track and timber sleepers.  In some cases, these are over 70 years old.  A telling factor is that there are nearly 260 miles of inter-city network with this permanent way structure.</P>
    <P>In a recent report to the Select Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport, Mr. Michael McDonnell, chief executive of CIE, confirmed that the Rosslare and Westport lines and all the branch lines throughout the country operate by means of mechanical signalling systems.  In regard to level crossings, the company outlined that a major upgrading programme is required to improve safety levels at the 2,200 level crossings throughout the country.  All this information is well known and has been furnished to the Department by Irish Rail, yet fundamental decisions have not been taken.  That scandal has been allowed to develop.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the report media headlines predicted fatal rail accidents.  I want to put those headlines into perspective.  In terms of travel related accidents and excluding cyclists, pedestrians and motor cyclists, travelling by train is more than ten times safer than travelling by car.  It is important to state that.</P>
    <P>Given the inadequacies of the infrastructure of our rail network over the years, full recognition must be given to the staff and management of Irish Rail for their trojan efforts.  The safety record of Irish Rail is more than comparable to any other rail service in Europe.  We must all hope that this level of achievement can continue to be maintained, particularly until the pro-gramme of infrastructure upgrading is carried out.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the Minister's commitment but I wonder if the Government is committed to the rail network.  Is it prepared to finance a quality service to towns like Sligo, Westport, Ballina, Kilkenny and Waterford?  If so, the Government must be prepared to make significant investment in the railways.  A policy of non-investment almost brought the railways to a close in the early 1990s.  This was due to a lack of Exchequer investment and of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds particularly in the period 1989-93.  It has been the policy of consecutive Governments to respond to the traffic crisis by pumping money into the roads system rather than public transport and the rail network.  It was due to the submissions made for the 1994-9 round of EU funding &mdash; in which the Labour Party had a significant input &mdash; that a <Col N="1537" /> major investment package was secured which has helped save the railways.</P>
    <P>For many years in this House I raised the need for investment in the rail network.  On many occasions I received a hostile reception from Members who repeatedly referred to the £90 million annual subvention to CIE.  It was obvious that these Deputies were unaware of the real facts.  Is it known that out of that £90 million, Irish Rail must carry approximately £50 million per annum for infrastructural costs?  Compare this to the road infrastructure, which is funded completely by the Exchequer.  I ask the Minister of State to bring to the Minister's attention my recommendation that the operational costs and infrastructural costs of the CIE group of companies be separated.</P>
    <P>For motorists in the greater Dublin area the gridlock situation has become part of the daily routine and will become even worse because of the record number of new cars purchased this year.  The alternative must be a reliable, high quality public transport service.  The inadequate number of trains serving the towns of Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Donabate, Malahide and Portmarnock in my own constituency is a matter of grave concern to me and an issue which causes great anger among my constituents.  Additional carriages are necessary and are economically justified on the outer suburban corridor in Dublin. Action is required now.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to this report is totally inadequate.  The £23 million committed for next year is merely an undertaking to guarantee borrowing by the company itself.  The Government's proposal to phase the investment over a 15-year period is totally unjustified, particularly in light of the safety factors highlighted in this and other reports.  For example, level crossings are being used in a very unsafe manner.  I wish the Minister well in her efforts to secure the necessary funding to ensure rail safety.  She has the opportunity to put her mark on public transport by providing the finance for an adequate infrastructure.  On economic and environmental grounds, I hope this opportunity is taken and the right thing is done.  I look forward to debating this question again when the Minister's so called inner cabinet discusses this report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this full review of safety in the rail network.  Her prompt action has brought about this report which, I hope, will bring great improvements in rail safety.  The Government is fully committed to rail safety and Deputy Ryan can be assured that he will see changes within the next few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this year's Estimates, £56 million has been allocated for investment in public transport.  For the first time the Exchequer has provided direct capital funding for public transport. <Col N="1538" /> Between now and the end of the year 2000, a total of £115 million of public funds will be spent on public transport and the railways.  CIE will also spend considerably from the company's own resources.  This money will be spent on carriages, rail cars and on improvements to railway stations and rail tracks.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Government has provided funding for the upgrading of the Mullingar to Carrick-on-Shannon line.  This line will be provided with continuous welded track which will vastly improve the level of safety and efficiency.  Heretofore, the Dublin to Sligo line had the worst rolling stock and track and the least efficient service of any line in the country.  Thankfully, this is now changing and I can mention one significant improvement.  A return ticket from Sligo to Dublin cost more 17 years ago than it does today and this price reduction has led to an increase in passenger numbers on the line.  The proposed investment will allow an improvement in rolling stock and the provision of automatic signalling on the line and we can look forward to a much better service to and from the north west.  The line serves the midlands as well as the north west.  In the Minister's own constituency, a train leaves Mullingar every morning and reaches Dublin in one hour.  It brings students to Maynooth and workers to many towns along the line.  It is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Many years ago, a decision was taken to close railway lines and tracks were taken up.  There is now no railway line whatever in County Donegal. This is a great pity.  Many of these lines would be attractive to tourists.  The narrow gauge line would have been a wonderful tourist attraction in lovely Leitrim.  While on holidays in north Wales some years ago, I saw the benefit of the narrow gauge line which attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors to Snowdonia every year.  We once had a lovely railway station in Tubbercurry on the Claremorris to Collooney line.  I am glad the Minister has deferred the decision to take up this line because too many rushed decisions were made in the past.  The first train I ever travelled on ran on this line and I hope that it and other small lines will be allowed to remain.  Perhaps in years to come a use will be found for them.</P>
      <P>I sometimes wonder whether people living in County Dublin appreciate the level of service and comfort provided by the DART in comparison to the London underground, the Paris metro or the New York subway.  Anyone living within one mile of the DART should not bring a car into Dublin as cars are choking the city.  The DART provides a great service.  Trains now run from Maynooth and Drogheda to Dublin.  Dublin would not be choked by traffic if there were more trains and a better service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have travelled on trains throughout the world and the standards in Ireland, particularly on the Dublin-Cork line, compare favourably to those in any part of the world.  This is not necessarily the Minister's responsibility, but CIE must provide a better service from rural areas to Dublin.  Except <Col N="1539" /> on Mondays, the earliest service from Sligo to Dublin leaves at 7.45 a.m. and arrives at 11.00 a.m. However, this arrival time is too late for anyone attending hospitals or meetings.  It also means that one cannot be in the airport in time to get a flight to the US.  The train should arrive in Dublin no later than 10.00 a.m. This is not the Minister's responsibility but the matter should be raised with CIE.</P>
    <P>I am happy with this report and it will be very beneficial if implemented.  I congratulate the Minister.  She will be remembered as one of the best Ministers.  When this report is implemented and the funds are available we will have a better and safer rail service.  Public transport, particularly trains, are the safest way to travel.  I often use trains, particularly if travelling to Dublin for a football match.  People should come by train as they will get home in good time.  This is not the case if one travels by car.  I wish the Minister well in implementing this report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this report but I hope it is the last report we see concerning the rail service. We now want action.  We are fed up with reports, task forces and consultants making money out of Iarnród Éireann while services get worse.  The Minister will have my support provided she can deliver funding for the rail service.</P>
      <P>My family has long associations with the rail service.  My uncle worked for CIE for 43 years. He owns the Railway Tavern in Westport but CIE was not very loyal to him when it was selling land.  It was a tradition for CIE to sell land to its friends.  However, on this occasion the sale was not advertised.  The land was bought but not paid for and the deal was not completed.  We were assured the land would be put up for public tender but this has not happened.  I am asking the Minister to investigate this matter again.  I have written to the Department and the Minister about this in the past.  The chairman, Mr. McDonnell, told me he would deal with this problem.  I will raise the matter on the Adjournment if I do not get satisfactory answers.  How can people be sold land by a semi-State company without it being advertised or without paying money?  Perhaps this explains why CIE and Iarnród Éireann have no money and cannot run services.</P>
      <P>As regards the Westport line, the people of the west are fed up with the secondhand service, secondhand line and secondhand carriages.  Previous Governments failed to allocate the necessary funding to improve this line.  When the national plan was drawn up in 1993, the Rosslare and the Westport-Ballina-Dublin lines were the only two lines not included in the review or for EU funding.  In 1996, Goodbodys was well paid by Iarnród Éireann to assess the state of the lines, but were told not to investigate the Westport line.  This indicates the attitude of Governments to this line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a recent accident and Iarnród Éireann got away with a warning.  Luckily there <Col N="1540" /> was no loss of life although there was some injuries. It was a needed warning.  The Government has this report.  I compliment the Minister on publishing it and prioritising the securing of funds.  However, we will judge that commitment by the amount of funding made available for the Westport-Dublin line in the budget.  If that funding is put in place I will be the first to congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <P>A constituent of mine used the Westport-Dublin line yesterday and was 20 minutes late arriving. My daughter used the line this morning but she had still not arrived when I came into the House.  The train should have arrived at 11.15 a.m. but I suppose there will be another 20 minute delay.  This is not good enough.  People paying for a service are entitled to travel safely, in comfort and be guaranteed that the service will arrive on time.  The delays are not for five or six minutes, they can be up to one hour.  On occasions people in the west do not know whether they will be brought from Athlone to Westport by bus.  Once one passes Athlone one does not know where the breakdown or the hold up will occur.  This is not acceptable in 1998.</P>
    <P>The number of cars on our roads has reached crisis point.  It is time Governments made decisions about transport, particularly with regard to freight.  There would not be as many trucks on the roads if Iarnród Éireann operated its business properly and provided a good service. Many business people transporting goods to and from Dublin would use the freight service.  They cannot do so at present as delivery times cannot be guaranteed.  CIE was once heavily involved in freight transport but it has lost that business.  It has lost many major clients because it has not delivered the goods.</P>
    <P>It is time to put funding in place and introduce legislation on the rail network.  EU regulations make it difficult to compel people to use the freight service.  However, the freight service could transport many of the goods coming into and leaving Dublin.  No matter what time one travels to Dublin, one will see many trucks travelling to and from the city.  It is time to examine this issue and to take some pressure off the roads.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the DART.  Dubliners have that luxury but the people in my constituency are simply seeking a reasonable mainline service on which they can depend.  According to the report, 411,000 people use the Westport to Ballina to Dublin line.  That huge number indicates a higher level of rail usage on that line than on lines in other parts of the country.  One cannot make the excuse, therefore, that the service is not being used.  It would be used to a far greater extent if it was improved.  Even I would use it again.  I stopped using the train because I could not be sure of being in Dublin at 11 a.m. if I had to attend a meeting.  One cannot even be sure of being in Dublin in time for lunch.  That is crazy. Many other people have stopped taking the train <Col N="1541" /> for the same reason, but they would use it again if there was a proper service.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to invest the necessary resources in that line.  Deputy Brennan also referred to lines that were removed in the past. That brings to mind the Westport to Achill line. If that line still existed, it would be a major tourist attraction.  Many other rail lines throughout the State were removed, particularly in Dublin city, and it will cost millions of pounds to replace them.</P>
    <P>There are enough reports and task forces.  We are aware of the problems and we now know how to solve them, something we often did not know in the past.  In the case of the rail system, the major problem is money.  I hope the forthcoming budget will show the Government's commitment to providing the necessary funding for the Westport to Dublin line.  People in the west should not have a second class service with second class trains and lines.  They are entitled to a first class service and the money should be allocated to provide it.  If that happens, I will be the first to congratulate the Minister.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on being the most proactive in a long line of Ministers with responsibility for the Irish railway system in particular and the transport system in general. A comprehensive review of the rail system was long overdue and, now that the initial report is available, it confirms what many people suspected for a long time.  Our railways need urgent and radical attention.</P>
      <P>The Minister will ensure the necessary urgent and remedial action will be taken.  It is a novel and welcome approach that a copy of the report will be sent to every member of staff of Iarnród Éireann.  The Minister will also meet the staff to explain the position, outline her strategy and seek their assistance in the implementation of her improvement plan.  She is aware that to succeed in her mission she will need to bring many people with her.  In this respect, the people who will have to implement the plan are among the most important.</P>
      <P>The Minister is in the unenviable position of having inherited a transport system which has been neglected for many years.  The permanent ways show this, as do the rail stock and investment figures.  The passenger figures are the most damning indicator.  There should be a good, efficient, comfortable and safe rail system or none at all.  Optimum use of the rail network would remove the pressure on roads and alleviate the suffering of those who must use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was first elected to the House, I was obliged to seek accommodation in Dublin.  I chose to live close to the House and intended to <Col N="1542" /> use the train to commute to Waterford.  However, I was soon disabused of that notion when I discovered it was impractical due to the inordinately long journey between Dublin and Waterford.  I would have preferred to use the train as it provides greater comfort and allows one to work and have something to eat in the course of one's journey. However, it did not fulfil my time requirements. Even though the Dublin to Cork route is 60 miles longer than the Dublin to Waterford route, the journey time is not much greater.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic.  In this day and age people can sit in their cars and drive to the capital with little delay while retaining the convenience of having their car in the city.  An extremely good alternative is necessary to lure them onto the train.  Dublin Bus found that out some time ago but has yet to come to terms with it.  That is one of the reasons for traffic gridlock in the city.</P>
    <P>The Minister's function is to ensure travel on public transport, particularly on the railways, is at least as attractive, comfortable, safe and even inexpensive as the family car.  I do not envy her the job of bringing about the changes that are necessary.</P>
    <P>Having read the report, I am particularly concerned about the rail service in my constituency and in the south east.  It appears to be one of the worst parts of an already decrepit system.  Waterford is in the unenviable position of having two of the five worst sections and three of the nine worst sections of rail.  The railway in most need of attention is the Waterford to Rosslare europort line, a facility which is used by a huge number of people annually.</P>
    <P>The fifth worst section is that from Cherryville to Kilkenny, part of the Waterford to Dublin line. Even the mention of Cherryville junction gives rise to unpleasant memories for people who are familiar with the route.  It was there, in August 1983, that seven passengers were killed in a rear end collision.  The Limerick to Waterford line has changed little since my youth &mdash; not too long ago &mdash; when I used it to travel to Munster finals in Limerick and Thurles.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough that accidents can happen but if one were to happen because of neglect, everybody should feel accountable.  I do not need to urge the Minister to proceed with all speed to bring the deficient lines up to normal standards while they have not yet become dangerous.</P>
    <P>We must do everything possible to instill confidence in the public about all aspects of our transport system.  People must be reassured that the tracks on which they travel and the signals that were used when the Prince of Wales travelled around the country at the turn of the century have been updated.  Nobody would consider them still adequate for the job.</P>
    <P>The Minister inherited a run down rail network. Thankfully, however, the incidence of accidents is no worse than in the rest of Europe.  This is not a cause for complacency or self congratulation. If that record is to be maintained, if not <Col N="1543" /> improved, there must be a huge programme of investment.</P>
    <P>The years of neglect have taken their toll and we are now on notice that we must act quickly. The Minister, to her great credit, has faced up to her responsibilities.  Given the necessary resources, she will put people back on the trains to travel in safety, acceptable comfort and with worthwhile savings of time.  The roads in our cities have reached saturation point with motorised vehicles.  Even modest provincial towns experience traffic jams and delays.  For that reason alone, not to mention the transport of freight, quick and positive action is required for the travelling public.</P>
    <P>We can be guided by previous experience.  The success of the DART demonstrates that if a proper service is provided it will be used.  The Minister recognises the value of further modernisation of Dublin Bus not only through the provision of vehicles and infrastructure but also through modernising attitudes.  In the past, the number of passengers on provincial buses had declined to the point where some buses carried only three or four people on journeys of 50 to 100 miles.  Those buses are now full with passengers who are getting a service that is quick, efficient, cheap and comfortable.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not have an easy task, but I acknowledge her wisdom in deciding to meet and convince the workers at the coalface who will be crucial in delivering a new and modernised service. She must fight to get the necessary finance to implement her programme.  If this involves an element of privatisation or the acquisition of a strategic partner, so be it.</P>
    <P>The railway system, despite neglect for over half a century, has still much to offer.  It will have a great deal to offer in the future as the movement of people increases.  The Irish proverb, &ldquo;Is tosach maith leath na hoibre&rdquo;, is eminently applicable.  Having started well, I urge the Minister not to be deflected in her resolve to provide better and safer trains.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for sharing his time.  I also take this opportunity to compliment the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, on employing consultants to produce this report on rail safety following the serious train derailment at Knockcroghery, County Roscommon, in November 1997.  I also compliment her on the brief given to the consultants to consider the adequacy of Iarnród Éireann's existing safety systems, rules and procedures and the adequacy of the company's arrangements for implementing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted the consultants managed to inspect 60 per cent of the rail network and that consultations took place with the staff of Iarnród Éireann.  That was most important.  It is particularly important because, given the number of derailments which have taken place, Iarnród Éireann has assured people using the service that safety is its No. 1 priority.  This is of particular <Col N="1544" /> relevance to me in relation to the train service to the west, where there has been considerable concern among train users over the years as to whether the service is safe.  It is important that we do not generate undue alarm among the public since Iarnród Éireann has assured us that the train service is safe.  Not everybody has the use of a car and public transport is essential for some people, particularly patients who must travel from the west to Dublin for essential medical treatment and many students and young children who need essential services which are only available in Dublin.  I do not want to discourage those people from using the rail service.  However, despite the fact that we have been given the assurance that the rail service is safe, it is only safe in my part of the world at low train speeds. In 1998 that is not acceptable.  It results in people arriving in the city long after the stated timetable times.  Unfortunately nobody who wants to carry out serious business in Dublin can use the train service from the west.  It is not possible for me, a Deputy from the west, to use the rail service to come to and from the Dáil to carry out my business. Undoubtedly if I did so, some votes would be lost in the Dáil.  I am sure that would certainly attract major attention to the situation in the west.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report's findings, some of which are quite alarming.  Serious faults have been highlighted in the signalling system and some of the tracks are in an unacceptable condition.  The consultants acknowledge that the condition of much of the track, signalling and structures is poor, while the condition of the rolling stock is on the whole satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to get the opportunity to participate in this debate on rail safety.  I compliment the Minister on her courage in commissioning this report.  It was the right way to go.</P>
      <P>With traffic chaos clogging up all of the cities and provincial towns, it is important to try to organise the public transport system in a proper way.  In my view the rail network is the most obvious section of public transportation infrastructure to which one should give priority.  The review undertaken gives us damning evidence regarding the deterioration of the rail network. The report should be the catalyst for the beginning of the redevelopment of the rail system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report shows that the system is inadequate. If we wish to provide a proper and safe rail service, the amount of finance needed is huge. Rather than adopting a piecemeal approach and trying to put in place proper road networks and bus and rail transport facilities, it is appropriate that the Minister should give priority to the rail network.  My only complaint would be that the <Col N="1545" /> Minister feels that the implementation of the report should be over a 14 year period.  That is too long.  I appreciate that the amount of money which must be provided is large but if we provide a proper rail service in all areas, it will go a long way towards stopping road traffic chaos.  Rail services are a safe and environmentally friendly way to travel.  Therefore, priority in the development of the public transport network should be given to the rail service.  I ask the Minister to revisit the financial aspect of the matter and try to implement the recommendations of the report over an eight-year period rather than a 15 year period.</P>
    <P>We all have our own experiences of the rail service to the areas from which we come.  The Dublin-Sligo line has been a major concern of mine for many years, especially since I became a Member of this House, and many of my colleagues have raised the issue.  I remember that in 1987 my colleague, Ted Nealon, made the point that the first rail service from Dublin to Sligo in the early 1900s was faster than the current service. Rather than making progress, we have gone backwards.</P>
    <P>What concerns me greatly in the report is that safety is now a major concern for the public when they take a train to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Dublin-Sligo line has deteriorated over the years and people using the service are concerned that it is not safe.  It is important that Iarnród Éireann state that the line is safe.</P>
    <P>If one leaves Sligo and is supposed to be in Dublin at 11 a.m., more than likely one will arrive at 12 noon.  Many times people who have taken the train have been left in the middle of the track between Edgeworthstown and Dromod.  Nobody tells them what is the problem and they are held up for two or three hours.  If that continues, people will not use the rail service.</P>
    <P>When this report is being implemented the Minister should give serious consideration to the provision of a rail service from Sligo to Donegal. County Donegal is the only county which does not have a rail service.  It should not be so isolated. Over a period of time it is imperative that a proper rail link be put in place from Sligo to Donegal.  I hope that Minister will agree to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for sharing his time.  I welcome the opportunity to speak about this important issue.  The results of the report show that there was a need for it to find out the exact position of the rail stock, track, safety provisions and other aspects of the overall infrastructure.  It is obvious that a huge amount of money is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from a county close to Dublin which is supposed to have all the benefits of the Celtic tiger and all that goes with it, my constituents are in a position where there are two rail stations, one at Enfield and the other at Gormanstown. These do not do much for the thousands of people who must move out of the city to buy <Col N="1546" /> houses at a cheaper rate and travel 30 or 40 miles &mdash; it is 25 miles from Navan &mdash; every day to work.</P>
    <P>The Minister's overall proposal is to implement this report are over a 14 year period, which is an enormous length of time.  There will be unbelievable changes in that period.  There are 500,000 houses required between now and the year 2010 for the growth in population.  I want a commitment from the Minister in her reply to this debate that, following the research which has been done, the rail track from Clonsilla to Navan will be relaid and opened for commuters.  There is a track from Navan to Drogheda for freight which is used by Gypsum Industries and Tara Mines.  That is the only track in County Meath.  From my perspective, if we do nothing else except provide a station and relay a 20 mile track to Navan, that would be extremely beneficial for Cavan, north-Meath and Navan, the population of which is expected to increase to 40,000 in the next few years.</P>
    <P>There are many worthwhile recommendations in this report.  Given that we will not have Objective One status and that the money for develop-ment in this area will have to come from the Exchequer, the Government has to decide on its priorities.  Decisions have to be taken by the politicians who sit around the Cabinet table, including those from the county to which I have referred and neighbouring counties who can say they want to take people who use cars to commute long distances to their workplaces, due to house prices, off the roads.  This is an interesting scenario.  A gentleman on the outskirts of the city bought a house recently 37 miles from here.  He said he is saving £1,000 per mile and is prepared to sit in his car for two hours per day to travel to and from work.  That is what is happening and it appears it will continue.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ensure the provision of the passenger rail line to Navan?  Not alone would there be support for this line but there is a need for it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I congratulate the Minister on commissioning the report and on her welcome announcement that £56 million Exchequer investment will be put into public transport.  In recent days she said 150 extra buses will be provided in Dublin and that there will be improvements to the main rail line system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the Galway-Dublin railway line has been improved in the past few years.  I understand that by April 1999, the Portarlington-Galway section of that line will be completed.  Will the Minister ensure this work is not done in a piecemeal fashion?  We are concerned that railways need repair.  If Iarnród Éireann is to work on this line I would prefer if it closed the section of line between two towns and used a bus link to carry passengers between those towns.  In the event of a rail breakdown passengers get off the train and board a bus for the next station.  While we have a good safety record on the railways, we cannot <Col N="1547" /> afford to carry out this work in a piecemeal way. I suggest a major overhaul of the railway system.</P>
    <P>We need to use all our railway lines.  I put this case to Iarnród Éireann in the past because I witnessed sections of a railway line north of Tuam, used mainly for the carriage of freight, being taken up.  Following a strong protest Iarnród Éireann agreed to relay the railway line.  That line, the Sligo-Limerick line, is the only north-south line in the country.  It is important that we maintain those lines.  I make a strong case for using some of those rail lines for carrying freight. It may not be possible to carry passengers on all the rail lines.</P>
    <P>More timber is being produced in the western region.  Generous grants are available in the State and private sectors for tree planting.  It is obvious, given Coillte's planting targets, that more timber will be available.  It is encouraging to hear those in the timber industry say they would put timber on the railways if they had the proper facilities. This would mean less heavy goods, such as timber, being transported by road.  In the past on the Sligo-Limerick line, heavy goods such as coal and cement were always carried by rail.  In the western region we now have the Masonite plant in Leitrim and a timber plant in Clonmel and Louisiana Pacific in Waterford.  I am pleased the railway line is in place and I hope it can be retained.</P>
    <P>Community employment or FÁS schemes could be used to maintain those lines.  I am disappointed CIE is neglecting some of these lines.  It is not spending money on them, but I am pleased the lines are not being taken up.  This is one of the reasons many people in the west have campaigned for a strategic Euro route from Sligo to Limerick to Waterford which would be involved in the timber processing industry.  It could also be looked at in terms of tourism projects further down the road.</P>
    <P>Visitors from the Continent who come in through Rosslare find it difficult to get to the west.  They have to travel to Dublin to make a railway connection.  All railway lines radiate from Dublin.  The only north-south line is the Sligo-Limerick line.  Those in the west who wish to go to the southern region usually have to travel to Portarlington to get a railway connection to the south.</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints about overcrowding on the trains.  This is a serious matter for Iarnród Éireann, particularly on Friday evenings when many people leave Dublin to return to their homes.  The facility, introduced during the summer months, whereby it was possible to pre-book seats on trains, is a good one. Sports fans in Galway who travelled to Dublin in August and September for the all-Ireland football finals pre-booked their train seats.  This meant there was no overcrowding.  This is a worthwhile development which Iarnród Éireann might extend to Friday evenings.  People complain about having no seats on trains, that they are overcrowded and dangerous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> I am pleased that three trains depart Dublin each afternoon for Galway.  In the past there were only two trains, one at 2 p.m. and another at 7 p.m. The extra train leaves at 5 p.m. However, I am not 100 per cent happy about some small but significant changes introduced by Iarnród Éireann.  I fail to understand why it cannot provide full dining facilities on all three trains.  The 5 p.m. train has full dining facilities but the 7 p.m. train does not, which leads people to take the earlier train and to overcrowding.  That is why pre-booking for weekend travel will have to be introduced.</P>
    <P>I welcome Iarnród Éireann's investment in extra rolling stock because we need new carriages and ongoing investment.  I look forward to major improvements in the Dublin-Galway line and continuous welded rail is most important.  I pay tribute to Father Mícheál Mac Gréil, who is passionate about the railways.  He recently pointed out that the most disadvantaged part of the Tuam diocese was the area about ten miles either side of the Galway to Tuam section of the Sligo to Limerick railway.  The late Monsignor Horan used to speak of the &ldquo;black triangle&rdquo; in Mayo; Father Mac Gréil speaks of the &ldquo;black rectangle&rdquo;, which is a bigger area.  A good railway line leads to a good economy because the people in the area do well.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the railway link to Galway city because there is congestion in the city, although not as bad as in Dublin.  The railway could be used to allow access from south Galway to the city.  It is fortunate that the terminus is in Eyre Square, in the heart of the city.</P>
    <P>I compliment Iarnród Éireann on its good safety record.  The last major railway accident was in 1983, in which seven people died.  The experience and skill of the staff has contributed to this record.  I welcome the Minister's decision to participate in a number of regional workshops in the next few weeks.  The views of staff members are important because it is they who receive criticism for difficulties such as trains arriving late, no seating or no tea facilities.  I welcome the consultation process for implementing the consultants' recommendations.</P>
    <P>While I praise the number of train services in afternoons and evenings, many trains arrive late and people travelling from the west to Dublin for business or hospital appointments do not arrive on time.  When I travelled on the Galway to Dublin train some months ago, passengers were given a questionnaire which asked them to indicate at what time they would like to arrive in Dublin. Everyone in my company said their preference was 10 a.m. but that is not possible under the current timetable.  In her discussions with Iarnród Éireann I urge the Minister to request that the morning train service would allow people to arrive earlier in the capital.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic because for some years I have been a rail commuter on the east coast, from Dundalk to Dublin.  I had no gripe with CIE over the years and we have come a long way from the days of &ldquo;Are You Right There, Michael?&rdquo; However, I am cynical about the plethora of reports and commissions which we are obliged to have on virtually everything.  I cannot understand why the Department did not have specialists monitoring the railways or why we have to ask for the deliberations of an outside firm of consultants at huge cost.  I am cynical about so-called &ldquo;experts&rdquo; because the two biggest mistakes in Ireland in my lifetime were perpetrated by these people &mdash; one was the lifting of thousands of miles of railway track, the other was decimalisation, which opened the economic floodgates and made us one of the dearest countries in Europe. Nevertheless, I welcome the attention belatedly being given to the railways as a result of the tremendous amount of money we received from the EU in recent times, which has been put to good use.</P>
      <P>The gridlock affecting Dublin makes it a penance to live or even stay three days a week in the city, and the same will happen to every town in the country because of affluence derived from the Celtic tiger.  No matter what the cost, the future must be in railways.  Everything is relative, including cost &mdash; in 20 years' time people may ask why we did not tackle the problem in 1998.  A major part of the answer to gridlock is reinvestment in railways, which means laying down rail track across the country.  County Donegal was the biggest loser &mdash; when the Irish northern railway line closed in 1958 that beautiful and vast county, one hundred miles long, was detached from the rest of Ireland, with terrible damage to its tourism potential.  Safety on the roads concerns us all, because more people die on roads in Ireland, per head of population, than in any country in Europe.  If more freight was transported by railway there would be fewer lorries and probably fewer deaths.</P>
      <P>The DART has been a tremendous success and as someone who travels from Blackrock I appreciate it, but I do not appreciate the numbers crowding on to it.  Some years ago I spoke to CIE officials about my safety fears.  They were coming from a hostelry in a mood of revelry and dismissed my concerns.  However, anyone who sees people packing on to those trains must be concerned because if a tragedy occurred there would be considerable fatalities.  It would not necessarily be a case of two trains crashing &mdash; if a train's brakes failed and it ran into a buffer there would be severe casualties.  Unfortunately, in this country we do nothing until tragedies occur and the DART has exceeded its safety provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the re-awakening of interest in the <Col N="1550" /> railways and hope meaningful action will be taken as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The key towns of Mullingar, Longford, Carrick-on-Shannon, Boyle, Ballymote, Collooney and Sligo, and counties Leitrim, Sligo, Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath, west Cavan, south Donegal and south-west Fermanagh are served by the Dublin-Sligo rail link.  This line is not just an infrastructural issue, it affects and is affected by many other issues such as low population, dependency of vulnerable groups, access to employment and education, etc.  It serves social as well as economic needs.  The principle of social subsidy for public transport, particularly in relation to infrastructural investment, in areas of deprivation and social exclusion has not been applied to the rail lines in the areas most affected.</P>
      <P>Urban renewal schemes have attracted large investments to towns served by this rail line.  Sligo has proposals for an investment of more than £300 million and this, coupled with the new regionalised IDA Ireland grant regime, has attracted to the region major new industrial initiatives which need to be underpinned by a quality trans-European standard rail link.  These developments have created an expectation of quality rail services and there are positive indicators that industrialists are now more inclined to consider regional urban centres as locations for enterprise and investment.  A modern high speed rail line is an important element of their decision-making and a key selling point for IDA Ireland.</P>
      <P>CIE estimates that 54 miles of jointed track will remain post 1999.  This track is reaching life expiry, with sections up to 65 years old.  Many of the sleepers are up to 35 years old and are life expired.  These old rails and sleepers are a cause of concern for safety reasons.  They lead to serious speed reductions, poor ride quality and breakdowns and delays in the service.</P>
      <P>The engineering division of Iarnród Éireann is seeking a maximum speed over jointed track of 50 miles per hour throughout the system.  The new timetable, which is due to be published shortly, will show three hours and 32 minutes from Sligo to Dublin compared to the current travel time of three hours and ten minutes.  This compares to the operational programme target of two hours and 45 minutes.  The new timetable target time indicates an average speed of 36 miles per hour.  It is the same timetable that was launched in 1863, which speaks volumes.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for allocating £14 million from the Luas fund to Carrick-on-Shannon. A further £8 million is now urgently required for the route from Carrick-on-Shannon to Sligo.  I appeal to the Minister to provide a loop link in Ballymote because a 15 acre theme park is being developed there and there is not a break in service for 28 miles along the Sligo to Boyle line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in recent years 181,000 people left Sligo, 20,000 left Ballymote, 31,000 left Boyle, 25,000 left Carrick-on-Shannon, <Col N="1551" /> 13,000 left Dromod, 48,500 left Longford and 9,000 left Mostrim to go to Dublin.  That is a total of 327,000 people, excluding those who travelled from Mullingar.</P>
    <P>The traffic problems in our cities and towns require an integrated policy on transportation. We have highlighted some of the implications for Dublin traffic which a failure to invest in railways outside Dublin will create.  There is an urgent need for CIE to look at railcars as a serious option for rail services on lines such as that from Sligo to Dublin.  Operating costs are approximately one third of current rolling stock.  There seems to be a failure to convey to the public and the authorities the favourable consequences of adopting this modern railway technology.  This failure has resulted in a general weakening of the case for rail development.  The time has come when we must display conviction and self-confidence and ensure that investment is made in the rail service.</P>
    <P>Trains are a safe mode of transport.  I welcome the allocation of £14 million to Carrick-on-Shannon. I appeal to the Minister to allocate a further £8 for the route from Carrick-on-Shannon to Sligo, which is urgently required.  I appeal to her to provide a loop link in Ballymote because a 15 acre theme park is being developed there.  There is also the potential to generate business along the Dublin to Sligo line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this discussion on the report and I congratulate the Minister for her role in commissioning it.  It is stimulating lively debate in the House.</P>
      <P>Recent economic growth and increased economic activity, car ownership, commercial traffic and freight on our roads and road deaths have focused attention on public transport.  However, it has been found wanting.  Public transport has been in a state of decline for the past 20 years.  It was starved of investment by successive Governments, but I am glad that is about to change.  The Ireland of the Celtic tiger must support public transport.  I welcome the Minister's statement that &ldquo;we are once again entering an era when rail transport will play an increasingly important role in the economic and social life of the country&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As regards DART services, the report states:</P>
      <P>DART electrification equipment &mdash; generally, the system is in good condition, but due to its age major works will be required in the near future to keep the system running effectively. A lack of formal maintenance procedures and electrical competence certification was noted. The continued use of out-dated equipment to enable staff to gain access to overhead power supply lines requires immediate attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That finding will come as a big surprise to many people in this House and elsewhere.  Dubliners who use the DART believe it is a modern and efficient service, albeit a costly one.  That there is a question mark over its future safety is a cause <Col N="1552" /> of concern.  I hope we can address this issue because the DART plays an important role as far as transport and traffic in the city is concerned.</P>
    <P>Quality bus corridors are being built throughout the greater Dublin area with the result that motorists are being forced off the roads and to use public transport.  However, they have found over recent months, particularly in my constituency of Dublin North Central, that an adequate service is not available.  They are forced to leave their cars at home because of gridlock and reductions in road space, yet there is no adequate bus, DART or suburban rail service.  The DART is overcrowded, suburban rail is stretched to capacity and buses are full at peak times.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement on 11 November that there will be new investment in public transport.  I understand that 150 new buses will be provided which will increase rush hour passenger capacity by 20 per cent.  Extra DART and train carriages and extended platforms will be provided to increase capacity on suburban rail and suburban rail lines will be upgraded.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that EU money which was earmarked for Luas but which could not be taken up because of delays in the project will be used for projects in Dublin, although I noted what other speakers said.  We are spending that money efficiently in the areas of greatest need.  I welcome the Minister's role in that.</P>
    <P>On the suggestion that the provision of an additional 150 new buses by Dublin Bus will increase passenger capacity by 20 per cent, I am not sure that such an increase in capacity will be enough.  What will a 20 per cent increase in capacity mean?  How many more passengers will the buses carry?  It will take some time for those new buses to come onstream.  From my experience as a representative of the people of Dublin North Central, I do not believe the provision of those additional buses will adequately address the problem.  The introduction of quality bus corridors have forced cars off the road in a brutal manner and reduced the road space for cars.  If the provision of 150 new buses is not enough, we will have to go back to the drawing board to ensure necessary services are provided to enable people to commute to work in the central city area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general provisions of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, the establishment of the Dublin Transportation Office and the view that public transport needs to be enhanced. Traffic management measures are required, all aspects of parking policy are being reviewed and the provision of cycling facilities is being encouraged. However, I question one element of the initiative, the provision of park and ride facilities. We have moved too slowly in that and we have a gridlock crisis on our hands.  Cars cannot gain access to and from the city, particularly during peak periods, and park and ride facilities do not exist.  The Government has been lethargic in that regard.  Dublin Corporation intends to provide a pilot park and ride facility for the Christmas period <Col N="1553" /> at Whitehall and a longer term park and ride facility at Finglas, but the provision of such a pilot facility will only scratch the surface of this problem. The local authorities in the greater Dublin area will need to give this matter priority.</P>
    <P>I regret that Iarnród Éireann's announcement that it intends to provide a late night DART service for the Christmas period was made before adequate arrangements were put in place to meet the legitimate security concerns of the staff.  I ask the Minister and CIE management to sort out the industrial relations problem with the staff and to get that service up and running for the peak Christmas period.  That service is required.  We have already heard horror stories of people who have been stranded in the city late at night and could not get home.  They could not get a taxi, travel on the DART or catch a nightlink bus.  We must give this matter top priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the recent review of rail safety by the IRMS on behalf of the Minister.  I compliment my constituency colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, on commissioning this review.  It was long overdue and it is important we have a base from which to start to address this problem.  It confirmed what we all knew and the anecdotes we have heard about rail safety.  Now that the problem has been confirmed we can start to address it.</P>
      <P>We are deeply concerned, as is the travelling public, about the safety and comfort aspects of the public transport service.  People who have an interest in the development of an efficient public transport service, including the rail service, will welcome this report, but we cannot feign surprise at its contents.  Coming from Mullingar, I note, with deep concern, the details of the report dealing with the Dublin to Mullingar section of the railway line.  That is something I and my constituency colleague, Deputy McGrath, raised on various occasions in the House.  We have failed in the past 20 years to adhere to the concept of developing a proper public transport service, especially a rail service.  All we did was throw a few bob to address an issue that is fundamental to the safety of passengers and rail staff.  It is vital we provide the necessary investment to develop our railways.  We should all support the Minister in her endeavours in this regard at the Cabinet table and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Stagg suggested, failure to invest in rail transport in the past has been rooted in an ideological opposition to the concept of public transport service provision and the existence of public transport companies.  That view underpinned the Thatcherite view in Britain, that private companies operating solely on a profit motive would be the best way to provide a public transport service.  I am glad we have not gone that route.  The right wing consensus in the early to mid-1980s was that public transport companies should operate on a commercial basis and not be subsidised.  I reject that ideological <Col N="1554" /> destructive thinking which, if followed, would effectively isolate rural communities and abandon the vital social benefits that accrue from the provision of any public service, particularly rail transport.</P>
    <P>We need to invest approximately £600 million to upgrade our railways.  That would be of major significance to the Dublin-Sligo and Dublin-Mullingar lines.  Particular safety concerns are outlined in the report.  There is major overcrowding on 250 services per year on those lines and approximately 120 per cent of seating capacity is utilised.  People who have to travel to Dublin often have to stand in carriages for long stretches of their journeys.  Iarnród Éireann has taken steps recently to remedy this problem.</P>
    <P>Much of the track mileage is nearing the end of its lifespan and this has led to speed reductions and poor journey quality.  Some sections of the track and the sleepers were laid 65 years ago.  A good deal of our rail system runs across peatland and that aspect must also be attended to.  That was noted in the report.  It is critical there is investment in rail lines that serve the midlands. The Minister is aware of the need for such investment, but it needs to be hammered home.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath and I raised the matter of the time it takes to travel from one place to another, a matter of major concern to people who wish to commute from the midlands.  The commuting public may have to connect with a flight or another rail or bus service to reach their final destinations, but often they do not make those connections because of delays.  It is often said the public do not fully utilise the rail service. However, it is estimated that 200,000 people will use the Dublin to Mullingar rail service this year. If the number of people who will use the Dublin to Sligo line this year was added to that figure, the total would be 600,000 people &mdash; a phenomenal number of people use those rail services. That gives the lie to the remarks trotted out by people who do not want investment in the rail service.  The rail service is utilised and could be utilised more, but the time factor is critical.  The more rail transport is used the better the transport system will be throughout the country. Deputy Haughey mentioned the gridlock in the city.  I am sure Deputy McGrath will agree that he and I can get from our places of abode to Lucan in a shorter time than it takes us to get from Lucan to Leinster House.  Dublin commuters would be pleased if rural politicians did not travel by road.  If we had an efficient public rail system, more people would use it because they would know they would get where they want to go in time.  Ensuring that, is an essential feature of an efficient public rail system.  An efficient rail system would also have a positive environmental impact.  It would reduce the number of cars on the road, help alleviate gridlock and reduce the level of pollution.  Investment in this area on a cost benefit analysis would be positive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> A study carried out on the return on investment in the rail service revealed a return of between 13.5 per cent and 15 per cent on the Dublin-Mullingar line, which I am sure Deputy Roche would be interested to note.  That represents a major economic return in respect of the criteria adopted and it is extremely good in European terms.  I accept the bulk of the money involved is generated on the Mullingar-Dublin line, but even the Galway-Dublin line generates a return of approximately 14.5 per cent.  As Members are aware, the greater the number of people who use a service, the higher will be the return on the investment.  That is critical.  The Cabinet, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the finance bureaucrats who examine these matters from that angle are aware that we can achieve a profitable return on the investment.  In that context, I support the Minister's decision to allow CIE to borrow £23 million.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from a constituent regarding the daily commuter service from Mullingar to Dublin.  She stated that in recent years there have been unexplained train delays, trains have been cancelled, there have been signal failures and heating was not provided on trains in winter.  I used the early bird service on the Mullingar-Dublin line when studying to be a barrister.  The train departs from Mullingar at 6.43 a.m. and arrives at Connolly Station at 8.25 a.m. It has departed at increasingly earlier times in recent years but it still cannot reach Connolly Station before 8.25 a.m. It is crazy that trains are obliged to stop at Drumcondra Station for ten to 15 minutes.  Surely train times could be better synchronised.</P>
    <P>It sometimes takes an hour and three quarters to travel from Mullingar to Connolly Station.  A person walking on the Royal Canal line could complete the journey faster.  Deputy McGrath and I are being criticised for not doing our job because of delays on the Mullingar-Dublin line. We are doing our job and we welcome the publication of the report, which vindicates our view in respect of this matter.  The Government will have our wholehearted support in ensuring the necessary investment is put in place to improve the rail lines.</P>
    <P>I could refer to other areas dealt with in the report, but time is against me.  I intend to ensure the report is not allowed to gather dust and that its recommendations will be implemented.  I have no doubt the Government will set about implementing them in a thoughtful way.  I intend to ensure the necessary investment is provided to improve the Mullingar-Dublin line.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to make a political point, but members of Deputy Penrose's party <Col N="1556" /> held Cabinet seats for ten of the past 15 years. However, everyone has a responsibility to solve this issue.  I compliment the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, who has done a good job.  By any objective standards, she has done everyone a great service by publishing the report.  I also compliment her on the investment package she announced recently.  Deputy Penrose was correct to state that during the lifetime of successive Administrations over the past 40 years the public transport system has not been provided with adequate investment.  The Minister has shown that she is acutely aware of problems in this area by expanding the public bus fleet, rail services for DART and Iarnród Éireann's rolling stock.  Most importantly, however, she has done us a great service by publishing the report.</P>
      <P>The report makes for frightening reading.  Its findings on tracks, signalling, structures, the DART and rolling stock give everyone pause for thought.  With regard to its comments on tracks, Deputy Browne and I intend to make a point about the Dublin-Rosslare railway line &mdash; the longest stretch of line in the country which still runs on antiquated wooden sleepers.  If one goes south of Greystones, the railway line is in a dangerous condition and speed restrictions operate along its length.  The situation is even worse on the stretch of line from Rosslare to Waterford. We are looking down the barrel of a gun because, if an accident occurs, serious damage will be done.</P>
      <P>The report's findings on the poor state of the rail signalling system are terrifying.  With regard to structures, anyone who uses the DART or the commuter rail system in the greater Dublin area will know that some of the station platforms are extremely dangerous.  There is a need for a relatively modest amount of money to be spent on improvements in this area.  Deputy Haughey made the valid point that the report's comments regarding safety on the DART will come as news to most people because everyone had believed the system was running properly.</P>
      <P>I will make only one comment on the rather sanguine view expressed in the report with regard to rolling stock.  It is clear that the person who stated that rolling stock is generally satisfactory has never travelled on the Arklow-Dublin or Wexford-Dublin lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to express specific concerns on two issues, namely, the DART and Dublin-Rosslare line.  The problem with the Dublin-Rosslare line is that investment has never been provided to facilitate improvements to it.  The line is particularly vulnerable because for long stretches it runs either adjacent to the seashore or on land reclaimed from the sea.  That rail line is the most vulnerable to erosion and rot, but no investment has been made to improve it.  The Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport was recently informed that this is the longest stretch of line in the country which runs on old fashioned railway sleepers.  That stretch of line is not mentioned in the current programme of investment <Col N="1557" /> for upgrading.  At least the rail lines to which preceding speakers referred will be catered for under that programme.  No action will be taken on the Dublin-Rosslare line before 1999.</P>
    <P>Because of the rapid growth of towns such as Arklow and Wicklow, the Dublin-Rosslare line is now a vital artery.  There has been phenomenal growth in commuter traffic on the line which could provide a huge amount of investment for improvements to it.  However, additional trains cannot be provided or schedules cannot be upgraded because the line is in a dangerous condition. It is difficult to understand why this line which, in addition to serving the commuter belt which now stretches as far south as Arklow and which also services the Euro port of Rosslare, has not been the subject of more attentive reaction.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise another point about the Dublin-Rosslare line which is of particular concern to me. A certain amount of important commercial traffic is carried on the line in addition to some very dangerous commercial traffic.  At present, major chemicals are transported on this rail line to the IFI plant in Arklow.  Any deficiencies on the line mean we are running the risk that there will be a catastrophic accident, a fact which undermines and threatens the economic viability of a plant that is vital to the people of Arklow.  Therefore, there are two reasons the line, not only for commuter purposes but from the point of view of general public safety, should be the subject of major investment.</P>
    <P>The Government and its predecessors earmarked millions of pounds for investment in upgrading the N11.  A great deal of the traffic which causes the chaos on that route is commuter traffic which, in most cases, could be transferred to rail transport.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the DART.  The extension of the DART to Greystones is long overdue.  It would have happened 20 years ago but for the fact that someone in CIE miscalculated the figures.  As Deputy Haughey stated, in the next four months the DART will be extended to Greystones, but no parking facilities have been provided.  Iarnród Éireann has been offered the use of a enough land by the local county council to build a 350 space car park adjacent to the DART station.  However, the Dublin Transportation Office, for reasons which elude me, has decided not to fund the construction of the car park.  If ever a stupid, short-sighted decision was taken, this is it.  I made a proposal to CIE to consider the possibility of extending the DART to Kilcoole, three and a half miles down the line from Greystones.  The line is in place and the demand is present.  Why stop short again and encourage a further 20 years of debate before an extension is built at an inflated cost?</P>
    <P>There is a major amount of work to be done in this area.  However, I will conclude by complimenting the Minister on publishing the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Roche for sharing time.  I compliment the Minister on <Col N="1558" /> initiating this review on the Irish rail system. Deputy O'Rourke is the first Minister to take positive action in this regard.  I welcome Deputy Yates's new-found interest in this subject because during his three years as a Minister he showed scarce commitment to the Dublin-Rosslare rail line.  On a number of occasions when I raised the issue in the Dáil the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, disallowed my questions on the grounds that he had no say in Iarnród Éireann.  I thank the Minister sincerely for her upfront approach in dealing with this.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Roche, I am very concerned about the Rosslare-Dublin line.  Rosslare is a Euro port, one of the major ports in Europe, and it is growing at an alarming rate, yet the rail line between Rosslare and Dublin is obsolete, comprising predominantly old jointed rail on timber sleepers which are rapidly reaching life expiry. There are numerous speed restrictions on the line because of the age of the infrastructure.  The present journey times are uncompetitive.  I travelled by train recently to Dublin.  It took about two and a half hours, and it was nice to sit back and relax.  However, very few people travelled on that train until it got to Greystones.  From there into Dublin it filled up very quickly.  From the passengers' point of view, the carriages were very old and in a dilapidated condition and there are very few services for the public to use.  From Greystones on it is a different world with modern stations and so on, but Gorey, Arklow and Enniscorthy have only basic facilities for commuters.  It is time this line was upgraded to a proper standard. I have been in the Dáil for 16 years and during that time I have argued with Ministers in different Governments for the provision of money for the upgrading of this line.  Enniscorthy and Gorey are expanding towns, and Wexford is bulging at the seams.  There is no doubt that if this line and the train facilities were upgraded far more people would travel.</P>
      <P>My final point relates to journey times.  I get to Loughlinstown by road in an hour, but to travel from Loughlinstown into the city could take anything from one to one and a half hours.  The Minister has decided to deal with the railways.  It is time she dealt also with the three county councils in Dublin who have no regard whatsoever for rural commuters coming into Dublin.  I have been travelling the Loughlinstown road for seven or eight months, and roadworks have been going on there for all of that time.  Surely somebody in Dublin's county councils has the ingenuity to speed up those roadworks and complete them because they are causing major difficulties to commuters from Wexford and Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I too want to express my shock at the recent revelation that the risk of accident on the Dublin to Mullingar railway line was the second highest in the country.  I was aware for some time of the need for investment in track renewal and signalling on this route, but I was totally unaware of the very poor condition of this <Col N="1559" /> route and the potential for serious accidents.  For quite some time we have been aware that what we were getting in terms of rolling stock on our line were the leftovers &mdash; what was not necessary or usable on other routes &mdash; but I had not realised the situation was so bad.</P>
      <P>The growth in numbers from Westmeath attending higher education, the mobility of our people and the increasing numbers who commute daily to and from Dublin has led to a big increase in the use of this railway line.  Because of the huge numbers using this line &mdash; Deputy Penrose estimated there were 120,000 in 1997 &mdash; and the present gross overcrowding on this route, it is imperative that additional investment is made immediately.  As to journey times, the train pulls out at about 6.45 a.m. each morning and arrives in Dublin at about 8.30 a.m. If one were to leave Mullingar at that time and drive one's car, one would be in Dublin twice over before the train got there.  It is not really a competitive commuter line and needs to be upgraded dramatically.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of an additional train originating in Mullingar, commencing last Sunday. This train, two carriages with the capacity to carry 130 passengers, will help to relieve the gross overcrowding on Sunday nights on the Sligo-Dublin route.  Heretofore the passengers &mdash; 150 on average &mdash; embarking at Mullingar on the 7.30 p.m. train to Dublin on Sunday nights had no possibility of getting a seat.  They spent the journey standing in corridors, crowded into the linkages between carriages, standing in the guard's van and even permanently confined to the toilet. This is unacceptable.  I have submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister for Public Enterprise alerting her to the possible dangers for these passengers and asking for safety measures to be put in place.  This question was answered yesterday and the response is already in the record of the House.  I note that in that reply the Minister said she had no responsibility for safety on the railways, yet in her speech last night she said &ldquo;road safety is not just my business, it is everybody's business&rdquo;.  There is a slight contradiction here.  Either it is her responsibility or it is not.  I would say it is her responsibility and I hope she will put in place measures to improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that the staff have been faced with this impossible situation because of lack of foresight by the management of Iarnród Éireann and the lack of infrastructural investment by successive Governments.  I acknowledge that £12.5 million is being spent on track renewal on this line and £5 million on signalling upgrading, but this work will not be completed until the end of next year.  What interim measures are being taken to improve safety for the thousands of passengers using this line?  This is an important question, and I hope the Minister will get an opportunity to respond to it.  We know that the track and signalling are being upgraded, but can we be sure that passengers will be safe in the interim?  Since the money is available for this <Col N="1560" /> upgrading, would it be possible to speed up the work by employing additional staff in Iarnród Éireann or by subcontracting parts of the work so that a safer track could be put in place as soon as possible?</P>
    <P>I also acknowledge the allocation of £17 million for track renewal on this route &mdash; money originally earmarked for the Luas project &mdash; but again the benefits will not be in place for up to three years.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible to employ additional staff and get that in place sooner?  I would hope so.</P>
      <P>Mullingar is expanding very rapidly.  An additional 1,000 houses were built in the past four years, representing a 25 per cent increase.  There is an increasing demand for a good commuter line between Mullingar and Dublin.  Since Mullingar has the necessary infrastructure already in place &mdash; sewerage capacity, student places in primary and secondary schools, recreational, sporting and social amenities and a variety of arts and heritage groups &mdash; it makes good economic sense to encourage further development in the town and its environs.</P>
      <P>Infrastructural development of our rail link will also give people an opportunity to move out of Dublin for cheaper and better quality housing in provincial towns.  I call on the Government to fund the works required in the same way as road improvements are paid for.  The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has said that she has approved borrowing for this work by Iarnród Éireann.  Can we not go that step further?  Why should the Government not invest in this infrastructural improvement itself?  After all, it does invest in roads.  What is different about our rail network?  Why can we not have that investment?</P>
      <P>As damning as this report is of our rail network, particularly the Dublin-Mullingar line, we can be content that the dangers to passengers are not nearly as great as to road users where up to 50 people may die between now and Christmas. The record of Irish Rail is relatively good with only five serious accidents in 43 years involving 34 fatalities.  I note that specific recommendations relating to particular locations and equipment have been made to Iarnród Éireann by the reporting consultants.  These recommendations should be made public so that the travelling public will be able to monitor progress on these improvements and hence be content that safety on our rail line is being improved.</P>

      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to address the issue of rail safety.  From the report, it seems that there has been an enormous amount of neglect over the years which has resulted in a very poor maintenance record.  The fact that there are railways that have not had regular maintenance is a frightening thought.  It seems that problems will have to arise before action is taken.  This has to change.</P>
      <P>There is an imbalance in investment in road and rail infrastructure.  While there is the question of safety, there is also the question of our international commitments relating to greenhouse gas emissions and the provision of an alternative to the motor car, the numbers of which are burgeoning. Commuters in my constituency of Dublin North, from Portmarnock, Malahide, Donabate, Rush, Lusk, Skerries and Balbriggan, have the right to travel in comfort.  The Minister should travel on the service at the times when there is congestion which is insufferable, even for those in good health.  There is severe overcrowding at peak hours.  In Tokyo staff are employed to push people on to trains.  We face a similar prospect here.</P>
      <P>While the report deals with the condition of the track, signalling and other infrastructure, the issue of rail safety has to be addressed by providing the additional carriages ordered as quickly as possible.  With the increase in building activity in outlying areas there is an enormous demand for increased capacity on the rail network.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Lenihan for sharing his time with me.  It is much appreciated.  I am appalled that the line from Howth junction to Drogheda is fourth on the list of lines which are under-financed.  The Minister should make the necessary resources available immediately to upgrade it.  Finance is also required to provide additional rail cars &mdash; more than 10,000 passengers use the line daily &mdash; which should not be used elsewhere during bank holiday weekends or on match days.  There is an economic benefit to be gained in reducing the number of motor cars on the road.  There is overcrowding from Balbriggan through Malahide, Rush, Lusk, Donabate and Skerries to the city centre.  Unless action is taken immediately the Government will stand indicted in the event of an accident.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on commissioning and publishing the report and demonstrating the necessary political will to implement its recommendations.  I share Deputy McGrath's concern about the Mullingar line which runs through my constituency and which is rated as the second most dangerous in the country. In the past year I have received a large number of complaints in regard to the quality of the service on the section of the line between Connolly Station and Maynooth.  The main complaint <Col N="1562" /> is that on the morning service to Dublin carriages are crammed to capacity by the time the train reaches the suburban fringe.  There is severe overcrowding. In direct contravention of safety regulations, passengers embarking in Clonsilla, Coolmine and Castleknock stations must stand in the aisles, doorways, the guard's van and even the toilets.  There are frequent delays because of which Iarnród Éireann is compelled to make alternative arrangements.  Similar problems arise on the evening service.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has reassigned moneys earmarked for the Luas project to the development of this line.  I have pushed hard for this since my election to the House.  Sufficient urgency cannot be attached to this project.  As Deputy McGrath mentioned, in addition to providing a double track to Maynooth, in the longer term it will have to be extended to Kilcock and Mullingar.  This represents substantial value for money because there is a sound economic case for investment in the line.  Because the infrastructure is in place the additional capital cost involved is far less than the sums required for some of the more ambitious and daft projects advanced to solve traffic chaos in Dublin.  The Minister has been the first to recognise this in a tangible way in recent years.</P>
      <P>There is huge scope for further development in terms of the provision of park and ride facilities for provincial commuters.  The point Deputy McGrath made about the development of suburban areas in the eastern region is relevant.  If the line can be developed, it will create far more space for housing developments at the time when house prices are high.</P>
      <P>Although not directly related, there is another matter to which I wish to refer.  Developers in my constituency where a vast number of new houses are being constructed are advertising developments on the basis that the area is served by a rail service which, as I have explained, is inadequate. This is deplorable.  If there are any further advertisements, I propose to take the matter up with the relevant bodies responsible for advertising standards.  It is not acceptable that young persons are being induced to purchase houses on the basis that the area is served by a rail service which cannot take the number of commuters who wish to avail of it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Jerzy Buzek, completed a two day official visit to Ireland yesterday. I met with him on Monday morning for a two hour working session.  I also hosted an official dinner in honour of the Prime Minister and Mrs. Buzek in Dublin Castle on Monday evening.  I discussed in detail with the Prime Minister Poland's preparations for accession to the European Union.  I assured him of Ireland's support and co-operation in maintaining the momentum of the enlargement process.  We considered the ongoing negotiations in Structural, Cohesion and CAP funding and the need to adhere to the March timetable for their completion.  We also discussed possibilities for increasing Irish-Polish trade and wider economic bilateral relations between our two countries.</P>
      <P>I will meet the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer, for a working lunch tomorrow.  We are likely to discuss Agenda 2000 issues, EU support for the peace process, the Vienna European Council, institutional reform issues and enlargement.</P>
      <P>Since I informed the House on 7 October of my foreign engagements and meetings with heads of State or Government, I have arranged to meet with Austrian Federal Chancellor, Viktor Klima, on 27 November as part of his tour of capitals in advance of the Vienna European Council on 11-12 December.  I have also arranged to meet the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, on 15 December.</P>
      <P>The agenda and proposals coming forward for the Vienna European Council are not yet set and accordingly the positions to be adopted by Ireland are not yet finalised.  However, it is clear that one of the main items to be discussed at the council will be the Structural and Cohesion Funds and the CAP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> The Cardiff European Council in June called for substantial progress to be made at Vienna so that political agreement can be reached on key aspects of this package no later than March next year.  The negotiations are on course to meet the timetable set, provided that the political will is forthcoming.  Ireland for its part will co-operate constructively with the Commission and the Presidency as well as with the incoming German Presidency with a view to meeting the March deadline.</P>
    <P>The Austrian Presidency has not yet specified in any detail how it envisages handling the Structural Fund negotiations in Vienna.  However, it seems likely it will be able to note significant progress on the detailed regulations and to give useful impetus to the negotiations through a further discussion of the most sensitive points at political level.  The European Council will also discuss a range of economic issues, with particular emphasis on employment.  Justice and home affairs questions, the functioning of the Union's institutions, CFSP issues and enlargement will also arise.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the French Prime Minister, Mr. Lionel Jospin, on 30 September raising the concern in Ireland regarding the ending next year of duty free sales for persons travelling within the European Union.  In particular, I referred to the Capet report which the Prime Minister Mr. Jospin's Government commissioned and which recommended that the excise duty component should be phased in rather than being introduced abruptly.</P>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach receive a response to his letter to the Prime Minister, Mr. Jospin?  Regarding the discussions tomorrow with the Commission President, Mr. Santer, would the Taoiseach, in the case of regions in the country for which the retention of Objective One status is sought, consider the possibility of breaching county boundaries by including district electoral divisions which qualify under the criteria of having an income below the Community average and which are on the border of counties for which the retention of Objective One status is sought?  I speak of certain areas in Carlow, west Cork, west Limerick and north Kilkenny where the income is very low and is below the 75 per cent average. Would it be possible to allow district electoral divisions, which are legitimate administrative areas recognised by the EU for other purposes, to be included with the areas for which the retention of Objective One status is sought so that they do not find themselves losing any hope of attracting industry because better grants will be available a mile or two down the road across the county boundary?</P>

      <P>I received an acknowledgement from the Prime Minister, Mr. Jospin, not a detailed reply.  Regarding tomorrow's discussions with the Commission President, I do not know what the level of detail will be but I hope to outline the Government's thinking on this issue with <Col N="1565" /> President Santer and explain to him the arguments in favour of allowing as much funding as possible.  Having discussed this privately before, I know he believes the issue to be one for Eurostat.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach in his discussions with President Santer tomorrow indicate to him the desirability from Ireland's point of view of the country being divided into two regions?  Does he expect to have any substantive discussion with President Santer or is it his view, the Government having made its decision, that the matter is one exclusively for EUROSTAT and that any such discussion with President Santer would be neither productive or relevant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe any discussion with President Santer will affect what we are doing.  An application in line with Government thinking will be forwarded to EUROSTAT within the next few days through the Director General of the CSO, which is the usual process. A substantive reply will be expected from EUROSTAT when it has considered the application. I understand from those who have been dealing directly with EUROSTAT over the past six to eight months that the application is seen by it as very straightforward and not requiring prolonged consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Taoiseach's meeting with the Chancellor of Austria, Viktor Klima, does he intend to discuss with him possible institutional changes within the European Union?  I know the Taoiseach has in the past indicated that, until such time as the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified, any possible future changes to the institutional structures are premature.  However, having regard to the fact that Agenda 2000 is a matter for discussion and constitutional and institutional change is considered a prerequisite for further enlargement, will the Taoiseach inform Chancellor Klima that our view is that, notwithstanding any other type of constitutional or institutional change there may be in the workings of the European Union, small member states would be required and would insist upon having at least one Commissioner representing their interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point I would make.  I continually raise that issue because it will be a case in whatever structural or institutional changes are made.  The level of discussion I will <Col N="1566" /> have with Chancellor Klima, based on his recent meeting with me here, will concentrate on what can happen in the General Affairs Council, and some of those issues.  As part of his Presidency he is anxious to at least tidy up some of these matters, as he would put it, and get a more structured operation of the agenda in the General Affairs Council.  At the Portschach meeting he stated that he would continue to move that agenda forward in the second round of meetings he will have next week.  Deputies will recall that the question was whether we should continue with the current system or hold it over two days, and I believe he was moving towards having a two day session.  There was an option in regard to who would represent but, more likely, it would be Foreign Affairs Ministers.</P>

      <P>In regard to my proposal that district electoral division statistics should be prepared so that district electoral divisions in other counties contiguous to those being included in Objective One can be considered, will the Taoiseach consult the current EU regulations where, in particular, the <i>arrondissements</i> of <i>Auvergne, Douai</i> and <i>Valenciennes</i> are included even though they are in NUTS III categories because of what is described in the regulation as their unique adjacent position and their regional GDP?  In this case these counties are adjacent to Objective One areas?  Will the Taoiseach consider that the precedent of <i>Auvergne, Douai</i> and <i>Valenciennes</i> could be used to allow areas in west Limerick, west Cork, Carlow and north Kilkenny&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As Deputy Bruton pointed out, some of those stretch into local districts.  Almost every <Col N="1567" /> member state has operated some of these schemes.  As I said earlier, in the discussions with EUROSTAT, our officials, who have tried to promote some of these issues, have examined various combinations.  I will bring this suggestion raised by Deputy Bruton to their attention if they are not already aware of it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the questions answered by the Taoiseach.  I was interested to hear the reply to Question No. 1 because I wanted to know whether he had raised with the French Prime Minister the experiment to have a car free day in 23 cities.  I thought that might be relevant, particularly in the context of Dublin.  In relation to question No. 2, will the Taoiseach raise the importance of retaining the duty free allowance with President Santer, an issue of great interest to many people here?  In regard to question No. 3, given the Taoiseach's statements in China that the Chinese leaders should meet the head of the Tibetan people, has he any intention of inviting the Dalai Lama to this country?  I know this question was asked previously of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In regard to question No. 4, did the Taoiseach raise with the Polish Prime Minister the issue of the decommissioning of the old nuclear plants in Eastern Europe?  That issue is of interest to many people, not just in terms of the safety aspect but also the cost implications for the European Union.</P>

That will be good news if it is followed through but that is the information that was made available to the European campaign.

He is interested not just in the issue of the old nuclear plants but also the outdated equipment in many of the traditional industries, and is anxious to move forward in modernisation.

First, I have accepted an invitation to visit the offices of the Safe Start Foundation in West Hendon, London.  This is my second visit to this organisation.  My first was during my term as Minister for Labour when I was invited to launch a promotional video when the foundation was first set up in 1989.  Safe Start was founded by the Mayo Association along with the Irish business community in London who recognised the special needs of young Irish people faced with homelessness or unemployment in London.  It is a community organisation which works closely in partnership with statutory bodies in assisting single young people to access accommodation, training and jobs.  Safe Start has been funded by the Irish Government through the DÍON Committee in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the past eight years.  Since its inception the foundation has helped more than 20,000 people.</P>

      <P>The Duke of Edinburgh in his capacity as patron of the Duke of Edinburgh Award visited Dublin on 10 November 1998 to launch the Millennium Gold Encounter with President McAleese, as patron of our equivalent awards scheme, Gaisce &mdash; the President's Award.  The Millennium Gold Encounter will be jointly hosted next year, both North and South, by the Duke of Edinburgh Award in Northern Ireland and Gaisce, the President's Award, in association with the international council for awards worldwide.</P>
      <P>During his visit the Duke of Edinburgh paid a courtesy call on me at Government Buildings which lasted for about 30 minutes.  In the course of our conversation we touched upon a number of topics including the importance of the awards schemes and their value to young people.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was raised by the Duke of Edinburgh with me.  Worldwide, 60 countries take part in the National Challenge Award for young people between the ages of 15 and 25.  The Duke of Edinburgh Award and Gaisce, the President's Award, are included in that award.  An international council protects the standards of various national awards.  The Duke of Edinburgh has been active in that and is, I think, a former chairman of it.  The Millennium Gold Encounter is an event for gold awardees and is held every three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Treaty of Amsterdam and perhaps the Treaty of Maastricht not facilitate the European Union in running a speciifically European Union award of this kind?  Would the Taoiseach consider this an appropriate matter for informal discussion with his colleagues in the European Union?  We do so many other things together and such an enterprise would <Col N="1572" /> build cohesion among young people in the European Union.</P>

      <P>Governor Frank Keating paid a courtesy call to me on Wednesday, 11 November, in Government Buildings.  We had a friendly exchange on a number of issues and I underlined to the Governor the importance of continuing bi-partisan American support for the peace process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed this question with the Governor because his views on it are well known.  I told him I totally disagreed with capital punishment but he explained his views at some length and his reasons for holding them.  He spoke of the tragedy of the bombing in Oklahoma City in which more than 170 people died and of the enormous number of subversive, terrorist or criminal gangs in the area.  He strongly takes the view that because these groups knowingly set out to kill people, public opinion in Oklahoma favours severe measures including capital punishment. Needless to say, I debated the matter with him.  I asked if statistics show that capital punishment had brought about an improvement in the situation.  He did not convince me that executing those convicted of murder did anything to reduce the number of such crimes.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the nature of the understanding between the Government and Deputy Gildea; if any written agreement exists between the two parties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  [23689/98]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no written agreement between the Government and Deputy Thomas <Col N="1573" /> Gildea.  I have said before I do not do privileged deals with any individuals.</P>
      <P>Deputies on all sides of the House know there is a huge selection of Government expenditure programmes, both capital and current, across the whole range of services the State provides.  In the Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrats programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, there are proposals to increase funding for specific programmes, especially capital programmes.  The Government has given priority to county roads, water and sewage treatment, education and rural development for extra resources.  This will allow certain programmes to be completed more rapidly and will permit certain elements of programmes to be brought forward earlier than had been originally planned.</P>
      <P>In my discussions with Deputy Gildea he indicated that certain issues were important to him. He has already publicy stated theses issues.  It would be the intention, over the remaining life of this Government, to deal with these issues many of which are reflected in our programme for Government.</P>
      <P>I do not believe this process will give rise to overall expenditure targets of Government being exceeded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that if one of his staff was a civil servant or a political aide, it would be normal that a note or minutes of the meeting would be taken?  That might be wise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There may have been loose notes.  Deputy Gildea gave me a copy of the statement in draft form which has not changed.  This <Col N="1574" /> outlines the issues which he correctly states are on the long-term list of requirements for south-west Donegal.  There is nothing unusual on the list.  The Deputy went through the points with his colleague and stated why he believed they were important to the people.  He did not ask that anything other than those issues be taken into account in expenditure in the north-west.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the frequency with which the household survey, which has replaced the labour force survey, will be released by the Central Statistics Office; the publication date for the next set of statistics; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  [21130/98]</P>

      <P>The quarterly national household survey was introduced in September 1997, replacing the annual labour force survey.  The purpose of the survey is to provide quarterly detailed statistics on the labour force and to produce periodic reports on social themes.  Processing and publication of survey results are still at a developmental stage.</P>
      <P>To date, one survey release has been issued by the CSO containing labour force details for the fourth quarter of 1997.  The next release scheduled for publication at the end of the month will contain results for the first two quarters of 1998. The ultimate target is to produce quarterly reports within three months of the end of each quarter.  The CSO expects to meet this objective during 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has there been such an enormous slippage?  The purpose of this exercise was to produce individual quarterly reports which would be published subsequently.  There has been massive slippage when two sets of quarterly reports are to be released on the same day, six months after the first survey was taken.  Has the Minister of State received an explanation for this from the CSO?</P>

      <P>The labour force survey reports were running nine months to a year behind the taking of the surveys.  The CSO is trying to ensure that, before the end of 1999, it will be able to produce quarterly reports within three months of the end of each quarter.  It is making solid progress towards that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  Massive extra resources were allocated to the CSO by the last Government to enable it to produce reports on a quarterly basis.  The value of the statistics rests on their freshness.  Can the Minister of State explain why the CSO failed to publish separately the second set of quarterly statistics and why two sets of such statistics are being published simultaneously?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is obviously an overlap. The quarterly national household survey was introduced in September 1997 and the CSO is trying to move towards producing that survey on a quarterly basis and away from the labour force survey methods.  A huge changeover is taking place.  At present, 150 CSO field staff are employed to carry out the quarterly survey.  Three thousand homes throughout the country are visited each week by CSO interviewers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are they being published together?  Why were the results for the first quarter of 1998 not published some months earlier as they should have been?  That was the objective and the resources were made available.  Does the Minister of State's brief not contain that information?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only explanation I can offer is that the processing, analysis and publication of results is a complex matter.  The new system is at a developmental stage and there has been an increase in the use of technology.  The <Col N="1579" /> interviewers, for example, use laptop computers when conducting 3,000 interviews per week.  The office is changing from an old system to a new one.  That is the best explanation I can offer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State believe that explanation?  If the CSO could publish the first quarterly set of statistics, how did it screw up on the second and third?  Does the Minister of State believe that garbage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The CSO informs me that there is a huge amount of work involved in changing from a system which it has used for decades to a new system of quarterly surveys.  It involves additional work and resources.  That is the reason for the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee, which I chair, will have its first meeting on Thursday, 19 November.  The committee is to examine and make recommendations on a small number of capital projects of national signficance which have been proposed as millennium projects.  In addition, it will examine and recommend a system for supporting, including funding, commemorative projects at a community, local, county or regional level to provide local communities, including in areas of social disadvantage, with an opportunity to participate in the commemoration of the millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of £30 million of Exchequer funding is to be made available over the years 1999 and 2000 towards the cost of projects for inclusion in the Government's programme to mark the new millennium.  A total of £27 million of this funding has been designated for capital projects.  It is the Government's intention that this £30 million will act as a lever on other sources of cofunding from the corporate and private sectors, thus potentially <Col N="1580" /> making up to £60 million available for millennium projects.</P>
    <P>The work of the National Millennium Committee will be supported by a small millennium office to be established within the Department of the Taoiseach.  This office will also be responsible for the co-ordination of the Government's overall millennium programme.  An announcement giving details of the National Millennium Committee will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health and Children the total anticipated hospital bed closures that will take place in December 1998; the hospitals concerned and the relevant health board areas; the length of time during which beds will be closed; the total number of bed days lost to date in 1998 arising from bed closures and the projected number as at 31 December 1998; and the action, if any, he proposes to obviate the necessity for bed closures in December 1998. [24140/98]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of the anticipated temporary hospital bed closures that will take place in December 1998, the hospitals and health board areas concerned and the length of time for which beds will be closed will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Temporary bed closures to date in 1998 have accounted for 74,379 bed days nationally.  The total projected number of bed days associated with temporary closures for the whole of 1998 is 90,398.  This amounts to less that 2.5 per cent of the total number of bed days available in the system. The figure represents an average monthly number of temporarily closed beds of 207 or almost 1.7 per cent of the total number of 12,267 acute hospital beds available nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Activity in the acute hospital system is planned by local management over a 12 month period having regard to anticipated levels of emergency admissions and the overall resources available. This forms a central part of the service planning <Col N="1582" /> process which is required of health boards under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, and which is also engaged in by other agencies not at this stage covered by the Act.  In 1998, for the first time, hospitals were advised of their funding allocation under the waiting list initiative at the beginning of the year.  This has enabled improved planning of elective activity for the year as agencies can take account, from the outset, of both projected core activity and activity to be performed under the waiting list initiative in the target specialities.</P>
    <P>In achieving activity targets set out in the annual service plan, temporary bed closures form a part of the normal bed management function performed by local hospital manage-ment within an overall budgetary management strategy.  These temporary closures also facilitate annual leave, the usual scaling down of elective activity during the summer months and the Christmas season, and on-going refurbishment works.  It is important, therefore, that they are viewed in the context of overall levels of activity delivered in the acute hospital sector against agreed service plans for the 12 month period.  In this context, it should be noted that the total number of discharges, both in-patient and day-patient, for all hospitals for the first nine months of this year was almost 3 per cent up on the same period last year.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that the number of overnight beds in the system at any given time does not reflect the complete picture of activity in modem hospitals.  For example, trends in medical practice in recent years have been for a marked shift in care from in-patient level to day case and out-patient level together with reduced average lengths of stay and increased bed occupancy rates.  To illustrate this point, overall acute hospital in-patient activity for January to September 1998 shows an increase of just over 1 per cent over the same period in 1997, while the corresponding increase in day activity is almost 7 per cent.  This significant increase in day work clearly underlines that a temporary reduction in bed numbers in any given location will not necessarily correlate to a similar reduction in activity in terms of total bed days used.</P>
    <P>My policy since taking office has been to ensure that the hospital system continues to respond efficiently, effectively and equitably to the needs of the population and that it is appropriately resourced to provide high quality hospital services in meeting these objectives.  Towards this end, I provided an additional £44 million for acute hospital services at the beginning of 1998 to provide for ongoing developments, including improvements in accident and emergency services, to commission new units completed under the capital programme and to tackle waiting lists and waiting times.  It is my intention to build further on this in 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the number of bed days which will be lost in December will be approximately 16,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on my reply, the present total of bed days lost is 74,279 and the projected total is 90,398.  There are about 16,000 bed days involved.  Of the total number of beds throughout the system of 12,267, the number that will be closed in December according to the tabular statement, is 912 in total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 912 beds will close in December.  Does the Minister know &mdash; he did not appear to know yesterday because his Department did not have the information &mdash; the state of the waiting lists as of 30 September 1998?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information available to me in the supplementary information to hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In determining whether additional funding should be made available to hospitals to keep beds open in December, it would be instructive both to the Minister and to his Department if he had put in place the necessary data collection base to ensure that at least by the middle of November he would be aware of the state of the waiting lists at the end of September 1998.  Would he accept it is gross incompetence and inefficiency that the only waiting list figures currently available to him and to Members of this House are the figures as they stood at 30 June 1998?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me to get data for the purposes of putting more money into the hospital system.  I have made it clear no more money will be going into the hospital system other than what has been approved expenditure since the beginning of the year.  I am not prepared to ask health boards to collect data for the purposes of putting further back in the queue people like those availing of services for mental handicap, services for the elderly and all of the community based services, which also require allocations. These services work within their budgets despite the fact that, similar to the hospital services, they would like more funds.  On the basis of finite resources, at the end of the day despite gross non-capital expenditure, day-to-day revenue expenditure will exceed £3 billion for the first time this year.  The allocation of further resources above those which have been budgeted for the hospital system would be at the expense of these community based services and that is not a just solution.</P>
      <P>Clearly this is the first year in which the accountability legislation is in operation.  It is important that it is seen to work.  The discipline which it imposes will be instructive to everybody for next year's allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in the absence of finalised figures from the Department it is reasonable to calculate that as at the <Col N="1585" /> end of this year the waiting lists will have grown to in the region of 38,500, which will be an increase of 10,000 during his term of office?  Would he accept that in the context of such a huge escalation in the waiting lists it is completely unacceptable that 90,398 bed days are lost in 1998 because insufficient funding has been made available to the acute hospitals to meet the real demands being made by patients in need of essential surgery and in-hospital treatment and care?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the waiting lists, the waiting times are more instructive for patients. These are unacceptably long at present and need to be improved.  The 1997 rises were in respect of allocations of just £8 million made by the previous Administration.  We increased that by 50 per cent for 1998 at which time we stabilised those lists give or take 1,000 or 2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>20. Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health and Children the number of adults on hospital waiting lists for longer than 12 months; the number of children waiting longer than six months; and the steps, if any, he will take to deal with this crisis.  [24139/98]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of adults on hospital waiting lists for more than 12 months on 30 June 1998 was 12,314 and the number of children waiting for more than six months was 2,413.  The remaining persons on public in-patient waiting lists were waiting for less than 12 months and six months, respectively.  I am committed to taking all appropriate steps to addressing both waiting lists and waiting times.  Since taking office I have taken a number of initiatives in the operation of the waiting list initiative.</P>
      <P>In addition to these steps, I established a review group on the waiting list initiative, which was the first major formal analysis of the area since the initiative was launched in 1993.  I received the report and we had a debate in the House on this matter.  I have since been preparing proposals for its implementation.</P>
      <P>I will shortly bring these proposals to Government, after which I will announce full details of how I intend to proceed.  I assure Deputies that I am committed to implementing the report of the review group in a planned and structured way. The report emphasises that there are no simple solutions in this area and that the problems arising must be addressed far beyond the acute hospital system alone.  I will ensure that all of the steps taken to deal with waiting lists and waiting times are implemented in a structured and co-ordinated fashion right across the health services.</P>
      <P>I will be happy to provide full information to this House when the Government has taken decisions in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the evidence to date <Col N="1586" /> would indicate a decidedly hands off approach by the Minister in dealing with the waiting lists crisis. He outlined a number of short-term steps which he intended to take some time ago.  Will he outline the steps he has taken on foot of the review group's report on the waiting list crisis?  He spoke of appropriate steps.  What has he actually done?  Furthermore, will he let us know when he intends to publish the review group's report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>An implementation team in the Department has been working on a memorandum for Government.  It is drawing up the resource allocations which will be required to deal with the issues raised.  It will deal across the hospital services, not just the acute hospital services with the need to provide more resources so that there is a greater throughput through the surgical beds' system.  That proposal is before Government and it will be coming before Government again next week.  As soon as decisions are taken which will allow me to proceed with an implementation phase of that review group's report, I will make those decisions public and make public the review group report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is nonsense to talk about trying to achieve a greater throughput when hospital beds are being closed?  In addition, those which are open are being used inappropriately.  Will he accept that the priority now is to make all possible hospital beds available in order that progress can be made on the waiting lists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This year resources were increased by 50 per cent.  The previous Administration reduced the allocations under the waiting lists initiative which saw the waiting lists rise by one third in its tenure.  With increased resources, we were able to do 15,000 procedures this year which was an increase of more than 5,000 compared to the previous Minister's performance in 1997 with the allocation which he made available.</P>
      <P>The temporary bed closures, which have been a feature of the health system since I came into public life, is part of the bed management system which is the operational responsibility of managers who must ensure that they work to their budgets.  They represent 2.5 per cent of the total number of beds available.</P>
      <P>The real issue here is to make sure that we bring forward a programme which will bring us results and achieve greater throughput.  One of the main ways of doing that is to attack this problem on all fronts and not expect that putting resources into the acute hospital sector alone will provide a panacea for the problem.  That will not solve the problem on its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister doing about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>A memorandum being considered by Government will provide for a greater level of <Col N="1587" /> resources across a whole range of areas.  This will compare favourably with what was done by the former Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is no consolation to the 34,000 people who are on hospital waiting lists.  Will the Minister accept that one of the serious underlying problems in relation to hospital waiting lists is that our hospital services are seriously under resourced?  Does he accept the figures bear that out?  The figures show that as a percentage of GDP our health spending is at the lower end of the EU scale.  Does he believe that funding difficulty will have to be addressed as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>One could argue for more health resources on a whole range of criteria, including that referred to by the Deputy.  Since coming to office we have attained increases in expenditure in this Department, far in excess of what my colleagues in other Departments have to accept, because of the priority being accorded to the development of the health services by this Government.  There will always be an argument for increased resources for the health services, no matter what Government is in office.  Unless we are prepared to submit to the budgetary disciplines the same as other Departments, these health agencies cannot plan for the improvements which the Deputy, I and others in the House seek.  As regards dealing with some of the outstanding problems, if people on the other side propose to throw budgetary discipline out the window and continue to provide funds regardless of how we plan our services, clearly that will not solve the problem either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>21. Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health and Children if he intends to increase the price of private beds in public hospitals during the next 12 months; and, if so, the likely increased cost of health insurance as a result of any such proposed price increase.  [22436/98]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a 9 per cent increase from 1 January next in the charges for private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals. The determination of any premium increase is a matter for each individual insurer, having regard to all considerations relating to the financing of its particular operations.  For example, the VHI increased its premia by 9 per cent from September 1998 and it is estimated that about 2 per cent of the premia increase was attributable to the increase from 1 January in the private bed accommodation charges in public hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that my Department, in informal discussion earlier this year with VHI and BUPA, advised that it would be prudent for them to incorporate in their financial plans the likelihood <Col N="1588" /> of an increase of this order from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>The actual cost for the public hospitals of providing a service for a private patient is still well in excess of the increased charge.  This is due to medical inflation, including pay increases, and the impact of technology on the costs that a hospital must bear.  Successive Governments have accepted the need for charges to reflect more fully the economic cost of delivering health services for private patients.  Any other approach represents an unjustified subsidy of the private health sector generally and the taxpayer should not be asked to meet such a bill.  It might also be noted that there was no price increase at all in hospital charges in 1994, 1995 and 1996, despite a significant increase of about 16 per cent in public hospitals costs for that period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying the substantial increases announced by the VHI and, no doubt, similar increases by BUPA, derive not merely from the increased charge imposed on private beds in public hospitals in last year's budget, which became operative on 1 January 1998, but that he is imposing a further 9 per cent as and from 1 January 1999 and that that was factored into the September VHI increases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not correct.  I told them to factor it in for any future increases they may be contemplating for next year.  We estimate that every 1 per cent increase in the charge on private patients using public hospital beds in public hospitals represents a quarter of 1 per cent increase in premia.  We estimate it represents about a 2 per cent increase in premia for VHI users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying another 2 per cent will be added to the premium as and from January 1999, owing to his proposal to increase the cost by a further 9 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The VHI, if applying for an increase, usually approaches my Department in July or August.  The proposed increases, if not rejected by me, will come into operation from 1 September 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept he is playing the role of price fixer for private beds in public hospitals?  Will he accept that the roles of the owner of the VHI and of the regulator of health insurance are mutually exclusive and contradictory?  Will he also accept that if he continues to increase the cost of private beds in public hospitals there is a risk that it will put the cost of health insurance beyond the reach of young couples who are already struggling to make mortgage repayments?  In that context it may impose greater pressures on the public hospital system which has a burgeoning waiting list.  Has the Minister any immediate plans to transfer his function as a regulator of the health insurance industry to <Col N="1589" /> any other Department, as required by EU regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter matter raised by the Deputy was discussed in the context of the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill.  He will be aware a White Paper on that matter is due shortly.  We can discuss the matter in greater detail on that occasion.  To answer the Deputy's first question, I have a simple question to ask the Deputy.  Is he in favour of a subsidy by the taxpayer at the expense of public patients, where private patients are using public hospital beds?  As a matter of social justice I do not believe that is tenable.  I believe a greater part of the economic cost should be paid by private patients using public hospital facilities.  If the Deputy does not agree, perhaps he will say so.  I have no apology to make in seeking to insist that the taxpayer and the public patient &mdash; we have just had a discussion about public patient waiting lists &mdash; get a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we keep on asking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can pick and choose when it suits his argument.  I am not prepared to allow the taxpayer subsidise to the extent he is subsidising the use of public hospital beds by private patients.  People should pay a greater amount of the economic cost.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health and Children the conclusions reached by a company (details supplied) in its investigation into the finances of Tallaght Hospital, Dublin 24; if he will publish its report; the plans, if any, he has to provide the hospital with the additional funds required for 1998; and the funding allocation he will make to the hospital for 1999.

      <P>The review which is being carried out on my behalf by Deloitte &amp; Touche into budgetary and other matters at the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, is not yet complete. I regret, therefore, I am not in a position to state the conclusions reached by Deloitte &amp; Touche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> No decision has been taken with regard to the publication of the report.  The Deputy will be aware that in my reply to his question on 8 October 1998 on this issue, I made it clear that I am committed to making the report expeditiously available to the board of management of the hospital.</P>
    <P>The board of management of the hospital reported to my Department in September last that it was projecting a budgetary overrun of approximately £21 million for 1998.  Part of the brief of Deloitte &amp; Touche is to review these projections and as I have stated earlier this review is not yet completed.  It is not possible for me to comment on the funding arrangements for any budgetary overrun the hospital might have for 1998 until I obtain the conclusions of the report. I confirm that the hospital, like all other health agencies, is expected to remain within its 1998 determination.  The hospital was notified, like all voluntary hospitals, that it was intended to apply in an administrative way any relevant terms of the accountability legislation.  Any overrun is in the first instance a matter for the hospital and an overrun for 1998 will be a first charge on next year's determination.</P>
    <P>With regard to the funding allocation to be made to the hospital for 1999, the hospital and all other health agencies will be notified of their 1999 determination early next month.  Even if the funding allocation to the hospital had been finalised at this point, I would consider it inappropriate to comment at this time and to treat this hospital any differently from other hospitals.  I am sure the Deputy would agree with me in this regard.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's obvious concerns with regard to the new hospital at Tallaght.  I am extremely concerned at the degree of the projected deficit for 1998 which has been presented and the reasons given for this overrun by the hospital's board of management.  My concerns obviously extend to the patients and staff of the hospital and the future implications for this, our newest and most modern hospital.</P>
    <P>This report will receive my immediate attention as soon as it is received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Minister in a position to explain to the House why the report has not yet been received, given that he originally informed the House that Deloitte &amp; Touche would complete its work within three weeks of going into the hospital?  Could he indicate if he is aware of bed closures in the hospital in the months October, November and December and, if so, how many?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche review is now close to completion.  It took longer than initially estimated as it proved to be more extensive and difficult than anticipated.  Deloitte &amp; Touche reported no lack of co-operation by the hospital and reports to the facilitation group indicated a co-operative approach.  All the detailed <Col N="1591" /> examination work at the hospital has been completed and elements of the report have been made available to the hospital and the Department to verify their factual accuracy.  It is anticipated that the report will be submitted to me as Minister within the next week.  As regards bed closures, that information may be available in the context of Question No. 19 and I will forward it to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned the position in Tallaght hospital is critical.  I have sent in independent consultants and I am not prepared to comment on what action must be taken until I have the conclusions of the report.  I do not believe it would be helpful to the hospital or the public to comment until I get the report.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is in the public interest that the report be published as soon as he receives it, and that it be put into the public domain as soon as possible, not hidden on the shelves of his Department, as is the case with the report of the review group on hospital waiting lists?  In the context of this question I expect the Minister to be able to tell the House the number of beds, if any, that have closed in the hospital in the months October to December.  Perhaps he could give that information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question was what conclusions were reached by the private consultants' report, when it would be provided, what additional funds were being provided in 1998, and the funding allocation for the hospital in 1999. That does not imply a linkage to the specific question of bed closures.  If such a question is put down I can make an inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>If the Deputy wants specific factual information about the bed numbers I can get it, but it is not anticipated in this question &mdash; if it had been, I would have the information for him. No decision has been taken about the publication of the report.  I must receive it and my first responsibility is to make it available to the hospital board.  I am not in the business of providing the conclusions for publicity's sake until I have an opportunity to deal with the owners and board of the hospital to see how we can solve this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not acknowledge that, since substantial public funds have been put into the hospital, Members of the House are entitled to see the report to discover the manner in which funding has been spent and whether the funding made available to the hospital was <Col N="1592" /> adequate to meet its needs, in order to assess what is in the best interests of the hospital and the community it serves for the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware I took the unprecedented step of sending in consultants as soon as it became obvious to me that such a course of action was necessary, precisely in order to discharge my responsibilities as Minister and to assist accountability so that the position was properly reckoned with and audited.  I am carrying out that responsibility.  As to the adequacy or inadequacy of budgets, I repeat the point I made previously at Question Time: in February the hospital submitted a budget which was only £900,000 in excess of its determination of £53.7 million, and it was instructed to resubmit its plan within budget.  It is vital to note that the original plan gave no indication of severe funding shortfalls. If anyone is suggesting the hospital was underfunded, that was not the case when the service plan was drawn up.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health and Children the steps, if any, he will take to reinstate health care and expenses payments to a person (details supplied) who claims she was infected with hepatitis C virus in Castlebar General Hospital, County Mayo; if it is accepted that she did contract hepatitis C; the developments, if any, which have occurred since all relevant records and papers at the hospital were made available to her; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  [24206/98]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is a serious dispute in this case between Mrs. Fallon and the Western Health Board.  The Western Health Board has stated its medical records show that anti-D was not administered to Mrs. Fallon while she was under its care in March 1993.  Mrs. Fallon is of the strong view that anti-D was administered to her following the birth of her child in Castlebar Hospital.  in March 1993, and has alleged that the medical record was later altered to denote that anti-D was not administered. In addition, tests carried out by the independent laboratory jointly run by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and the Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Edinburgh, indicate that the source of Mrs. Fallon's <Col N="1593" /> hepatitis C was not the anti-D product manufactured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board. These findings are also disputed by Mrs. Fallon.</P>
      <P>At my request, the Western Health Board arranged for the solicitors acting for Mrs. Fallon to gain access to all the hospital's records relating to the case, including medical, nursing and laboratory records, in their original format.  I understand that the solicitors in question viewed those records at Castlebar Hospital on Tuesday, 27 October.  The solicitors also met members of the hospital staff, including medical, nursing and laboratory staff and management, who explained the practices, procedures and record-keeping arrangements in relation to the administration of anti-D.  The hospital subsequently forwarded copies of any documentation requested by the solicitors. Further material requested by the solicitors was forwarded within the last week.</P>
      <P>The Fallons requested the Garda to investigate whether anti-D had been administered to Mrs. Fallon in Castlebar Hospital, and to investigate whether her hospital records had been materially altered.  I understand the Garda visited the hospital on 28 October and 16 November in relation to these investigations.  I further understand that the hospital requested the Garda to carry out a forensic examination of the relevant records, and this is currently being done as part of the ongoing investigation.</P>
      <P>I have made it known on several occasions that I consider the compensation tribunal the proper forum in which to have this matter resolved.  The tribunal was established by the Oireachtas and has a statutory remit to determine causation on the balance of probabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that <i>ex gratia</i> payments were made to Mrs. Fallon to facilitate her to obtain initial medical assistance and care arising from contracting hepatitis C?  Does he agree, in the context of this being a contentious and difficult matter and there being a dispute about the medical records, that it would be a correct response that those payments should continue to be made available to her while these issues are being dealt with and addressed?  I suggest the Minister take steps to ensure this is the case and not to deprive her of these payments in the context of the medical treatment she apparently received in Castlebar.  On the form the word &ldquo;anti-D&rdquo; is ticked as if she did receive it, but the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; has been put before it in writing.  I urge the Minister to restore the payments to allow her to receive additional medical care for the condition she has contracted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The compensation tribunal is the best forum in which to resolve this matter, and I am anxious to have it resolved one way or the other.  The tribunal was established by the Oireachtas, has the confidence of all four of the support groups representing persons with hepatitis C, and approximately 1,000 claimants have availed of it to date.  I reiterate my offer of an <Col N="1594" /> early hearing of Mrs. Fallon's case before the tribunal on the causation issue, independent of considerations of compensation.  Such a hearing could be arranged within three or four weeks. Alternatively, if Mrs. Fallon's solicitors have any new information which affects the case, I ask that they submit it immediately to the BTSB for consideration in the context of the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme.</P>
      <P>I again express my sympathy for Mrs. Fallon who has, whatever the cause, contracted hepatitis C. Since I first became involved in this case, my whole strategy has been to achieve a resolution in the interests of all parties, not to take sides on the issue.  I consider that the options I have outlined would, if adopted by the Fallons, ensure that the matter is resolved as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I ask the solicitors to contact the BTSB about any information they regard as relevant obtained from their detailed examination in the hospital. We need evidence of some description, because a scientific test has suggested that the source of the infection was not the anti-D.  The Deputy is correct that the person who would avail of the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme and claim to have hepatitis C, which this unfortunate lady has, would get their payments.  The dilemma has arisen because it subsequently emerged that perhaps the source of the contamination was not as she understood it to be. One can see the situation from both sides.</P>
      <P>I would like to see this issue resolved.  Unfortunately, there is a reluctance to go to the tribunal where there is an informal atmosphere and where people are dealing with these issues on a day to day basis.  There has been little or no complaint about these proceedings of which I am aware from any of the support groups.  I encourage this family to use the tribunal to deal with this issue alone and, if they wish and the causation issue is, on the balance of probabilities, dealt with in their favour, they could proceed to take High Court action or to look for compensation through the tribunal.  That is a matter for the family and I will respect whichever route they wish to take.  If an undertaking is given that this matter will be brought to finality, I will try to resolve it as amicably as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has been aware of the need to monitor and evaluate overall MRI requirements in the public hospital service.  Accordingly, an expert study of the existing arrangements for the provision of MRI facilities nationwide and likely future demand in this area was commissioned from Professor David Banta, an international expert in health technology assessment.  Professor Banta's findings were announced last year.</P>
      <P>As I have already outlined to the House, he identified the need to develop MRI facilities at University College Hospital, Galway, St. James's Hospital and the new Tallaght hospital.  All three hospitals have now submitted applications to my Department for the development of MRI facilities on foot of the acceptance of Professor Banta's recommendations.  My Department is currently in discussion with the management of St. James's Hospital concerning the installation and operational requirements for its facility. Once these discussions have been satisfactorily concluded, I am committed to making the necessary resources available for the provision of MRI facilities at St. James's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> I am conscious that the pace of developments in this area is fast moving, both in terms of the technologies involved and their applications.  I assure the Deputies that the evolving needs of the acute hospital service for high technology imaging facilities will be taken into consideration in implementing the commitments set out earlier.</P>

I am sure he is aware that there are just under 1,000 patients from the Eastern Health Board area on a Beaumont Hospital waiting list for MRI scan facilities.  Perhaps he might clarify if that waiting list incorporates patients from outside the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>Mr. Cowen: Discussions with the management of St. James's Hospital are ongoing.  It is a question of agreeing and dealing with the logistics of the installation and operational requirements.

      <P>I have no proposal to introduce a bone screening programme at this stage. However, all general medical services patients are entitled to acute medical services free of charge and bone density x-rays are carried out for public patients.  My Department's health promotion unit has recognised the important role of education in the prevention of osteoporosis and has given financial support to the Irish Osteoporosis Society to facilitate its programme of public awareness of the issue.</P>

Perhaps it could be examined in the context of a number of screening programmes with which we are trying to proceed at present, particularly in relation to the cancer <Col N="1598" /> strategy.

      <NameTxt>26. Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health and Children if he will provide details of the £32 million which his Department returned to the Department of Finance; the original intentions for the spending of these moneys; the reasons they were not spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  [23946/98]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I make it absolutely clear to the Deputy and to the House that I will not return £32 million to the Department of Finance nor to the Exchequer.  The figure of £32 million arose from the forecast outturn for 1998 as published in the Abridged Estimates of 1999.  This forecast was the latest Estimate available to the Department of Finance at the time of going to print.  While this forecast figure included the major portion of the likely buoyancy in Appropriations-in-aid and, to a lesser extent, additional recoupable expenditures, the figure did not and could not include the full extent of the Supplementary Estimate required by my Department.  The finalisation of the Supplementary Estimate is currently under discussion between officials in my Department and the Department of Finance.  I expect that when all the outstanding issues, pay and non-pay, are agreed with the Minister for Finance, the final net non-capital funding provided for the health sector will exceed the original Estimate and allow for the implementation of agreed service plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying the £32 million in question will be spent on the health services this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if we are talking about any £32 million as part of the overall expenditure of more than £3 billion in this area.  Following a misreading of the Abridged Book of Estimates by Opposition Members, it was suggested I had £32 million in my back pocket that I had not given to the health services which I should give to them, but nothing could be further from the truth.  All Deputies will be aware that we have never been amazed at the ability of our health agencies to not only spend the money they are given but to <Col N="1600" /> spend more than that.  The suggestion that I am in the business of holding back moneys allocated to them would have necessitated a communication from me to all the health agencies asking them to deduct the equivalent of £32 million in total from their service plans, but that did not happen because that was not necessary.  There is no question of a reduction in service plan levels as anticipated or of £32 million being retained by the Department.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the sources of funding for the health service are Exchequer grant-aid and Appropriations-in-aid, which represent the own resources element of the health services, health levies, etc.  The breakdown of those figures in terms of how we fund the total authorised expenditure decided on at the beginning of the year and which will be augmented by a Supplementary Estimate that will come before the House tomorrow is usually 90 per cent to 10 per cent.  A sum of £32 million has not been held back.  It has been my job over recent months to indicate to the health agencies the need for them to comply with accountability legislation to ensure they do not go over-budget.  I would not ask them to ensure they are under-budget because there would be no prospect of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying the £32 million in question has arisen because of an increased buoyancy in the health levy?  If so, is that an additional £32 million that was not included in the original Estimates because of the difficulty in forecasting income that would accrue from the health levy and will that money be spent on the health services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I want to ensure nobody gets the wrong end of the stick a second time.  If the provision for health levies is approximately £300 million, which represents approximately 10 per cent of gross non-capital expenditure, the health services would be funded by 10 per cent represented by Appropriations-in-aid plus a 90 per cent Exchequer grant.  The Appropriations-in-aid figure is topped up with an Exchequer grant to the value of the total level of expenditure agreed at the beginning of the year plus a Supplementary Estimate.  That is a simple mathematical equation. There are two streams of funding, the level of the Appropriations-in-aid and an Exchequer grant and the level of the Appropriations-in-aid determines the Exchequer grant.  That is how we have funded the health services since we introduced health levies in 1979.  There is no mystery about it.  If there is buoyancy one year the level of Appropriations-in-aid contribution might increase.  If the figure increased by £30 million or £60 million that would represent 1 per cent for every £30 million extra.  Instead of the health services being funded on that occasion by a ratio of 90 per cent Exchequer grant to 10 per cent Appropriations-in-aid, it could be funded by a ratio of 89 per cent to 11 per cent.  The overall expenditure figure does not change.  That is the <Col N="1601" /> basic point.  The suggestion made by the Opposition last week that such buoyancy involves a £32 million underspend is a misunderstanding or more likely an engagement in political mischief to take from the Book of Estimates which were historic in terms of the level of public services improvements envisaged for next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the position extraordinarily simple?  Because an additional £65 million has been received in respect of the health levy over and above that which the Minister had anticipated and because he has spent approximately £30 million to £32 million of that by way of over-spend through his Department, the reality is the Appropriations-in-aid that the Department of Finance agreed to give his Department at the beginning of this year will be a sum of approximately £32 million less than the Department originally envisaged because the Minister has received far more money by way of buoyancy through the health levy than he anticipated?  That £32 million Appropriations-in-aid that was available from the Department of Finance to his Department for this year is now considered a saving by the Department of Finance and will not be made available to the health services.  Is that not what the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy confirmed in his press conference held this day last week when the Estimates were published?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No it is not the position.  I will explain the position once more for him.  If a fee or an outlay was in question it would be an easy matter for the Deputy to understand.  This is a simple matter.  The total level of expenditure for health was agreed at the beginning of the year. That is how the system works.  Under good Government one decides what one will spend and one spends that amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  The level of health spend <Col N="1602" /> was agreed at the beginning of the year.  Under the accountability legislation for the first time all moneys are sent out in time so that service plans can be drawn up on the calendar year, 1 January 1998 in the case of this year.  I will send out letters of determination after the budget so that they can prepare their service plans and have money available to them from 1 January 1999 next year. There was a time when we did not give allocations until mid-March and we wondered why we could not plan our health services.  We could not tell people how much they would spend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of buoyancy, that merely determines the level of spend from the source of funding from which the buoyancy comes.  As a general rule, there is a division of 90 per cent to 10 per cent in the health service spend. There are two separate streams of income and the overall 100 per cent figure does not change. The suggestion, therefore, that 89 per cent plus 11 per cent amounts not to 100 per cent but rather, as the Deputy claims, to 99 per cent of the total spend is not borne out by the mathematics I was taught in school.</P>

Does the Minister acknowledge that, notwithstanding the change in proportionality and the fact that the original budget was agreed with the Department of Finance, circumstances have changed and that an additional £32 million, which arises out of buoyancy and which was not originally available, has come on stream?

    <P>People refer to buoyancy as if it relates to owned resources only.  However, they conveniently seem to forget the buoyancy that relates to the spend.  These things balance out.  Deputy McManus asked why we cannot use the buoyancy?  We intend to use it to plan developments in the health service for next year which are pay-related to the tune of more than £200 million and which include service improvements of £154 million. Members on the other side of the House must accept that when they propose legislation &mdash; I agree with such legislation &mdash; it is in the short, <Col N="1605" /> medium and long-term interests of the health service that we are prepared to work within the budgets allocated.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that health spending is constantly increasing.  This year, for the first time, we will breach the £300 million barrier relating to day to day expenditure.  Each week we are reaching milestones in respect of the Health budget.  In the past five years, the total budget has doubled. Deputies are aware that there is an internal dynamic in operation in terms of our trying to provide services and improvements.</P>
    <P>If we are to move away from the <i>ad hoc</i> situation which obtained in the past, we must realise that the purpose of the Health (Amendment) Act was to encourage the Minister for Health and Children to demand a greater capital budget from the Minister for Finance to modernise infrastructures, improve capacities and achieve throughputs in respect of the waiting lists about which everyone is complaining.  We cannot have it every way.  Members, whether in Government or Opposition, must realise that we have to work within some sort of credible framework which, if nothing else, imposes discipline in the interests of best practice.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise one further point which has not been taken up by any Member of the Opposition. On the basis of a finite budget and regardless of amount of funding provided by that budget, why are hospitals exempt from budgetary discipline?  It is because the impact of succumbing to that discipline would mean non-hospital services, which are equally important in terms of providing healthcare in the community for many groups which have been at the end of the queue for too long and about which the House has had many good debates in recent months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to place more effective controls on the nature and extent of advertising by solicitors, particularly in the area of personal injuries.  The Bill specifies what may and may not be contained in solicitors' advertising generally.  It prohibits advertising which expressly or by implication refers to claims for damages for personal injury and treats contravention of the advertising provisions in the Bill as misconduct by a solicitor for the purposes of the Solicitors Acts.  The Bill also removes difficulties and anomalies in certain procedures of the Disciplinary Tribunal for the solicitors' profession, and it strengthens the power of the Law Society to prohibit contravention of the Solicitors Acts in relation to advertising and other matters concerning the conduct of solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Society has indicated its support for the Bill and I welcome that support.  It is important that the society has made clear its position because it is the general regulatory body in relation to the solicitors' profession.  The society has indicated that while the present law provides for limited control of advertising, it is not <Col N="1608" /> adequate to deal with the excesses which have become prevalent among some of its members.</P>
    <P>Advertising by a small number of solicitors is blatantly litigious.  It openly invites persons to make claims and it stirs up business involving claims against employers, occupiers, State organisations or any other mark for damages.  This advertising is pushy, &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; and sometimes personalised.  The advertising in question has brought the good name of the solicitors' profession into disrepute.  Advertising by solicitors in relation to Army hearing impairment cases is but one example of the kind of advertising which this Bill aims to deal with.  The intention of the Bill is to ensure that the solicitors' profession as a whole will work within a reasonable standard advertising code.  The reality which cannot be ignored is that the actions of a few have tended to lower the public's respect for the profession.  It is time now for this matter to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Law Society carried out admirable work on a code of conduct over a long period of time which culminated in 1988 in a code, A Guide to Professional Conduct for Solicitors in Ireland.  It is the work of many eminent solicitors and it is a monument not only to them but to the wisdom of the society in promulgating the work and bringing it to finality.  The foreword to that code of conduct by the then President of the Society, Thomas D. Shaw, is as relevant in the context of this Bill as it was in 1988.  He stated that &ldquo;sound ethical conduct is the foundation on which any profession should base the conduct of its business&rdquo;, and among his concluding remarks were the following:</P>
    <P>This Code of Conduct attempts to translate ethical philosophy into a practical set of rules and conditions, based upon sound common sense, culled from the collective wisdom of practitioners over many years.  Professional conduct is largely a matter of self-discipline.  It has to do with personal pride, pride in oneself and in one's profession.  It transcends the purely legal aspects of a situation, because sometimes even when the legal niceties are attended to there can be a choice between common sense and sharp practice.  Ethical conduct has to do with standards of common decency the observance of which affects that very precious commodity the &ldquo;good name&rdquo; of the profession to which every solicitor has the honour to belong.  It is to be hoped that this Code of Conduct will act as a ready reference to solicitors as to what is proper in the many diverse situations in which they find themselves as they go about their daily business in close proximity with the public which they have the honour to serve.</P>
    <P>When the Law Society published its code of conduct it elected, with some reluctance and after considerable debate, to allow advertising under certain conditions.  The society, since 1955, had, by regulation, prohibited solicitors from advertising their services to the public.  While the 1988 <Col N="1609" /> regulations allowed solicitors to advertise, they prohibited advertising which was in bad taste, false or misleading, claimed specialist knowledge or superior quality of service over other solicitors or was critical of other solicitors.  Those advertising provisions were subsequently put into primary legislation by the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>I propose, briefly, to set out for the information of the House the main provisions of the statutory code, contained in Acts of 1954 to 1994, which currently apply to advertising by solicitors.</P>
    <P>Section 71 of the Solicitors Act, 1954 empowers the Law Society to make regulations with respect to the professional practice, conduct and discipline of solicitors.  That section was extended by the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994 to provide that the society may not prohibit advertising except in the case of advertising which is likely to bring the solicitors' profession into disrepute, is in bad taste, reflects unfavourably on other solicitors, contains an express or implied assertion that a solicitor has specialised knowledge superior to other solicitors, is false or misleading, consists of unsolicited approaches to individuals for business or is contrary to public policy.  These legislative provisions were given detailed effect by the society in regulations made in 1996.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations of 1966 a solicitor is obliged to furnish the Law Society with a copy of an advertisement issued within a 12-month period of its date of issue when requested to do so by the society.  Breaches of the regulations may be investigated by the Disciplinary Tribunal and may be found by the tribunal to be misconduct within the meaning of the Solicitors Acts of 1954 and 1960.  The 1994 Act gives the Disciplinary Tribunal power, where it has found a solicitor guilty of misconduct, to advise, admonish or censure that solicitor and to order him or her to pay a sum, not exceeding £5,000, to the compensation fund of the society or an aggrieved party.  In addition it has the power to refer the matter to the High Court which has the power, <i>inter alia</i>, to strike the name of the solicitor off the roll, suspend the solicitor from practice for a specified period of time or place restrictions on the solicitor's practice.</P>
    <P>A person who refuses to obey a direction of the Disciplinary Tribunal is guilty of an offence which carries a maximum fine of up to £10,000 and/or two years' imprisonment.  Where the offence is tried summarily, the maximum penalties are a fine of £1,500 and/or 12 months' imprisonment. Disciplinary Tribunal orders may be appealed by a solicitor to the High Court.  Disciplinary tribunal orders may be appealed by a solicitor to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeals and re-enacts many of the provisions of section 71 of the Act of 1954 as inserted by the Act of 1994.  A main difference is that the details of prohibitions on advertising will now be contained in primary legislation rather than in regulations made by the Law Society.  The Bill aims to ensure that the kinds of excesses of advertising <Col N="1610" /> experienced to date will be a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific provisions in the Bill. Section 1 is the main provision.  It amends section 71 of the Solicitors Act, 1954, which relates to regulations with respect to the professional practice, conduct and discipline of solicitors, by the substitution for subsections (2) to (7) of ten subsections, many of which contain either new or amended provisions.  Before dealing in detail with these new subsections I first draw the attention of Deputies to definitions contained in the new subsection (10).</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; is wide and covers any oral, written or electronically produced communication which publicises a solicitor or his or her practice.  It includes any material or statement for general publication and any audio or video recording or any presentation, lecture, seminar or interview.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;claims for damages for personal injuries&rdquo; means claims for damages or compensation for personal injuries suffered by a person owing to an act of another person.  The term &ldquo;personal injuries&rdquo; is defined as including any disease and any impairment of a person's physical or mental condition or death.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (2) corresponds in large part to existing law in so far as it prohibits solicitors from publishing or causing to be published an advertisement which is likely to bring the solicitors' profession into disrepute; is in bad taste; reflects unfavourably on other solicitors; contains an express or implied assertion of specialist knowledge in any area of law or practice which is superior to that of other solicitors; is false or misleading; is contrary to public policy.</P>
    <P>Other provisions, however, are new and are of particular relevance.  A solicitor is prohibited from publishing or causing to be published an advertisement in an &ldquo;inappropriate location&rdquo; which is defined in subsection (10) as including a hospital, clinic, doctor's surgery, funeral home or cemetery.  Many people would find it extraordinary that any solicitor would attempt to promote his or her practice as a solicitor in such a location. The fact in some cases, as I have learned in the recent and not so recent past, is that truth is stranger than fiction.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) also prohibits advertising which expressly or impliedly refers to claims or possible claims for damages for personal injuries; the possible outcome of such claims; the provision of legal services in connection with such claims; which expressly or impliedly solicits, encourages or offers any inducement to any person or group to make such claims.</P>
    <P>A key provision is the new subsection (3).  It prescribes the information which may be contained in a solicitor's advertisement.  An advertisement can include the name, address, including electronic address, telephone and facsimile number and place of business of the solicitor.  Particulars of the academic and professional qualifications and legal experience of the solicitor may <Col N="1611" /> also be provided as well as factual information on legal services provided and any areas of law to which those services relate, particulars of any charge or fee payable to the solicitor, and other information specified in regulations made by the Law Society.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (4) makes clear that, without prejudice to the prohibition on advertising in relation to claims for personal injuries contained in subsection (2), solicitors may, when advertising, include the words &ldquo;personal injuries&rdquo; in the factual information they provide.</P>
    <P>The Law Society will be required under the new subsection (5) to make regulations, with the Minister's consent, to give effect to provisions in the Bill.  The regulations, among other matters, must make provision in relation to advertisements by a solicitor, including the manner of their publication, their form, content or size.  They must restrict solicitors from &ldquo;touting&rdquo; and provide for the manner of determination by the Law Society of a contravention of the advertising provisions in the Bill or regulations made under it.</P>
    <P>The new subsections (6), (7) and (8) repeat existing provisions in the Act of 1994.  Those subsections enable the Law Society by regulations to prohibit the advertising by solicitors of any charge or fee for a specified service where the Law Society considers it appropriate and where the Minister is satisfied that such regulations are in the public interest.  The subsections prohibit a solicitor from charging less for a legal service than any charge or fee specified under any enactment for the time being in force and empower the Law Society to provide by regulations that solicitors, who satisfy the Law Society of specialist knowledge in a prescribed area of law or practice, be permitted to advertise themselves as having such knowledge.</P>
    <P>The advertising controls provided for in section 1 in relation to personal injuries apply by virtue of section 2 to non-solicitors also.  Given the extent to which non-solicitors advertise services of a legal nature in the area of personal injuries it is only reasonable that statutory controls which apply to solicitors in this area should also apply to non-solicitors.</P>
    <P>There is a need to address the question as to whether and to what extent the new provisions affect existing advertisements.  Section 3 provides that sections 1 and 2 shall not apply to advertisements published not more than three months after the commencement of the Bill.  This will give solicitors a reasonable time within which to acquaint themselves with the new provisions and to be on notice on how to act within the parameters of those provisions for the future.</P>
    <P>The Solicitors Acts of 1954 to 1994 specify what constitutes misconduct by a solicitor.  Breach of advertising provisions in those Acts constitutes misconduct.  Section 4 of the Bill extends the definition of misconduct for the purposes of those Acts to include breach of the new advertising provisions in the Bill.  The section also provides that <Col N="1612" /> any solicitor who acts with an unqualified person whom the solicitor knows to be acting in contravention of the Solicitors Acts shall be guilty of misconduct under those Acts, including provisions in the Bill.  Accepting instructions from any such person or any other conduct tending to bring the solicitors' profession into disrepute will also constitute misconduct.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6, which I initiated on Committee Stage in the other House, have been included as a result of consultations between my Department and the Law Society.  Both sections amend the procedures to be followed by the disciplinary tribunal when inquiring into the conduct of a solicitor against whom misconduct has been alleged.</P>
    <P>Section 5 amends section 7 of the Solicitors Act, 1960, as substituted by section 17 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, and is designed to strengthen the disciplinary tribunal's procedures in a number of respects.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) makes it mandatory for the tribunal to include with its report to the High Court &ldquo;a verbatim note of the evidence given and submissions made&rdquo; to the tribunal in the course of its hearings.  Under the law, as it stands, the tribunal is required, on completion of its inquiry into alleged misconduct by a solicitor, to embody its findings in a report to the High Court specifying the nature of the application, the evidence laid before the tribunal and any other matter which the tribunal thinks fit to report.  Because the full transcript of the proceedings is not made available to the High Court, it leaves open the possibility of challenge, by way of judicial review, by either the applicant or respondent solicitor, as to the accuracy of the tribunal's report.  Paragraph (a) remedies this potential difficulty and the availability of the verbatim note will have the added advantage of minimising delays in the production of the tribunal's report for the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 5, paragraphs (b) and (c) deal with service of the tribunal's report and order.  At present, the tribunal is required to serve a copy of its report to the High Court and to serve its order under section 7(9) of the 1960 Act on the respondent solicitor.  The amendments contained in paragraphs (b) and (c) oblige the tribunal to serve copies of the report and order on the Law Society and, where appropriate, the lay applicant. The documents in question must be served within 21 days of their preparation.  These provisions will ensure that all parties before the tribunal are dealt with equitably and that the tribunal's proceedings will be seen to be open and transparent.</P>
    <P>Section 5 paragraph (d) provides for amendment of the law relating to appeals to the High Court against an order of the tribunal in two ways.  First, it provides that the Law Society and applicant in the proceedings before the tribunal shall have the same right of appeal against the order of the tribunal as the respondent solicitor currently has.  At present, the society or the applicant may only appeal in respect of the adequacy of the sanction imposed by the disciplinary tribunal <Col N="1613" /> or on the basis that, in lieu of making an order, the tribunal should have referred the matter to the High Court.  I am satisfied that, in the interest of equity, the society and applicants should have the same right of appeal as the respondent solicitor.</P>
    <P>Second, paragraph (d) provides that the period of appeal will run 21 days from the &ldquo;date of service of the order or the report, whichever is the later&rdquo; in place of the current provision for the period of appeal to run 21 days from &ldquo;the date of service of the order&rdquo; only.  The tribunal's report, which contains its findings and the evidence presented to it, is of singular importance in any appeal and is of particular relevance to the parties contemplating an appeal against an order of the tribunal.  Given that the appeal period of 21 days is relatively short and that, in some cases, the tribunal's report may not be ready for some time after the issue of the order, I am satisfied that for the parties to fully assess the tribunal's findings, the date of appeal should run from the date on which the full particulars of the tribunal's findings and its order are available to all the parties.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends section 23 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, to allow the Law Society to publish a summary of the disciplinary tribunal's report on its findings in proceedings against a solicitor for alleged misconduct.  At present, section 23 provides that the Law Society may, on receipt of an order from the disciplinary tribunal, publish the order or notice of the making of the order and its effect.  Such publication has undoubtedly a certain deterrent effect on solicitors. However, publication of the order, which often contains no more than the sanctions imposed by the tribunal or its effect, may not make clear in all cases the nature of the misconduct of which the solicitor has been found guilty or the significance of the misconduct.  Consequently, the deterrent effect of publication can be diminished.  On the other hand, the disciplinary tribunal's report specifies the nature of the complaint against the solicitor, the evidence which is presented to it in the course of its inquiry into the complaint and its detailed findings.  The view of the Law Society, with which I agree, is that more disclosure should be made of the findings of disciplinary hearings against solicitors.  Publication of such hearings would give rise to greater transparency and it could also have a greater deterrent effect than simple publication of details of the penalty imposed on a solicitor for his or her misconduct.</P>
    <P>The remaining section of importance in the Bill is section 7.  It provides that, on application by the Law Society, the High Court may where it is satisfied grant an injunction prohibiting contravention of the Solicitors Acts by a solicitor or any other person, notwithstanding that such contravention may constitute an offence.  The background to this new section is that in a High Court case, the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland <i>v.</i> Carroll and others &mdash; 1993, vol.  3, <i>Irish Reports</i>, p. 145 &mdash; the Law Society sought declarations <Col N="1614" /> that a defendant who was not a solicitor and who had held himself out to be such had contravened the Solicitors Act, 1954, and sought injunctive relief restraining him.  In refusing to grant the injunction the court held that, while the society had power to bring a criminal prosecution against a person who commits an offence under the Solicitors Acts, it did not have the power to obtain an injunction to prevent a person from breaching the Solicitors Acts.  Section 7 of the Bill now provides for that power against any person, both solicitors and non-solicitors.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that the Bill is warranted and that it will achieve a reasonable balance between the right of solicitors to communicate and the need to maintain good ethical standards in the legal profession consistent with public policy. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> While I welcome the Bill, it is too little too late.  It is akin to closing the stable door when the horse has bolted.  The compensation culture rampant in this country derives from two decisions in which the Minister's party played central roles.  First was the Law Society decision of 1988 to relax the rules governing advertising by solicitors.  It is worth recalling the Law Society made its decision in 1988 after much agonising and under threat from the Government of the day that, if it did not drop the prohibition on advertising, the Government would introduce legislation to ensure it did so.  It was the era of open and free competition.  Knife edge, cut and thrust competition was the order of the day.  It may have seemed a sensible decision at the time, but there was grave anxiety within the legal profession about it.  There was a great deal of soul searching and the decision, when made, was by way of postal ballot and was carried by the slimmest of margins.</P>
      <P>The second instrument responsible in part for encouraging the culture of compensation was the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994.  There is no doubt that this opened the door further.  While it sets down a series of guidelines, rules, strictures and sanctions for any breaches, the reality is that not alone have these not been effective but the relaxation of the ban on advertising has been the single greatest stimulus for the spate of compensation claims which annually records a dramatic increase.  That legislation lifted the lid and it is impossible at this stage to put the genie back in the bottle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each high profile area of compensation seems invariably to trigger off some other potential area of claim.  The unfolding saga of Army deafness claims, with estimates of the final cost to the taxpayer being between £1 billion and £2 billion, has opened up other potential areas of claim.  It will be noted about the Army deafness claims that there is a distinct pattern in some cases and a distortion in others.  A reply was given to the House by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, on 17 December 1997 to a question asking him to set down all details relating to claims made <Col N="1615" /> by various regiments, squadrons, battalions, etc. It showed that, while the 1st Infantry Battalion in Galway, a sizeable one in the Western Command, had a mere five claims at the time, the 12th and 13th Infantry Battalions in Limerick, which are the same size as the 1st in Galway, had 159 claims.  I do not want to make spurious allegations but it seems more than coincidental that there is a massive increase in one battalion over another which has been exposed to the same occupational hazards in the same set of circumstances, yet in the case of Limerick the claims amount to 159 as against five for a battalion of the same size in Renmore, Galway.  I would not like to draw an inference from the fact that one of the people in Limerick actively touting for business in Army deafness claims is a former Army officer who is now a solicitor.</P>
    <P>Other like comparisons can be made.  In the 28th and 29th Infantry Battalions in Donegal, 42 and 20 claims respectively have been made. Donegal is a substantial battalion covering Finner, Letterkenny and Lifford, and it is no coincidence that the person openly advertising for business in Army deafness claims is a solicitor who is the wife of former Army officer.</P>
    <P>In the 3rd Infantry Battalion in the Curragh, 63 claims have been made while the figure for Kilkenny is 53.  There seems to be a Newbridge influence in those cases showing a tangible connection between people who formerly served in the Army and those now openly touting their services. Going through the list, one can see increases in claims where open touting is taking place.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question last week to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the number of deafness claims from members of the Garda Síochána.  A total of 72 gardaí have made deafness claims and while the Minister talked tough during Question Time by insisting that claims would be vigorously defended and that there would be no easy settlements, the reality is that the handful of claims settled so far were for £32,000 each.  That is not small change.  The Department does not appear to have a strong defensive policy in these claims.  The merits or otherwise of every case must be thoroughly investigated.</P>
    <P>I received a reply from the Minister some time ago in relation to personal injury compensation. The figure for his office is relatively small but in regard to the Garda Vote, actions involving official vehicles amounted to 582 in 1994, with the number of payments made being 396.  The total expenditure, including compensation and legal fees, involving official vehicles was £2,652,472. The situation worsened in 1995 when a total of 590 claims were made.  A total of 639 claims were made in 1996 while in 1997, 659 claims for civil actions were made of which 534 were paid at a cost to the taxpayer of £3,898,449.</P>
    <P>This House and taxpayers are owed an explanation of the kind of occurrences that give rise to <Col N="1616" /> 659 cases being brought and 534 settled at a cost to the taxpayer of £3.8 million.</P>
    <P>In examining the number of claims under the Garda Síochána (Compensation) Acts, 1941-5, I note that 258 claims were made in 1997.  The number of claims on which compensation was paid was 50.  The amount of compensation was £1,388,000.  That is a welcome reduction on the 1992 figure where 372 claims were made, of which 293 were paid costing the taxpayer £4,471,000.  In regard to the prison Vote, 102 claims were made in 1997, 59 of which have been settled so far at a cost of £883,000.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a root and branch examination of the way we deal with compensation claims, and it should start with Government Departments.  While I welcome the commitment of the law society to the procedures set down in the Bill and its commitment to self-regulation, I fear its task will not be easy because so many legal firms are actively promoting the compensation culture through the most reckless form of advertising.  No attempt is made at subtlety in these advertisements.  The most blunt form of inducement is used.  Advertisements which read &ldquo;Personal injuries.  No foal, no fee.  We settle most of our cases out of court so you will not have to worry about embarrassing publicity&rdquo; have become the norm.  Taxis carry advertisements stating:</P>
    <P>If you accidentally collide with the car in front of you, you may have a successful and lucrative personal injury claim to make.  We are the experts to advise you.  Contact us.</P>
    <P>The firm of sponsoring solicitors is named, the telephone number is given and of course the first consultation is free.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that these legal firms would begin to move away from such aggressive marketing in view of the imminent prospect of this Bill becoming law.  The Minister referred to section 3 providing an acceptable run-in period to allow people adjust to the new regulations.  There should not be any adjustment period provided. As soon as this Bill becomes law and the order is made, it should take effect immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the deterrent effect of section 23.  I am not optimistic about that because, irrespective of how this Bill might signal new strictures, those in the industry have not taken the hint even though the measures in the Bill have been well flagged.</P>
    <P>The very week the Bill was being taken in the Seanad, advertisements in the Sunday newspapers ran the banner headline &ldquo;Have You Been Exposed to Asbestos?&rdquo;  The advertisement went on to state:</P>
    <P>You probably know that Asbestos can be &ldquo;harmful&rdquo;.  You may have been told to be &ldquo;careful&rdquo; when working with it.  But has anyone told you the full story?</P>
    <P>If you inhale Asbestos dust it will harm your lungs but you might not find this out for years. <Col N="1617" /> It may take twenty to thirty years before it kills you.</P>
    <P>Yes, Asbestos dust can and does kill people. In the UK more than 3,000 people are dying each year from Asbestos related diseases. There are no accurate figures available for the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>You are likely to have come in contact with Asbestos at work.  Those at risk include people employed in construction, maintenance and manufacturing, as well as electricians, plumbers and laggers.</P>
    <P>But you don't have to work with Asbestos. Wives have been harmed because of the Asbestos dust carried home on the overalls of their husbands.</P>
    <P>I wonder what would happen if it came home on the underwear.</P>
    <P>Entire families have been affected because they lived close to a factory or an Asbestos dump.</P>
    <P>If you think your health has been put at risk because of Asbestos you may wish to know more.</P>
    <P>We are a firm of solicitors specialising in personal injury law.  At present we are investigating numerous claims of Asbestos exposure. Maybe we can help you.  Please phone us if you would like more information or why not avail of our free first consultation.</P>
    <P>We are putting legislation through this House which will send out a strong signal to curtail blatant touting, yet here is a large, so-called reputable city centre firm of solicitors openly encouraging anyone who may have come into contact with Asbestos to come forward for advice about a personal injury claim.  It is the crudest form of exploitation. It plays on people's fears, anxieties and emotions and anyone can see that it is deliberately drafted to create the maximum doubt in people's minds. It asks if anyone has told the full story and suggests that it may take up to twenty or thirty years before asbestos kills its victim.  It reminds the reader that asbestos dust can and does kill people.  The reader is not even asked if he has come into contact with asbestos.  The advertisement tells him that he has come into contact with asbestos at work.  The scope is further widened to the tradesman's wife and family and the neighbourhood and entire community are invited to get in on the act.  Wives, it is claimed, have been harmed by asbestos dust carried home on the overalls of their husbands.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Advertisements such as this demean the legal profession.  No one suggests that any person should be denied his or her legitimate and constitutional right to compensation for genuine personal injury.  However, the instant and automatic reaction of a substantial number <Col N="1618" /> of people is to lodge a claim with a solicitor if they suffer the most trivial injury and occasionally when they suffer no injury at all.  It has become the norm.  No question of morality is involved. Indeed, morality has no place in situations where people deliberately set out to exploit fears and anxieties, as was done in the advertisement I cited.  The current situation is seen as a harvest of rich and easy pickings.  The problem must be tackled on several fronts and this Bill goes part of the way towards doing that.</P>
      <P>There is a growing and worrying tendency not to fight personal injury claims.  This is particularly true of public bodies so that local authorities, Government Departments and semi-State bodies are seen as soft touches.  Too many cases are settled out of court.  Dublin Corporation has a specialist claims unit in its finance department. Well might Dublin Corporation require such a unit because in 1997, 593 personal injury claims were lodged against it.  Of these 502 were settled and the total settlement for the year was £4,720,399.  The tendency to settle out of court sends out a wrong signal.</P>
      <P>The issue of excessive legal costs must also be tackled.  While the amount paid out in compensation by Dublin Corporation in 1997 came to £4.7 million, the amount paid in legal costs came to £2.3 million.  These costs are particularly out of proportion in view of the fact that most claims were settled out of court.  I cite the example of Dublin Corporation but that body is not exceptional. The picture is reflected throughout most public bodies.  Not alone does the proliferation of claims play havoc with people's attitudes but also with the services provided by public bodies.  In County Mayo, for example, public playgrounds are being closed down because of the number of claims resulting from alleged accidents on swings and other pieces of playground equipment.  Minor injuries are seen merely as opportunities to rip off a public body.</P>
      <P>An examination of the variety of claims lodged against local authorities makes interesting reading. Claims are lodged for every conceivable situation including falling on roadways and footpaths and in playgrounds, falling from bicycles and motorcycles, driving into potholes and for injuries caused by litter bins and by slates falling from public buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major problems encountered, particularly by Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited, in seeking to defend public authorities is that many claims are not made for several months or even years after the date of the alleged accident.  This can make it impossible for local authorities fully to investigate the circumstances of the alleged accident.  An individual who alleges he sustained personal injuries as the result of falling into a pothole on a public road need not submit his claim until two years and 364 days after the alleged incident.  By this time the pothole has been filled in, the local authority has forgotten about it and was probably unaware that an incident ever occurred at the location and <Col N="1619" /> there is no hope of seeking witnesses, presenting a cogent defence or of disproving the claim.  This problem arises from the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991.  This stipulates that the limitation period within which a personal injury claim can be brought runs for three years from whichever of the following dates is later, the date upon which the cause of the accident accrued or the date upon which the person injured first had knowledge of all the following facts: that he or she had received a significant injury; that the injury could have been caused by an act of negligence; the identity of the defendant; where a person other than the defendant is alleged to have acted negligently the identify of that person and the additional facts necessary to bring an action against that person.  The limitation period of three years only begins when the plaintiff has full knowledge of the facts surrounding the injury. The time period for lodging claims for damage to property is six years.</P>
    <P>Prior to the passing of this Act, by reason of the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957, the limitation period for bringing an action for personal injuries was three years from the date upon which the cause of the action accrued.  This formula was generally acknowledged to be three years from the date on which the act of negligence was complete and the damage had been caused.  Prior to the passing of the Public Authorities (Judicial Proceedings) Act, 1954, the time limit allowed for bringing an action against a local authority was six months.  We must return to that regime.  We urgently need an amendment to the 1991 Act which would reduce the time limit now enjoyed. This would allow local authorities fully to investigate and defend third party claims.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was introduced in the Seanad, Senator Henry welcomed it as a member of the medical profession.  She referred to the huge escalation in the number of medical negligence claims.  No one can excuse shoddy medical practice but there is no doubt that the same attitude of opportunism which pervades the general insurance scene has taken a firm grip in the area of medical insurance claims.  Fifteen years ago a typical doctor paid £40 per year for medical insurance protection.  The average general practitioner is now paying £7,000 per year.  Anaesthetists and surgeons are paying £14,000 and up to £18,000 in some cases.  Obstetricians are paying between £34,000 and £36,000 for medical insurance protection.  The Department of Health and Children, in other words the taxpayer, is meeting the bill for a large number of doctors employed by it.  The Department must pay approximately 80 per cent of their medical indemnity costs &mdash; more than £20 million of taxpayers' money per year.  The figures are staggering. They are growing and will continue to grow unless something is done.  In saying this I do not wish to infringe on people's rights to claim in genuine cases.</P>
    <P>I regret the Bill does not attempt to address <Col N="1620" /> the problem faced by young graduates seeking to enter the legal profession as solicitors.  As a result of a court judgment handed down by Judge Foy in a case brought by Queens University graduates, all law graduates must pass an entrance examination before they can enter Blackhall Place.  Prior to this judgment, law graduates got automatic entry.  In this case, entry examination requirements are unreasonable.  I cannot see the logic in asking someone with three or four years' study for a specific legal degree or qualification to sit a duplicate entry examination.  The Minister should have entered dialogue with the Law Society in advance of the publication of this Bill to see if this could be rectified.  This Bill offered such an opportunity.  It deals with a different aspect of the profession but it presents a golden opportunity to rectify an unfair anomaly.  I plead with the Minister to examine this and to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage.  All sides would have pleasure in supporting such an amendment.</P>
    <P>There is another difficulty for law graduates which should be tackled, namely, the difficulty, and in some case the impossibility, of young graduates obtaining apprenticeships.  It is unfair that young, highly motivated and qualified, top ranking honours graduates, who entered university with the ambition of becoming solicitors, will never get the chance to practice as they do not have family ties with, or roots in, the profession. The present situation has been overlooked for too long and something must be done to bring some order and create more apprenticeship opportunities.  Has the Minister any proposals in this regard?</P>
    <P>Another matter which has not been addressed is the unwritten rules concerning the introduction of restrictions on conveyancing.  There is an inherent danger in allowing a solicitor to act for both sides.  This adds to the dangers of the modern phenomenon of gazumping.  Where a solicitor is privy to, and acting for, both sides, there is a danger and a temptation that such a practice will become the norm in view of the linkage between fees and the amounts paid.</P>
    <P>I welcome the main thrust of the Bill.  However, there are a number of omissions which should be rectified.  I look forward to the Minister's response and to the subsequent Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Higgins reading excerpts from the advertisement, I wondered if having a lung disorder caused by asbestos was something to which one should aspire.  The language used was appalling.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this Bill.  It is necessary to protect the consumer from being enticed into taking legal action arising from advertising, but it will also put a halt to the emergence of large scale advertising by companies, not operated by solicitors, who offer legal services in respect of personal injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Bill is a measure to protect the consumer, it must be remembered that when the ban <Col N="1621" /> on advertising by solicitors was lifted it was not done at the behest of the Law Society.  Therefore, I advise against large scale solicitor bashing during this debate.  However, I also acknowledge there are legal practices which take huge advantage from the lifting of the ban which have done nothing to abate the compensation culture that has emerged in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Bill was published on foot of the Army deafness cases against the State.  The number of these cases led the Minister for Defence to adopt the view that solicitors were acting as ambulance chasers and there was a requirement to impose restrictions on how they advertise.  While the view of the Minister for Defence may or may not have been correct, it is important to state that, prior to the lifting of the ban, the Law Society stated it was not in favour of such a move.  However, it has already been found that, under the Competition Act, the advertising ban was anti-competitive and legislation was drafted and implemented in keeping with that Act.  In hindsight, the advertising ban should not have been lifted.  Competition does not work well in litigation and the Competition Act should not have applied.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the Bill are to change the rules on advertising by solicitors; to ensure the consumer is not abused and to prevent the onslaught of the compensation culture.  I hope the change will benefit the consumer.  What does the Minister intend to do to restrict para-legal advertising?  Does he plan to regulate para-legal advice and advertising?  There have been remarkable cases of people convicted of gross criminal activity who set themselves up as legal advisers in the vicinity of the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>From the lawyers' perspective, where there is a wrong there must be a remedy.  A person who has suffered loss through the fault of another must be entitled to recover damages as compensation.  No one could argue with this rationale.  There would be no point in asserting the existence of rights under law if remedies are not available.  Remedies are essential to restrain breaches of the law and to award compensation which has the effect of vindicating the rights of the individual who has suffered injustice at the hands of another.</P>
    <P>Such an award of damages is, as the word compensation makes clear, not intended as a punishment for the wrongdoer but to put the victim, in so far as money can do, in the same position as if the wrong had not occurred.  In personal injury cases, out of pocket expenses are met, future losses assessed and an extra sum is arrived at which is intended to cover pain and suffering. However, an economist, sociologist or statistician would argue that modern living is a risky activity. Individuals are at risk from the actions of others and the slightest mistake on the part of another can expose one to extraordinary and far reaching consequences.  The public seems unable to accept the concept of risk or to accommodate the notion that life is full of risks which cannot be eliminated.</P>
    <P>There is no point in stating that the wrongdoer <Col N="1622" /> should cover the costs of his or her mistake as many could not afford to do so.  Every lawyer is familiar with the concept of the market for damages &mdash; the person or the body with the deepest pocket who can afford to be found responsible. There is no point in finding fault with an individual who cannot pay for his or her mistakes.</P>
    <P>Litigation and compensation are a means of sharing risks.  The Oireachtas requires that every person who drives a car must be insured for the damage which they may cause.  It is recognised that such damage is potentially enormous and beyond the means of most private citizens.  Essentially, we as policy holders club together to form a fund from which the needs of victims are met. Although not required by law, in practical terms anyone in the business of providing goods or services to the public must carry public liability insurance.  The cost of insurance is reflected in the charges which firms impose and is eventually borne by consumers.</P>
    <P>In the law courts, people with extraordinary needs have them met from a common fund. Whether policy holders, consumers or taxpayers, we all contribute to these funds.  The true defendant is not named in court.  To a large degree, every consumer and taxpayer is the defendant. The function of the court in many ways is to decide who is eligible to pay.</P>
    <P>The question the legal profession must answer is whether disbursement from these funds is managed in the most effective and efficient manner. The courts are not primarily concerned with the needs of the plaintiff, but with the responsibility of the defendant.  Even though the defendant meets little or none of the cost, he must be blamed in some circumstances.  In assessing the merits of a system where the plaintiff's needs do not count as a trigger for payment, and where the defendant does not pay the bill, one has to bear in mind the various other mechanisms society has put in place to meet sudden and extraordinary needs.  There are some fine examples of that. Social welfare, pay related insurance and private schemes are based on the concept of individuals grouping together to form a common fund to which each has recourse in time of need.  The only difference between those systems and compensation cases is that the purse strings are not in the hands of highly paid professionals who make their living by determining access to the money and extracting a percentage.</P>
    <P>For example if a child deprived of oxygen at birth becomes profoundly handicapped as a result, it will impose an emotional, physical and financial burden on those charged with responsibility for its care for the foreseeable future.  If nobody is to blame for this accident, the family in question and the State must meet this challenge. If a doctor or a hospital can be found responsible, an award of damages will be made. The cost of the future care of the child will shift from the State, funded by the taxpayer, to a medical insurance company.  Most of the premia paid to this company are paid by the State while the <Col N="1623" /> rest are made up from charges paid by the general public.</P>
    <P>I do not argue that a child in such circumstances is not entitled to the best possible care or that the parents are not entitled to every assistance. Why, however, should the provision of this care and assistance be contingent on finding fault?  Why is there such a radical difference between the services the State would supply to such a family from Exchequer funding and those which could be afforded by the insurance company managing the fund premia?  Regardless of the route, the money comes from the public.  Do we, whether we are paying as taxpayers or consumers of insurance goods and services, really want some needs to be met in full and others to be met on an inadequate basis simply because nobody can be found at fault?</P>
    <P>What is at issue is the fairness of the system and its efficiency.  The issue is not new.  The merits of no fault insurance have been accepted in several jurisdictions and, as a result, the large increases in premia required to fund litigation can be modulated.  This is now generally supported by the medical profession, notwithstanding the importance medical personnel attach to their reputations.  They are still prepared to disregard that importance in exchange for the efficiencies and improvements which would result and which would not damage the customer.  There should be a serious examination, on the basis of efficiency and effectiveness, of State funded, no fault insurance in such discrete areas as medical malpractice and industrial and road traffic accidents. In the meantime, we depend on the courts.</P>
    <P>It is a truism that litigation is now confined to the very rich and the very poor.  The middle classes cannot afford to get involved.  The poor are given a free ride through the legal system. This is not provided by the State, with us as taxpayers, but by the insurance companies, with us as policyholders and consumers.</P>
    <P>A litigant with personal injuries will be told by the local legal aid centre that it will not take the action since any private firm of solicitors will take it instead.  The private solicitor and his or her barrister will operate on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis.  If the case is unsuccessful, the defendant's insurance company will not pursue an individual with no means for its costs.  These become part of the costs of running the insurance company and are reflected in increased premia.  In such circumstances, small cases develop a nuisance value where it is simply not worth the defendant's time and energy to contest a case, so small amounts are paid to plaintiffs simply to send them away. Again, the increased expense is borne by the public.</P>
    <P>Litigation does not work to the public benefit when it is entered into recklessly by those who are not taking risks with their own money.  In some jurisdictions where the State subvents public injury cases, the legal aid board or centre will assess the prospects of success and refuse to finance <Col N="1624" /> cases which are of dubious merit.  In such jurisdictions, private lawyers who fund litigation from their own resources with a view to taking a share of the profits might encounter rules which would forbid such practices as contrary to public policy.</P>
    <P>In this country, one might suspect that at least some of those involved in personal injury litigation adopt a scatter gun approach where the merits of each individual case is less than the number of writs issued.  On a statistical or actuarial basis, if one puts enough of these cases through one's hands, one simply cannot lose.  It is similar to being the bookie on the racecourse. One can see the risk and work out the odds and, if the numbers are adequately large, one must profit.  If the numbers are too small, one might come out at the wrong side of probability, but if one can increase the numbers, one is on a winner.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude with a few remarks about the legal profession.  It has a history of being a worthy and worthwhile profession and, to a great extent, it has served the Irish public well.  The Minister was correct to draw attention to the good name of the profession, which has been seriously damaged by the activities of a relatively small number of solicitors.  A good example of those activities were the advertisements which Deputy Higgins quoted in his contribution.  At one level, one could view them as appalling but at another they were so outrageous they were funny.</P>
    <P>On a serious note, it is a dreadful and nauseating form of touting for business which one would associate with the more grotesque huckster shops. Any profession which tolerates such practices must seriously consider its position because they are undoubtedly doing it a serious disservice. However, these solicitors would not be in business or publishing such advertisements if there were no compensation culture.  If the advertisements did not generate business, they would cease to be published in a relatively short time.</P>
    <P>The compensation culture which has developed is one of the nastier aspects of our present prosperity. Years ago, when Irish people were not so well off, they had a feeling for the common good and a sense of social obligation.  Their sense of community led them to understand that money in compensation cases came from somewhere, probably from somebody who did not live far from them.  In other words, they were aware the money came from the people who lived in the same community. In a society dominated by individualism it is easy to understand how the compensation culture can come to prominence and why people are willing to avail of it.  To a large extent, it arose from Thatcherism which facilitated that type of society.</P>
    <P>I also wonder about the awards made by the Judiciary in these cases.  I do not want to take the easy option of attacking the Judiciary in this debate.  However, some of the awards made by the courts must give rise to questions.  The problems in this area might have been addressed if <Col N="1625" /> adequate data were available about the size of awards, the circumstances surrounding them and so forth.  There is a need for a coherent method of gathering statistics and information on the courts within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Minister would not accept amendments to impose an obligation on the new courts agency to gather statistics, but I hope the agency will do it anyway on its own initiative.  The information would be extremely useful.</P>
    <P>The other ugly aspect of the compensation culture is the practice of defensive professionalism by medical personnel, engineers and other professionals. A defensive professional service is now supplied to the public.  In medicine it results in doctors carrying out tests and gathering samples and information which they know are not necessary on the basis of reasonable and sensible behaviour.  However, they must take into account how they would fare on the witness stand if confronted by a barrister asking why they did not carry out the tests.  Defensive professional practice is a disservice to the public, whose members generally have to endure sufficient invasive medicine because doctors must cover the risk of a compensation claim.</P>
    <P>In the case of agencies such as Government Departments and local authorities, one is inclined to wonder in what type of funny world they lived while this compensation culture grew.  People in Dublin city organised crashes and accidents in order to claim compensation.  It might not have been part of the duties of public officials in these agencies to be aware of that, but anybody out and about in the world should have seen what was going on.  It is a great pity that was allowed to continue for a long time.  If the information had been gathered, it would have been possible to see there were families which had an exceptional level of risk.  The local authority or the State should have wrapped them in cotton wool or placed them in a padded environment where they could not do themselves any more injuries.  It seemed as if their cars were attracted to drains and the like.  Unfortunately, large sums of money were paid out.</P>
    <P>Some of this also arose from what many would see as the old political business of engagement, shrill adversarialism, kicking again to the lowest common denominator.  It involved lots of shouting and aggression.  It was as if life was a game of football or a boxing contest.  All of us, not just in our profession but in some of the other professions should be a little more thoughtful, consider where this is taking us and maybe make some modifications to our behaviour.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope it deals with all the issues.  I have some concerns in relation to its capacity, or the capacity of any Bill, to deal effectively with all the concerns.  Some of the difficulties it is trying to address arise from the nature of society and the values which currently exist.  I would be particularly concerned with the para-legal folk who operate at a distance from law, but at the same time are carrying out similar activities <Col N="1626" /> to the advertisements.  I hope the Bill also adequately tackles and eliminates their activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to follow on from the last fine contribution.  The two previous speakers made fine contributions.  I welcome the Bill which raises the issue of the manner in which an important profession, the legal profession, relates to society.</P>
      <P>The Bill is long overdue.  As Deputy Upton stated, in many respects we must blame the Oireachtas for the ills we are now addressing.  A few years ago these changes were forced on the legal profession in the belief that practices within that profession were so bad we had to create a marketplace, and we created a monster.  In recent years the legal profession has become debased by the activities of some of its members while the legal profession as a whole has served the country well.  Sadly, a proportion of the members of that profession are not serving their profession, their clients or their country well.  They are debasing the profession and destroying society.  They are pandering to greed and to the lowest elements in society.</P>
      <P>One need only look at the <i>Golden Pages</i> to see some of the extraordinary lengths to which some members of the profession have gone to tout for business.  Deputy Higgins referred to one or two interesting examples.  The excesses of these pages give a measure of the breakdown of the profession's capacity to regulate itself.</P>
      <P>This will not be the last time I will address the question of a profession's capacity to regulate itself.  There can be no doubt the legal profession has lost much of its esteem.  There can be no doubt ambulance chasing solicitors, their activities and the advertisements which adorn the national press and the <i>Golden Pages</i> have contributed in no small way to the diminution of the profession's status.  Touting for business in the most outrageous way has become the virtual norm.  Unfortunately, one can see from the advertisements that some fine old legal firms are now engaged in the same process.  They have decided they might as well go with the herd, otherwise they will be left behind.</P>
      <P>Some of the most peculiar professional services are on offer in the <i>Golden Pages.</i>  On pages 1309 to 1352 there is an exotic array of services on offer which are not pervaded by legal firms in any other country.  These include pavement specialists, falling in public places specialists, hearing specialists and so on.  It is bizarre.  Deputy Higgins pointed out the latest of this exotic array, the asbestos claims specialists.  It is nauseous.  Full page display advertisements offer all sorts of bizarre arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Virtually every one of these companies advertise their services as being available on a free first consultation basis.  As we are all aware, the free first consultation is less intended as a service to the potential client than as a means of cherry-picking cases.  Deputy Upton is correct.  If one can <Col N="1627" /> build up the case law, the probability is that one will make a mighty big hit.</P>
    <P>The problem which has arisen in recent years is one of greed.  There can be no doubt Ireland is gripped by a compensation culture.  On the one hand, there is the greed of those in the profession who are willing to tout services, drum up business and encourage spurious claims, offering compensation on the basis that there will be no problem getting it and, as Deputy Higgins quoted from an advertisement, there will be no embarrassment because they will fix up outside the court.  The previous two speakers are correct.  Public authorities which do not challenge spurious cases have a great deal to answer for.</P>
    <P>Moral or ethical questions for the client or for the solicitors' firms do not really arise in these cases.  It is sad that many people are willing to chance taking a case, no matter how weak, in the hope that they will enjoy a windfall.  I remember the late John O'Connor once telling me in UCD many years ago that the best thing that could happen to an Irish person was to have a little road accident and not be killed or maimed, but have enough to leave a mark because one would make a few shillings from it.  Unfortunately, that attitude to road injuries which existed ten years ago has escalated to cover almost everything which can happen in the State.  Far too many people in modern Ireland adopt a flexible moral attitude when it comes to the issue of compensation.  They do not see it as theft, because that is what it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton was correct in stating that the courts have some contribution to make.  All too often substantial compensation claims have been agreed on the most tenuous of claims.  The idea of an Army bandsman making a substantial claim because somebody tooted a trumpet in his ear ten years ago begs the question why everyone who operates in a disco is not queuing up at the High Court seeking compensation.  While some cases are rejected and others are reversed on appeal, these are a distinct minority.</P>
    <P>Besides solicitors and their clients, and occasionally judges, the Law Society has a great deal to answer for.  It is the body charged with governing the solicitors' profession.  By any objective standard, it has failed.  This failure is not peculiar to the Law Society because we, as a society, allow this professional body to involve itself in self-regulation.  In reality, self-regulation does not work.  One cannot be judge and jury in one's own case and that also applies to the Law Society.  The current increase in compensation claims and the evidence that many solicitor firms actively encourage spurious compensation claims is a breach of the ethical standards of the profession and it is also a clear measure of the failure of self-regulation.</P>
    <P>This is not, however, the most important evidence that self-regulation does not work.  There are far more serious examples.  I will outline one case to prove that self-regulation does not work and to suggest to this Minister, as I have to previous <Col N="1628" /> Ministers, that we need to have a serious root and branch examination of this matter.  The dogs on the street know that some solicitors tout for business in a manner which shows they do not care from where the business comes, yet one would search long and hard to find public evidence of effective action taken against firms of solicitors which have stepped over the mark by their own professional guardians.  Everybody in Dublin knows the firms which specialise in doubtful cases.  Like the population as a whole, the Law Society must be aware of the evidence on this issue.  Its members read the papers and gossip is plentiful in Blackhall Place and in the Law Library, yet there is no evidence that anything has been done to enforce an acceptable standard of professional behaviour on any legal firm which has behaved in a manner which, by any standard, is outside the norm.  Money talks and in this business it speaks at least as eloquently as it does in other businesses.  The Law Society has a responsibility not just to society but to the many decent firms and solicitors which it counts among its members, but has failed to fulfil its responsibility to its members or to society.  If the failure of the Law Society to do anything to curb the excesses in the manner of advertising was the only failure of self-regulation, I would not be as concerned.  It is not the only example of self-regulation failure, there are many others.  I give the example of one case which has been through the courts and has been the subject of a very fine judgment of the Supreme Court.  It illustrates the problems with this profession.</P>
    <P>In the extraordinary case <i>Doran v. Maguire</i> a series of events were unravelled.  Over a period of eight years a young couple has been denied a house and a home because of the gross professional incompetence and behaviour of a number of solicitor firms.  This couple has lost everything. They first petitioned the High Court, then the Supreme Court and then went back to the High Court to seek justice and restitution for their loss.</P>
    <P>As the facts of this case have been well publicised elsewhere, I do not need to dwell on them. However, a degree of detail is necessary because it illustrates the extent to which self-regulation of the legal system has failed.  It also illustrates the need for an independent oversight on this and other professions.</P>
    <P>In this case the couple bought a site which turned out to be land locked and it was not possible to obtain planning permission.  Even if planning permission had been forthcoming they would not have been allowed to build because of an existing legal dispute.  When the solicitor for this young couple requested the vendor's solicitor for requisition of title on the matter of any outstanding law case, his queries were dealt with in a manner which can best be described as careless. In response to questions as to whether there was any outstanding disputes on the land in question, the reply given was &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  This is a gross dereliction <Col N="1629" /> of duty.  It was a breach of the standards which the Law Society prescribes.</P>
    <P>To the great credit of the Supreme Court, in a very fine judgment handed down recently it found unanimously that the vendor's solicitors had a responsibility not just to their clients, but to the purchaser to provide full and accurate information.  That did not happen in this case. Because it did not happen, almost nine years after the events in question, that family is still living in rented accommodation and still waiting to get a home of their own.  The children of that marriage have grown up moving from one rented place to another while they wait for justice.</P>
    <P>The real problem in this case is that the Law Society, to which the Legislature has given responsibility for controlling the activities of solicitors, is the same body which is charged with defending the interests of solicitors.  It is fulfilling a dual role.  It has always been my belief that it is impossible for any profession to fulfil the role; it cannot be done.  The State should be the regulating body and we should recognise that.  We have handed over extraordinary powers to the Law Society and to other professional bodies. This case and many others are evidence of the failure of the breakdown of self-regulation.</P>
    <P>When the most recent Solicitors Bill came before the House some years ago, I argued strongly that there is a need for a completely independent agency to control and oversee the activities of solicitors.  Solicitors are no better or worse than the rest of us.  None of us is capable of self-regulation.  We in this House are the court of the people &mdash; they will judge us.  Small shopkeepers are judged by their customers, but who judges solicitors?  We need a legal ombudsman to deal with the complaints that arise about the operations of the legal profession.  The Doran case is a good illustration of this.</P>
    <P>Before that couple could progress their action, it was necessary to find a solicitor to take their case.  That was no easy undertaking.  We all know it is not easy to find a solicitor to sue another solicitor.  In this case, as in other cases, one could go to the Law Society.  However the Law Society was not much help.  My experience, and that of other Members, has been that when one takes such a complaint, it falls on deaf ears.  The help which should come from a self-regulating body does not come.  Citizens who wish to take an action against a solicitor experience real difficulties. Members can search the <i>Golden Pages</i> but they will not find a solicitor who specialises in suing solicitors because that is the one taboo area they are not willing to enter.</P>
    <P>Inevitably the first approach of the Law Society is a defensive reaction.  I understand that because the society is a trade union for its members.  It does not produce any evidence that the society is overly anxious to become involved in patrolling the activities of members against whom complaints are made.  It is wrong that people have to trawl the streets looking for a solicitor to undertake an action against one of their own kind.  In <Col N="1630" /> such cases, it is no exaggeration to suggest that the courts are not always as sympathetic to the plaintiff as they should be.  In the Doran case there was a reprehensible and unforgivable delay in the court action which heaped injustice upon injustice.  It would not have been necessary for this couple to go before the formal process of the courts if a reasonable and rational arbitration system had been in operation.  It should not have been necessary for particular issues to go before the courts because the Law Society has prescribed high-handed conveyancing.  If there is an issue of fact, and one which is clearly misrepresented, it is obvious that those who suffer the tort must be compensated.  It should not have been necessary for an Irish couple and their children to put their lives on hold for eight years while they sought justice and went to the Law Society and then through the courts system.</P>
    <P>In this case two separate firms of solicitors made serious mistakes at the outset.  In spite of these errors, problems could and should have been resolved with relative ease.  If an effective and independent complaints mechanism had been in place which would have been able to establish the facts, this problem could have been resolved in a short time without any great expense.</P>
    <P>The Dorans went to the Law Society, the society that regulates.  They were told to take their problem to a solicitor and were given a list of six solicitors.  Their contracts with these firms failed to produce results.  When they encountered difficulties in getting a solicitor they went back to the Law Society.  Telephone calls were made, messages were left, the official &mdash; whom I will not name &mdash; responsible in the Law Society did not get back to them.  Following more telephone calls, more rejections, the Dorans were lucky to find a young and good solicitor who was willing to take on what seemed an impossible case.  To his great credit he brought that case to the High Court and to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Another side of the legal establishment is the solicitors mutual defence fund, an august body, that has much clout.  That body provides cover for the profession.  It took two years and three months from the time the proceedings were initiated to get that case into the High Court.  If the Dorans thought an end of their troubles was in view at that stage, they were wrong.  It took a further 23 months to get a judgment from the High Court, but there was more to come.  The Dorans decided to take the third point of their case to the Supreme Court.  Before their case could go before the Supreme Court they had to wait 29 months.  Some of that delay arose because the defending solicitors, acting on behalf of the mutual fund, would not agree with all the evidence before the Supreme Court.  The biggest delay arose because of the failure of a judge in the High Court case to produce his report for the Supreme Court.  I do not want to get into a controversy, but a High Court judge in England recently had to take a hike because he delayed a case for 18 months.  With all the delays, it took <Col N="1631" /> little short of seven years before that case commenced in the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court found in favour of the Dorans in each and every point raised in their case.  The judgment is a great credit to the Supreme Court.  In its judgment, the court was very critical of the standards of practice of the solicitors involved in the case.  One judge commented as follows: &ldquo;They ought to have known that the information they were passing on was neither the truth nor the whole truth&rdquo;.  I read with great interest the response from the Law Society to that.  It is an astonishing indictment of a firm of solicitors.  In stark contrast to the High Court, the judgment of the three Supreme Court judges took slightly less than one month to deliver.</P>
    <P>By any objective reading, this case and many other similar cases, point to a systems failure of cataclysmic proportions which can destroy people seeking justice.  I have argued long and hard for better State regulation of professions.  In this profession we need a fair, independent and statutorily established legal ombudsman.  The point will be made that we have a legal ombudsman of sorts and an adjudicator who was recently appointed under the 1997 regulations.  An ombudsman should be appointed by statute, be independent and seen to be independent, be capable of receiving direct complaints from the public, be a high level public official with investigative capacity, and above all completely separate from the agency he or she seeks to oversee.  An ombudsman must also have powers to ensure findings are followed up, and the term &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo; suggests the office should be directly related to parliament. We have abdicated our responsibilities in this regard, because we have given statutory powers to self-regulate to this and other professional groups.  It is a parliamentary failure that we do not put in place the same overseeing provisions we have created in the ombudsman legislation.</P>
    <P>This is not to labour the point.  An adjudicator was appointed under the solicitors' adjudicators regulations of 1987; he is appointed and funded by the Law Society.  He is a fine and independent individual but there is no direct access to him by a member of the public who has a complaint. Anyone offended by the operations of a solicitor's firm has first to progress through the Law Society before the case can be heard.</P>
    <P>The Doran case and the issues we discuss here indicate a high level of systemic failure.  I welcome this legislation, but it is only the first step on a long journey.  I commend the Bill, but ask the Minister to urgently turn his mind to a full, independent, statutorily created, overseeing body &mdash; in other words, a legal ombudsman &mdash; which is something we require.</P>

      <P>Deputy Roche's points about the ombudsman are valid.  A danger evident in the debate so far is that it is argued, on one hand, that a professional body is above reproach by virtue of its nature and cannot be treated as a commercial body would be and, on the other, that being a solicitor is purely a commercial business and the rules which apply should not be other than the normal rules of commercial transaction. I hate the term &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo;, but the idea that the holder of that office should draw his or her authority from the Oireachtas is a sound one.</P>
      <P>I have mixed feelings about this Bill, although I support it.  The principle of permitting solicitors to advertise is generally progressive.  Anything which leads to competition should benefit the consumer and should be maintained, particularly in a profession not renowned for its competitiveness. There is also a public information aspect to this question.  Not long ago, thousands of married women won the right to equality payments, at least in part due to the opening up of the legal profession to the use of advertisements.  These were used to inform people as well as to promote services and those women have reason to be grateful to the legislation we are now setting out to amend.  When a Fianna Fáil Minister for Social Welfare was fighting these women tooth and nail, solicitors were essential in supporting them. Although it took the appointment of Deputy De Rossa as Minister to deliver the equality payments, after years of governmental stonewalling, solicitors representing the women played a significant part in informing them of their rights and in ensuring a happy ending to the story.</P>
      <P>It is therefore welcome that the Bill controls rather than abolishes advertising.  Its concentration is on personal injuries and it sets out to eliminate the aggressive style of advertising much beloved of the ambulance chasing solicitor.  We have all seen these advertisements, the seductive lines of &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo;, insurance cover to protect against failure, and the high number of cases settled before reaching court.  The message is directed at a public which needs no encouragement to exercise its right to litigation &mdash; compared to many other countries we are a highly litigious society.  In the area of personal injuries we have almost made it a national pastime; one of my colleagues said it is the only real effort made by Ireland towards redistribution of wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the insurance implications, there is a social cost which must be underlined, and this feature of Irish life cannot be ignored.  The absence or loss of public facilities is often a direct result of personal injury claims.  Many campaigns for improved facilities have foundered on the rock of public liability.  Young parents seeking to have public playground facilities provided by their local authority have frequently been frustrated by the obstacle presented by the threat of personal injury claims.  The other aspect is that local authorities have been found to be gravely at fault in a range of their responsibilities, where the only recourse open to the public was to take them <Col N="1633" /> to court.  However, when it comes to personal injuries claims, experience has shown that there are unscrupulous solicitors who want to take advantage of current circumstances, and that reflects unfairly on a profession which generally maintains good standards.</P>
    <P>The principle of advertising services is valid and provided for in the Bill.  It is, however, curtailed in a number of ways, some of which are self-evident but others of which deserve comment. While the principles are laid down in the Bill, the regulations governing them will be determined by the Law Society.  It is in the public interest to know the criteria the society will use in determining these regulations.  For example, what is likely to bring the solicitor's profession into disrepute?  What is &ldquo;bad taste&ldquo;?  I am not sure anyone in this House could provide a definition. Taste is a subjective matter, dependent on one's outlook and life experience, and may change over a lifespan.  Many commercial advertisements prize themselves on being in bad taste. Will the Law Society take into account future changes in the public appetite to tastelessness?</P>
    <P>Most of the provisions, including that one, are already in the Solicitors Act, but I am concerned about a new provision which bans advertisements being published in inappropriate locations.  Certain of these are specified but presumably other unspecified ones are also included.  Even taking into account those specified, I can think of instances where the subsection could be too restrictive.  For example, a funeral home is often a place where a bereaved family receives advice and guidance about many aspects of the bereavement. A suitable listing of local solicitors would be an asset in giving advice and dealing with people in a funeral home.  I do not agree with the Minister that this would be harmful &mdash; what is at issue is how an advertisement is prepared, not its location.  Many people do not have contact with a solicitor and would not know where to find one until they experience a bereavement.  Doctors' waiting rooms have a form of televised advertising which solicitors use, and that too will be banned under the Bill.  This is not necessary because such advertising is not doing much harm &mdash; it may not be doing much good either but that is a separate issue.</P>
    <P>More particularly, many local bodies, organisations and services depend on advertising to survive and expect solicitors to play their part in supporting them.  Where will they stand?  This could affect schools seeking advertisements for journals, football clubs, chambers of commerce, doctors' information sheets and organisations raising funds for charities.  It is not clear whether these means of advertising would be considered inappropriate locations.  The publication may be located in a school or medical or sports centre. This may seem a small point, but it is important because it relates to a form of advertising which is local, low cost and has a significant social purpose, yet is clearly still advertising.  The offensive style of commercial advertising is on a different <Col N="1634" /> scale both in terms of content and extent.  We saw the famous advertisements on the backs of buses about the ambulance chasing solicitors.  They have all taken advantage of the current situation.</P>
    <P>The Army deafness claims were the stimulus for the Government to draft this Bill.  However, there is a danger of hypocrisy in this regard.  It ill becomes Departments to blame solicitors for promoting themselves, when they are culpable for not preventing hearing loss in the first place.  This is costing the taxpayer a fortune.</P>
    <P>The feeding frenzy does not reflect well on solicitors. In one case it was reported that a video was produced by a member of the legal profession to train litigants for cross examinations.  I understand there was no clear evidence of this but it attracted media attention.  It highlights the need for the Law Society or the Bar Council to have clear control mechanisms which are accessible and which work when such queries arise.</P>
    <P>A customer friendly service requires a quick and responsive appeal system when a dispute arises.  However, that does not exist at present. Deputy Roche mentioned the case in my constituency which raises the question of who puts things right when they go wrong.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there is a correlation between the introduction of advertising in the US and the reduction in the status of the legal profession in the public's eyes.  I do not know if that is true.  People both inside and outside this House are a little sanctimonious about it.  I believe it has more to do with the cost of fees.  The establishment of the Flood Tribunal, which was of national interest, was delayed because the legal teams were not getting the fees they wanted.  When the fees were agreed as a compromise, they were phenomenal compared to the average industrial wage.  People had great difficulty understanding how such fees could be justified and they began to wonder if people were worth such large amounts of money.  I am not taking away from the good work done by solicitors, but we must not become tied up in the mystique of the profession as that is not in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The stimulus which led to advertising by solicitors was based on a free market approach, which has grave limitations.  Advertising confirms the principle that what is on offer is just a service for which people pay and are paid.  For too long the mystique of the profession has served to cloud the public's understanding of that fact.  In a modern climate in which democracy applies in all types of ways which would have been unheard of in the past, there is a danger of patronising the public.  In a world where advertising plays such a major role, I am convinced the public is sophisticated enough to make its own judgments on what is real and what is show.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  For many years there was a debate about how solicitors could advertise their services when a strict code of practice was in <Col N="1635" /> existence.  The first measures to relax this regime were introduced in 1988.  The Solicitors Act, 1994, allowed for the almost total removal of restrictions on advertising of services by solicitors. These measures were imposed on the Law Society by the Government of the day and were driven to a large degree by Deputy O'Malley and the Progressive Democrats.  They opened the advertising floodgates and fuelled the ambulance chasing activities of a small number of solicitors who gave the profession a bad name.</P>
      <P>These imposed changes may have brought about the compensation culture which seems to be so prevalent.  One cannot move without the threat of legal action and local authorities are crippled by the huge claims lodged against them. The Law Society and individual solicitors pointed out at the time that this would be the likely outcome of these measures but, unfortunately, their calls fell on deaf ears.  They were forced into the situation in which they now find themselves. Those who promoted the liberalisation of the code of advertising at that time got it totally wrong.</P>
      <P>I agree in general with the contents of this Bill but I have some queries to which I hope the Minister will respond.  Much power and authority is vested in the Law Society.  It has done a good job over the years in monitoring the activities of its members and it has exercised a control appropriate to this profession.  I have contacted the Law Society on a number of occasions since being elected to this House and I found it to be helpful and efficient.  The Minister quoted from a former President of the Law Society, Mr. Thomas Shaw, who is a practising solicitor of J.A. Shaw and Company in Mullingar.  He paid tribute to his work in compiling a code of conduct for solicitors.</P>
      <P>I note that this Bill gives the Law Society the power to classify solicitors as having expertise in specific areas of law.  Perhaps the Minister could indicate if such expertise will be measured by the Law Society.  Will the years a solicitor has worked in a specific area of law be considered?  Will further studies in areas of law qualify them as experts?  Will the expertise of someone who has worked for years on cases at the coalface in the Law Courts be recognised?  Will the successful handling of cases in a particular area warrant such accreditation?  Will experts be scattered throughout the country or will they be restricted to the Dublin area?  Will solicitors apply for such accreditation to the Law Society or will they be awarded credits at the behest of the Law Society?  What system of transparency will be put in place to ensure that genuine experts are identified and get the necessary accreditation?  These queries were brought to my attention by solicitors who feel that too much control may be given to the Law Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend Deputy Roche for what he said tonight.  He outlined a situation, which sounded intolerable, in which a couple from County Wicklow <Col N="1636" /> found themselves.  The people responsible for that have a great deal for which to answer.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister has missed an opportunity to put into law measures related to conveyancing, which is an important aspect of solicitors work.  A solicitor handling a conveyancing case between a father and a son is expected to advise his clients that independent legal advice should be obtained by them.  I wonder if this happens.  Does a solicitor say to his clients that he must send one of them to someone else to get expert advice or are such dealings handled by the same solicitor or the same practice?  This has led to many difficulties and it should have been outlawed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Solicitors are prohibited from working for a builder and a purchaser on the same conveyancing case.  Is that regulation always adhered to?  Is it right that a solicitor may represent a purchaser and a builder in the same case?  That is not supposed to happen, but it does and it is an ideal case in which gazumping could occur.  Is it possible that a solicitor could work for two masters at the one time?  Was this not an ideal opportunity for the Minister to introduce into law restrictions on this type of practice?  Restrictions on such practices are laid down by the Law Society, but what does it say to a solicitor who is found to have practised in this way?  It cannot even be declared that he or she operated in an unprofessional manner.  In effect, there is no real prohibition or penalty imposed on solicitors who act in this way.  It is regrettable the Minister did not consider it appropriate to include a provision in the Bill to restrict this unprofessional behaviour in which a small number of solicitors engage.</P>

      <P>Advertising by solicitors was permitted initially on the basis that it would allow market forces to rule as against fees, but all it did was lead to increasingly daft forms of litigation.  Do we want to live in a society where advertisements from solicitors peer at us from the back of buses, stare down at us from hoardings or shriek at us from the radio?</P>
      <P>It took people a long time to realise there is no such thing as a free lunch.  Maybe they will also realise that there is no such thing as a free first consultation.  Solicitors advise us that we do not fall anymore, we are caused to slip.  Everybody now suffers loss, damage and expenses.  Many of these advertisements inform us of problems we did not know we had and of pains from which we did not know we suffered.  They have prompted us into believing somebody else is to blame for our carelessness, that somebody else is responsible and, more importantly, that somebody else will pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently published edition of the <i>Golden Pages</i> contains 44 pages of solicitors in the Dublin area alone.  Instead of the usual one line entry, <Col N="1637" /> there are full page advertisements that make outlandish statements.  They speak to the person directly, stating, &ldquo;You've had an accident.  There is pain, disruption and financial distress.  Talk to us.&rdquo; Another one offers &ldquo;home/hospital visits for the elderly or the seriously injured&rdquo;.  Is one's solicitor one of the people one would like to count among one's closest friends and family when lying in a hospital bed?  The same solicitor may visit one in the cemetery because he or she also deals with &ldquo;accidents that involve death&rdquo;.  Others deal with &ldquo;injuries at work&rdquo; and claim they will get their clients &ldquo;compensation for damage to their promotional prospects, real or imagined&rdquo;.  They will all help in the event of a slip and fall.  If a person slips and falls surely he or she is responsible, but the advertisements would have us believe somebody else can be blamed for the fall. Do we want to live in a society where every incident must have an author with a deep pocket or an insurance company behind him or her?  I am pleased this Bill curtails that type of advertising. It will not mean the end of solicitors' advertising, but it will introduce a level of standard into such advertising.</P>
    <P>I hope it will not constitute the end of the Minister's endeavours on litigation on the modern law of negligence, which is one of the main questions at issue.  In 1932 a snail in an opaque ginger beer bottle in England gave rise to the law of negligence. It is time that snail was put back in its shell.  I commend the judge who, in a court in Dublin yesterday, decided that, unlike that snail in the ginger beer bottle, a fly in a bottle was not worth the £400 sought, that it was worth only £1.</P>
    <P>Public bodies have been impoverished by the ever increasing frontiers of the laws of negligence. The real losers in society are the ordinary citizens because money that could be used in the provision of cre ches, libraries, playgrounds, playing fields, roads, footpaths, etc.  is spent in ever increasing amounts on the defence of increasingly questionable litigation.  New words such as &ldquo;nuisance value&rdquo; have entered our vocabulary and replaced the old expression of blackmail.  If we put the growth in the law of negligence to the acid test, who would have benefited?  Would it be the population in general or a selected few?  Among those selected few, how many would be lawyers?  The old common law maxim <i>de minimius non curat lex</i> seems to have gone out of fashion.  Now every stubbed toe, cracked finger nail and grazed knee must give rise to an action. Even gravity has gone out of fashion.  People no longer fall as a result of gravity.  They fall as a result of negligence, breach of duty, breach of statutory duty or the nearest insured entity, their servants or agents.  It is great work if one can get it, but is it good for society?</P>
    <P>In curtailing solicitor advertising the Bill takes a tentative step towards reintroducing the concept of fairness into the marketing of elements of the legal profession.  This tentative step is welcome, but a much greater stride is needed.  The constitutional right to bodily integrity, which was <Col N="1638" /> envisaged by de Valera as being necessary to protect life and limb from unlawful and malicious assault, is now called for in the aid of the comely maidens who have consumed too much alcopop and who have twisted their ankles in perceived potholes at the crossroads.  Hordes of athletic youths now hobble the streets in pursuit of increased damages as a result of encountering a fallen leaf to which the local authority had failed to attend immediately on its demise.  The law of negligence is not an ass, it is a dragon scorching all who fall in its path.</P>
    <P>Removing solicitors' advertisements from the hoardings, the backs of buses, the radio, hospitals, funeral homes and the cemeteries may be a first step, but the law that allows suits of this nature ought to be the real target of this legislation.  I look forward to that being the next focus of our attention.</P>

      <P>When the previous Bill on this matter was introduced I said I hoped it would resolve some of problems in this area.  It was said at that time that the advent of competition would ensure equity prevailed and that an even balance was assured.  I agree with many of the previous speakers in the sense that the legislation had the opposite effect.  There is also negative competition where everyone competes to the extent that there is a downward spiral and instead of equity, fair play and equality, we get the reverse.  There is evidence to suggest that we have moved to the fore in terms of identifying who is negligent and who should pay for the negligence.</P>
      <P>A young person who fell on a bus some time ago told me her friend saw it happen.  I asked if she was hurt, but that was not important; what was important was that her friend saw her fall. The implications of that are that from the moment such an incident occurs, a train of events are set in motion which will ultimately result in compensation.</P>
      <P>The Bill may have to be revisited.  I am not sure it will resolve existing problems.  However, I accept that it is necessary to address the areas where obvious abuses are taking place and where latitude is allowed to such an extent that the law is being tested in respect of almost every issue. We must emphasise the issue of balance.  There are those who suggest with a certain degree of accuracy that some people might not gain access to courts if it were not for the fact that a number of solicitors are prepared to operate on a &ldquo;no win no fee&rdquo; basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will be aware of cases where individual constituents might have had to take a large institution or major corporation to court.  What chance does an individual have of taking on a major corporation or of successfully engaging legal representation to help him to do so if he does do not have the resources to go to court in the first instance?  There are those who cynically state that gaining access to the courts does not necessarily mean one will obtain justice.  That is true because the only thing one can ever obtain <Col N="1639" /> in a court is the application of the law.  However, the presumption is that some measure of justice will be dispensed in the course of its being applied.  In recent years, considerable evidence has emerged which suggests that it was necessary to ensure that people without adequate resources were able to gain access to the legal system.  In that context, some people have begun to treat the system as something of a game and they are abusing it.  To be fair, it is not entirely the fault of solicitors that the system is being abused.</P>
    <P>In cases where solicitors may go through the motions of enabling people to bring forward frivolous claims, professional pride usually comes to the fore.  In such circumstances all that is important is who will emerge victorious.  By the same token, the courts are the final arbiters and are responsible for making decisions.  It is on the basis of established case law that subsequent cases are followed through and the kind of matters to which Members referred have emerged.</P>
    <P>We do not have to dig very deep to discover how this system operates.  It operates on the simple basis that if a person goes to court and his claim succeeds in a particular circumstances, the law on negligence comes into play and if the offending party is deemed to have been, is or continues to be negligent the case must be answered. Several Members put forward the reverse of that argument and there are considerable grounds to support their case.  For example, following changes a number of years ago, it has become legally acceptable for solicitors to advertise the range of their services to the general public. However, they do not merely arrange their services in order of importance for the public's perusal, they immediately illustrate examples to ensure that people will be attracted to the services on offer.  Having read an advertisement in a newspaper or magazine which stated that they could be successful in a claim against a local authority, the Electricity Supply Board or a range of other utility services, what person in his right mind could turn down the opportunity to gain a few quid if it would not cost him anything?</P>
    <P>When the trimmings are stripped away, we must ask whether a person would normally state he was above such behaviour, that he would not make any attempt to achieve a personally beneficial settlement &mdash; even though it would not cost him anything to do so &mdash; or that he would not follow the example of others and would set his own instead.  There are people who do that, but they are fewer and further between than heretofore.  By the same token, the numbers of those of the other variety are on the increase.  I do not blame individuals, I blame the methodology which allows people to proceed with frivolous claims.</P>
    <P>The regulations laid down to govern particular types of claims must be considered.  I do not know the extent to which that will be done during the deliberations on the Bill.  It is generally accepted that a twisted ankle is worth £4,500 to £5,000 in <Col N="1640" /> compensation or that if a car lightly bumps another at a set of traffic lights it might be worth up to £9,000.  This is similar to the &ldquo;knock for knock&rdquo; system operated by insurance companies and legal advisers where a person involved in a minor car accident may be threatened with having cover withdrawn by the insurance company if he does not settle.  That shows no regard for whether a person was in the right.  To speed up the process and ensure rapid settlements, people are threatened with the withdrawal of their insurance cover if they do not comply with the wishes of the insurance companies.  That is a strange way to do business.  People should recognise that, as consumers, individuals and citizens, they have the right to defend themselves in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>There should not be a rule of thumb whereby every person who falls, slips or slides can assume he will be automatically paid compensation.  A number of years ago a local community operated a children's playground which had proven to be very successful.  However, the community was not in a position to fund its ongoing costs and it was decided that the local authority should assume responsibility for it.  The playground changed hands on a Friday evening and on the following Monday morning the county manager could barely gain entry to his office because his way was blocked by a stack of claims which had arrived over the weekend.  That is a sad reflection and it is clearly an indication that people knew that a powerful body such as a local authority would be in a position to pay out money in a way which would not normally be expected.</P>
    <P>Problems exist in this area.  It is not a question of fairness, it is merely that there is a recognition that public authorities and similar bodies are more responsible than anyone else when accidents occur and that they are 100 per cent liable whether or not they are at fault.  We must consider how a balance can be achieved.  I have already referred to the two extremes &mdash; the first, where there is rapid access to a system which can be ultimately abused, and the second, where a certain group of underprivileged people may not gain access to the system.  There must be a balance, and the changes being made in the law must achieve that balance in so far as that is possible. From my perusal of the Bill, I am not so sure that will happen and we will have to revisit it over the next few years.  If possible, difficulties pinpointed by Members should be dealt with by amendment as the Bill progresses.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the laws relating to negligence.  That could become a merry-go-round because everybody can be negligent to a greater or lesser extent.  If, for example, one leaves one's car door open in traffic, that would be negligent because an unfortunate cyclist might crash into it.  At the same time, a motor cyclist speeding past traffic at high speed when the traffic is stopped would have to take some responsibility for not having due regard for other road users.  It comes back to trying to achieve a <Col N="1641" /> balance.  Only if a balance is achieved will there be satisfaction with the legislation.</P>
    <P>I hope that as a result of this legislation, or perhaps as a result of further legislation that may have to be brought on stream, there will be recognition of the necessity to achieve a balance on the one hand and, on the other, to ensure people who lack the finance to avail of the regular services of the legal profession have the opportunity of doing so.  However, we must ensure that there is no abuse.  In relation to advertising, the current parading of the available services and facilities before the public is a blatant abuse of the system. It encourages frivolous claims, and it encourages people to pursue issues in a way in which they might not ordinarily have done were it not suggested to them by way of questions in advertisements as to whether they slipped, fell or bumped their heads in the past six months, whether they suffered headache as a result, and a suggestion that even at this late stage it might be possible to achieve a very lucrative financial settlement on the basis that somebody was negligent.  If we go down that road, which we have been doing, eventually the cost of providing services generally will increase.  Local authorities, transport, telephone and electricity companies, and anybody who provides a service, will be vulnerable to continuous attack.  I hope the Bill before the House will go some way to addressing this.  The theme of what I have said is the need for balance.  If we do not have balance there will be abuse at one extreme or the other, because of a lack of access to rights or because of over-indulgence of access which is currently being engaged in by a number of people.</P>
    <P>Some things never cease to amaze me.  I remember reading about the case of an individual who had 13 or 14 unfortunate accidents.  On close examination of the individual's past, the judge in the case decided the claim was not genuine.  If a person turns up at a solicitor's office in a plaster cast, having twisted his or her ankle, and says he or she will not be able to work for three months, that is a serious issue.  It could well be that somebody is responsible for that because of negligence. It could transpire, however, that the same person had a similar accident three months previously, or that he or she had a multiplicity of accidents.  Surely the solicitor could examine the file and come to one of a number of conclusions &mdash; that the person was accident prone, that he or she was extremely unlucky and should not go out because as soon as he or she stepped out the door there was the potential for loss of life, his, hers or somebody else's, or that the person concerned was chancing his or her arm.  I have no doubt there are exceptions, that a person could have slipped and fallen into a manhole or have had various things fall on him or her 30 or 40 times. However, that is the exception rather than the rule.  The current system tends to trip up more such people than previously, particularly since insurance companies began to keep records and relate to each other what is happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> I put down a number of questions to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government relating to claims against local authorities.  I have received many replies to the effect that the Minister has no responsibility to the House in relation to these matters.  The Minister may well have no responsibility to the House, but if a serious matter arises, a Minister will have to come in and answer to the House.  It would be no harm if the Minister for the Environment and Local Government were to accept some responsibility for collating evidence on the multiplicity of claims against local authorities up and down the country.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to allow for better control of advertising by solicitors.  It deals with the nature and extent of advertising by solicitors and prohibits advertising which expressly or by implication refers to claims for damages or for personal injury.  The Bill specifies what may or may not be contained in solicitors' advertising, requires the Law Society to make regulations governing such advertising and treat contravention of the advertising provision in the Bill as misconduct by a solicitor for the purpose of the Solicitors Act and enables the society to obtain a High Court injunction prohibiting contravention of these Acts in regard to advertising and other matters concerning the conduct of solicitors.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on this Bill which is a response to growing concern about excessive advertising by some solicitors, in particular in the area of personal injuries.  The doubts which have existed about the effectiveness of existing controls have been highlighted in the Army hearing loss cases.  No one familiar with the advertising which occurred in this area can be in any doubt about the extent to which some members of the legal profession are prepared to go.</P>
      <P>The intention in the Bill is to ensure the solicitors' profession as a whole will work within a reasonable advertising code.  The actions of a few which have tended to lower respect for the profession cannot be ignored.  It is time to address the matter.</P>
      <P>In any market for a professional service, competition is based on the laws of demand and supply and the availability of information in such a market should be a reasonable and effective way to combat problems.  The legal profession provides an essential and hugely significant service to the public.  Because of the vital importance of the service there is an obligation and duty on the Minister and everyone with an input into the provision of such service to ensure solicitors are accountable and that their services are of the highest possible standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not obstruct by direct means the legitimate right of persons to seek compensation or redress for substantial genuine injuries sustained. Any attempt to do so should be strongly opposed by all fair-minded persons.  If a person sustains, as a result of the wilful or careless action <Col N="1643" /> of another, a significant injury which causes physical or mental disability, he or she is entitled to seek redress for serious impairment of the quality of his or her life.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to amend section 71 of the Solicitors Act, 1954, to provide for stricter controls on advertising by solicitors, particularly in respect of personal injuries.  The Bill prohibits a person who is not a solicitor from advertising, for reward, legal services in respect of personal injuries in a manner which is no longer open to solicitors and prohibits solicitors from becoming involved, directly or indirectly, with such a perk.</P>
    <P>It is of significance that the Bill was prepared in consultation with the Law Society of Ireland which has publicly welcomed it.  The Bill enables the Law Society to obtain a High Court order prohibiting contravention of the Solicitors Acts, 1954 to 1988, by a solicitor or other person.</P>
    <P>There is strong evidence that advertising by solicitors contributed in a big way to the flood of Army deafness cases.  I do not envy the Minister for Defence his task in tackling the matter on behalf of the taxpayer.  The financial implications for the Exchequer are potentially serious.  The Minister is determined to face up to his responsibilities for which I salute him.</P>
    <P>Advertisements by solicitors contain glaring headlines such as &ldquo;Army Deafness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Don't leave it too late&rdquo;.  This constitutes blatant and gross deception.  It was always understood that on one's first visit to a solicitor's office one stated one's case and did not seek legal advice.  An advertisement in a newspaper in July 1996 read:</P>
    <P>Any member or former member of the Defence Forces, including the FCA, who has a hearing impediment which may have arisen as a result of membership, please contact .</P>
    <P>Another read:</P>
    <P>If you are a member of the Defence Forces, and you have a hearing problem, you may have a claim.</P>
    <P>This is provocative and blatant.  A further advertisement referred to personal, military and noise related injuries.  This constitutes prompting, encouraging, goading and guiding persons with ill intent.</P>
    <P>Garda management recently ordered Chief Superintendent Higgins to investigate deafness claims lodged by members of the Garda Síochána, which are not thought to be on the same scale as Army deafness claims.</P>
    <P>At £30 million, the annual bill for public liability claims against local authorities and health boards is disconcerting and the number of claims is increasing by between 5 and 10 per cent each year.  Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance, the company which provides public liability insurance cover for local authorities and health boards, states that it is snowed under with claims.  It has to deal with more than 10,000 actions at any one <Col N="1644" /> time.  The major urban centres of Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick account for the majority of claims.  The number considered to be fraudulent is as high as 20 per cent.  This is a frightening figure.</P>
    <P>Public authorities and Departments have a duty to fight back on behalf of the taxpayer.  Several are doing so.  A number of public authorities have employed private investigators to catch bogus claimants and are defending cases in the courts.  There is an onus on all public bodies to adopt similar tactics as the alternative to making settlements which they know to be unjust.  The existence of a highly organised witness service or network was revealed as a result of the employment of private investigators.  When information from a number of public bodies was tabulated certain names cropped up repeatedly as claimants and as witnesses.  It was clear that they were part of a ring.</P>
    <P>When such unscrupulous and fraudulent practices are exposed to public scrutiny it brings the legal system into sharp focus.  This is unavoidable. Assertions of professional licence and the right to exemption from scrutiny of practices employed in the processing of cases have no validity and cannot be tolerated.  Solicitors must be open to scrutiny. I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he worked in close consultation with the Law Society on the principles and provisions set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is easy to be wise after the event but with increased competition it should have been possible to predict the emergence of the ambulance chasing culture which could have been averted by better regulations.  I hope the provisions of the Bill will be enacted quickly and that the regulations to be made under it will be strong enough to curb this practice.  They should be well monitored and policed so that legislators will not have to revisit this issue.</P>
    <P>The first victims of the compensation culture are the young, the sick, the poor and the weaker sections of society.  The taxpayer pays taxes in the belief that the moneys raised will be used to provide better public services, including education and health services.  These include providing care in the community for the old, the sick and the disabled.  It is appalling that persons who are clever enough to exploit the situation are filling their pockets with fraudulent payments.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will deal with this issue effectively, the unintended outcome of the legislation it is seeking to amend.  One is being charitable in stating that the advertisements and touting are in bad taste; the effect on public morality is serious. Moneys, provided by the compliant taxpayer for the provision of decent public services, are being plundered.  Criticism is being directed at the Law Society because of the activities of a small number of solicitors with whom it should deal with conviction, speed and without mercy.</P>
    <P>A key provision is the new section 1(3) which prescribes the information which may be contained in a solicitor's advertisement.  An advertisement <Col N="1645" /> can include the name, address, including electronic address, telephone number and place of business of the solicitor.  Particulars of the academic and professional qualifications and legal experience of the solicitor may also be provided as well as factual information on legal services provided and any areas of law to which those services relate, particulars of any charge or fee payable to the solicitor, and other information specified in regulations made by the Law Society. The new subsection (4) makes clear that, without prejudice to the prohibition on advertising in relation to claims for personal injuries contained in subsection (2), solicitors may when advertising include the words &ldquo;personal injuries&rdquo; in the factual information they provide.</P>
    <P>The Law Society will be required under the new subsection (5) to make regulations with the Minister's consent to give effect to provisions in the Bill.  The regulations, among other matters, must make provision in relation to advertisements by a solicitor, including the manner of their publication, form, content or size.  The regulations must restrict solicitors from touting and provide for the manner of determination by the Law Society of a contravention of the advertising provisions in the Bill or regulations made under it.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeals and re-enacts many of the provisions of section 71 of the 1954 Act as inserted by the 1994 Act.  The main difference is that the details on advertising will now be contained in primary legislation rather than in regulations made by the society.  The Bill aims to ensure that the type of excesses of advertising experienced to date will be a thing of the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is an important measure in the context of what is happening in the area of litigation.  Officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should listen to the debate.  I have listened to it and the issues raised have been frightening.  The previous speaker said how appalled he was to see taxpayers' money going to people who exploited a situation and spoke of the immense effect on public morality.  We, as legislators, must deal with that.  We have not been responsible in doing so. The issue has existed for many years.  I remember raising it in great detail ten years ago in the Seanad and others have raised it since.  It has been discussed in the Dáil and the Seanad but nothing has been done because there is a belief nothing can be done.  I do not accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered that a similar situation pertained to occupiers' liability and the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995, was introduced to deal with it.  I remember Deputy Deenihan piloting a Private Members' Bill on the matter and it was the first legislative measure which attempted to deal with that problem.  It raised the profile of the issue of the difficulties faced by landowners and others, such as sporting clubs, who used or crossed private property.  I subsequently raised the issue in the Seanad.  Eventually the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor, <Col N="1646" /> decided to confront the issue and introduced the Bill to deal with it.  People said it could not be done but it was and the problem of occupiers' liability was corrected.  Measures are now in place to protect the occupier.  If such issues can be dealt with in one area, they can be dealt with in a more general fashion.  As the previous speaker said, the effect on public morality is immense.</P>
    <P>Those of us involved in local government know the level of claims taken.  The previous speaker said 20 per cent of claims were spurious; I think that is conservative and it is higher.  Do we take responsibility anymore for what we do or for our safety?  Do we accept blame when we have been irresponsible or do we seek to place blame elsewhere?  People must accept responsibility.  The Law Reform Commission should be asked to investigate the matter and bring forward recommendations to ensure this area is dealt with.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the most litigious countries in Europe.  As others have said, the compensation culture is like a cancer eating into our society and almost borders on the immoral.  The State must move quickly to halt the slide down a slippery slope where all commercial and service industry will grind to a halt.  We are less competitive in industry and commerce than our partners in Europe because of the level of payment of compensation and the consequential increase in insurance premiums.  I calculated that, had we the same level of insurance payments in the area of employers' liability for four years, 10,000 jobs would be created because of the improvement in the level of efficiency.  We are uncompetitive in many areas, especially in manufacturing, where we are in competition with our European partners, because of the level of claims taken against employers.  Young people cannot obtain insurance.  Why must insurance premiums be so high for young people?  It is many times higher than that in the UK or on the Continent.  The level of payment of claims is way ahead of that of our continental partners.</P>
    <P>There is also the practice of insurance companies coming to an agreement.  I know they do it because claimants will settle for less rather than going to court.  However, it creates a situation where people who make spurious claims do not have to take the stand and give their side of the story.  An agreement is reached on the steps of the court and they go away laughing.  The system acts against the best interest of the genuine claimant who may have to wait many years for the resolution of his or her claim with its consequential distress and uncertainty at the level of appropriate compensation.  This discourages rehabilitation and return to work.  People are advised, if they have a claim against their employer, to delay returning to work until their claim is settled.  This area of the courts is clogged with claims and people who are fit to return to work are advised in the interests of their claim not to do so.  That is not in the interests of the claimant, the employer, industry and commerce or the State.</P>
    <P>Insurance costs are creating complications for <Col N="1647" /> employers, businesses, motorists, public authorities and voluntary and sporting organisations.  No area has been spared the paralysis which has accompanied the escalation in litigation.  For example, school teachers can no longer send a student to the nearest shop for a message.  Open season has been declared on public houses, clubs, hotels and supermarkets by people who fall on such premises.  Once a person falls on any premises, the first thing to enter their minds is to make a claim.  We joke about it although it is a serious matter, and this indicates it is regarded as humorous. The compensation culture is pervasive and is on its way to destroying ordinary, decent people's enjoyment of life.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Richard Bruton on Tuesday, 17 November 1998:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to introduce a properly resourced strategy to tackle educational disadvantage and learning difficulties, which are a source of inequality at all levels of our education &mdash; pre-school, primary, secondary, third level, and further education &mdash; and which, despite their devastating impact on many young lives, are only addressed by a series of under resourced and <i>ad hoc</i> measures with very limited impact, and condemns the Minister for Education and Science for not honouring commitments to the electorate in this respect.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann notes that the 1999 Abridged Estimates show spending on first, second and third level education rising by 20 per cent, 19 per cent and 19 per cent respectively versus the 1997 allocation and that this figure includes the largest ever direct funding increase for primary schools, believes that this significant investment in education is of crucial economic and social importance to the country and supports efforts to target resources at those who experience educational disadvantage.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> Politics is about debate and disagreement.  It is part of the package and we are all accustomed to it.  However, the contribution made yesterday evening by the Minister for Education and Science was distasteful.  I appreciate he is a man in a hurry and that he has ambitions to lead his party, but if he is to succeed I suggest the unbridled arrogance he displayed in his contribution to this debate last night will not serve him well.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to my party's record in education over the past five years.  His contribution was littered with half truths about our record and no detail about his achievements.  He seems to believe he has brought about a revolution in his own time.  In his former life the Minister was a teacher.  I do not know whether he taught history&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but his contribution last night gave no indication of that.  It was devoid of historical context.</P>
      <P>The record of my party colleague, Niamh Bhreathnach, in Government between 1992 and 1997 is a proud one.  If this Minister has been able to make any progress in the past year and a half it is built on what Niamh Bhreathnach achieved. There is a practice among most Members of the House to acknowledge the contribution of their predecessors, but this Minister has chosen to ignore that.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to be churlish.  I acknowledge the £4 million the Minister announced for children with special needs.  That is a good develop-ment which builds on progress made by the Minister Niamh Bhreathnach during her time in office.</P>
      <P>Labour in Government put in place a national education convention, the first in the history of the sector.  That convention, which ultimately led to a White Paper, brought together everybody with an interest in education, with parents and teachers receiving long overdue recognition.  That convention, and the model on which it was based, has formed the basis for the development of education into the next century.</P>
      <P>When Niamh Bhreathnach took office, the pupil-teacher ratio was almost 26:1.  She left it at 22:1.  Primary level capitation, which the last Fianna Fáil-PD Government had frozen for three years, increased from £28 to £45.  The second level capitation also suffered the wrath of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and was frozen for three years.</P>

    <P>The Minister made great play of the fact that the grant did not increase in 1997, but he deliberately chose to ignore that in that year a £9 <i>per capita</i> payment was made to schools to assist in upkeep and maintenance.  Expenditure on special education was revolutionised.  The capitation grants for children with special needs increased from £76 to £316 during Niamh Bhreathnach's period in office.  Our Education Bill, not the watered down version which has gone through the Dáil, provided for a statutory obligation on education <Col N="1649" /> boards to cater for children with special needs.  These are substantial achievements and only represent a small proportion of what Niamh Bhreathnach achieved in office.</P>
    <P>As the Minister travels around the country opening new school buildings, he should remember that these projects were initiated by his predecessor. If he thinks school buildings are in a poor condition now, he is fortunate not to have inherited the mess left behind in 1992 by some of his current Cabinet colleagues.</P>
    <P>The Minister's comments about third level education and the abolition of fees by the previous Government are particularly shallow.  If he is so opposed to the move, why does he not put his money where his mouth is?  The reality is that the Minister will not do that because he stated:</P>
    <P>The measure has relieved substantial pressure from many middle income families.  In short, it has facilitated the attendance at third level of many young adults who may not have had the opportunity to attend.</P>
    <P>The Minister's remarks about educational disadvantage ring hollow.  Educational disadvantage was not an issue until Niamh Bhreathnach took office and recognised the good advice of agencies like the ESRI and the Combat Poverty Agency which provided documented evidence that the most effective way of preventing early school leaving was through early intervention.  The Breaking the Cycle and Early Start programmes were concerned with addressing the educational disadvantage that has been endured for too long by communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Early school leaving and the lack of educational qualifications lie at the root of long-term unemployment and poverty.  In her attempt to break this long cycle of poverty and disadvantage, Niamh Bhreathnach undertook to examine a number of key issues and trends before pumping money into the Early Start and Breaking the Cycle programmes.  The result was that she was in a position, on foot of objective research, to nominate a number of schools in which she could pilot these programmes.  The idea of piloting these programmes was that before they were extended further, any shortfalls would be addressed.  It was not intended that these programmes would be cut back, which is what the Minister did.  I understand that Marlborough model school, of which the Minister is a patron, lost a teacher in September despite the fact that it was nominated under the Breaking the Cycle programme.  An undertaking was given in that programme that those schools would not lose teachers in the first five years.</P>
    <P>The litany of allegations and cheap jibes the Minister made in the House last night failed to recognise his own decision which is both against the spirit of the national anti-poverty strategy and the people in the schools to which I referred.  As my party colleague, Deputy O'Shea, said last night, it is not possible to change the education system overnight.  As has been proven in the past <Col N="1650" /> 17 months by the Minister, change takes time.  I do not expect the Minister to achieve everything overnight, but what has been achieved should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>It will take years before we see the benefits of the Early Start and Breaking the Cycle programmes. That is, if the Government starts to build on them rather than cut them back.  The extra remedial teachers put in place in schools under the previous Government was a start but the numbers remain insufficient.  That is why the Minister must build on those numbers although I acknowledge he has stated that he is in favour of providing remedial teaching for all children who need it.  I fully support him in that and recognise he is making some progress.</P>
    <P>The home-school liaison service is another measure extended by Labour in Government. This service needs to be extended to all disadvantaged areas.  That is an effective programme because it links the school with the home, where disadvantage starts.  That link is very important.</P>
    <P>Vast improvements in the school building pro-gramme and the improvements undertaken in the institutes of technology have made a huge difference, but this work must be continued.  In my constituency, the Limerick Institute of Technology, which was located in an old factory building when Niamh Bhreathnach came into office, is now located in a beautiful modern building where many young people who might not otherwise get third level education have the opportunity to pursue it.  That is also true of the IT sector generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister's job would be much more difficult were it not for the array of initiatives undertaken in the area of education in recent years.  It is time the Minister came to grips with the fact that he has been in office for 17 months, and while the legacy of Labour in Government has made his job easier, he needs to move on and stop attempting to discredit the record of Labour in Government.</P>
    <P>I understand it takes time to bring about the various changes and improvements we all want to see in the education sector.  My colleague, Deputy O'Shea, has debated this issue with the Minister, particularly in regard to the Education (No. 2) Bill, in recent weeks.  There are many areas on which we all agree but it is important that the work started by Niamh Bhreathnach in 1992, which in many ways built on an education system that did not focus on children from disadvantaged areas, is continued.  Niamh Bhreathnach made a great deal of progress in those areas.  She was particularly dedicated to the idea of early intervention.</P>
    <P>I have worked in the pre-school area and have studied some of the education psychology and sociology in relation to it.  It is clear from reading that material that if we do not intervene with children at an early age, we are perpetuating the <i>status quo</i> in the education system.  Those people who have always benefited from education will continue to benefit from it unless we make some radical changes in the system.  That is why programmes <Col N="1651" /> like Early Start and Breaking the Cycle were piloted under Niamh Bhreathnach.  That was done on the basis of advice given and evidence gathered by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education and Research Centre in St. Patrick's.  The leaving certificate applied and other measures were also designed to carry on that programme into second level.  A large number of students drop out of school because they do not have appropriate programmes at second level.</P>
    <P>The contribution made by the Minister last night did not do him any credit in terms of the way he attacked, without substance, the record of Niamh Bhreathnach in Government over a number of years during which major changes for the better were brought to the education system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Kitt, Keaveney, Power, McGuinness, Hanafin, Brendan Smith, Michael Moynihan and Pat Carey.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to record my admiration of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin for his commitment to education. As Opposition spokesperson on education during the rainbow administration he highlighted the sad and failed efforts of that Government.  I am surprised to read that the people involved in that administration tabled this motion condemning the Minister for failing to honour his commitment to the electorate.  The Minister has honoured all his commitments and more.  This House should recognise the dynamic proven track record of the Minister as Opposition spokesperson and as Minister.  He is one of the best if not the best ever Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The Minister believes education is crucial in giving people opportunities.  The lack of access to education undermines people's ability to play a full part in society.  That is the Fianna Fáil ethos. We have always put education at the top of our priority policy list and the Government honours that tradition.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan is concerned that the Minister, last evening, attacked and discredited the former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach. The Rainbow Government introduced education policies which did nothing for the education system as a whole.  More importantly, their policies did not help the disadvantaged.  The question of education for autistic children, for example, was not addressed by the Rainbow Government or by previous successive Ministers for Education.  People with disabilities were denied the right to education.  When I raised this issue in the past the responses from the previous Minister were sad.  However, I recently received the following letter on the subject of autism from the Minister, Deputy Martin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On many occasions we have discussed the issue of the education services available to special needs children and you have made representations on behalf of constituents seeking <Col N="1652" /> improvements in these areas.  I am pleased to be able to inform you that this Government has approved a major new initiative in special education which will provide the first ever automatic support for many children with disabilities. This initiative marks a particular breakthrough for integrated education for children with autism and will deliver extra teaching and child care services.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to give a detailed and comprehensive report on the package of services.  Congratulations are well deserved by the Minister for this initiative in an area where several Ministers had failed in the past.</P>
    <P>Many speakers last evening chose to ignore the fact that the largest ever increase in funding for primary schools has been made by this Government. They ignored the new educational psychology service, the major expansion in early school leavers services, the wide range of well-targeted and effective initiatives and most of all, they seemed to want to ignore their own record of failure in Government.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to parents who have suffered frus-tration and annoyance at a system which could not accommodate their children because of their disabilities.  I pay tribute to schools in my constituency and particularly to St. Patrick's national school, Drumcondra, St. Paul's special school, Beaumont and the Central Remedial Clinic in Clontarf.</P>
    <P>On January 22, 1997 Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left voted for a budget which froze school funding, cut primary teachers' numbers, refused automatic supports to many children with disabilities and maintained examination charges for the poorest families.  I ask why?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Two weeks ago a headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> proclaimed &ldquo;Successful end of 20 year campaign&rdquo;.  The headline referred to comments by the Irish Society for Autism on the £4 million package of measures for children with special needs.  I welcome the special pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 for autistic children and the automatic entitlement to child care support.  It is not just autistic children who will benefit, as children with a severe or profound mental handicap who are in special schools will have an entitlement to two child care assistants for each class of six children. This level of response will be in line with the recommendations of the special education review group which reported some years ago.</P>
      <P>I welcome also the Minister's announcement of remedial and resource teachers which he made during the year.  However, sometimes too many schools are included in a cluster sharing a remedial or resource teacher.  In some cases the teacher spends too much time travelling between schools.  Schools in rural areas might instead have extra teaching hours for children with special needs.  The question of a suitable classroom for the remedial or resource teacher also arises. These facilities must be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The money provided in the Estimates for building <Col N="1653" /> and renovation of primary schools has been increased significantly.  Primary school spending will be 20 per cent higher next year than in 1997. Spending on building grants and capital costs for secondary schools will increase by almost £17 million to £58.8 million.  I acknowledge the Minister's help to one-teacher schools.  In my parish our 23 pupil school has been allocated a second teacher.  I hope that other one-teacher schools will receive the same assistance.</P>
    <P>The Government has identified the necessity of addressing adult education as a means of combating long-term unemployment.  An OECD survey published in October 1997 highlighted that 25 per cent of Irish people have serious literacy problems. Without basic literacy skills people cannot get jobs or access to training programmes.  As we face a future dominated by technological communications, literacy will become an even greater necessity.  The Government acted quickly in response to the OECD figures and increased the budget for adult education from £2.3 million in 1997 to more than £4 million in 1998.  I also commend Deputy Richard Bruton for his report on literacy levels.</P>
    <P>Primary schools received additional funding in the recently published Estimates.  The basic capitation grant will increase from £50 to £60 and will be supplemented by new capitation based initiatives for science equipment and for pupils in infant classes.  This amounts to the largest increase in direct funding for primary schools.  The Minister has delivered on his pre-election commitment and will continue to fight for more resources for education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to three aspects of education &mdash; Youthreach, the post-leaving certificate sector and remedial education.  I record my appreciation of the work of the Minister and the Government and their commitment to education. This is evidenced by their commitment to improving the position of the less advantaged and additional resources provided in 1999.</P>
      <P>The pre-budget estimate for spending on education in 1999 shows a £500 million increase in the post-budget position of the previous Government in 1997.  This is evidence of the Government's and Fianna Fáil's commitment to education. Direct funding for primary schools will have increased by more than 33 per cent in that two year period.  This is evidence of the Minister's success in Cabinet in negotiating the resources needed for education.  I compliment him on tackling the difficulties in a number of sectors.</P>
      <P>The Minister has provided maintenance grants for the post-leaving certificate sector.  He has also established a capital budget for the provision of proper facilities for these colleges.  Fortunately, my county will have one of the first colleges of further education built and provided for by the Minister.  He will not come to Cavan to open schools built by the previous Government.  He will open schools for which he will provide the funding and which are being constructed now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> Fortunately, there is a large investment pro-gramme in school buildings in Cavan but more needs to be done.  I compliment the Minister and the Department on advancing the planning stages and providing the funding necessary for so many school projects.</P>
    <P>The importance of Youthreach was identified by the Minister when he provided extra places.  I know many students who have gone through this programme.  It is gratifying to learn of the success of these students.  Some of them come from less advantaged parts of society.  They were somewhat troublesome in primary and secondary schools, but as a result of their participation in Youthreach, some went on the futher education and took up worthwhile and gainful employment.  I applaud the Minister's efforts in this regard.  I appeal to him to ensure that staffing is regularised and that the co-ordinators of the Youthreach pro-gramme are given permanent status.</P>
    <P>The Minister has consistently said we will not be able to eliminate all the problems in education overnight.  He has made a good start in the area of special needs and remedial education.  I commend him for these efforts and I know that further progress will be made in the next three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak in this debate.  The number of speakers on the Government side is a sign of how well the Minister and the Government are doing on education.</P>
      <P>I will speak about primary education and Youthreach.  The Book of Estimates included a major cash boost for primary education.  This is right and proper, as primary education is the foundation stone of any child's education.  For too long, the primary sector was neglected.  The infrastructure of primary education is in disrepair in every part of the country.  Buildings have fallen into disrepair and the necessary resources were not made available for maintenance.  The facilities available to primary teachers were also sadly lacking.  I am delighted the Minister has ensured in the Book of Estimates that primary education will get the resources it needs.  We have a long way to go but I am delighted a start has been made.</P>
      <P>Youthreach is very close to my heart.  I know people who have worked in Youthreach since it commenced in 1989-90.  People entered Youthreach coming from disadvantaged and troubled families.  They received training, a sense of purpose and confidence that they can belong to society.  This is a start in tackling social exclusion and ensures that people are brought into the system. I commend the Minister and the Youthreach service.  We must ensure that more funding is made available for this area.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The scope of this topic is enormous and impossible to condense into the three minutes available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the important <Col N="1655" /> developments he has made since taking office.  I commend him for the aims he set out in the pro-gramme for Government and wish him well in implementing those which are still outstanding.</P>
    <P>The 1999 Estimates show an increase of more than £250 million on the 1997 post-budget figure. This will enable spending on the primary sector to increase by 20 per cent next year, and second and third level spending to increase by 19 per cent.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>On entering this House, remedial education was one of the main issues raised with me by constituents. The previous Government let down the whole country.  Then, due to an approaching election, my county got one remedial teacher. However, since this Government took office, there has been an improvement with the promise of further significant improvements next year.</P>
    <P>Some people talk of the lack of grand prix drivers when they talk about the provision of remedial teaching.  I thank the Minister that we have more grand prix drivers under his flag than ever before.  However, I would welcome a reduction in the number of laps expected of them.</P>
    <P>Another improvement which can be seen is in the home-school and teacher-counsellor models where extra resources are being deployed and the Minister is looking at the expansion of this initiative. A source of amusement to me on entering this House was the previous Minister's generosity in providing computer trolleys.  I congratulated her foresight.  However, more importantly, I congratulate the current Minister for providing the computers for the trolleys.  This adds a new dimension to the concept of partnership and planning.</P>
    <P>While every Deputy will know of special needs students who require assistance, I compliment the Minister for the radical initiatives he announced which give automatic rights to supports which these children need, such as a child care assistant. Could it be that the previous Government spent £250,000 fighting a case to deny these entitlements?  Shame on that Government.</P>
    <P>Donegal continues to have inadequate access to educational psychologists and I am glad the Minister is appointing extra psychologists and putting in place the blueprint for a national educational psychology agency.  My constituency will be one of those entitled to extra support.</P>
    <P>In contrast with the position in many rural areas, I had the pleasure of attending the openings of two rural schools recently.  While work is ongoing in schools such as Scoil Colmcille, Malin, and work is needed in schools such as Cloontagh national school, Clonmany, it is important that the Government has doubled the spending on school buildings and renovations.  Next year, more than £117 million will be spent.  There are needs in each region but moneys are being provided.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister established a group to carry out the first proper qualitative and quantitative analysis on early school leavers and has <Col N="1656" /> made a commitment to act on the results in the near future.  This issue is of great concern and is evoking much constructive debate and imaginative solutions in my constituency where the problem is particularly acute.  I congratulate the Inishowen Partnership on its initiative in carrying out a survey.  I trust the Minister will consider its findings and help in counteracting the current situation.</P>
    <P>All Deputies know of the importance of education. Everything is not perfect at present but in comparison with previous Governments, much has been done in a few months.  The Minister is gradually fulfilling commitments that all the partners in education recognise as positive.  I wish him well in continuing this task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for tabling this motion which gives the Minister an opportunity to highlight the number of changes he has made in a short period.  I have never seen the Opposition so quiet during a debate in Private Members' Time and that probably tells its own story.  However, I will not seek to make political capital from it.</P>
      <P>It is useful to look at the effects on the education system of major decisions by the Department. The abolition of fees for third level education is one such decision.  It was one of the biggest mistakes ever made by the House.  It seriously restricted the ability of the Minister to make changes to tackle disadvantage in a meaningful way.</P>
      <P>When the current Minister, Deputy Martin, was Opposition spokesman on education, he consulted widely with the partners in education.  On the basis of those consultations he formulated a strategy which he promised to implement.  Many of the teachers' organisations and Members of the Opposition will acknowledge that, in his capacity as Minister, he has lived up to his promises. He has made a tremendous impact on the education system in a short period.</P>
      <P>An important element of the education system is the provision of remedial education.  Every school in Ireland requires this service and in many cases too many schools are trying to share a remedial teacher.  In spreading the jam too thin, the effect is reduced.  While the Minister has made great progress and has pledged to continue it, he should pay special attention to this area and ensure that no more than two schools share a remedial teacher.  That would target the resource effectively.</P>
      <P>Another area worthy of mention is adult literacy. The budgetary allocation for adult literacy was doubled last year.  It is an important area and I am aware Deputies Bruton and Ferris have done a great deal of work on it.  However, we are still not sure of the extent of this problem.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to continue to invest in adult literacy.  It is of great benefit not only to the individuals concerned, but also to their families in terms of improving self confidence and the quality of their lives.</P>

      <P>Educational disadvantage is part of the broader issue of disadvantage.  In availing of the opportunity to speak on the motion, I wish to point out that this Government is not a latter day convert to the cause of alleviating disadvantage. When the National Development Plan was being formulated, the URBAN initiative was put in place to combat educational deprivation in areas such as Finglas, Ballymun and Darndale. However, when the rainbow Government took office the same amount of money had to be spread thinly to include areas to satisfy Deputy Rabbitte.  That was done despite Deputy De Rossa's presence in the Cabinet as Minister for Social Welfare and despite the fact that it would deprive Ballymun and Finglas.  The interim report of the Higher Education Authority on the needs of third level education in the Dublin area stated that an institute of technology was necessary in the Finglas area.  When the final report was issued, Finglas was not given its institute of technology. Instead, certain pieces of the proposed institute were transferred to other areas.  One part went to Dun Laoghaire and the rest was allocated to Blanchardstown, although it was unfinished, unannounced and unfunded.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on committing £20 million to the Blanchardstown Institute of Technology and on giving the go-ahead for the first phase of Coláiste Íde where 800 students follow post-leaving certificate courses.  I also compliment the Minister on introducing the grants scheme for students in post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>With regard to measures to assist access to third level education for the disadvantaged, the motion rings a little hollow when one considers that the National Youth Council, the Union of Students in Ireland and students' unions across the country made a pre-budget submission to Deputy Quinn when he was Minister for Finance seeking an increase of maintenance grants for third level students.  Labour Youth is part of the National Youth Council and it concurred with that motion.</P>

      <P>I conclude by complimenting the Minister on his commitment to introducing a Green Paper on adult education, another important means of alleviating educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the need to continue to invest heavily in the provision of education for those who are disadvantaged or disabled and who cannot easily access mainstream education for a number of reasons.  The measure of maturity in a society is how it looks after its weak and vulnerable members.  In this regard, the <Col N="1658" /> Minister and the Government have an excellent track record which continues to recognise the need for investment in this area.</P>
      <P>The policy of support and development in this area of education is reflected in the 1999 Estimates. In my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, the spend on education across all levels from June 1997 totals £5 million.  The Minister is to be complimented on this investment which will benefit everybody in the constituency.  Other projects await sanction, but I have no doubt they will be sanctioned in 1999.</P>
      <P>However, one cannot become complacent. Every effort must be made to keep the disadvantaged and marginalised in the education system. New methods of providing a safety net for those who fall out of the system must be examined and funded.  Community initiatives such as homework clubs or services such as those offered in Kilkenny by the Young Irish Film Makers must be examined and possibly funded through the Department.  The outreach centre in Kilkenny, headed by NUI Maynooth and the Carlow Institute of Technology, is now located in St. Kieran's College and caters for those who missed education in their earlier years.  These initiatives should be examined and properly funded by the Government.</P>
      <P>The outreach project is an ideal pilot scheme which would tell the Minister and his Department a great deal about outreach centres and their effect on communities.  The project is up and running and has the support of the local community. It has a student base and uses the skills and expertise that are already being funded by the Department.  It would be sensible for the Department to use it as a pilot project and I ask the Minister to examine that possibility.</P>

      <P>In the past year when the House discussed Private Members' Bills and motions, I often empathasised with the ideas behind them and sympathised with the sentiments expressed by the Members.  However, I cannot do that on this occasion because I have rarely heard such blatant hypocrisy on the part of the parties supporting this motion.  They obviously came to the House to bury the Minister rather than to praise him.</P>
      <P>Before I was elected to the Dáil, I heard much talk about disadvantage.  As has been said previously in this debate, disadvantage was not an issue until the Labour Party went into Government. There were many speeches, press conferences, seminars, videos, policy documents, Green Papers and White Papers on disadvantage, during its time in Government, but little done about it.  It has taken this Government and Minister to do something about the issues which were raised during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While disadvantage was being discussed in the Dáil during that period, in Dun Laoghaire I met children who could not get into their local schools, there were classes of 37 and 38 pupils, children got lost between the primary and secondary <Col N="1659" /> school systems &mdash; nobody knew where they had gone &mdash; and children dropped out of school between the ages of eight and 15 years.  I met six travelling students who are the only travelling students in the area to be incorporated into mainstream education, students who could not afford their books or examination fees agus gael-scoileanna nach raibh in ann aitheantas a fháil ón Aire in a Dáil cheantar féin.</P>
    <P>After the election the mood, the Minister, the investment and the commitment changed.  In the past 15 months we have witnessed a record of which any Minister would be proud after five years in office.  In months to come, I will be the first to criticise where criticism is deserved and to highlight important issues.  I will be the first to say something must be done or that the Government should do more.</P>

      <P>Last night's speech by the Minister for Education and Science had more to do with reasserting his position within the upper echelons of Fianna Fáil than addressing the serious issue of educational disadvantage.  In a performance which obviously appealed to his Fianna Fáil back-bench colleagues, the Minister attempted to use the opportunity to seek forgiveness for the disaster in Cork South-Central.  The speech was a shameless one and it exposed the Minister as a Minister on the run.</P>
      <P>He is obsessed with public perception of him following his party's haemorrhaging at the polls in the Cork South-Central by-election.  Last night we heard the speech of a man who is desperately trying to regain his position within Fianna Fáil. The defeat in Cork in the constituency of a man with leadership ambitions is not looked upon sympathetically by the party faithful throughout the land.  Last night the wagons circled and we were all treated to the Minister's swan song &mdash; Come back, all is forgiven.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister and, indeed, his private office for sending me a copy of his idiot-proof guide to educational propaganda which all Members of the Government parties received last evening.  In a bizarre twist I was the lucky recipient of a document from the Minister's propaganda department.  The ritualistic bleatings from the Government Members tonight obviously have their source in this special unit in Marlborough Street.  I look forward to receiving further Stasi-like pronouncements in the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the Government not want to address the central issue behind this Private Members' <Col N="1660" /> motion, that the Minister had £178 million made available in extra spending for education and could only devote 20 per cent of that spending to primary education?  The Government does not want to face the reality behind this scandal in which students from disadvantaged backgrounds have not and will not receive their fair share of the educational budget.  It is in the area of educational disadvantage that the Minister stands indicted.  At a time of unprecedented economic wealth, we now have the opportunity to make a substantial difference to the teaching and learning environment of children who come from disadvantaged areas.  That opportunity will not exist forever.  The failure of the Government to introduce a properly resourced strategy to tackle educational disadvantage and learning difficulties will produce additional problems within society in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there are a number of schools which regularly report 20 per cent of their pupils not attending school.  If there is one issue which we need to address in terms of additional resources, it is the issue of school attendance.  To date, the Minister has failed to bring forward legislation and has failed to give support to the school attendance service throughout the country. There is the ridiculous situation in my constituency where members of the Garda Síochána must spend their time running after children who are not attending school.  It is a waste of Garda resources and it is disgraceful that in the late 1990s we have yet to reform this key function of educational policy.  Children who are regularly playing truant from school are exposed to a cycle of crime at an early age.</P>
    <P>Despite the brashness of the Minister's comments, a massive 54,000 children are in classes larger than the maximum number which the Department claims is acceptable.  As Deputy Bruton rightly stated, this year 91 disadvantaged and Breaking the Cycle schools have lost teachers on account of insignificant falls in their school enrolments. There are too many schools where teachers are faced with a daily routine of having to manage oversized classes.  If the opportunity is not taken to resolve the situation within the context of the present Book of Estimates, it will never be grasped.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science has failed to address educational disadvantage.  It is quite obvious from his reactionary remarks that he is provoked by Deputy Bruton's consultative paper on educational disadvantage, which has stolen a march on the Minister's plans.  I take this opportunity of congratulating Deputy Bruton for the radical set of proposals he has outlined in this area.  At last a national strategy exists to deal with educational disadvantage.  The Minister should now implement in full Deputy Bruton's proposals.</P>

      <P>I welcome this motion from Fine Gael and thank them for giving me some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of disadvantage is an important, if <Col N="1661" /> rather perplexing, one.  It is not helpful to have the kind of statements made by Deputy Hanafin which clearly do not appreciate the difficulties and the necessity for consistent concentration on tackling disadvantage in a way which is not a matter of an instant overnight response.  The policy on disadvantage was developed during the time of the Rainbow Government as it had not been before.  Anybody who is not mean-spirited would acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>Increasingly we understand that it is investment at primary and pre-school levels which pays off both in terms of enabling people to continue on through education and to achieve when they leave the educational system.  That investment needs to be concentrated at an early age if it is to make the significant difference which it can.</P>
    <P>Pre-school education is a topical issue at present because of the debate about child care. I hope the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will not deepen the divide further by opting for the quick fix proposal which Fianna Fáil has been promoting of simply providing tax relief on child care. That will increase disadvantage if it is done in a one-sided and unintelligent way which even the Minister would understand is not the way to move.  A much more comprehensive approach is required.</P>
    <P>I commend the INTO for organising a campaign which is exemplary.  I have been contacted both to attend meetings and to meet small deputations to deal with the fundamental issues relating to primary schools.  I pay tribute to those teachers who use their spare time to lobby for the children in their care.  They are not looking for better conditions or extra money.  They are not suddenly succumbing to the blue 'flu because they want more money.  They are campaigning because they understand the importance of investment in the schooling of young children who are at risk even of simply not being able to read when they come out the other end.  Such children do not have a chance of being able to get the benefits of secondary education.</P>
    <P>We must look at the spending on primary education which is only about 64 per cent per pupil of that which is spent on secondary students and 28 per cent of that which is spent on third level students.  This is the time when we can make a real difference.  This is the time when there is agreement in the community that we must look after the young, and we must look after the younger of the young.  We can only do it by spending money and spending it wisely.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we can look back at our history and see that there is a tremendous record of education in Ireland.  There was great commitment from individuals from religious orders who have left us a great legacy.</P>
    <P>Now the opportunity is to seriously tackle disadvantage, not with the reactive nonsense which I have heard here tonight but in a way which genuinely faces up to the fundamental issue in education. The Minister for Education and Science recognises that it is of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> I do not think the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, would share his view as he comes from a very different ideological perspective.</P>
    <P>This debate is timely and I am delighted to have had the opportunity to speak on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather disingenuous of the Government side of the House to criticise the record of the Rainbow Government regarding disadvantage.  That Government really started the process of catering for this sector.  The present resources are there as a result of the economic policies of that Rainbow Government.  The Minister has more at his disposal than any previous Minister.  We must view the allocation of resources in the context of the amount of money which is available to the Government.</P>
      <P>Times have changed.  The Minister has more latitude to provide funding for the disadvantaged than heretofore.  Irrespective of what Minister is in office we would expect that.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to disadvantage in rural areas.</P>
      <P>There are 3,200 primary schools &mdash; 318 are designated disadvantaged, while 33 urban and 123 rural schools participate in the Breaking the Cycle programme.  In those urban schools the pupil-teacher ratio is 15:1, whereas in rural schools there is no additional staffing.  The Breaking the Cycle programme should be in all schools designated disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>There are 558 schools without the service of a remedial teacher.  That is not fair and is an issue that must be addressed.  Several other schools share a remedial teacher, sometimes with five or six schools.  That is unsatisfactory.  If the problem of disadvantage is to be tackled, a remedial service will have to be provided.  That service is not being provided to any great extent.</P>
      <P>I refer to the report of the educational research centre on educational disadvantage.  It estimates that 16 per cent of the schoolgoing population is disadvantaged and indicates that the majority, 60.7 per cent, live in areas with a population of less than 10,000.  When the number of disadvantaged children is expressed as a percentage of all pupils living in rural areas, it shows that one in every five is disadvantaged.  It also confirms that Dublin is the best served of the regions by schools designated as disadvantaged with 41.2 per cent of its pupils placed in such schools.  Conversely the report shows that rural areas are least well served with only 4.9 per cent of pupils in schools designated as disadvantaged.  Provision for disadvantaged pupils in Dublin is shown to be nine times better than in rural areas and four times better than in towns with populations between 10,000 and 40,000.  I have no argument against the provision for disadvantaged in Dublin &mdash; even more is needed.  Nevertheless, it shows a glaring difference between rural and urban schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the absolute number of disadvantaged pupils is taken into account, provision in Dublin is shown to be 20 times better than in rural areas. This disparity of treatment is further exacerbated, as the report highlights, if one takes into account <Col N="1663" /> the level of remedial service available to both categories of pupil.  While virtually all pupils in designated schools in the larger urban areas will have a remedial service available in their schools, it can be assumed the vast majority of disadvantaged pupils in rural areas will be found in the 50 per cent of primary schools which do not have access to the services of a remedial teacher.  The report also shows the Early Start programme is entirely urban based.  I do not know whether that is accurate.</P>

      <P>The Minister introduced a scheme whereby supports are made available to 25 clusters of rural schools, each cluster having a combined enrolment in the region of 350 pupils. This support takes the form of a co-ordinator who works with families and teachers.  There is one cluster in Kerry, in Cahirciveen.  For many years the greatest demand from parents, teachers and management in rural areas has been for the appointment of remedial teachers to serve realistic numbers of pupils and schools.  There would seem to be little point in establishing a co-ordinator, to improve the confidence and skills of pupils and families, to schools which are unable to provide such a basic service as a remedial teacher.  The provision of a realistic remedial service to rural schools must be the Minister's top priority.  I understand an additional 220 posts would meet that requirement.</P>
      <P>One of the Minister's many promises prior to the election concerned career guidance teachers. He said: &ldquo;The provision of additional guidance counsellors will be a priority of the next Fianna Fáil Government.  In particular we will aim to restore the ratio of one guidance counsellor to 250 pupils and acknowledge that this must happen if the service is to be effective in schools&rdquo;. He has not lived up to that commitment and has got nowhere near it.  I shall remind him of it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and compliment my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, on introducing the motion.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting of the Education and Science Committee some teachers came from around the country.  I was struck by the figures provided for disadvantaged schools.  A teacher from County Clare informed the meeting that two schools were declared disadvantaged at primary level.  Every second level school in Clare is disadvantaged.  That says something about the care being given to primary school children throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two main problems.  There is extreme pressure on the parents of primary school pupils who have become tax collectors on behalf of the Department of Education and Science.  The capitation grant for schools is being increased by £10 <Col N="1664" /> and was increased by £5 last year.  The Minister can make whatever case he wishes about what happened under previous Governments.  The reality is that £1 billion extra is available in the Department of Finance this year.  Therefore, there should be sufficient funds for education without putting the parents under pressure on a daily basis for money.  The day of free education is long gone and it is time the Minister admitted it.  That is some of the pressure children are experiencing.</P>
    <P>One remedial teacher serves three or four schools.  These remedial teachers have become known as the new rally drivers of Ireland as they try to get from one school to another.  Those children are not being given a fair chance.  When they go to second level education, teachers say that because a percentage of the children need to move on with the curriculum, they cannot wait for the others who are left behind.  Any primary school teacher will confirm this.  Unfortunately, there are a number of children in that position in every primary school.</P>
    <P>This motion is important.  There is a need to provide more money for education, given that last year 14,000 did not sit the leaving certificate.  The reason is there is not sufficient money in primary education.</P>

      <P>I thank speakers for sharing their time on this important debate.  I take exception to the remarks of Deputy Hanafin, who stated this is an exercise in burying the Minister and that it is hypocritical.  A debate on education is never hypocritical.  During my 11 years as a Member I have never sought to bury a Minister or an Opposition spokesperson.</P>
      <P>This debate is important.  We talk about the wealth and the future of our nation, that is, our young people.  If their future is to be sustained, it behoves us to put in place a proper educational system for them.  The Minister would be first to admit he does not have all the answers.  Some suggestions will be made here which, no doubt, the Minister will take on board.  When there is a problem in a constituency, it will be reflected in the representations one receives at clinics and in correspondence. I have a host of letters relating to problems in education &mdash; overcrowding in schools, the need for remedial teachers, bus services, why pupils are dropping out of school.  Parents come to me and say that John or Mary will not return to school.  When asked the reason I am told they cannot keep up.  We all understand that problem. The reason they are not keeping up with the others in the class is that they are not receiving the required level of attention because teachers cannot give them the time.  I hear every day about overcrowding, teachers having to deal with 25 or 30 pupils, which is not possible in a working day. Time is not on my side to debate the capitation grant but I will read the following letter, which I received this morning:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> At a recent board of management meeting in our school, capitation funding for primary schools was discussed.  We feel, as do our primary teachers, that the discrepancy between primary and secondary is terribly unjust, also that the £10 increase proposed in the Book of Estimates is miserly.  We earnestly ask you to use your influence to have this unjust situation rectified.</P>
    <P>I am now using my influence.  As the Minister is well aware, given the day to day cost of running schools, £10 is a drop in the ocean.  The Book of Estimates has been published but there is time between now and budget day for the Minister to make a realistic offer to schools in their capitation grants so they can get the equipment they need &mdash; they are not looking for luxuries.  I ask the Minister to make an adjustment in that area, he cannot say there is no funding because there is more than £1 billion excess.  I do not want the Minister to throw it away and he will not spent it on anything better than education, the future of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to comment on this important motion, proposed by Deputy Richard Bruton, whose recent report clearly demonstrated that education, especially at primary level, is the most important means for preparing people for work and bringing about full employment.  Also, when young people are working there will be less crime, so there is justification in spending more money at primary level to avoid greater costs later.</P>
      <P>The Government must meet its commitment to increase funding and lower class sizes at primary level.  While I appreciate the extra £10 proposed in the Estimates, that is a long way from the election promise to equalise primary and second level funding.  Another anomaly at second level is that schools are given aid posts but extra staff are not provided to cover the changed timetable which results.</P>
      <P>I wish to make the Minister fully aware of the schools which still do not have remedial or resource teachers and which must get them immediately.  Why were two small schools at Rockcorry and Drumm in my county left out of a group of schools which received such teachers this year?  One of those schools has a particularly urgent need for a remedial service.  The Inniskeen group of schools is another which has not been serviced as yet.  So many schools are grouped together that there is not enough time to give a proper service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for educational psychologists is also urgent.  One parent told me that, although she asked for evaluation two years ago and her son was examined six months ago, there is no report as yet.  This is not acceptable.  Another case concerns a five year old from Monaghan with autistic spectrum needs, in which there appears to be a problem between the Department and the Department of Health and Children.  In reply to <Col N="1666" /> a question today, I was told there was no request for such facilities in Monaghan, yet the child's parents wrote to me on 1 October that they had heard nothing from either Department on the issue.  I welcome the Minister's recent commitment on educational needs and hope this problem can be sorted out.</P>
    <P>Disadvantaged schools have been mentioned, in which regard I mention Clones junior primary school.  That was the worst hit town as a result of the Border &mdash; it received many migrants, which caused enormous educational problems.  The senior primary school has been declared disadvantaged, the Gaelscoil gets enormous grants, yet the junior primary school has not yet been declared disadvantaged.  This is not sustainable and I ask the Minister to rectify this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Richard Bruton for putting this motion before the House to allow us discuss this issue.  The motion calls on the Government to introduce a properly resourced strategy to tackle educational disadvantage and learning difficulties.  Those are distinct issues and we must put in place a strategy to deal with both.  They may come together but we must first look at them separately.</P>
      <P>I have put down a series of questions on autism in recent months.  I thank the Minister for his initiatives in the area but the thrust of the motion is that the Government's policy lacks an overall strategy where educational disadvantage and learning difficulties are concerned.  Autistic children need early intervention at age two to three, before pre-school, which has been seen internationally to be successful.  This is needed urgently &mdash; the longer we wait, the more children will slip through the net and not get the required treatment.  I implore the Minister to do everything possible because the research shows this works &mdash; he is nodding in agreement.</P>
      <P>In recent months I have also been working for escorts in school buses and I acknowledge that the Minister has provided funding for that, but it must be given soon because it is a huge problem. I received a letter from the parent of an epileptic child who falls asleep on the bus, wakes up and tries to open the door while the bus is moving. He is in danger of falling on the road.  The driver has no way of getting help or attracting attention.</P>
      <P>There is also a need for extra remedial teachers but again I stress the overall lack of planning. There is no point talking about one remedial teacher, one must train all those teaching a particular class, especially at second level, otherwise there will be a conflict.  I could speak about this for a long time; I worked as a guidance counsellor and a home-school liaison teacher, so I know what I am talking about.</P>

If we are ever to solve the problem to give children a chance we must help primary school children, some of whom need <Col N="1667" /> remedial teaching.

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to reply on behalf of the Government to the contributions of the Opposition.  It is unfortunate that the rules of the House only allow me to speak for a few minutes because the catalogue of inaccuracies and wilful misrepresentations we have heard from the Opposition deserve a detailed rebuttal.  I remind the House that this Government in its short time in office has a record of implementing more improvements and honouring more promises than the rainbow Government managed during its entire time in office.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that many of the Opposition contributions have been true to type, with sweeping condemnations flowing from either the disregarding or ignorance of the many initiatives which have been launched by the Government over the past year and a half.  Let me remind the House of a few of these initiatives.</P>
      <P>Next year will see the largest ever increase in the direct funding of primary schools.  While Deputy Richard Bruton tries desperately to twist the figures, he cannot get away from the size and importance of this increase.  The doubling of school building and renovation funding will also be felt throughout the country.  New approaches to traveller education, school attendance problems and the integration of services targeted at drop outs will leave a lasting impact, as will the major increase in Youthreach funding, together with the introduction of counselling, psychological and childcare services to help disadvantaged groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The abolition of examination fees for the poorest families has already been implemented and the creation of an educational psychological service is well under way.  Children with disabilities have already begun to benefit from a historic recognition of their right to supports.  This is removing the necessity for parents to go to court and once the arrangements have bedded down, this shameful legacy of the rainbow Government will be behind us.  The importance of the Minister's initiative was recognised in a recent statement <Col N="1668" /> from the Parents for Integration Group, which stated that &ldquo;we are now getting away from the era of the begging bowl and entering a new era of rights, equality and justice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The expansion of further and higher education places, together with the introduction of grants for PLC students, is extending educational opportunity to more people.  I welcome the concern the Opposition is now voicing for what is an unacceptably high level of literacy problems among our adult population.  In this as in so many other areas, we are way ahead of it and have already taken positive action.  The doubling of adult literacy funding this year was a dramatic start and we are committed to going further.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has failed to explain the reasons that we should take seriously its supposed concern to tackle educational disadvantage.</P>

Only the Independents are getting ministerial attention.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Richard Bruton on initiating this debate.  The Minister promised he would deliver, but he did not.  He did not think he would be the Minister for Education and Science; he had hoped to be side-tracked to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is misfortune or fortune that I always seem to speak after Deputy Ring in these debates.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this motion.  I was surprised that the Minister spent so much time criticising the Opposition, given that he congratulated himself on numerous occasions on the job he is doing.  I thank him for visiting Wicklow last week and for attending the funerals of the people killed in the accident during the summer.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has given additional funding to the special needs area.  I hope that trend continues, irrespective of what Minister is in power.  The Minister mentioned access to technology.  Many schools have received computers but they are not used because many teachers are not computer literate.  The INTO is running courses in conjunction with the Department, but these are held in the evenings and they may not suit people.</P>
      <P>The biggest gap in the educational system is in the provision of in-service training.  There are evening, day release and summer courses, but there is no in-service training.  Although this requires funding, teachers should be taken out of the system every four or five years and sent to St. Patrick's College or Mary Immaculate College for a couple of months to do an in-service training course.  All aspects of life, including education, in particular the teaching of reading, evolve.  I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, speak about adult literacy.  If we adopted a proper approach to teaching reading, we would not have an adult literacy problem.  There is no set standard on teaching reading in schools.  They adopt different approaches.  The Association of Children with Learning Difficulties use a multi-sen-sory system, yet most schools use a look and say system, which is antiquated compared to the standard of the association's system.  I hope the group examining the curriculum will address that matter. Many teachers are inundated with requests for reading grinds after school hours, but it is the approach to teaching reading that causes the difficulty. I hope this matter can be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> I wish to raise one of the Minister's pet subjects, the weight of school bags.  He was accosted about this in Bray last week.  A report on this matter was completed in June and it has been before the Minister for a few months.  I hope he will liaise with the Minister for Health and Children on this and move to introduce some of the recommendations of that report on this important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>In the two minutes Deputy Bruton agreed to share with me, I wish to make a special case for national schools in the drugs task force areas.  Those areas of extreme social disadvantage should not be assessed under national criteria on disadvantage in respect of the pupil-teacher ratio.  They should be assessed as having an exceptional need and the Breaking the Cycle scheme should be expanded in national schools in those areas.  Heroin is unique to those areas. The only way children who attend those schools will have any real chance of overcoming the temptation of drugs, completing second level and going on to third level is to give them an opportunity in school.</P>
      <P>It is not a coincidence that those areas have the lowest level of access to third level education in the State.  It is incredible that a Cabinet subcommittee deals with social exclusion and drugs, but an initiative has not been taken to address the problem in primary schools in those areas.  The chairman of the Government's National Strategy Committee on Drugs told a Dáil committee today that education must be the first line of defence in the war against drugs.  The previous Government's ministerial task force designated 12 areas in Dublin and one in Cork as drugs task force areas.  The 12 areas in Dublin were heroin blackspots and required urgent attention to address social disadvantage if progress was to be made against a heroin crisis.  The previous Government introduced the Breaking the Cycle scheme, which is the single most effective measure to combat social exclusion and the drugs problem.  Many of the national schools in the north inner city and in the other drugs task force areas benefit greatly from that scheme and progress is being made. However, the Minister's record to date has been disastrous in this regard.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin 1 and Dublin 7 areas, which span two heroin task force areas, no fewer than nine national schools lost teachers at the start of this school year.  As a result, junior classes were maintained at Breaking the Cycle level, but senior classes had to double up.  The progress that was made is now being wasted.  Schools which lost teachers include those in Sheriff Street, Seán Mac Dermott Street, Hardwicke Street and O'Devaney Gardens, areas of multiple depravation.  I appeal to the Minister to reverse these losses for the reasons I outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not have the Minister's attention when I made my earlier comment.  What I am requesting is supposed to be Government policy.  The drugs <Col N="1672" /> task force areas require special attention.  They do not get special attention from the Minister's Department which does not have special criteria for assessing the pupil-teacher ratio for schools in those areas.  Any attention they got was through the Breaking the Cycle scheme, which is being undermined by the Minister's failure to listen to reason and to respond to the teachers, parents and public representatives in those areas.  I appeal to him to change his attitude and to respond to these areas in a positive way.</P>

      <P>I thank the many Opposition Deputies who contributed to this debate.  Significant contributions were made and much attention was given to the problem of educational disadvantage. Not one speaker on the Government side showed a glimmer of understanding of the scale of disadvantage in our schools.  One would imagine they were ignorant of the fact that one in six of children aged 16 to 25 leave school not able to read the instructions on the back of an aspirin package.  Instead we had self-serving congratulations from the Minister downwards.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State did not grace us with his presence last night, but he seems to be well able to comment on what happened.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about what happened in the previous regime.  His comments were so transparently self-serving that anyone listening to this debate must believe the concept of politics shown by the Government parties is base.  If early school leavers, whom our education system has failed, were lining the gallery tonight, would the Minister have indulged in the type of rhetoric we heard last night?  He would not, he would have adopted a different attitude.  We would have heard him talk meaningfully and with feeling about their problems, but that was absent when he spoke last night.  We heard him make cheap jibes at the former Minister.  He was pathetic and anyone who heard him will believe that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who are the young people who leave school early?  Surveys have repeatedly shown that their ambition is to work and improve themselves, but those young people's experience of school has been universally negative.  They have been hurt, made feel small and have come out of the education system feeling resentful and alienated.  The Minister must take responsibility for that.  He has held responsibility for the education portfolio for the past two years and has failed to address the needs of those young people in the last two Books of Estimates.  We must address that reality. A total of 60 per cent of those young people are unemployed.  Those figures were not produced by <Col N="1673" /> me, the Labour Party or Democratic Left, they were gathered by the CSO.</P>
    <P>Doors are closed on those young people in our society.  They cannot access reading material or technology and are shoved into menial positions. It is impossible for them to envisage owning their own houses or providing for a family.  If those people are listening to this debate, they will be ashamed of the cant we heard from the Government benches.</P>
    <P>We in this House stand indicted of investing only £18,000 or £19,000 in the education of an early school leaver, while £50,000 is invested in the education of a graduate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <P>The Minister expected to be congratulated on his early school leaver initiative. A total of £1 million a year over the next three years will be allocated to that initiative.  The Minister must face reality.  I had to check the promises he made.  He said there would be a five year plan to tackle educational disadvantage based on the national anti-poverty strategy, but that has been forgotten.  He said staff schedules at primary levels would be based on a progressive reduction in class size, but we have not heard mention of that. He said all schools would have access to remedial teachers, but 704 schools do not have access to one.  He said administrative and caretaking services are a basic necessity for all schools, but we have not seen the provision of any of those services. The Minister admitted he will not provide one such post this year.  Guidance counsellors <Col N="1674" /> were to be appointed at second level and 20,000 early school leavers were to have personal development plans.  These are the promises the Minister made.</P>
      <P>I would applaud the Minister if he was making a genuine effort to tackle the needs of these children but that is not what he is doing.  He is taking the same old approaches and expecting something different to happen.  Nothing different will happen while he continues to follow that route. The Minister must take this issue seriously.  It is not good enough to allocate 20 per cent of his Department's budget to primary education, he must state that such education is a priority.  It is also not good enough to state that £250 million will be made available for the provision of technology. That technology must be made available after a decent service is provided to those who are disadvantaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>It has come to my notice that somewhere in the region of 1,000 cases are awaiting decision on appeal in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  There are four staff members dealing with these appeals.  I understand that the number of appeals coming in is greater than the number being dealt with.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister investigated the number of appeals which are the result of minor mistakes made by individual farmers?  Department officials seem to be using an iron hand in dealing with human error relating to one animal in a herd comprising anything between 20 and 200 or 300 animals.  As a result of such decisions in the local district veterinary office huge numbers of people are having to await decisions for up to seven months.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister intend increasing the number of staff to deal with appeals?  Does he not think the law is too strict, that the rules and regulations are being applied too stringently, and that there is a perception among applicants that Department officials see farmers as trying to buck the system?  On the basis of information I have received on a number of such decisions over the past few months, I do not accept that this is the case.  There is a problem, and it needs to be dealt with.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could inform me that he will organise extra staff to deal with the backlog, if not by the end of the year certainly by the end of February.  It is reasonable to expect that people who have a legitimate right to appeal should have their applications dealt with by that time.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The appeals unit of my Department was established to provide a channel for a review of decisions taken in local offices on applications for payments under the various headage and premium schemes which are operated as income support mechanisms within the guarantee section of FEOGA.  Most decisions taken are uncontroversial.  Applications are processed thoroughly and promptly and a decision is arrived at in accordance with the relevant EU regulations.  A small number, about 0.1 per cent of the total, are appealed to the appeals unit.</P>
      <P>The appeals unit is composed of four officers of the Department who assess each application <i>de novo</i>, that is, they examine the application from the beginning, take nothing for granted and independently assess the validity of the claim.  The independence of the unit has been at times unfairly challenged.  It has the authority to countermand decisions taken by local offices on initial consideration or internal review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than 30 per cent of appeals are upheld either fully or partially by the appeals unit.  This is a high success rate and reflects the unit's openness to the case made by an appellant.  Like local <Col N="1677" /> offices, it is nonetheless bound by the precise terms of the governing regulations which it must implement faithfully so as not to expose the Department to censure by the European Commission or the Court of Auditors and to protect the Exchequer against penalties.</P>
    <P>The quality and fair-mindedness of the appeals unit is widely recognised.  The timeliness of decisions has been, however, the subject of criticism in recent months.  Appeals are dealt with in the order in which they are received to ensure fair treatment for all appellants.  The unit has set an internal target of three months for the completion of its examination in all but the most complicated and intractable of cases.  Because of the build up of applications it has not been able to meet this target this year.  The delay was somewhat longer than the seven months suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The total number of appeals in hand is 507. Since the appeals unit was established in 1995 a total of 2,015 appeals have been lodged, of which 135 have not been pursued.  Decisions have been reached on 1,373 while 225 have been referred by the unit to the relevant local office for internal review or further information.  While the appeals in hand will be examined with the unit's customary thoroughness and impartiality, the delay in processing them is likely to be excessive unless measures are taken.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the appeals unit whose operations reflect the Department's commitment to openness and equity in its dealings with farmers should have the means to operate effectively.  For this reason I have instructed that an additional officer be appointed to the unit immediately.  This will quickly contribute to absorbing the backlog and maintaining the turnaround time at an acceptable level.  Officers of the unit, supplemented by colleagues from other divisions, have been working overtime in recent weeks to reduce the backlog and will continue to do so for a further period.  These measures should ensure that in 1999 the unit will be able to process all appeals within a satisfactory interval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Thursday the Minister for Finance made a lengthy statement in which he clearly signalled that he favoured a regionalisation approach so that additional Structural Funds could be obtained in the next tranche of funds covering the period 2000-6 which is being negotiated.  He strongly indicated that Objective One status would be sought for three sub-regions, the west, the midlands and the Border counties, an area comprising 13 counties.  The Government took its decision yesterday and added two further counties, Clare and Kerry, to these sub-regions.</P>
      <P>So far the Government has provided no estimate of the amount of money it expects to receive in the next tranche of Structural Funds. About £1 billion accrues annually to the Exchequer in Structural and Cohesion Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> The expectation of the rainbow coalition Government was that, while there would be a scaling down of this sum, it would still be possible to negotiate about £700 million for each of the seven years from 2000 to 2006 giving a total of slightly under £5 billion which by any standards is an enormous amount of money.  Will the Minister of State confirm that the estimate of the previous Government is still in line with Government expectations?</P>
    <P>The debate on Structural Funds which has followed the Government's decision has concentrated on the additional amount which could be delivered through a regionalisation approach.  A figure of £120 million over five years has been mentioned.  While this is a significant amount, it is relatively small in contrast with the expectations of £5 billion, the figure in circulation when we left office.  The Minister of State should clarify the situation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate everybody in the 13 counties whose areas are included.  The Celtic tiger's influence has been spread unevenly.  While GDP in the country as a whole increased by 21 per cent in the period 1991-5, in the three sub-regions in question it increased only by between 13 and 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>The change in the distribution of the population which has occurred in the past 30 years also supports a regional approach.  The proportion of the national population in the regional authority areas of Dublin and the mid-east has risen from 34 to 39 per cent while it has fallen in the west, midlands and Border counties from 30 to 27 per cent.  Last week the Minister informed us that only 23 per cent of grant-aided jobs created in the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 were created in the west, the midlands and Border counties.  This is due principally to poor infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies are concerned that their constituencies have not been included in the Government's application.  They could hold the line if the application was confined to the 13 counties originally chosen but the inclusion of Kerry and Clare has undermined the position of many Deputies in their constituencies.  It is not the Structural Funds issue that is of primary concern but the fact that a higher level of grant aid may be paid to industries setting up in the favoured regions.  Many fear that the counties not included will experience a kind of industrial blight along their boundaries.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider including DEDs outside the 15 counties but contiguous with them in the Government's application to Brussels?  The DED is the smallest unit used for statistical mapping by EUROSTAT.  We are familiar with its use as the smallest unit in relation to the disadvantaged areas scheme.  If the Government accepts this proposal, it will ensure areas as disadvantaged as the areas included in the application but contiguous to them are considered by EUROSTAT.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Minister, when he made his statement last Thursday, did not expect <Col N="1679" /> Clare and Kerry to be added to the sub-regions. He said:</P>
    <P>Consideration could be given to including some adjoining counties in the new NUTS II region with Objective One status.  This would, however, involve consequential changes at the next level, NUTS III, which might not be acceptable to EUROSTAT and might also endanger qualification for Objective One status by breaching the 75 per cent GDP threshold.</P>
    <P>It is clear that neither the Minister nor the Department favoured the addition of the two counties mentioned in the application.  It is also clear that political pressure was exerted during the weekend which influenced the political decision made by the Cabinet at its meeting on Tuesday.</P>
    <P>The criteria for inclusion in Objective One is that the <i>per capita</i> income of a region be less than 75 per cent of GDP.  The Government has made its case on the basis of the 1995 figures.  I understand that at noon tomorrow EUROSTAT will publish the 1996 figures.  As the CSO prepared these figures for EUROSTAT, I presume the Government had access to them in advance of the decision.  Will the Commission make its decision on the basis of the 1996 figures or taking into account the average over 1994, 1995 and 1996?  Will the <i>per capita</i> figures announced tomorrow strengthen or weaken the Government's position in respect of the 15 counties for which Objective One status has been sought?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House knows, the Government decided yesterday to pursue an application to EUROSTAT, the statistical service of the European Commission, for a change from Ireland's current status as a single region to one comprising two regions.  This application will be sent to EUROSTAT soon <i>via</i> the Director General of the CSO.  The application involves a reclassification of Ireland's statistical regions in the European Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units.  One region would comprise the current regional authority areas of the west, which now includes Counties Clare and Kerry, the Border and midlands.  The other region would comprise the rest of the country.  The inclusion of Clare and Kerry in the regional authority area of the west will ensure that the new Objective One region will encompass the western seaboard from Donegal to Kerry, an area on the periphery of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthwhile to outline once again the circumstances which form the background to the Government's decision.  As everyone now knows, because of our increased prosperity, the country as a single region no longer qualifies for Objective One status for Structural Fund purposes. Under EU rules, regions which have a <i>per capita</i> GDP below this 75 per cent threshold are classified <Col N="1680" /> as Objective One and qualify for the highest level of EU support.  Ireland's <i>per capita</i> GDP is now well above the 75 per cent threshold and there is no prospect of securing Objective One status for the whole country.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Government, when making its decision, had regard to three factors.  First, no difference existed in the past between the various sub-regions in their eligibility for Structural Funds.  Negotiating support and managing the funds on a national basis gave maximum flexibility without compromising our capacity to target regional inequalities.  Expenditure per head in the west, Border and midlands exceeded the national average.  However, the regions of the west, including the two counties mentioned, the Border and midlands, because of their low GDP levels in comparison with the EU average, would continue to qualify for Objective One status in the next round of Structural Funding from 2000-6. This reflects the fact that they have not developed the industrial and service industries which have strengthened the economic base of the rest of the country.  This points to the need to adopt a new approach to regional development, including the management of Structural Fund transfers.</P>
    <P>A second key factor is that this region would also qualify for a higher level of assistance by way of industrial grants from national agencies, such as IDA industrial promotion grants, in line with EU State aid rules.  This is in line with the Government's commitment in An Action Pro-gramme for the Millennium to bring about improved targeting of the problems of regions of the country which, despite Ireland's recent economic progress, are lagging behind.  The develop-ment of an economic base for the future in the west would therefore be facilitated.</P>
    <P>A third factor underlying the Government's decision is that regionalisation will also keep open the possibility of continued EU assistance on a transition basis for this region in the period following the next round of funding after 2006.  I listened carefully to what Deputy Noonan said when he quoted certain figures and I do not believe he considered the prospect of what the funding would be beyond 2006, which is an important element of the total package.  We are not just focusing on the period 2000-6 but are also including what happens in transition after that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the next tranche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the position must be established now.  Many comments have been made to the effect that a regionalisation approach means the Government is turning its back on the poor and socially excluded.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I emphasise that the regionalisation approach will not deflect it from its commitment to tackle social exclusion, urban or rural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding those programmes in the area of social exclusion eligible for EU co-financing <Col N="1681" /> under the current round, the Government will, within the overall parameters of EU and other funding available in the two proposed new regions, ensure that the objectives of these programmes remain a priority in both regions. Assistance for initial education and training and reskilling opportunities for the unemployed and those with inadequate qualifications will continue to be available in both regions.  There will continue to be support for early school leavers, local enterprise development and the integrated development of disadvantaged areas within the new regions, especially in urban blackspots.</P>
    <P>The Government will also press at European level for the retention of the URBAN community initiative.  The Commission's proposals do not provide for its retention, but the Government believes that, as it funds important schemes in urban blackspots in Dublin and Cork, it should be retained.  I am happy to report that Ireland's stance on this issue has attracted support not only from other member states but also from a range of MEPs.  In other urban areas, such as Waterford and Limerick people in disadvantaged areas suffer from social exclusion.  Their problems must also be addressed in the context of the formulation of the next national plan.</P>
    <P>Social exclusion is not just confined to urban areas.  The Government is also conscious of the position of traditionally deprived areas bordering on counties in the proposed new Objective One region.  In its discussions with the Commission on Structural Funds, the Government will seek to have account taken of these areas.  In addition, the Government will, in drawing up the national development plan, pay attention to the needs of these areas.</P>
    <P>The scope for regional reclassification is limited. We do not have the option of designating micro-regions, such as urban blackspots, so that they can avail of Objective One funding.  Such funding goes to NUTS II regions which must consist of geographically contiguous areas which come within the EU norms as regards area and population.  The Structural and Cohesion Funds have played an important role in developing Ireland's infrastructure, encouraging industrial development, fostering human resources capabilities and countering social exclusion.  More investment in these and other areas is needed throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>The regionalisation application, if successful, does not change the fact that we are facing a reduction in Structural and Cohesion Fund receipts compared with the current round.  The Government recognises that, reflecting our increased prosperity, we must be able to meet more of our investment needs from our own resources.  However, it remains the Government's intention to continue to press in the Agenda 2000 negotiations for the maximum share for Ireland and the proposed two new regions.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme contains a wide range of policy initiatives designed to secure Ireland's economic and social development.  It has <Col N="1682" /> already put significant additional resources into key programmes designed to improve services in areas such as health and education.  The Government's expansion of the capital investment pro-gramme up to 23 per cent in 1999 will continue to develop Ireland's economic potential while at the same time improving facilities in social services. The budgetary situation means Ireland is now in a strong position to continue these programmes throughout the country in future.  As long as we continue with the prudent policies which have played a major part in securing the economic growth of recent years, we should have the ability to manage the appropriately phased reduction in EU aid for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that a revised regional structure is needed in the context of the regionalisation proposal.  This will be the subject of discussion in Brussels as part of the regionalisation application and will take account of the views of regional interests.  Accordingly, the Government will be initiating early contact with the existing regional authorities.  After these discussions and consultations, it will make a decision on the final shape of a revised regional structure. The Government stresses that a major consideration is that the efficient and effective administration and control of Structural Funds spending, for which Ireland enjoys a just reputation, must not be jeopardised, especially in the period of declining overall assistance from Europe.  An application will shortly be lodged with EUROSTAT and the Government hopes it will be settled satisfactorily and quickly to enable preparations for the next national plan to go ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous issue is not unrelated to the issue I want to raise.  The Minister of State has just discussed the macro aspects of the changes we are seeing but I want to examine a micro incident in an area which is deprived and in need of assistance.</P>
      <P>In the past 15 years there have been 27 serious floodings in the village of Dromcollogher, County Limerick.  The situation became so serious in September 1997 that Limerick County Council decided to request Gibson O'Connor, Consulting Engineers, to examine and report on the overall problem of flooding in the village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The village has experienced severe flooding over a prolonged period but the most serious event took place on the night of 26 August and the morning of 27 August 1997.  On that occasion flooding disastrously affected the eastern part of the village with several homes in the Pike Street area flooded to a depth of 0.5 metres.  Water flowed down the road leading from Carroward townland for the full width of the carriageway and inundated Pike Street and Pound Street in the eastern area of the village.  Serious overloading of the combined sewers within the village occurred and raw sewage overflowed onto the streets and into the houses.  The matter was <Col N="1683" /> reported to the Mid-Western Health Board by a local medical practitioner and the board in turn referred the matter to Limerick County Council.</P>
    <P>Flooding also occurred on the west side of the village near the church where the Ahavarraga stream overflowed causing flooding to roads in the vicinity.  Downstream of the villages, bridges and culverts backed up and surrounding lands were flooded.  The undermining of the abutments of one bridge required immediate emergency reconstruction works.</P>
    <P>Neither of the two stream channels flowing through the village of Dromcollogher are capable of discharging the level of flooding which occurred.  In particular, the channel capacity of the Carroward stream is totally inadequate in the section which passes through the village.  Flood relief works to this channel could be carried out either by the construction of a major culvert through the village or by reverting this stream to the Ahavarraga stream upstream of the village and carrying out channel improvement works in the Ahavarraga stream where it passes through the village.</P>
    <P>A major problem exists, however, in the river downstream of Dromcollogher.  This was clearly demonstrated by the serious flooding which occurred downstream of the village on 26 and 27 August 1997.  At that time, a local structural steel fabrication works was inundated and the village sewage treatment works had to be bypassed with raw sewage overflowing directly into the river. Flooding as high as road level was experienced in the Ahavarraga stream and as far downstream as Moyvane Bridge, some two kilometres below the village.</P>
    <P>The report produced by Messrs.  Gibson O'Connor states: &ldquo;The very serious lack of capacity in the river below the bridge results in a backwater effect which significantly contributes to the flooding in the village&rdquo;.  It is imperative that the co-operation and assistance of the Office of Public Works be obtained with the objective of carrying out channel improvement works at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister arrange for that to be done because it is almost two years since the report was submitted to him?  Until such time as river improvement work is carried out downstream of Dromcollogher, any flood relief works to channels through the village will not effect significant improvements.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to respond to this serious issue.  It affects a small but significant area in west Limerick close to the Kerry border which will soon have funding that will not be available to alleviate the problem in Dromcollogher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue because I have received a number of questions recently about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity of addressing the <Col N="1684" /> problem.  Dromcollogher is situated within the River Deel catchment.  The Commissioners of Public Works carried out an arterial drainage scheme known as the River Deel catchment drainage scheme which commenced in 1962 and ended in 1968.  The main channel was improved from Askeaton in County Limerick to a point three and a half miles south of Milford village in County Cork.  In addition, almost 250 kilometres of tributary channels were improved.  The streams which flow through Dromcollogher enter the River Deel catchment drainage scheme at channel C23 which is approximately two and a half miles downstream.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy said, there have been a significant number of instances of flooding, particularly of roads, recorded in Dromcollogher dating back to 1984 with houses being flooded on some occasions.  On the night of 26 August and the morning of 27 August 1997 there was very severe flooding in Dromcollogher.  Following this event, Limerick County Council commissioned a firm of consulting engineers to examine the causes of the flooding and to indicate the probable scale of corrective works required.</P>
    <P>Their preliminary report indicated that neither of the two stream channels flowing through Dromcollogher are capable of discharging the flood.  In fact, the capacity of the Carroward stream is totally inadequate in the section which passes through the village.</P>
    <P>The report also indicated that the capacity of the channel immediately downstream needed to be increased because it had a backwater effect which also significantly contributed to flooding in the village.  However, these recommended works are outside of the Office of Public Works maintenance responsibilities for the Deel catchment drainage scheme.  The backwater effect is not caused by a channel which is maintainable under the scheme.  There is a fall of approximately 90 feet in the stream from the village of Dromcollogher to where it enters the maintainable channel.</P>
    <P>The 1995 amendment to the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act gave powers to the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake flood relief schemes, where appropriate, for the alleviation of localised flooding.  However, the resources of the Commissioners of Public Works are fully committed, for the foreseeable future, to advancing to completion the schemes originally selected for priority attention under the Urban Flood Relief Programme.  Consequently, no progress has been made regarding the preparation of a flood relief scheme for Dromcollogher and it is unlikely we will have the resources to do so for some time to come.</P>
    <P>While the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995, may give powers to the Commissioners to undertake flood relief schemes for the alleviation of localised flooding, it does not make them liable for the relief of all flooding in the country, nor does it abrogate local authorities from their responsibilities to undertake such schemes within <Col N="1685" /> their areas as provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue relating to carers in advance of the budget in December.  Every Deputy in the House knows the sacrifice thousands of carers make every day of the week for their loved ones.  Over the years, we have developed an <i>ad hoc</i> system of support for carers in our society.  That system has not received the priority or the funding it deserves.  Now that the strong economic performance of recent years has produced significant Exchequer returns, it is time to acknowledge the role of carers in our society.</P>
      <P>There is a perception that the problems of carers do not affect us.  That is a serious misunderstanding. We are all potential carers.  Who is to say when or if we will experience the emotional, physical and financial effects of caring for a loved one struck down by accident, illness or the effects of old age?  This sacrifice is the reality of life for approximately 100,000 people throughout the country.  However, at present only approximately 11,000 people receive the carer's allowance of a miserly £73.50 per week.  The forthcoming budget must address the legitimate demands of carers. There must be a substantial increase in the carer's allowance and a commitment to improve the whole area of community care.  This would entail the provision of more professional workers such as public health nurses and occupational therapists. To co-ordinate the delivery of these services a liaison person within each community care area, who would assess the needs of carers and liaise with them and the statutory services, should also be appointed.</P>
      <P>There is a consensus of opinion in the House that the means test discriminates against people caring for an elderly family member.  Extension of the carer's allowance to people who do not come within the means test limit is essential and must be a priority in the budget.  The carer's allowance should be a realistic attempt to provide carers with the means to care effectively for their loved ones.  Carers often give up paid employment or their potential to engage in paid employment to care for family members in the home.  Many daughters give up the prospect of marriage to care for a loved one.  There should also be a new non-means tested cost-of-care allowance to cover the hidden costs of caring, such as heating, laundry, special dietary requirements and so on.</P>

    <P>In addition to reform of the carer's allowance, it is essential that we develop an adequate system of respite care.  The importance of this facility for people with a mental handicap received a full airing in the House last week.  A carer's ability to continue caring, thereby saving the State thousands of pounds in residential care costs, depends on the carer having a life and interests apart from caring.  Time off is vital to enable a carer to develop outside interests and to devote time to <Col N="1686" /> other members of the family circle.  Breaks from the ongoing pressures are a basic necessity and resources must be invested in these facilities to ensure every carer is offered a break at regular and planned intervals.  The Minister for Health and Children and Minster of State with responsibility for older people have given commitments over the past 18 months to radically improve the position of carers in Irish society.  Now is the time for the Government to honour these commitments. Actions speak louder than words.  Now that finance is available, there is a moral and political obligation on the State to establish a humane and adequate care system for people who are ill and infirm and for those who dedicate their lives to looking after them.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply and to monitoring developments in this area during the lifetime of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for raising this issue on the Adjournment.  The extremely important role played by carers in supporting people at home is widely recognised.</P>
      <P>A significant proportion of dependent people who are looked after by carers are in the older age category.  Current policy towards the care of older people is guided by Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly, published in 1988.  It provides a framework for the development of health, personal social services and housing to assist older people.  The cornerstone of policy towards older people is to support older people at home in dignity and independence and when this is no longer possible to ensure ill and dependent older people have access to the highest quality hospital and residential care when they require it.</P>
      <P>The primary responsibility of the Department of Health and Children lies in the provision of front line health services.  The health services which impact most on carers are respite and day care together with community nursing and paramedical services and home help services.</P>
      <P>In recent years additional resources have been provided to develop community support services. For example, professional support staff have been appointed by the Eastern Health Board to work with older people in their homes.  These are known as community ward teams and they facilitate the early planned discharge of older people from acute general hospitals by the provision of rehabilitation and care in the person's home. They also prevent or delay the admission of older people to long stay care and enhance other service supports, including public health nursing, day care, carer support and respite services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the mental handicap side, home support services were initiated in 1992 with the purpose of providing additional support to carers where persons with a mental handicap were either waiting for placement in day or residential services or wished to continue to live with their families.  The response to the services from both carers and agencies has been very positive and the services <Col N="1687" /> have been enhanced and expanded annually.  The home support services enable agencies to respond to the needs of individual families in a flexible manner and with a package of care which is designed in consultation with the carers.  During 1997 more than 2,200 people benefited from these services.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Department of Health and Children's responsibility towards carers lies in the area of provision of mainstream health services and, in particular, the provision of relief care of various kinds, that is day centres, short-term and holiday relief care, night-sitting &mdash; freeing the carer for a number of hours &mdash; and domiciliary relief care.  I accept there is some distance to go in developing such a network.  It is my intention to develop a comprehensive range of services, <Col N="1688" /> both institutional and community based, for older people including specialist geriatric units, extended care, home nursing, home helps, paramedical services, day care and respite care on a phased basis over the next few years.  These would all have a positive impact on carers.  This process has already commenced.  In 1998 the capital programme for older people has more than doubled.  This will result in the provision of an additional 200 day care places and 30 respite places.</P>
    <P>I accept the need to provide greater support for carers and this is being actively considered in terms of the availability of additional resources in 1999.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 19 November 1998.</P>

      <P>As we near the close of the Government's 1798 commemoration programme I am delighted, as chairperson of the Commemoration Committee to take this opportunity to outline the events organised or assisted, as part of that programme by my committee.</P>
      <P>As you know it was my committee's intention to develop a broad ranging, comprehensive and inclusive programme which commemorated the ideals of the Untied Irishmen and the &lsquo;Fellowship of Freedom&rsquo; that inspired them in 1798.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, it was felt that the commemoration programme should focus primary attention on the principles of democracy and pluralism which the United Irishmen advocated.  Projects such as the international conference, &lsquo;1798: A Bicentenary Perspective&rsquo;, the National Museum and National Library's interactive exhibition at Collins Barracks, the Irish and British Governments 1798 commemoration scholarship and the RTE documentary series &lsquo;Rebellion&rsquo; are examples of projects funded which I think duly reflected my committee's objectives.</P>
      <P>My committee was also happy to fund projects such as the Dublin/Belfast Choral Festival, the publication of Wolfe Tone's diaries and the Drennan Papers, the Humbert and Merriman Schools and the restoration of the William Lawless Tomb in Paris.  Plans to circulate an education pack to schools are under way.  The Film Institute of Irelands Film Festival was a great success and the Glencree Peace Centre is continuing to develop its programme &lsquo;From Revolution to Reconciliation&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>The development of the Croppies' Acre Site at Collins Barracks as a memorial garden is under way and will be opened by me on 22 November.</P>
      <P>I think we can all agree that the 1798 Centre at Enniscorthy, which I opened earlier this year is a shining example of what can be done when State and local bodies work together with a single goal in mind.  The centre and its exciting interactive 1798 exhibition I know will continue to attract a large number of visitors for a long time to come.</P>
      <P>Many ceremonies have taken place over the past ten months to mark the rebellion.  One such ceremony attended by me and involving the French military and our own Defence Forces took place in Ballina on 22 August to acknowledge France's involvement in 1798.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the commemoration period funding has been made available at local level to many projects throughout the country.  Armagh, Antrim, Cavan, Carlow, Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Down, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois and Leitrim, <Col N="1690" /> Longford, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Sligo, Tipperary, Wicklow and Wexford all benefited from funding.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, given the limited budget available it was not possible to fund all of the many worthy projects under way throughout the country and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all of the local committees who have worked tirelessly to make their commemoration initiatives a success.</P>
    <P>I would also like this opportunity to thank my committee for all their work in developing this broad ranging and inclusive 1798 programme of commemoration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 41, 67, 95 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>Statistics in relation to prostate cancer are collected by the National Cancer Registry Board and the Central Statistics Office.  In its latest report on Cancer in Ireland, 1995, incidence and mortality, the National Cancer Registry Board indicated that the number of new cases of prostate cancer recorded in 1995 was 1,083.  The average age of newly-diagnosed patients was 74 years, and the largest number of new cases arose in the 70-74 age group.</P>
      <P>The number of deaths from prostate cancer over the past five years ranged between 474 and 540.  The figures, collected by the National Cancer Registry Board and the Central Statistics Office are as follows: 1993, 491; 1994, 474; 1995, 514; 1996, 521; 1997, 540.</P>
      <P>There is considerable international debate about the value of prostate cancer screening programmes. There is as yet no clear consensus about the effectiveness of the screening procedures used to detect prostate cancer.  Neither has it been established that screening for prostate cancer reduces mortality from the disease.  While there are various claims of progress in relation to prostate screening programmes, it is too early to determine whether a pilot screening programme in this area would be appropriate.  I intend to keep the international evidence under constant review.</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Forum, an expert group which advises me in relation to cancer issues, is of the view that pilot screening programmes for various forms of cancer must not be introduced until the efficacy of the screening procedure has been clearly established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also debate among medical experts <Col N="1692" /> regarding the most appropriate treatment of men diagnosed with the disease.  Some experts argue that observation rather than specific treatment is the most appropriate means of dealing with prostate cancer, especially in older men.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concern of Deputies regarding the calls for screening programmes for prostate cancer.  However, I must have regard to the expert medical evidence which indicates that as yet there is no clear agreement regarding the efficacy of the test for prostate cancer, the effectiveness of treatment regimes and the ability of screening programmes to reduce the number of deaths from the disease.</P>
    <P>Extensive trials on screening for prostate cancer are already under way.  The National Cancer Institute in the USA and the European cancer programme are engaging in major studies involving over 120,000 men to study the potential value of specific screening programmes.  It is hoped that the trials will also provide valuable information about mortality, identification of high-risk groups and the most appropriate screening intervals, if such screening is proved to be medically effective.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I will keep the case for a prostate cancer screening programme under review, in conjunction with the expert opinion available to me from the chief medical officer of my Department and the National Cancer Forum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>Temporary bed closures to date in 1998 have accounted for a total of 74,379 bed days nationally.  The total projected number of bed days associated with temporary closures for the whole of 1998 is 90,398.  This amounts to less than 2.5 per cent of the total number of bed days available in the system.  The figure represents an average monthly number of beds temporarily closed of 207, or almost 1.7 per cent of the total number of 12,267 acute hospital beds available nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Activity in the acute hospital system is planned by local management over a 12 month period, having regard to anticipated levels of emergency <Col N="1693" /> admissions and the overall resources available. This forms a central part of the service planning process which is required of health boards under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, and which is also engaged in by other agencies not at this stage covered by the Act.  In 1998, for the first time, hospitals were advised of their funding allocation under the waiting list initiative at the beginning of the year.  This has enabled improved planning of elective activity for the year as agencies can take account, from the outset, of both projected core activity and activity to be performed under the waiting list initiative in the target specialities.</P>
    <P>In achieving activity targets set out in the annual service plan, temporary bed closures form a part of the normal bed management function performed by local hospital management within an overall budgetary management strategy.  These temporary closures also facilitate annual leave, the usual scaling down of elective activity during the summer months and the Christmas season and ongoing refurbishment works.  It is important, therefore, that they are viewed in the context of overall levels of activity delivered in the acute hospital sector against agreed service plans for the 12 month period.  In this context, it should be noted that the total number of discharges, both in-patient and day-patient, for all hospitals for the first nine months of this year was almost 3 per cent up on the same period last year.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that the number of overnight beds in the system at any given time does not reflect the complete picture of activity in modern hospitals.  For example, trends in medical practice in recent years have been for a marked shift in care from in-patient level to day case and out-patient level together with reduced average lengths of stay and increased bed occupancy rates.  To illustrate this point, overall acute hospital in-patient activity for January to September 1998 shows an increase of just over 1 per cent over the same period in 1997, while the corresponding increase in day activity is almost 7 per cent.  This significant increase in day work clearly underlines the fact that a temporary reduction in bed numbers in any given location will not necessarily correlate to a similar reduction in activity in terms of total bed days used.</P>
    <P>My policy since taking office has been to ensure that the hospital system continues to respond efficiently, effectively and equitably to the needs of the population and that it is appropriately resourced to provide high quality hospital services in meeting these objectives.  Towards this end, I provided an additional £44 million for acute hospital services at the outset of 1998 to provide for ongoing developments, including improvements in accident and emergency services, to commission new units completed under the capital programme and to tackle waiting lists and waiting times.  It is my intention to build further on this in 1999.</P>
    <P>It is essential, however, that this is done in the context of an agreed framework for approved <Col N="1694" /> budget and service plans.  In this regard, I have no plans to review the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996, which provides this fundamental framework and which was, of course, proposed to the Oireachtas by the previous Government.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet committee established to oversee the preparation of a Green Paper on Abortion has met on two occasions.  Work on the drafting of the Green Paper is proceeding.  When the drafting has been completed I intend to convene another meeting of the Cabinet committee, when it will commence consideration of the draft.  Publication of the Green Paper must await a final decision of the Government in due course.  I acknowledge that the process is taking longer than expected but I would point out that any dates given by me are at all times indicative, pending final approval by Government.</P>
      <P>Statistics published by the Office for National Statistics, London indicate that 5,336 women resident in Ireland had legal abortions carried out in England and Wales in 1997.  The latest quarterly figures available are in respect of the quarter ending 30 June 1998 and these indicate that 1,495 women resident in Ireland had legal abortions carried out in England and Wales during this period. This compares to a figure of 1,352 for the same period last year and represents an increase of 10.58 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1995 my Department has provided substantial funding for pregnancy counselling services for women with crisis pregnancies.  In 1998 this funding amounted to £700,000.  Funding is also allocated to health boards in respect of family planning services being provided by the boards themselves and by voluntary agencies and general practitioners.  In 1998 the amount provided was £1.935 million.  Following publication of the &ldquo;Women and Crisis Pregnancy&rdquo; study earlier this year my Department asked health boards to review the adequacy of family planning and counselling <Col N="1695" /> services in their areas and, in the light of the study's findings, to indicate what service developments they considered appropriate.  A number of proposals have been made by the health boards and I expect that additional funding for the further development of services will be available in the context of the 1999 Estimates.</P>

      <P>The statistical information sought by the Deputy is not routinely gathered by my Department. However, I have asked the health boards to provide this data and I will communicate further with the Deputy when this becomes available.</P>
      <P>Occupational therapy services form part of a set of generic services provided by the health boards and voluntary agencies for a range of people including those with physical and sensory disabilities, mental handicap and the elderly.

      <P>As set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, this Government is committed to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of health services, this commitment comprehends the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future published in December 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towards an Independent Future sets out the requirements for the development of services in the physical and sensory disability sector, including occupational therapy services, over a five year period.  The report recommends the appointment of an additional 80 occupational therapists.  In its first six months in office, this Government allocated £10 million by way of once-off funding to address immediate and pressing problems in the sector, namely, the provision of aids and appliances and the elimination of deficits of the voluntary agencies providing services.  This year a further £8.4 million has been allocated comprising £5.4 million additional revenue and £3 million for capital projects.  Of the £5.4 million revenue, £3 million has been specifically earmarked for the development of services in the sector including occupational therapy services.  From this funding, the health boards will be appointing a further 11 occupational therapists as well as providing financial <Col N="1696" /> support to voluntary agencies providing this service.</P>
    <P>While occupational therapy services would be viewed as part of the multi-disciplinary team approach in the development and provision of services for people with mental handicap, there are no specific recommendations regarding the service in respect of this sector.  However, the enhancement of support services generally, including occupational therapy, would be part of the overall development of services as outlined in my Department's report entitled Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001.</P>
    <P>The role of occupational therapists in the care of the elderly is acknowledged in the framework document, The Years Ahead &mdash; a Policy for the Elderly.  As part of my Department's plans to improve community based services for the elderly in the next few years, it is expected that funding will be provided for the recruitment of additional occupational therapists.</P>

      <P>The provision of services at St, Colman's Hospital, Rathdrum is the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.  I understand that the board provides a range of services for older people including assessment, rehabilitation, respite-intermittent care, welfare, day care and residential care, While not having a dedicated unit for patients with dementia, the hospital cares for such persons, including those with Alzheimer's disease, within the existing units.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health board in conjunction with the local community is currently considering the hospital's priority needs which include, <i>inter alia</i>, the creation of an enhanced environment for Alzheimer-dementia patients by the provision of additional day space which will improve the quality of life of the residents.  I can assure the Deputy that any proposals received from the Eastern Health Board in this regard will be given the fullest consideration in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 7 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that a child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents.  This article further provides that States party to the Convention shall ensure the implementation of these rights in accordance with their national law.</P>
      <P>Legislation relating to the registration of births is set out in the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1996 which include provisions for the entry of paternity details in the register of births.  Qualified informants, which include parents, are required to give the information necessary for the registration of a birth within 42 days of the birth.</P>
      <P>The information registered includes the child's name and surname and the name, address and occupation and former surnames of both parents. Particular provisions exist to facilitate the registration of paternity details in respect of children born to parents not married to each other.</P>
      <P>The Status of Children Act, 1987 amended section 7 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland), 1880 by the substitution of sections 7 and 7A . These sections set out the procedures allowing for the registration of paternity details where the parents are not married to each other &mdash; including registration of the father's details in the register of births on the joint application for registration by the parents or on the application by one or other parents with the co-operation of the other parent.  Provision is also made for registration of paternity details on the sole application of either the father or the mother of the child on the production of a certified copy of a court order naming the father of the child.</P>
      <P>The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child examined Ireland's First National Report under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child last January.  In the committee's concluding observations concern was expressed regarding the disadvantaged situation of children born from unmarried parents due to the lack of appropriate procedures to include the identity of the father in the birth registration of the child and the committee recommended that all appropriate measures be taken for establishing, as far as possible, procedures for the inclusion of the name of the father in the birth certificates of children born from unmarried parents and consideration is being given to this recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to providing a high quality range of services in relation to breast cancer.  At present, urgent appointments for mammograms are normally seen within a few days of referral. The criteria for urgent cases include the existence of a breast lump, previous family history of breast cancer and other factors which indicate a high risk of breast cancer.</P>
      <P>Women with no symptoms, or who otherwise do not give cause for immediate concern as an urgent case, are seen as quickly as possible but must be subject to careful prioritisation by the appropriate medical personnel.  In view of the demands placed upon mammography services, some hospitals may refer women to their general practitioner for a further assessment of priority. Where a woman is concerned about the length of time that she has to wait for a mammogram, she can ask her general practitioner to discuss her case with a consultant radiologist, who decides upon the priority of cases.  I must emphasise that hospitals review their caseload regularly so that women with an urgent cause for concern are seen without delay.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing mammograph services, I am committed to introducing a national breast screening programme which will be aimed at detecting breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Phase one of the programme comprises the Eastern, Midland and North-Eastern Health Board areas.  I am pleased to report that advertisements for the necessary consultant and support staff for the programme were recently placed.  I will be making the necessary funding available for these staff which comprise six consultant radiologists, two surgeons, two histopatholocists, one epidemiologist, 14 radiographers, two specialist breast care nurses, one physicist and a number of administrative and support staff.</P>
      <P>I have already approved funding of £2 million to date to cover start-up costs and capital equipment. In addition, I approved a grant of £1.035 million towards the refurbishment of facilities at the Mater Hospital as a screening and assessment unit and as the headquarters of the programme. I also approved a grant of £897,750 towards the construction of screening unit facilities at St. Vincent's Hospital.  I am confident that the funding I have provided will help us to continue developing our breast cancer services so that mortality rates from this disease are reduced.</P>

      <Quest>the extent of the capital and revenue budget overruns at Tallaght Hospital, Dublin 24; his views on whether the original allocation was inadequate; and the steps, if any, he will take to rectify the situation.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23963/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with the capital and revenue issues separately.  Regarding capital this major project which commenced on site in 1993 is now in its final stages.  The construction element of the project is practically complete and the preparation of the final certificates is imminent.  The Deputy will be aware that at this stage of a construction project and prior to the issue of the final certificates from the architects, detailed cost negotiations relating to the final cost of the project take place.  This project is now at this stage and, accordingly, I am advised that the cost issues are commercially sensitive until such time as the final accounts are agreed.  For this reason, I am unable to provide the Deputy with any estimate of the final account at this time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the equipping costs associated with the hospital, I am informed that the Tallaght Regional Hospital Board has equipped the hospital as it is now functioning, within the agreed budget.  However, some additional equipping requests have been identified by the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Childrens Hospital and I am awaiting a report on this matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding revenue the Deputy will be aware that the hospital's outturn for July 1998, which was its first full month in operation from its new location in Tallaght, showed a significant overrun against the hospital's budget and the board of management having been asked to review the figures confirmed the hospital's budgetary difficulties on 24 September last.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the degree of the projected deficit for 1998, approximately £21 million, I initiated an independent review of the data submitted by the board of management.  This review is also examining the arrangements within the organisation for service planning and associated staffing and financial budgets, and the processes, systems and practices for reporting and control. As I stated earlier today in a reply to Deputy Shatter, this review is not yet complete.  Consequently, I am not in a position at this stage to make any further comment as to the extent of the revenue budget overrun.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the original allocation for the hospital was inadequate.  This year's revenue determination for Tallaght is £53.659 million.  In addition, £3.7 million has been provided for the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospital, the bulk of which is Tallaght-related.  This brings the total to £57.4 million.  This funding represents additional funds of £5.9 million to facilitate the hospital moving to Tallaght and setting up services for the second half of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1700" /> In addition, adequate funding has been set aside to cover all the industrial relations costs associated with the move to Tallaght from the three base hospitals.  The 56 bedded psychiatric unit will be funded in addition to the above by the EHB.  As I have previously stated, I am extremely concerned with regard to the problem at Tallaght and the independent report will receive my immediate attention after it is received.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 39, 56, 82 and 146 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have approved a multimillion pound investment programme to support the reorganisation and redevelopment of the BTSB nationally.  The primary objective is to ensure that the BTSB is resourced to provide a transfusion service in line with best international standards.  I am making significant additional resources available to the BTSB to support the following programmes: a new national headquarters at a cost of approximately £25 million; the introduction of new technologies to improve the safety of the blood supply, at a total annual cost of £4.7 million; and additional staff appointments.  Additional medical consultants will be recruited including consultant support to be located at the Cork centre.  My Department has also approved the recruitment of four additional quality assurance staff, two of which will be at the Cork centre.  The total <Col N="1701" /> additional costs of the development programme, excluding the capital funding, will be approximately £6.5 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>I am also providing a total of approximately £4 million to replace the existing IT system to ensure year 2000 compliance.  These resources will ensure the accelerated implementation of the new IT system which involves the Cork centre in particular.  Five technical staff at the centre have been released on a full time basis on this project. Resources have been made available to backfill these five posts, one person has been released full time on the IT project at the Dublin centre and that position has also been backfilled.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board is licensed by the Irish Medicines Board to collect and process whole blood and human plasma for the use in the manufacture of medicinal products. The BTSB is not a manufacturer of blood products. It collects plasma for fractionation abroad, which is used for the production of blood products such as albumin and plasma-derived Factor IX which are used in Irish hospitals.  The Irish Medicines Board is a statutory independent body and is the regulatory authority for the BTSB. Accordingly, the regulatory requirements specified by the IMB must be met by the BTSB in order to retain their licence.  The manner in which these requirements are met is a matter for the BTSB, provided it meets with the approval of the IMB.  For my part, I will ensure that the BTSB is sufficiently resourced to ensure regulatory compliance. The BTSB's current manufacturing licence covers the period 1 August 1998 to 31 October 1999.  There are four conditions attached to the licence as follows: validation of the existing computer system for control of donations and components at the Dublin and Cork centres; the new computer system to be installed in both centres is to be fully validated; a construction and validation timetable is to be provided in relation to the new national headquarters; and replacement of the area for the processing of donations at the Cork centre.  Considerable work has been completed to date on the validation of the existing system, and additional work is ongoing.  The IMB's validation requirements for the new system, which is currently being installed and will be operational before the end of next year, will also be met.  The new system is one which is in use in a number of European and American blood centres.</P>
    <P>As regards the requirement for capital investment in the Cork centre to meet regulatory requirements, a number of options have been considered by the BTSB.  The options include the upgrade of existing buildings and-or replacement of existing buildings on site, or a move to a new site and the construction of a new centre.  In November 1997 the BTSB commenced evaluation of these options, including evaluation work on a new centre.  The BTSB also undertook a substantial capital investment programme at the Cork centre which involved the provision of: a new <Col N="1702" /> components processing laboratory; a new compatibility testing laboratory; a new product storage area; an upgrade of the donor clinic, and new office accommodation.</P>
    <P>The resources to complete this programme were made available by my Department at a total cost of £464,000, with an additional £60,000 for equipment.  The BTSB has advised my Department that the new components processing laboratory which is referred to in its licence is now among the best of its kind in Europe, and that, at a recent inspection by the IMB, the level of compliance was considered acceptable and in accordance with the EC Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice.  My Department has been given to understand that at a meeting on 3 November 1998 between the BTSB and the IMB, it was agreed that a review of the proposals involving the Cork facility would take place after the current inspections have been completed on 27 November.  The BTSB has also advised my Department that it has identified a number of areas at the centre which require improvement or replacement, including storage and accommodation for equipment validation.  The BTSB will discuss these matters and the implementation of any recommendations of the IMB arising from its inspections at both centres.</P>
    <P>The BTSB is fully committed to ensuring that the Cork centre continues to meet the requirements of the IMB.  For my part, further capital investment in the centre will be dictated by the requirements of the IMB and any additional resources necessary for this purpose will be made available.  Furthermore, proposals submitted by the Board of the BTSB for capital investment which are over and above those necessary to ensure regulatory compliance will also be considered by my Department.</P>

    <P>Because of the nature of drug misuse and the range of treatment options provided to drug misusers there is not a figure for the number who have successfully completed the programme and are drug free.  A number of misusers would be referred for detoxification, but may relapse again and would re-enter the system of methadone treatment.  For others, methadone maintenance, where the drug misuser is stable and can work and have a normal lifestyle, may be the final outcome of treatment.</P>
    <P>Methadone programmes will continue to be expanded as long as a need for such expansion is identified, with an emphasis on providing treatment to drug misusers in their own local area.  To date in 1998 the Eastern Health Board has commenced treatment in 16 new locations and work is in progress to ensure early commencement at nine further locations.  In addition, health boards will continue to recruit general practitioners who can provide treatment and care to drug misusers in their own local area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 42 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>First, in relation to anti-acne preparations, there is a wide range of products available in Ireland indicated for the treatment of acne in its varying conditions, ranging from mild and moderate acne to severe and nodulocystic acne.  Some of these products, in particular those for mild acne, may be purchased through pharmacies without prescription, whilst others, such as Roaccutane, may only be supplied on the basis of a doctor's prescription.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress that all medicinal products placed on the market in Ireland must be the subject of a product authorisation issued by the Irish Medicines Board and that the board will only issue such an authorisation after it has carried out detailed assessments to establish the safety, quality and efficacy of the product.  In addition, the board may impose restrictions on the sale or supply of a product depending on the risk-benefits ratios associated with it.  The board must also approve the prescribing data and patient information leaflets including any warnings or precautions that it may consider necessary.</P>
      <P>In relation to Roaccutane, I am aware of recent reports suggesting possible linkages between this product and depression, including suicidal tendencies. Roaccutane, isotretinoin, is a vitamin A derivative used in the treatment of acne.  In Ireland, it is authorised by the Irish Medicines Board for the treatment of severe acne, unresponsive to other treatments, and its availability is limited in that it must be prescribed and its use monitored by a specialist dermatologist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board has, on an ongoing basis, been actively monitoring data on Roaccutane which it has reviewed both internally with experts and with the other European regulatory agencies.  In addition, the board has also recently <Col N="1706" /> reviewed the terms of the product authorisation with the company.  As a result of this, revised wording for inclusion in the prescribing information for the product, outlining the current position regarding its use and warnings related to the possible development of psychiatric reactions, were agreed.  The warnings refer to possible side effects including depression, psychotic symptoms and of rare reports of suicide associated with Roaccutane.  The revised warnings have been incorporated into the authorisation documents for the product and the company has circularised all physicians and pharmacists outlining the new warnings regarding the use of Roaccutane.</P>
    <P>In accordance with its policy, the Irish Medicines Board continues on an ongoing basis to monitor reports of adverse reactions to all medicines, including Roaccutane.  At the same time, it is important in using any medicine that patients should read carefully the patient information leaflet and follow any instructions provided with the medication and consult with their physicians in relation to any problems, side effects or uncertainties they may encounter.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the widespread concern among people in the Midland Health Board area over the proposed bed closures, postponement of operations and the laying off of nursing and general staff at Tullamore General Hospital, County Offaly; the steps, if any, he will take to avoid these bed closures; and if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that there is already an extensive waiting list and these bed closures will make the situation more difficult.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of this year, the Midland Health Board submitted a service plan to my Department which specified the amount of activity that it would carry out in relation to in-patients, day cases and out patients.  The board was funded for this level of activity.  Tullamore General Hospital received an extra £1.316 million in 1998 over and above the amount allocated in 1997.  It received £14.788 million in 1998, compared with £13.472 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>On the basis of current trends, the Midland Health Board expects to have exceeded its targets for activity by the end of the year.  It will also have met its separate targets under the waiting list initiative.  In the final weeks of this year, commencing on 5 December and concluding on 4 January, the board will scale down its elective activity in Tullamore General Hospital.  I must emphasise that the hospital will continue to deal with all urgent and emergency cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Temporary bed closures are a part of normal budgetary management strategy and must be looked at in the context of overall hospital activity.  They are also used to facilitate ward <Col N="1707" /> refurbishment, and the Midland Health Board intends to carry out some necessary refurbishment during the period in question.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Midland Health Board will assess the situation on a daily basis and, if the level of emergency and urgent cases so dictates, it will open additional beds as required.</P>

      <P>The implementation of the 1996 budget provision concerning the retention of medical cards by persons <Col N="1708" /> who have been on the live register for at least 12 months who take up paid insurable employment and also, to participants on approved schemes aimed at the long-term unemployed is a matter for health board chief executive officers, who have statutory responsibility for the administration of the medical card scheme.</P>
      <P>Information of the nature sought by the Deputy is not normally held by my Department and health boards do not record such information on an ongoing basis.  I am advised, however, that health boards are in the process of changing the medical card records system in a way which will enable them, in the future, to identify the number of long-term unemployed persons who retain their cards on taking up employment.</P>
      <P>The report of the Joint Department of Health and Children-Health Board Working Group on the clarification of the guidelines on eligibility for medical cards particularly as they relate to the budget 1996 provision has been approved by health board chief executive officers.  The working group is now in the process of preparing revised guidelines which will address the issues in the report.  The new guidelines will be made available to all relevant front line health board staff and interested voluntary organisations.

      <P>In establishing its health targets my Department examined the epidemiological information available to it which set out the main mortality and morbidity patterns in our population.  The principal indicators involved are life expectancy, and premature mortality, that is deaths under 65 years, from cancer, heart disease and accidents. These are the three main causes of premature mortality in Ireland.  The setting of additional targets has been guided by epidemiological information on a range of other causes of death and morbidity.</P>

      <P>Every batch number of Anti-D has been identified. <Col N="1709" /> A total of 621 batches were manufactured between 1970 and 1994.  A total of 336 of these batches have been tested for the presence of hepatitis C, including all batches sourced from plasma taken from patient X. In the years 1973 to 1986, 62 batches were manufactured, of which 41 have been tested.  In relation to the period prior to October 1973, archived samples of batches produced are not available for testing but the BTSB has advised that it has no evidence to suggest that these batches were infectious.  In the period September 1973 to December 1973, eight batches were manufactured and six were tested. In 1974, 32 batches were manufactured, 22 were tested.  In 1982, 29 batches were manufactured and 16 were tested.</P>
      <P>The BTSB has tested all batches where there is evidence of infection or potential infection.  They have also tested batches which were selected to be representative of the various donors to the plasma pool, to rule out the possibility of infection.</P>
      <P>Not all records relating to the administration of batches for the years 1972 to 1974 and 1982 exist. The BTSB only has records of administration where the anti-D cards, which were filled in by hospital staff after administration, were returned to the BTSB.  Records in relation to the administration of anti-D may be available at individual hospital level.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a new 27 bed nursing and rehabilitation unit at St Joseph's Hospital, Dungarvan was officially opened, earlier this week, by the Minister for Health and Children.  This was a replacement of old unsatisfactory accommodation.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board indicated to the Department in November last year that, because of fire safety fears at St Joseph's Hospital, the need to move patients from first floor accommodation was a priority.  A capital grant of £400,000 was subsequently allocated to the South Eastern Health Board to bring this about, by extending and upgrading the vacated St Elizabeth's Ward.  I understand that a contract has been signed and that actual work will commence very shortly.  I should emphasise that this £400,000 was in addition to the £1.6 million cost of developing the new 27 bed nursing and rehabilitation unit at St Joseph's.</P>
      <P>If the South-Eastern Health Board considers that further capital work is necessary at St Joseph's, I will consider any such request in the light of available capital resources, competing demands and the board's internal priorities.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the need for high quality services for children diagnosed with leukaemia and for that reason the National Cancer Forum was asked to examine issues relating to the provision of treatment for such children and specifically to advise me on the most appropriate approach to the assessment, care planning and follow-up of cases.  I am currently reviewing the National Cancer Forum's recommendations which I received in recent days.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that the overriding criterion in the consideration of issues such as this is that decisions should be based on the best objective scientific evidence available as to what will ensure a high-quality service for the patients.  It is on that basis that the National Cancer Forum was asked to deliberate and make appropriate recommendations. I will be communicating my views on the matter to the hospitals concerned without delay. I will ensure that, however these services are organised, every opportunity will be offered to those with existing skills to use them for optimal patient benefit.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy may be referring to a day resource centre at Erris, County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and <Col N="1711" /> Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of services in this sector.  As recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities have been put in place in each of the health boards.  One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees is to advise the chief executive officers of each board on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of services in their functional areas.</P>
    <P>Additional capital funding of £3 million was made available in 1998 for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities.  From this, £270,000 was allocated to the Western Health Board for a number of capital projects including £120,000 for the development of day resource centres in Erris, County Mayo, and Tuam, County Galway.  I am informed that, following consultation with its co-ordinating committee and the Irish Wheelchair Association and having regard to difficulties in progressing simultaneous development at both centres, the board decided to use these funds to progress the development of the centre at Tuam with the expectation that the development of the centre at Erris might commence in 1999.</P>
    <P>At this stage I am not in a position to provide further funding for the centre in County Mayo. The development of such facilities will be considered in the context of available capital funding in 1999.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Internet is now providing public access to a wide range of health information, and is beginning to facilitate access to information for groups with special needs like carers and people with disabilities.  The Internet, and related technologies, are also facilitating a number of developments in medical communication and telemedicine.  Research has shown that patients may be better informed than previously, and keener to participate in decisions about their own care but, equally, vulnerable to information on the Internet which is inaccurate or misleading. This has emphasised the desirability of sign-posting relevant information sources and offering some degree of reassurance about their <Col N="1712" /> reliability, while the difficulties in doing so, given the range and quantity of information involved, are palpable.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the work being done in the United Kingdom by the Centre for Health Information Quality, to which the Deputy makes reference, on improving the quality of health information produced for the public, and in developing an accreditation process for health information which is reliable and evidence-based. I understand that the centre will also be involved with implementing the &ldquo;National Gateway&rdquo; to health information on the Internet and National Electronic Library for Health proposed in the United Kingdom strategy document &ldquo;Information for health&rdquo;.  These developments are intended to assist the public and health professionals in locating relevant health information resources, and provide some level of accreditation of their content.</P>
      <P>I have recently convened a Working Group on Health Services Public Information which is examining existing inadequacies in the provision of health information to the general public and specific groups by health agencies, and which will be making recommendations aimed at effecting improvements in information quality and dissemination. The group will be examining the recommendations of the Consumer Health Information Research Project, which was funded by my Department from national lottery funds, and which reported in May 1998, the work of the centre for Health Information Quality, and the proposals on establishing a National Electronic Library for Health and &ldquo;National Gateway&rdquo; to health resources on the Internet.  I will also be asking the working group to assess in detail the feasibility of a national health &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; website, which would link to recognised and reliable sources of information.  The working group is due to report in mid-1999.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for ensuring that adequate security arrangements are in place to protect nurses and other staff working in the hospital system rests with hospital management.  Safety issues arising in individual hospitals fall to be addressed by management in consultation with staff representatives. As the Deputy will appreciate, the nature of such issues may vary from hospital to hospital, according to the types of services being provided and the client groups involved.  Initiatives taken at local level for the protection of hospital staff include the issuing of personal attack alarms to <Col N="1713" /> nurses in accident and emergency departments, the installation of panic buttons at reception desks and duty bases, and increasing and-or rescheduling the presence of security staff in key areas and at specific times.</P>
      <P>With regard to mental health services, the Inspectorate of Mental Hospitals has prepared guidelines on good practice and quality assurance in mental health services which include guidance on personnel safety for all staff working in this service.  The guidelines cover issues such as training for staff and the provision of appropriate safety equipment, together with the need for local policy documentation on the management of patients who may exhibit violent behaviour. Those guidelines have been circulated to all mental health service providers and their implementation is being monitored by the inspectorate.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Combat Poverty Agency report referred to by the Deputy which is a pre-budget submission to my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The Government is aware of the problem of social exclusion in our society and has made &ldquo;an inclusive society&rdquo; one of the seven key concerns in the programme for Government. A Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion has been established which is chaired by the Taoiseach. At the outset, the committee saw the need for a co-ordinated approach across departmental boundaries to address children's needs generally.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in addition to my responsibilities in the Department of Health and Children, I have also been appointed as Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In this context, I chair the Inter-Departmental Co-ordinating Team which comprises officials from the three Departments.  The committee meets regularly to discuss matters of relevance to the three Departments.</P>
      <P>I actively support the family support projects to which the Government has committed £2.4 million in each of the years 1998, 1999 and 2000. The objective of the family support projects is to prevent at risk children and young people from engaging in various forms of anti-social behaviour by providing a pro-active inter-agency response to support the children and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full implementation of the Child Care Act has resulted in an improved legal framework for <Col N="1714" /> the delivery of services to children.  One of the main provisions of the legislation is the placing of a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  Since 1993 and to end 1997, £43.5 million has been provided on an annualised basis to ensure that health boards have the necessary resources to carry out their responsibilities under the Child Care Act.  An additional £8 million was provided for this purpose in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to what the Deputy is referring to with regard to his question on adequate resources and support for adoptive parents.  In general I would point out that an adopted child has the same legal status as if he or she was born to his or her adoptive parents, that the adoptive parents and adopted child have the same entitlement to health and social services as any other parents and children, and that the Adoption Acts make no provision for the delivery of any specific post-adoption services.  If the Deputy has a specific issue in mind which I have not covered in the above perhaps he would write to me in this regard.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the issue of the delay in commencing foreign adoption assessments in some detail in replies to questions in this House on 30 September and 5 November last.  In my replies I stated that I was not convinced that simply assigning more social workers to deal with an ever expanding case load was the most efficient way of dealing with delays in this area, particularly when one considers the other areas of pressing need in our child care services.  I went on to say that it was also necessary to consider how health boards could best utilise existing resources to manage cases and whether or not legislative change was required to assist them in this regard. As set out in my previous replies I intend to address the above issues by commissioning an independent consultancy to review the foreign adoption assessment procedures in the eight health boards with the aim of ensuring that an efficient and standardised assessment procedure which accords with best practice in the field operates across the country while at the same time having regard to the priority that must be attached to other areas of the child care services. It is hoped to commence this consultancy very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards encouraging adoption I would point <Col N="1715" /> out that adoption is an extremely serious decision for any mother to make as it involves her giving up all legal rights with regard to her child.  For that reason our adoption laws provide that an adoption should take place only where it is in the best interests of the child concerned and where the mother has given her free and fully informed consent to the adoption.  Procedures for dispensing with the consent of the natural parent or parents where this is in the best interests of the child concerned are set out in the Adoption Acts, 1974 and 1988.</P>
    <P>As regards intercountry adoption, Ireland subscribes to the principles set out in the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoptions, 1993, namely, that each State should take, as a matter of priority, appropriate measures to enable the child to remain in the care of his or her family of origin and that intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of a permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot be found in his or her State of origin.  Legislation to enable ratification of the Convention is currently being prepared in my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>Records available to me indicate that four cases of E.coli 0157 were reported by health boards to my Department during 1997, and three cases were reported during 1998.  The records also indicate that there were no fatalities due to this infection during these years.  While all cases of E.coli 0157 infection in Ireland have been sporadic and there have not been epidemics of the infection here, I believe nevertheless it is imperative that the medical profession, the public, and all persons engaged in food preparation are aware of E.coli 0157 and of the simple measures by which infection can be prevented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has for several years now recognised the potentially serious implications of this infection and has taken steps to increase awareness of it.  A report on the matter by the food safety advisory committee was circulated to all health boards in October 1994 with an instruction <Col N="1716" /> that it should be brought to the attention of all officers engaged in food control operations.  A reminder to this effect was issued in July 1995.  A further reminder was issued in December 1996 to all the Directors of Public Health in the health boards, who were asked to remind doctors and laboratories to be particularly vigilant in reporting cases of food poisoning with a view to identifying any possible cases of the E.coli infection. More recently, following advice from the Food Safety Advisory Board, the health promotion unit of my Department has prepared a leaflet for distribution to the general public on this matter.  The leaflet advises, in particular, on the importance of properly cooking meat products, on the need to properly wash raw vegetables before eating, and on the importance of observing good food hygiene and personal hygiene practices in order to prevent and control outbreaks of E.coli 0157 infection.</P>
    <P>While there is a legal requirement under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981-1996 to notify cases of food poisoning generally, E.coli 0157 is not specifically notifiable.  However, the recently established national communicable disease surveillance unit, which will provide a comprehensive broad based approach to the prevention of disease, including foodborne disease, is currently reviewing the whole area of disease notification and E.coli 0157 is being included in this review.  Furthermore, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has established an E.coli 0157 task force to examine the issue, and to advise on the appropriate response in terms of regulation, standards and education for consumers and producers. I understand that this task force will report within a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>Health boards provide financial support to a range of day care services which cater for children who are regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged.  These services include parent and toddler groups, community playgroups and drop-in centres.  This function is in keeping with the boards overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and provision of family support services.  The total budget for day care services funded by health boards is included in the global funding allocated for the strengthening of child care and family support services on an ongoing basis.  The cost per year of <Col N="1717" /> day care services can vary considerably depending on a range of factors including the age of the child, the type of service, geographic location and any special arrangements needed. The health boards estimate that approximately 9,000 children are catered for in these services.</P>
      <P>I should add that the Government is fully committed to expanding the availability of child care. In this regard an expert working group on child care has been established under Partnership 2000. The group, under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is currently examining the provision of a co-ordinated national framework for the development of a child care infrastructure.

    <P>Children at risk ranged in age from one day to ten years.</P>
    <P>The decline in incidence among IV drug users may in part be due to the huge expansion in drug treatment services in the Eastern Health Board. Figures would indicate that the board's strategy of needle exchange/methadone maintenance is proving effective in reducing the incidence of HIV among drug misusers.  Figures would also indicate that homosexual spread among males and heterosexual spread among females are now the most common modes of transmission of HIV.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the adequacy of detection and treatment services.  People, who consider they have put themselves at risk of infection with HIV can have a HIV test through their general practitioner or in STD or drug treatment clinics.  The clinical management of HIV/AIDS is overseen by consultants in infectious diseases in St. James's Hospital, the Mater/Beaumont, Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin and Cork University Hospital.</P>

      <P>The continuing rise in the incidence of suicide is a cause of considerable concern.  As the Deputy is aware, the report of the National Task Force on Suicide, which was published in February 1998, put forward a national suicide prevention/reduction strategy and identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities.  I am anxious that the measures recommended in the strategy are implemented without unnecessary delays.  Since the publication of the report, I have been in contact with my ministerial colleagues in the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, and the Environment and Local Government, with a view to implementing the task force recommendations in so far as these Departments are concerned.  My Department has also contacted all the statutory agencies identified in the report with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies requesting that the necessary measures are put in place to ensure the implementation of the recommendations which relate to their respective areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> A core recommendation of the task force report is the establishment of a suicide research group by the chief executive officers of the health boards.  The group's main responsibilities include the review of ongoing trends in suicide and para-suicide, the co-ordination of research into suicide and the making of recommendations to the chief executive officers of health boards which, it is hoped, will assist in the reversal of the growing incidence of suicide.  The group was established earlier this year by the chief executive officers of the health boards and has met on a number of occasions.  Arising from the deliberations of the group so far, it is intended to appoint a full-time researcher/co-ordinator with secretarial facilities. I am providing the necessary funds to the group to allow this important work to proceed.</P>
    <P>As far as the provision of services on the ground are concerned, my own Department is involved in a number of areas.  The Irish Medicines Board have made recommendations involving certain additional restrictions in the sale of paracetamol, together with additional warnings on the packaging and information leaflets.  An extensive consultation process has been conducted in relation to the board's recommendations and the question of introducing regulations to give full statutory effect to the recommendations is under examination.  I am glad to report, however, that most pharmaceutical companies and pharmacists are giving effect to the board's recommendations on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>The majority of health boards have established working groups to examine the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on Suicide.  The working groups are multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary and engage in the promotion of positive mental health and the de-stigmatisation of suicide, provide information in relation to suicide and para-suicide, liaise with the media and provide training requirements for staff in relation to all aspects of suicide and para-suicide. The process of consultation with statutory and voluntary groups regarding the issue of suicide has also commenced in many health board areas.  Resource officers have been appointed in many of the health boards with responsibility for implementing recommendations of the task force.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that groups at risk of suicide, in particular the young and older age sectors of our population, have greater accessibility to relevant health services at times of stress.  I am committed to further developing consultant led child and adolescent and old age psychiatry services during 1999 which will assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk.  An important development in the education sector which will promote self-esteem and self-confidence and enable students to develop personal and social skills is the approval by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment &mdash; NCCA &mdash; of a social, personal and health education syllabus for primary level and the junior cycle for post-primary level schools.  I understand that a sub-committee <Col N="1721" /> of the NCCA course committee is meeting to develop an implementation strategy that will be recommended to the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provides for the supervision and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. In 1998, a further £8 million revenue has been made available to strengthen child care services. This includes £500,000 for the continued implementation by the health boards of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII, in regard to pre-school services.  The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, cre ches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services. Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service.  The latest information provided to my Department by the health boards indicates that 2,624 notifications have been received nationally.  Precise information on the number of pre-school providers who have not complied with the notification requirements is difficult to compile.  However health boards are taking active steps to pursue non-notifiers.</P>
      <P>A working group to monitor the implementation of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, is in place.  The group is representative of all the health boards and is concerned with ensuring a consistent approach to the implementation of the regulations.  It is intended that the operation of the regulations will be reviewed after three years, with a view to effecting any changes considered necessary at that stage.  As a first step in this process, I recently initiated a review of the inspection process through the working group.  Non-notification is among the issues being addressed in the review process.</P>

In relation to the claims for allowances, a hearing from the Labour Court was held on 28 October 1998.  At that hearing, health services management asked the court for a ruling on the admissibility of certain of the claims introduced by the Nursing Alliance in its submission to the court.  The court duly adjourned the hearing to consider the matter, and a decision is awaited.

      <P>I am aware of the concerns of consumers in relation to genetically engineered food.  The primary purpose of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, enacted in July, is the protection of consumers and this is reflected in the structure of the authority.  In addition to the authority's governing board, provision has been made for a 24 member consultative council which will provide a forum for consumer representatives to voice their concerns. The authority's scientific committee has also established a GMO and novel food subcommittee which serves to advise me on issues in this area together with affording a forum for the exchange of expert scientific opinion and advice on this new technology.</P>
      <P>There are strict legislative controls on the genetic modification of foodstuffs and my Department is responsible for the implementation of the relevant European Union measures in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" /> These controls provide protection to consumers and the matter will be kept under continuing review to ensure that this continues to be the case.

    <P>In relation to the latest EU measures on labelling, my Department is in consultation with both the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and representatives of industry to ensure that consumers are informed to the greatest degree possible in relation to genetic modification of foodstuffs. This issue is also the subject of ongoing discussions at EU level and I can assure the Deputy that in these discussions Ireland will continue to press other member states to address the consumer concerns which exist in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 170, 176 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>I fully acknowledge the burden of responsibility and the extraordinary commitment of the many carers and families providing care and support for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This has been widely recognised and reported on in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, A Strategy for Equality and the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.</P>
      <P>With regard to the physical and sensory disability sector, the provision of support services for carers and families is one of the priority areas identified in Towards an Independent Future. The report sets out the requirements for the development of the services over a five year period. Two of the review group's recommendations are crucial to the future development of services in this sector.  These are the establishment of regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services in each health board and the establishment of a database of service needs in the sector.  The co-ordinating committees, which comprise representatives of the voluntary and statutory agencies and people with disabilities themselves, have been established and they function in a consultative and advisory capacity to the chief executive officers of the health boards in identifying and prioritising service developments and the allocation of available funding for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Following a successful pilot project in three health boards, my Department is in the process of establishing a national committee to develop the database.  The database will provide the basis for the accurate identification and quantification of service needs for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including supports for carers and families.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, I have received a substantial amount of correspondence from various interest groups, including carers groups, concerning the provision of financial resources for the development of health services.  Decisions on the allocation of additional funding provided in the Estimates for the physical and sensory disability sector are currently being finalised by my Department and these will be advised to the health boards very shortly.  In keeping with the Government's commitments under Partnership 2000, services in the physical and sensory disability sector will continue to be developed to the extent permitted by the availability of develop-ment funding.  I cannot say at this time what funding will be made available in the 1999 budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;medical inflation&rdquo; is often used quite loosely and is sometimes taken to include increases in cost not solely driven by changes in price.  For example, the cost of certain services may increase due to the adoption of more costly technology but this technology may have been introduced to facilitate improvements in patient outcomes and/or increased activity levels.  Therefore, when analysing the increase in healthcare costs over a number of years it is difficult to disentangle costs associated with increased activity and improvements in quality from price inflation <i>per se.</i>  Problems in measuring medical inflation are experienced in all health systems due to the fact that the healthcare market is very different from other markets since public provision and subsidisation mean that prices tend not to reflect actual costs.  These measurement difficulties mean that, unfortunately, in response to the Deputy's question there is no reliable estimate of medical inflation in the Irish public health care system for 1998 or 1999.  Nevertheless, the evidence that is available would suggest that, both here and internationally, inflation within the health sector is higher than the average rate of price increase in the wider economy.  This would be particularly the case in relation to acute hospital services and drug schemes where the influence of technology is most pronounced.  For example, the increase in the acute hospital sector over the period 1993 to 1998 was 46 per cent while the increase in the consumer price index over the same period is just 12.5 per cent.  This increase for the acute hospital sector would include increases in activity, quality and increase in pay and non-pay costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my Department's understanding that the Central Statistics Office in calculating the consumer price index takes account of increases in the price of medical care and drugs purchased privately. However, the relationship between these price increases and price inflation in the public system is not straightforward and this would have to be examined in detail before any inferences could be drawn from this source about medical inflation in the public system.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the case that when formulating allocations to publicly funded health agencies provision is made for cost increases.  In relation to pay my Department provides for cost increases by taking account of awards due under national pay agreements.  A non-pay inflation factor is applied to non-pay budgets based on the standard non-pay inflation assumption used by the Department of Finance in agreeing Estimates with all Departments.  This non-pay inflation <Col N="1726" /> assumption is based on a forecast of the likely annual increase in the consumer price index.  In addition, provision is made for particular cost increases such as increases in the cost of drugs under the community drug schemes and the GMS or agreed developments in acute hospitals such as the introduction of particularly expensive drug therapies or technologies.  Allocation methodologies continue to be kept under review and medical inflation and other associated factors are receiving consideration by my Department in the context of the development of multi-annual budgeting.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are a number of strategies used to control medical inflation.  The most important strategy is the central role given to service planning under the accountability legislation.  Service planning requires agencies to thoroughly examine their operations to ensure that they meet the highest standards of efficiency and effectiveness. Proposed expenditure in the coming year should be evaluated by reference to the likely benefit in terms of health and social gain.  The role of service planning in controlling medical inflation is complemented by other initiatives taken by my Department, for example, in relation to materials management and value for money and the negotiation of agreements on pricing and supply of drugs with the pharmaceutical industry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 89 and 143 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies are aware, the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act came into force under the previous Government in 1996.  This Act obliges health boards to agree and adopt an annual service plan on the basis of a level of approved net expenditure that should not exceed the non-capital determination notified to the board by my Department for that year.  Prior to <Col N="1727" /> issuing letters of determination for 1998 I met with each health board and explained the basis on which 1998 funding would be provided.  This was confirmed and clarified in the official letter of determination to each board, which stated that it had been agreed with the Minister for Finance that, in relation to 1998 and subsequent years, Supplementary Estimates would be granted only on an exceptional basis and only then in relation to specific categories of expenditure, which in 1998 were confined to four headings.</P>
    <P>This places an obligation on health boards to deliver service plans within budget as any overrun on expenditure will translate into a first charge on the following year's allocation.  Where a health board is projecting a year-end deficit on the basis of activity in a particular area exceeding service plan targets, it becomes necessary, therefore, for that board to take measures to control this activity in order to remain within budget. Otherwise, the carry-over of deficits could become cumulative over the years, with drastic effects on an agency's budgetary management and its capacity to deliver core services It is a matter for local health board management to determine the most appropriate and effective measures in such circumstances.  The ward and theatre closures currently proposed for University College Hospital, Galway, are a response by the Western Health Board management, in fulfilment of their legislative responsibilities, to a projected year-end budgetary deficit of some £1.9 million on their acute hospital programme.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation, health board manage-ment are responsible for achieving the agreed activity targets set out in the board's service plan. It is important to note, in this context, that the Western Health Board have confirmed that the activity targets agreed in their 1998 service plan for University College Hospital, Galway, will be achieved.  In other words, the hospital will provide the level of treatment to patients in the region that it undertook to provide at the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>It is on the overall level of activity delivered, rather than the number of overnight beds available, that the performance of University College Hospital, Galway, should be considered.  This is the more relevant indicator because the number of in-patient beds available does not reflect the complete picture of activity in modern hospitals due to trends in modern medical practice for reduced average lengths of stay and a marked shift in care from in-patient to day case level.  This is strongly reflected in activity at UCHG, where for the first nine months of this year day case activity has been running at 13 per cent above 1997 levels while in-patient admissions are down 6 per cent over the same period last year.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the manage-ment of the Western Health Board is appropriately discharging its responsibilities in implementing its service plan for University College Hospital, Galway.</P>

      <P>Since 1994, the BTSB has conducted the most comprehensive testing programme of its kind ever mounted through a major public awareness programme.  Under this programme, all recipients of anti-D &mdash; sourced and prepared in Ireland &mdash; between 1970 and 18 February 1994 were invited to come forward for testing.  To date, 65,000 anti-D recipients have been tested under the pro-gramme. Approximately 12,000 recipients who indicated that they received anti-D during the years 1977 and 1978, and a further 18,000 recipients who indicated that they received the product during the years 1991 to 1994, have been tested. These numbers are greater than the number of infectious or potentially infectious vials of anti-D issued during those years.</P>
      <P>Following a cross-matching exercise carried out by the BTSB between the anti-D cards returned by hospitals, and the database of individuals tested under the screening programme, it appeared that approximately 2,000 people who may have received infectious or potentially infected product do not appear to have been tested.  However, as the information contained on the anti-D cards may now be out-of-date, and based on the numbers of recipients of anti-D during the relevant years who have been tested, it is likely that the majority of these 2,000 individuals have, in fact, been tested.  In addition, some individuals have elected not to be tested.  It is estimated that a small number of individuals who have not been tested may show evidence of having been infected by hepatitis C. The national blood screening programme remains in place, and testing is available free of charge through the individual's general practitioners.</P>
      <P>The BTSB has recently re-launched an advertising campaign to encourage any individuals at risk to be tested.  Information packs have been sent to 2,060 general practitioners, and posters for display in GP surgeries are being prepared.  An international advertising campaign is also being launched via Irish centres abroad and Irish media links to emigrants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 144 together.</P>
      <P>One of the most pertinent findings of the review group which examined the McColgan case was that if such a case was to present itself today, the response of the North-Western Health Board would have been more efficient in protecting the children.  Major changes which have occurred include the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the investment of £2.6 million in the development of the board's family support and child protection services in the period 1993-1998.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a social services inspectorate is a priority for my Department, and the chief inspector will be appointed by the end of the year.  The inspectorate will be invaluable to the on-going review of standards of child protection services in all health boards.</P>
      <P>I have asked officials in the Department to study the recommendations of the report and all health boards have been asked to examine the report and recommendations carefully and to implement any changes which will enhance child protection practices in their areas.  The current position in regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the review group will be discussed at a meeting to be arranged between officials of my Department and the health board programme managers for child care.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the Statute of Limitations is that the Statute of Limitations, 1957, already provides a period of three years for the commencement of personal injuries proceedings &mdash; whether against the State or a private defendant &mdash; beyond which the proceedings may be struck out because they were not commenced in time.  The statute also provides that the three-year period shall not be regarded as starting to run where the plaintiff is under a legal disability namely, not of full age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991, amended the law so that the three-year limitation period runs from the date on which the injured person discovers, or could reasonably have discovered, that the injury occurred, if this date is later than the act or omission leading to the injury.  I understand that this Act substantially implemented the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's report on the Statute of Limitations &mdash; Claims in Respect of Latent Personal <Col N="1730" /> Injuries (LRC 21-1987) and that it removed constitutional doubts that had emerged regarding the law in this area.  While there are no proposals for a change of the specific type outlined in the Deputy's question, I can say that the law is kept under review on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the international discussions, if any, his Department has had regarding the use of the drug, rohypnol; the further steps, if any, he will take to regulate its use; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Flunitrazepam, which is the active ingredient in Rohypnol, and its preparations, have been classified as Schedule 3 controlled drugs, under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, since 1993. The drug was reclassified in this country in 1993 in response to various reports of misuse and, as a result, unauthorised possession became an offence and it has been made more difficult for drug misusers to gain access to it.</P>
      <P>Doctors prescribing Rohypnol must comply with the special prescription writing requirements as set out in the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 1988.  Furthermore, persons, such as doctors and pharmacists, having the drug in their lawful possession must keep it in safe custody in accordance with requirements of the Misuse of Drugs (Safe Custody) Regulations, 1982.  My Department keeps up to date on international developments regarding the use and misuse of rohypnol.  For example, the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe, on which my Department is represented, set up a Group of Experts in Epidemiology to consider what activities might contribute to improving the understanding of the epidemiology of illicit benzodiazepine use and improving the effectiveness of monitoring activities in this area. The group observed that the abuse of sedative-hypnotics often involves several benzodiazepines, not just rohypnol.  I also understand that the manufacturers of rohypnol have taken certain steps to ensure that rohypnol is detectable where it is covertly administered to an individual's drink.</P>
      <P>The main group who misuse rohypnol are injecting opiate users.  Experts in the Eastern Health Board working with doctors dealing with this group advise that doctors should not prescribe the drug to opiate misusers because of the potential for its misuse.  As the Deputy will be aware the prescribing and dispensing of methadone recently became subject to stricter control arising from the introduction of the Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations, 1998.  My Department will be monitoring the prescribing of other controlled drugs to ensure that they are not subject to abuse.</P>

    <P>It is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board to deal with the reduction of waiting lists and waiting times at Waterford Regional Hospital in the first instance.  In this regard the South-Eastern Health Board received funding of £697,000 under the waiting list initiative in 1998 which represents an increase of 44 per cent compared with the funding of £482,909 approved by the previous Government in 1997.</P>
    <P>The Review Group on the Waiting List Initiative has submitted its report to me.  I will shortly be bringing its proposals to Government, after which I will announce full details of how I intend to proceed.  I wish to assure Deputies that I am committed to implementing the report of the review group in a planned and structural way. The report emphasises that there are no simple solutions in this area and that the problems arising must be addressed far beyond the acute hospital system alone.  In particular, I will be ensuring that all of the steps taken to deal with waiting lists and waiting times are implemented in a structured and co-ordinated fashion right across the health services.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to reduce waiting lists for cardiac surgery at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, Dublin 12, in view of the fact that latest figures show that 56 children, some only months old, have been waiting more than six months for surgery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, serves as the national referral centre for paediatric heart disease.  According to figures recently submitted to the Department the hospital currently has 56 patients waiting over six months for cardiac surgery.</P>
      <P>Under the 1997 cardiac surgery waiting list initiative a sum of £500,000 was allocated to the hospital for the purpose of alleviating the waiting list pressures.  The hospital's proposal, agreed with my Department, was to utilise this additional funding to provide the following: increased cardiology out-patient department activity with additional echocardiographs and electrocardiographs; four additional ICU beds; an additional training programme for ICU nurses; 18 cardiac procedures to be purchased on a contract basis in the UK.</P>
      <P>This year under the same initiative an increased allocation of £878,550 was made to the hospital.  This provided for additional staff, the purchase of 30 additional cardiac procedures in the UK and the continuation of the ICU nurse training course.  I should point out to the Deputy that as a consequence of this investment the number of children currently awaiting cardiac surgery shows a decrease on the comparable figure of 66 at the end of December 1997.</P>
      <P>The development of enhanced paediatric cardiac surgery facilities is at an advanced stage.  This includes the provision of additional theatres and associated facilities and a design team for the development will shortly be appointed.  In addition, the appointment of a consultant cardiologist and a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon has been approved by my Department and Comhairle na n-Ospidéal.  These measures will alleviate the pressures currently being experienced in the provision of this service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 79, and 151 together.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a national breast screening programme is a major undertaking which requires careful planning and organisation.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health and Children, I am very much aware of the unnecessary trauma and anguish that could be caused to women and their families as a result of mistakes in an organised screening programme.  Therefore, it is critical that in planning such a programme, every effort is made to ensure that the programme meets with international quality assurance standards and best practice.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, a major action plan was introduced to implement the proposals contained in the National Cancer Strategy.  Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction of a phased basis of a national breast screening programme.</P>
      <P>Phase 1 will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the launch of the Cancer Action Plan, a national steering committee, chaired by Dr. Sheelah Ryan, chief executive officer, Western Health Board, was established to guide the implementation of the national programme of screening for breast cancer.  Since its establishment in April 1997, considerable progress has been made on a number of fronts.  The principal developments in this regard are: (i) the passage of the Health (Provision of Information) Act 1997 which facilitated the development of a population register.  A population register for the programme has now been compiled.  It is currently being validated and fine-tuned and will be operational by the time screening commences; (ii) a decision by the breast screening steering committee on a model of delivery for Phase 1 of the programme in November 1997.  It has been agreed that there will be two central units based at the Mater and St. Vincent's, where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary team approach involving the relevant clinical disciplines, including the screening radiologist.  In addition, there will be two mobile units to bring the screening services to the women in the more remote rural areas within the three health boards in Phase 1.  Each mobile unit will be linked with one of the central units.  This <Col N="1737" /> should ensure uniformity of standards and continuity of care; (iii) the appointment of Dr. Jane Buttimer as project director for the programme in May 1998; (iv) the establishment of the pro-gramme as a legal entity in September 1998 to facilitate the appointment of consultant and support staff as well as for budgetary control and financial accountability reasons.  To this end, the programme was recently established as a joint board under section 11 of the Health Act, 1970; (v) recent advertisements for dedicated consultant and support staff for the programme in the national press.  The recruitment process is now under way and interviews will take place in November and December 1998; (vi) preparation of quality assurance guidelines by the national QA committee, which is a sub-committee of the national steering committee.  The final report is expected this month.</P>
    <P>A key determinant regarding the start up date for the programme will be the recruitment of the relevant consultant and support staff, advertisements for which were recently placed in the national press.  Once the relevant staff are ready to take up their appointments we should be in a position to start the programme.  I am committed to making the necessary resources available to the programme to facilitate the commencement of screening and I have approved funding to date of £2 million to cover the start up costs and minor capital equipment.  In addition, in August 1998, I approved the following capital allocations: £1,035,000 towards the refurbishment of 36 Eccles Street &mdash; Mater Hospital &mdash; as a screening and assessment unit and also as headquarters of the programme; and £897,750 towards the construction of screening unit facilities at St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputies will agree that in the light of the foregoing, there has been substantial progress on all fronts towards the establishment of a top quality breast screening programme and I look forward to the commencement of this pro-gramme as soon as the key elements are in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our existing legislation provides for the curtailment of expenditure on advertising of tobacco products and limits the content of advertisements. However the efficacy of this measure has been diminished by spill over advertising from the UK and other EU countries.  For this reason Ireland has long supported a ban on tobacco advertising <Col N="1738" /> and sponsorship at EU level.  The adoption of a directive to this effect by the European Parliament and Council in July this year was the culmination of considerable effort by ourselves and Commissioner Flynn.  With regard to implementation of the directive, my Department is examining the matter with a view to putting in place an effective implementation strategy.</P>
      <P>Promoting a smoke free society is a priority for myself and my Department.  There has been a significant reduction in the proportion of the adult population smoking over the past 25 years due largely to the various public health initiatives which have been undertaken.  However I am concerned that the reported prevalence of smoking among young people and particularly schoolchildren remains unacceptably high.</P>
      <P>I fully agree that we need to continue to influence public opinion on the dangers of smoking. For this reason I have established a policy review group to carry out a fundamental review of smoking and health policy.  One of the areas being looked at is the incidence of smoking among young people and schoolchildren.  I expect the group to report to me early in the new year with specific proposals and I will be prepared to go ahead with them.</P>

    <P>I am aware of the need to develop the home help service which provides a key service in supporting dependent people in their own homes.  Following consultations with the chief executive officers of the health boards, my Department commissioned an examination of the future organisation of the home help service in Ireland by the Policy Research Centre of the National College of Ireland under the direction of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  It is expected that this report will be submitted to me and published shortly.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the recommendations of the report will be fully considered with a view to early implementation.  Although not within the terms of this study, I understand that the question of payments to home helps has been referred to. In this regard, I acknowledge that the system of remuneration of home helps, both in relation to the rates of payment and standardisation across health boards, needs to be addressed.  My Department is currently examining how this might be achieved in the context of the availability of resources.  Due regard will also be given to the recommendations of the National Minimum Wage Commission.</P>

        <i>Adelaide Hospital</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Adelaide Hospital Society, a charitable organisation, was the owner of the former Adelaide Hospital at Peter Street, Dublin 8.  The <Col N="1740" /> society has recently sold the property by public tender.  My Department has been advised by the society that the terms of the sale agreement are confidential between the parties concerned under the agreed terms of sale.  The Department has also been advised that the sale was approved by the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.</P>
    <P>The Adelaide Hospital Society was incorporated under the Companies Act 1963 to 1990 as a limited liability company on 9 November 1994. The society has as its principal object the advancement of medicine, medical care and medical science and the practice thereof including the advancement of medical and nursing education and is a means for charitable participation in the health services of members of the Protestant Churches for the benefit of all and especially the poor of every denomination.  The society also has particular responsibilities under the Charter of the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital in respect of board appointments, student nurse entry, the voluntary character of the hospital and so forth.</P>
    <P>The use of the proceeds of the sale are a matter for the Adelaide Hospital Society but I am advised that the society is totally committed to developing new and enhanced services at the hospital in Tallaght.  For example, the society has committed a capital sum of £500,000 to a new clinical sciences building being built at the hospital by Trinity College, Dublin.  The society has also committed itself to provide over the next ten years £3.5 million for new and enhanced services at the hospital, which are to be approved by the Minister for Health and Children, on a shared basis with the National Children's Hospital and the Meath Hospital Foundation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Children's Hospital</i>
    </P>
    <P>The board of the National Children's Hospital established as a charity with memorandum and articles of association under the Companies Acts, was the owner of the former National Children's Hospital at Harcourt Street, Dublin 2.  The property has recently been sold by public tender. Again, I have been advised that the terms of the sale agreement are confidential between the parties concerned under the agreed terms of sale.  I am also advised that the sale has been submitted to the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for approval.</P>
    <P>The use of the proceeds of the sale are a matter for the board.  However, my Department has been advised by the chairman and secretary of the board that the income from the assets will be devoted exclusively to the Child Health Pro-gramme and the associated teaching and research as organised and conducted by the National Children's Hospital as a component of the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital.</P>
    <P>The first call on the income is the National Children's Hospital's contribution to the £3.5 million referred to above for new or enhanced <Col N="1741" /> services at the hospital in Tallaght and £500,000 for the clinical sciences complex to be built by Trinity College, Dublin at Tallaght.</P>

      <P>There are a range of information systems in place which provide information on health outcomes. These include the vital statistics reports, the public health information system, the perinatal reporting system, the cancer registry and the European home and leisure accidents surveillance system.</P>
      <P>My Department is continuing to promote and to provide support and resources for an ongoing programme of investment in modern information systems throughout the health services.  The capital funding being made available by my Department for this programme has been increased very significantly to £14 million this year.</P>
      <P>I recognise that there is still a requirement to improve the definition and measurement of health outcomes.  This is a problem of health systems worldwide and is the subject of ongoing research at international level.  In the context of service planning health agencies have been asked to monitor and evaluate service delivery against appropriate performance indicators with a focus on health and social gain.  It is intended that this process, which is currently in its early stages, will lead to the development of health outcome measures against which to judge the effectiveness of health services and help plan their future development.</P>
      <P>Developments are designed to support clinicians and other healthcare professionals in the delivery and assessment of the care and services for which they have responsibility &mdash; including outcome measurement and quality assessment generally.  Virtually all agencies have patient management systems in place which support treatment provision and provide access to details of previous episodes of care.  In addition, many agencies also have clinical support systems such as laboratory, radiology and order communications installed and significant progress continues to be made on the provision of links between hospitals, the community care services, and general practitioners in order to enhance overall continuity and quality of care.</P>

This includes £500,000 for the continued implementation by the health boards of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII, in regard to pre-school services.</P>
      <P>The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, cre ches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service.  On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.  All pre-school services should be inspected by mid 1999. Inspections will take place annually thereafter. The latest information provided to my Department by the health boards indicates that 2,624 notifications have been received nationally. Approximately one-third of these facilities have been inspected.</P>
      <P>A range of issues have emerged during inspections in relation to, for example, premises, numbers catered for, sanitary facilities and record keeping.  The regulations are being introduced in a co-operative manner with pre-school providers. Where deficiencies are identified, providers are given a specific period of time in which to make specific improvements provided that the delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A working group to monitor the implementation of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, is in place.  The group is representative of all the health boards and is concerned with ensuring a consistent approach to the implementation of the regulations.  It is intended that the operation of the regulations will be reviewed after three years, with a view to effecting any changes considered necessary at that stage.  As a first step in this process, <Col N="1743" /> I recently initiated a review of the inspection process through the working group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>The value of establishing task forces, and their potential for success, depends very much on the particular circumstances of the situation.  In the ordinary course, a task force is not necessarily appropriate as a response to the general economic difficulties in a given area.  It can, however, be of significant merit in selected circumstances and as a means of responding to specific events such as the closure of a major employer where this would have widespread implications in terms of local employment and spin offs into the local economy.  I consider that a task force is a useful instrument in such circumstances and should be used as a means of responding creatively and flexibly, in limited circumstances, where a special effort is needed to harness the collective dynamic of the various interests and agencies as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I have no plans for the establishment of a special task force for County Longford.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Agencies and the County Enterprise Board have contributed to raising the employment levels in Longford over the past number of years.  From its inception to the end of 1997, financial support from Longford County Enterprise Board has assisted the setting up of 198 projects with a job potential of 366 full-time and 46 part-time jobs.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland client companies have increased their employment by 250 persons between the period 1995 to 1997, an increase of nearly 20 per cent over the past three years.  A number of Enterprise Ireland firms are planning to expand their businesses over the next year which will lead to an increase in employment in the area.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is actively promoting Longford to potential inward investors.  While the issue of regional distribution continues to be a high priority for IDA Ireland, the decision on where to locate rests solely with the overseas investors, based primarily on the competitiveness and general level of attractiveness of individual locations.</P>
      <P>The various enterprise support agencies, together with the Longford County Strategy Group, which operates closely with the local authority and which co-ordinates the activities of local economic development agencies such as the Longford County Enterprise Board, Leader companies and partnership companies under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development continue to work in the interest of economic development in Longford.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that on Monday, 16 November 1998, I approved grant aid of over £12 million supporting investment of over £50 million for the introduction of 31 new vessels into the whitefish fleet.  Over 50 applications were received by BIM for new vessels under the whitefish renewal programme.  Following evaluation of the applications by BIM, 31 applications were approved.  As the original funding package for the whitefish programme allowed for grant aid support for some 14 vessels, I secured an extra £5.2 million in funding over and above the allocation in the whitefish renewal pro-gramme to enable the 31 new vessels to be supported. In addition to the grants approved, all the new vessels will be eligible for the special tax reliefs contained in the 1998 Finance Act, including a 50 per cent write off in year one.</P>
      <P>In relation to modernisation of vessels, the position is that the closing date for applications for the scheme was 9 October and BIM is currently evaluating applications based on the criteria set out in the whitefish renewal programme. I expect to be in a position to announce successful applications by mid-December.</P>

At an on farm inspection on 5 October it was found that the applicant applied on an animal which was not in his ownership and possession at the time of application.  The applicant was informed that this was contrary to the terms and conditions of the suckler cow premium scheme.  The notification letter offered the person named the opportunity to appeal the case and provide documentation to support the appeal.  No such appeal was received.

Currently the staffing of the office is under review with the objective of improving the situation there.  This application will be dealt with as soon as possible.  In no case does the processing time result in a financial loss to a retiring farmer.  The operational procedures for the scheme specifically ensure that the date of receipt in the Department of a valid application determines the date from which payment is made.</P>

      <P>The acceptance of an application under the REP scheme is subject to the general scheme conditions and each application must be justified in the context of Council Regulation 2078/92/EC. Where there is a doubt about eligibility, applications for REPS must be assessed thoroughly to ensure that they are genuine and comply with the terms and conditions of the REP scheme.  The legal basis and administrative provisions for the implementation of the rural environment scheme are set out in the REP scheme document.  The detailed requirements are contained in the agrienvironmental specifications.  Any Department decision on an application is based on an assessment of the eligibility of the application in the context of the scheme rules and conditions. Additionally member states of the EU are required under the terms of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No. 729/70 to satisfy themselves that transactions financed by the EU are actually carried out and are executed correctly, to prevent and deal with irregularities and to recover sums lost as a result of irregularities or negligence. Member states must bear the cost of irregularities or negligence as a result of their actions.</P>
      <P>Where an application is rejected, it is open to the applicant to appeal the decision to the Department giving grounds for the appeal.  It is, also open to an applicant to take legal action in relation to any application which is rejected. Where proceedings are taken against the Department, the Department accepts legal advice as to entering a defence and it is a matter for the courts to determine the final outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are five cases pending where legal proceedings have been taken against the Department. In four of these an order of <i>mandamus</i> by <Col N="1751" /> way of judicial review was sought to which the Department has replied.  It is not known whether these proceedings will be continued further.  The remaining case is an application for general damages. There are no costs to date on foot of these particular cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>Since the CAP reform measures were introduced in 1992 restrictions are in place in a number of EU funded schemes which limit the size of the claim or restricts eligibility to certain categories of farmer.  These limits and restrictions arise from policy decisions within the framework of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>Article 2.2 of Commission Regulation 3887/92 provides as follows:</P>
      <P>Member states shall take the measures necessary to avoid that the conversion of existing holdings or the creation of new holdings after 30 June 1992 leads to the patently improper avoidance of the provisions relating to the individual limits on the eligibility for premiums .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1752" /> Effectively this requires that the Department must satisfy itself that where new holdings are created after 30 June 1992 they are in fact legitimate entities managed separately from existing holdings and that holdings which existed prior to 30 June 1992 were not split into two or more holdings for the sole purpose of avoiding individual limits on eligibility for premiums.  All applications lodged are processed by reference to the underlying principle defined in Article 2.2 of 3887/92.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy wishes to provide details of an individual case I will be happy to have it examined. However I will assure the Deputy that all cases are examined and processed in a fair and equitable fashion and a decision is taken by individual deciding officers based on the merits of each case from the information available.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that headage and premia schemes have been the subject of audit each year and based on these audits it is accepted that the type of checks and the inspection rate on applications lodged in this country give reasonable assurance that applicants are complying with the terms and conditions of the schemes and as a consequence with EU regulations.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to put a figure on the number of farms split in County Galway since 30 June 1992.  Figures available to date in relation to the processing of the 1997 marketing year schemes show that there was no applicant in Galway in that year who was regarded as dividing a holding in order circumvent the defined limits.</P>

      <P>The Revenue job assist is a new initiative introduced by me in the 1998 budget to assist the long-term unemployed back to work.</P>
      <P>According to statistics produced by the Revenue Commissioners on the evening of the 16 November a total of 920 cases had been issued a tax free allowance which included the job assist allowance.  Of these 375 were in receipt of additional allowances in respect of children. Statistics are not available, either from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, of the number of these people who were previously engaged on a job initiative scheme.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that their computer files are not set up in a way which makes it possible to identify customers who were previously on a job initiative pro-gramme. I have been advised that to develop automatic facilities to produce this information would involve programming and testing of software which could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It certainly is feasible to move from the job initiative scheme to the job assist scheme.  The job assist allowance is available to an individual who takes up a qualifying employment, having been continuously unemployed for the immediate period of 52 weeks prior to taking up the job and who has been in receipt of: unemployment benefit <Col N="1763" /> or unemployment assistance or one parent family payment.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of deciding whether an individual has the requisite 52 weeks of continuous unemployment, time spent on a number of Stateaided training courses or schemes will qualify as periods of unemployment, provided the individual had been in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or one parent family payment immediately prior to commencing the training.  The training schemes or courses concerned include the job initiative programme administered by FÁS.</P>
    <P>As regards the retention by employees of secondary benefits under both schemes, under the job assist programme an employee can retain his or her medical card for three years from the date he or she returns to work.  Other secondary benefits such as rent-mortgage subsidy, fuel allowance, etc., can also be retained for three years provided the gross pay is less than £250 weekly.  The employee is also entitled to benefit from the family income supplement, FIS, provided the family income falls below the qualifying limit.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that jobs initiative workers can qualify for family income supplement in the same way as other workers and retain child dependant allowances for 13 weeks upon commencement of employment, and for that reason jobs initiative workers are not entitled to secondary social welfare benefits.</P>

      <P>The Revenue job assist is a new initiative introduced by me in the 1998 budget to assist the long-term unemployed back to work.</P>
      <P>According to statistics produced by the Revenue Commissioners on the 16 November 1998 a total of 920 cases had been issued a tax free allowance which included the job assist allowance. The breakdown was as follows: single cases 574; married cases 330; widowed cases 16.</P>
      <P>Of the 920 cases who had been granted the allowance up to 16 November 1998, a total of 375 cases were also benefiting from the additional allowances in respect of qualifying children.</P>
      <P>The statistics available are for the country as a whole and are not analysed on a regional basis. The facilities available to interrogate Revenue's database files, and in particular the PAYE computer files do not enable the production of the statistics required by the Deputy.  I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that to develop the automatic facilities would involve programming and testing of software which could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This having been said, during October a file <Col N="1764" /> was extracted of all customers in receipt of the allowance.  At the date this file was extracted there were a total of 781 recipients.</P>
    <P>Of these 781 customers, a total 385 were employed by employers registered in the general claims district 001, that is employers dealt with in Dublin city and the surrounding counties.  This would suggest that roughly half of the recipients are from the Dublin catchment area, that is Dublin and the surrounding counties.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer began job-sharing on 7 September 1998. This reduced her salary by 50 per cent and it was necessary, therefore, to review her tax-free allowances. The reduction in her income meant that the taxpayer was no longer liable to pay tax at the 46 per cent, Table B rate, and she was not, consequently, eligible for the Table B tax free allowance.  The Table B allowance was withdrawn and a revised certificate of tax free allowances for the taxpayer was issued on 5 October 1998.</P>
      <P>During the period from the time she began job-sharing until the revised certificate of tax-free allowances issued, the taxpayer's tax free allowances had continued to include the Table B allowance and, as a consequence, she was underpaying tax.  The withdrawal of the Table B allowance meant that the correct amount of tax was deducted from the taxpayer's salary and this led to a reduction in her take home pay.</P>
      <P>I am sending a detailed analysis of the taxpayer's position to the Deputy.  If the taxpayer has any further queries she should contact her local inspector of taxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the resolution on democratic accountability in the third phase of EMU which was adopted by the European Parliament on 2 April 1998.  I understand that, in accordance with the final paragraph of the resolution, the text of the resolution was subsequently forwarded to the Commission, the Council and the European Monetary Institute, now the European Central Bank, ECB.</P>
      <P>In so far as the resolution is addressed to the ECB, this is a matter for the ECB itself.</P>
      <P>In relation to the accountability of the ECB, the Deputy will be aware that the independence of the ECB and of the national central banks in the exercise of the tasks of the European system of central banks, composed of the ECB and national central banks, is explicitly guaranteed by the treaty establishing the European Community. Such independence is, of course, counterbalanced by an appropriate degree of accountability and this is also provided for in the treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Treaty, the ECB must draw up and publish reports on the activities of the European system of central banks, ESCB, at least quarterly. The ECB must submit an annual report on the activities of the ESCB and on the monetary policy of both the previous and current year to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission and also to the European Council.  The President of the ECB must present this report to the Council and to the European Parliament, <Col N="1766" /> which may hold a general debate on the report. The President of the ECB and the other members of the executive board may, at the request of the European Parliament or on their own initiative, appear before the competent committees of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Treaty also provides for a framework for continuous dialogue between the Council of Ministers and the ECB, respecting their respective competencies.  The President of the Council of Ministers may participate, without having the right to vote, in meetings of the ECB governing council and may submit motions for deliberation. The President of the ECB shall be invited to participate in Council meetings when the Council is discussing matters relating to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB.</P>
    <P>In addition to these Treaty requirements, the ECB will be invited to take part, when appropriate, at the informal meetings of the Euro-11 group (comprising the Ministers of the States participating in the euro area).</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the President of the ECB has indicated that he will hold a press conference, normally once a month, after one of the fortnightly meetings of the governing council of the ECB.  The ECB has also indicated that the public will also be kept informed about its activities through speeches and regular publications.</P>
    <P>As I have previously indicated, I believe that these arrangements represent an appropriate balance between safeguarding the independence of the ECB and ensuring that it is accountable and transparent.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that as far as possible income from all sources should be subjected to taxation.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to cut the rate of DIRT on interest income in the event of a fall in interest rates.  However, any further cuts in the standard rate of income tax, now 24 per cent, will be reflected in the standard rate of DIRT.  The rate of DIRT for special savings accounts is 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the situation of individuals who are aged 65 or over, they are at present entitled to a refund of DIRT if their total income, including interest income, is below their total tax free allowances or as the case may be their income tax exemption thresholds.  Concessionary treatment is, therefore, already afforded to these individuals <Col N="1767" /> in the administration of DIRT where their incomes falls outside the tax net.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the proliferation of health information on the Internet, while offering obvious benefits to consumers, has also resulted in a number of problems.  These include difficulties in locating relevant information, and concerns about the sources, quality and reliability of information once it has been found.  In this context, &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; sites, maintained by authoritative statutory bodies, such as those cited by the Deputy, are clearly useful in pointing to recognised sources of health information on the Internet, and providing some degree of reassurance to consumers and health professionals about the reliability of their contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently convened a Working Group on Health Services Public Information, which is examining existing inadequacies in the provision <Col N="1768" /> of health information to the general public and specific groups by health agencies, and which will be making recommendations aimed at effecting improvements in information quality and dissemination, including the roles of conventional and electronic media.</P>
    <P>The working group will examine the final report of the Consumer Health Information Research Project, which was funded by my Department from national lottery funds and published in May 1998.  The report made a number of recommendations for improvements in public access to high quality, evidence-based information, and drew attention to the potential role of the Internet in assisting in these improvements. The group will also examine the work of the NHS Centre for Health Information Quality, the proposals for a National Electronic Library for Health, and for a &ldquo;National Gateway&rdquo; website to health information services on the Internet, to which I presume the Deputy is making reference in his question, contained in the recent United Kingdom strategy document &ldquo;Information for health&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the potential of the Internet in disseminating health information not only to the public at large, but in facilitating access to this information for groups with special needs like carers, people with disabilities and people living in rural communities.  In this context, I will be asking the working group to assess in detail the feasibility of a national health &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; website here.  The working group is due to report in mid-1999.</P>

      <P>The maternity and infant care scheme provides an agreed programme of care to an expectant mother arising out of her pregnancy and to her newborn baby for six weeks after birth.  The scheme, which is free of charge and is available to all women who are ordinarily resident in Ireland, offers a system of combined care by a general practitioner of the expectant mother's choice and by an obstetrician at the maternity unit/hospital of the mother's choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme Review Group, which was circulated to interested parties in April 1997, examined the role of the scheme in the context of maternity services generally.  It advised that the system of combined care provided under the scheme was the best and most convenient form of ante-natal care for the majority of mothers.  The group made a series of recommendations on the delivery of <Col N="1769" /> the scheme whose implementation is at present being pursued by my Department.  In this context, officials of my Department have been engaged in discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation, which represents general practitioners, and at no stage have any concerns of general practitioners about the scheme been brought to the attention of this Department.</P>

      <P>Any effort to realistically calculate the annual cost involved for the training of general practitioners involves consideration of a number of factors that make its precise calculation both difficult and subject to a range of purpose-related economic perspectives.  A student preparing for a career as a general practitioner has to undergo undergraduate training in a medical school, to be followed by internship.  The, should he or she wish to complete their general practice vocational training, which is a necessary prerequisite for eligibility for applying for a GMS scheme post, they would have to undergo a further three years of training of which two would be spent in a hospital and the final one in a specialised training general practice.  Each aspect of that training regime has costs elements that are both direct and indirect and relate not only to the individual undergoing the training but also to the institution or body providing it and the State in terms of the overall infrastructure within which training takes place.</P>
      <P>However, the Higher Education Authority has advised that based on unit data cost for 1996-97, the average annual cost of an undergraduate medical student is approximately £5,300, which, based on a six years course, results in a total average cost of £31,800.  These costs relate entirely to the university period of training and do not encompass any other costs associated with required training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> All qualified and registered general practitioners are free to engage in private practice. Entry by practitioners to the general medical services scheme, which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for general practice services for medical card holders is by way of open competition publicly advertised by the relevant recruiting health board, for new posts, vacancies and assistant-with-a-view to partnerships positions.  The procedures governing entry, which are the subject of full agreement with the Irish Medical Organisations, are intended to ensure that the highest calibre doctors are recruited to the scheme; that there is a proper level of access to, and choice of, general practitioner services for patients in each health board area; and that due regard is given, on the basis of agreed guidelines, to the question of the viability of practices in the areas in question.</P>

      <P>I understand from inquiries to the health boards that the problem of children begging is mainly concentrated in the Eastern Health Board region, primarily in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the statistics on children begging quoted in the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Leanbh initiative first annual report.  The Leanbh report indicates that the majority of the children begging in Dublin city centre are members of the travelling community.  The Eastern Health Board has informed my Department that the number of children involved is relatively small and they come from a small number of families who are well known to the authorities.  In general, the response of the Eastern Health Board has been to work with the travelling community and relevant voluntary groups rather than adopting a confrontational approach.</P>
      <P>The board, in conjunction with other agencies, supports a pre-school and a school for approximately 60 traveller children, a resource centre which provides amongst other services an after-school and youth programme, a drop-in service, advice, counselling and a social work service.  The board also provides financial assistance to the operating costs of residential centres for children from the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An aftercare programme for young members of the travelling community leaving residential care has been developed as well as a special foster <Col N="1771" /> care placement programme whereby traveller families foster traveller children.</P>

Additional revenue funding of £432,500 was provided to the Order's services in the Eastern region in respect of ten new day places and six new residential places.  This includes funding of £81,000 provided to meet the full year cost of additional services put in place in St. Raphael's in 1997.  £600,000 of the £3 million additional funding provided to the Eastern Health Board region for service developments in 1998 was set aside to assist in the management of any emergency cases which occurred during the year.

This represents a very substantial increase, year on year, and underpins the health agencies service plans, which is the benchmark for the delivery of service throughout 1998.</P>
    <P>The service plans adopted by agencies were structured to deliver services throughout 1998 and provided for technical adjustments, pay and non-pay, for the continuation of service developments initiated in previous years and, where appropriate, for further service developments, particularly in acute hospitals, mental handicap services, child care, nurse training and the like.</P>
    <P>While I am aware of the pressures within the system, agencies are fully aware of the need to maintain overall spending within the approved limits set.  I understand that agencies will deliver the full quantum of services as set out in their service plan for 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 171 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>The statistical information sought by the Deputy is not routinely gathered by my Department. However, I have asked the health boards to provide this data and I will communicate further with the Deputy when this becomes available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of services in this sector, including residential and respite care and various home supports for carers.  As recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating <Col N="1777" /> committees for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities have been put in place in each of the health boards.  The committees, which comprise of representatives of the voluntary and statutory agencies and people with disabilities themselves, function in a consultative and advisory capacity to the chief executive officers of the health boards in identifying and prioritising service developments and the allocation of available funding for this purpose.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of 1997, the previous Government made available an additional £3.688 million for the maintenance and development of services in this sector.  By comparison, this Government, in its first six months in office, allocated £10 million by way of once-off funding to address immediate and pressing problems in the sector namely the provision of aids and appliances and the elimination of deficits of the voluntary agencies providing services.  This year a further £8.4 million has been allocated comprising £5.4 million additional revenue and £3 million for capital projects. Of the £5.4 million revenue, £3 million has been specifically earmarked for the development of services in the sector.</P>
    <P>Towards an Independent Future recommends the provision of an additional 100 residential places and 200 dedicated respite places for people with disabilities.  The £10 million allocated in 1997 included a capital grant of £600,000 to the Irish Wheelchair Association for the development of its national residential respite care centre, &ldquo;Cuisle&rdquo;, in Roscommon, which provided an additional 60 places for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Of £3 million made available for development of these services this year, over £0.5 million has been allocated by the health boards to the development of respite care facilities. The £3 million allocated for capital projects has been allocated to address the most pressing needs for refurbishment and development of existing facilities including those at day care/day resource centres and residential homes as well providing for aids and appliances.</P>
    <P>In relation to services to persons with a mental handicap, the Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, which was published by my Department last year identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential/respite places and 1,036 new day places over the period in question, at a revenue cost of £63.5m. There are also associated capital costs.  To this end, I have provided an additional £25 million for the development of these services in the last 12 months or so.  I have also put in place a £30m capital programme, which began this year and which will run over four years.  The position is that, by the end of this year, over 250 new residential places (when account is taken of the emergency cases) and over 300 day places will have been provided for the mental handicap sector and services will continue to be expanded and enhanced as a result of the allocation of these resources.  While the additional residential places do include some respite facilities, further <Col N="1778" /> development of specific respite care services has been identified as a priority development.  The regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee structure will continue to work at local level to co-ordinate service developments and identify priority needs for the future.</P>
    <P>I fully acknowledge the burden of responsibility and the extraordinary commitment of the many carers and families providing care and support for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This has been widely recognised and reported on in the report of the commission on the status of people with disabilities, A Strategy for Equality and the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.</P>
    <P>As set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, this Government is committed to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed.  With regard to the provision of health services for people with physical and sensory disabilities and mental handicap, this commitment comprehends the implementation of the recommendations set out in Towards an Independent Future and progress on the Assessment of Need.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, measures have been introduced by the Eastern Health Board in response to the increased activity at Naas General Hospital.  These measures, which include the appointment of additional staff, have impacted positively In relieving the pressure on hospital services, particularly over the past number of months.

    <P>With regard to the major development at the hospital I am pleased to inform the Deputy that it is at an advanced stage.  A target date of mid-1999 has been identified for commencement of construction with the major portion of the works <Col N="1779" /> to be completed by end year 2000 when a phased handover of the new facilities will commence.

    <P>* This figure includes emergency patients who would not therefore have been included in the waiting list figure on 01-01-98.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently announced a major package of investment in cardiac services totalling 4.9 million.  This investment is made up of two elements, £2.3 million to reduce waiting lists for cardiac surgery patients under the 1998 cardiac surgery waiting list initiative and £2.6 million to meet the 1998 costs of improvements in cardiac care infrastructure to support the cardiovascular health strategy initiative, which I announced earlier this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the interim measures to reduce the public cardiac surgery waiting list, the 1998 Initiative target is to provide appropriate treatment <Col N="1780" /> for an additional 265 adults and an additional 30 children.  My Department's strategy for achieving this aim involves the purchase of additional cardiac procedures in both the public and private sectors and the treatment of suitable patients with medical cardiac therapies.  I am confident that these measures will build on last year's success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the national cardiac surgery waiting list.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons and the maintenance of waiting lists are the statutory responsibility of the eight health boards.  As my Department does not maintain information regarding numbers undergoing or awaiting treatment in the detail required by the Deputy, I have asked the chief executive officer of each health board to provide the information to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>There have been no changes in recent times in the statutory provisions relating to orthodontic treatment.  Entitlement to the provision of orthodontic treatment is established under the provisions of section 66 and section 67 of the Health Act, 1970.  Because of the high cost of fixed appliance orthodontic therapy, health boards can only provide this treatment where a child has a handicapping orthodontic condition.  Children are assessed, therefore, in accordance with guidelines drawn up by my Department, to ensure that resources are used to best advantage and for those most affected or handicapped.</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group has been set up by the health boards to examine a range of issues in relation to the orthodontic services including the guidelines. This group, which includes health board consultant orthodontists, is due to report to the chief executive officers of the health boards in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health <Col N="1781" /> boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan for developments in orthodontic services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Cervical smear tests can be taken by different professionals and in different locations &mdash; general practitioners or practice nurses in GP surgeries, by doctors at family planning clinics, by gynaecologists in hospitals and in their own practices and by public health nurses in health board clinics. Information on waiting times for appointments with individual practitioners is not available. In relation to those health boards which provide a smear test service in health board clinics, two health boards, the North-Eastern and the South-Eastern have indicated that there are waiting times for initial smear tests in some of their clinics.  In the North-Eastern Health Board there are no delays where services are provided in the acute hospitals.  However, in community care clinics there is a waiting period of six to eight weeks in Meath and 12 to 16 weeks in Louth.</P>
      <P>In the South-Eastern Health Board, approximately 16,000 smear tests are carried out annually for women in the region.  In excess of 15,000 of these tests are taken by general practitioners/gynaecologists.  The remaining smears, approximately 800, are carried out in community care clinics in Waterford, Carlow-Kilkenny and South Tipperary.  There is no waiting period in the South Tipperary clinics. However, in Waterford clinics where approximately 100 smears are taken annually, the waiting time is 8 to 10 months.  In Carlow-Kilkenny approximately 300 smears are taken annually and the waiting period is 10 to 12 months.  I am advised by the South-Eastern Health Board that because of the waiting period for tests in the Carlow-Kilkenny community care area a decision was made to refer all new patients to their general practitioner for smear tests until this waiting list has been eliminated.  The board will, however, continue to provide a service for patients who do not wish to have the procedure carried out by their general practitioner.</P>
      <P>Following the initial taking of a cervical smear test, the smear is sent to a laboratory for analysis. There are 18 laboratories throughout the country which provide this service and each health board is free to use whichever laboratory it chooses.  At present arrangements are in place so that smears which are deemed to be urgent can be dealt with immediately.  The waiting time for the results of routine analysis from these laboratories is set out in table 1.</P>

However, I am advised by the Eastern Health Board that residents in long stay care units are not issued with medical cards and patients admitted to their care forego their medical card entitlements.  The person concerned is currently a resident of such a unit.  It has its own medical service and pharmacy with direct transfer to a general hospital, if required.  Optical services are provided through a local optician by direct contract to the hospital.  Dental services have, in the past, been provided for residents of the hospital concerned at an Eastern Health Board dental clinic in the area and the board is reviewing how the provision of this service should continue in the broader perspective of service provision to residents of long stay institutions, generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised that the health board's dental service personnel will make contact with the matron's office at the hospital and arrange <Col N="1783" /> for dental assessment and treatment of the person concerned.</P>

      <P>EU vehicle emission standards directives are mainly directed at the manufacture and entry into service of new vehicles.

      <P>I expect to be in a position shortly to announce the award of a contract to carry out testing of passenger cars, including emissions testing, in accordance with the requirements of the directive. The date on which testing will commence will be determined by the contractor's ability to mobilise the network of test centres and other resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations, such as the group mentioned in the Deputy's question, who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  A review of applications under the 1998 scheme indicated that some 940 applications had been received.  The regional breakdown of these applications is attached at appendix A.</P>
      <P>Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme this year I recently sought, and obtained, Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million.  The allocation of these additional funds will allow my Department to assist a large number of people again this year and the regional offices of my Department are currently processing applications. They expect to be in a position soon to advise groups of the decision regarding their applications.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment.  The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.  While preliminary figures suggest that additional funding would be required to fund all applications at the 90 per cent level it is expected that, as in previous years, the final demands under the scheme will be less than the initial preliminary figures would indicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1788" /> Therefore, I am satisfied that the current level of funding is sufficient to allow my Department to make a meaningful response to worthwhile applications and to assist a large number of people again this year.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme.  It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people will be assisted this year. This means that since I came into office in July of last year I have spent £10 million on this scheme as opposed to £2 million spent by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible.  In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.  The final report from the consultants will be available later this year.</P>

Mr. John Treacy, executive chairman of the Irish Sports Council, has met with all national governing bodies of sport, currently funded by my Department at least once during the past twelve months, as part of an ongoing programme of meetings to monitor progress and development of their respective sporting activities.</P>
      <P>Later this month I will be hosting a one day conference for all national governing bodies to update them on policy developments.</P>

      <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under <Col N="1799" /> which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved.  The response may take the form of a full-time or part-time resource teacher or child care support depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
      <P>The school in question is one of a number of schools which have applied to my Department for the services of a special needs assistant.  All such applications will now be considered in the context of this new arrangement.  I expect that additional allocations of special needs assistant posts will commence in the near future and continue through 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my key priorities as Minister is the establishment of a national educational psychological service.  Earlier this year, my Department recruited 15 educational psychologists for the purpose of expanding the psychological service to primary schools.  One of these psychologists has been assigned to certain primary schools in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>On 15 September last, I launched and endorsed the report of the planning group, which has prepared recommendations for me on how a national educational psychological service may best be introduced.  Subject to the approval of Government, implementation of the report will begin in 1999.  It is not possible to meet all the needs in all areas at the same time, so a phased expansion of the service is necessary.  It is my intention that there will be an educational psychological service available to all schools by the end of the five-year implementation phase.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are inevitably many schools in County Kerry which do not yet have access to my Departments psychological service. Attention will be paid to the needs of all areas as the psychological service is expanded.</P>

      <P>My Department does not have an application for the establishment of a special class for children with autism in the Monaghan area.  The Deputy will be aware of my recent announcement concerning the establishment of special classes for children with autism.  In the current school year, a number of special classes catering specifically for children with autism, have been established in both primary schools and special schools.  To date a total of 14 such classes have been set up in primary schools and seven classes in special schools.  Each class, which caters for a maximum of six children, receives the support of a class teacher, a child care assistant and enhanced capitation funding.  In addition, an out-reach support service is provided by the relevant health authority.  Special classes are established on the basis of an assessed level of need.  If the Deputy would like to provide information concerning children with autism in the Monaghan area requiring a special class service, my Department will investigate such provision.</P>

      <P>The person in question is not a pupil of the special school referred to by the Deputy.  The individual concerned is a trainee attending a vocational training centre.  While my Department sanctions some teaching hours for trainees attending vocational training centres, the centres are funded by the health authorities and do not form part of the remit of my Department. However, wherever possible, my Department tries to facilitate such trainees with transport to and from vocational training centres on school buses providing that no additional cost is involved.  In this particular case, the provision of a home pick-up/set-down service would entail additional costs as the school bus would have to be diverted from its current route.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the child to whom the Deputy refers.  I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved.  The response may take the form of a <Col N="1802" /> full or part-time resource teacher or child care support depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
      <P>The school in question is one of a number of schools who have applied to my Department for assistance in meeting the needs of particular children, including the services of a special needs assistant.  All such applications will now be considered in the context of this new arrangement.  I expect that additional allocations of special needs assistant posts will commence in the near future and continue through 1999.  I also expect that the resources required by the school in question to meet this particular child's needs will be allocated shortly.</P>

      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers has an authorised staffing in the current school year of a principal and two class teachers.  This allocation is based on the school's September 1997 enrolment of 79 pupils.  In addition to having the services of a remedial teacher, the school is also involved in the rural phase of Breaking the Cycle pilot initiative.  The post of rural co-ordinator of this initiative is based at this school.  There does not appear to be a basis for further staffing at this school at this stage.  However, I understand that an inspector from my Department recently visited the school.  As soon as the inspector's report is received, the staffing levels at the school will again be reviewed.  Thereafter, my officials will correspond directly with the managerial authorities of the school in this matter.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding to the third level institutions to operate a hardship fund to assist students in a compassionate and sensitive manner who may otherwise have to leave college due to financial hardship.  The 1998 allocations will be issued shortly to the individual colleges. I understand from County Waterford Vocational Education Committee that the student referred <Col N="1803" /> to is in receipt of a European Social Fund-aided maintenance grant at the full adjacent rate.  I further understand that the student has not made <Col N="1804" /> an application for assistance under the hardship fund and I suggest that the student should make an enquiry about the fund to the institute's student welfare officer.</P>
