      <P>No. 3 is the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1998.  Perhaps it is indicative of the lack of interest that the House takes in the Defence Forces that we are scheduling a debate on this important matter just before midnight. The House might note the comments today by the Chief of Staff about the matter.  I hope that in ordering business for the next session the Government will give serious priority to the interests of the Defence Forces, the discussion on the Defence White Paper and to taking the necessary decisions so that our Defence Forces are modernised in such a way that they can serve the State, as they wish to.</P>

      <P>I am sure we all join Deputy Quinn in wishing the Northern Ireland Assembly well today.  It is an historic day for this island.  The Assembly will operate in fairly difficult circumstances but everyone of goodwill will seek to make the best of it.</P>
      <P>When are we likely to see No. 86, the Registration of Births, Marriages and Deaths Bill, 1998, from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs?  The Bill is to reform the existing legislation with regard to such registration.</P>

    <Title>Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1998: From the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 7 and 8 are consequential on amendments Nos. 5 and 6.  Amendments Nos. 1, 5, 6, 7 and 8 may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 1: In page 3, between lines 8 and 9, the following definition inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Act of 1992&rsquo; means the Patents Act, 1992;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 involve making substantive changes to the Patents Act, 1992, bearing on the conditions of tenure of the Office of Controller of Patents Designs and Trademarks. Amendments Nos. 1, 7 and 8 are drafting amendments, the adoption of which would be required as a consequence of the adoption of amendments Nos. 6 and 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 6, amending section 6 of the Patents Act, 1992, provides that the Patents Office shall be under the control of the controller who shall act under the general superintendence and direction of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  This reinstates a provision for general ministerial superintendence and direction which was in place prior to the enactment of the Patents Act, 1992.  Amendment No. 7, amending section 97 of the Patents Act, <Col N="863" /> 1992, clarifies the legislative environment of the tenure in office of the Controller of Patents Designs and Trademarks on a number of points.</P>
    <P>The proposed new subhead (1) of section 97 establishes the basic conditions of appointment and tenure of the office.  I refer in particular to subparagraph (d) which will ensure that the present controller retains his personal conditions of tenure, such as rights to remuneration, superannuation, etc.  The proposed new subhead (3) clarifies the requirement that a controller while in office shall be deemed to be employed in the Civil Service.  The proposed new subhead (3)(a) would secure the Minister's right to specify the place at which the Patents Office and its staff are to be located and from which the functions of the controller are to be discharged.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that provision is made to allow the Minister to specify exceptions to this designated location.  This provision will allow the Minister to specify that patent and trademark hearings may be held at locations other than the designated location of the office or that particular staff or functions of the office may be located away from its designated location on a temporary or permanent basis should this prove expedient or necessary to the effective performance of the office.</P>
    <P>The Government believes the new provision was a particularly important clarification of the legislative position regarding the location of the Patents Office and of the discharge of the functions of the controller in the context of the forthcoming move of the Patents Office to Kilkenny. The proposed new subhead 4A is self-explanatory and provides for the specific circumstances in which the person appointed to the office of the controller may be removed.</P>
    <P>The proposed new subsections (5) and (6) make provision for officers authorised by the Minister to act in place of the controller subject to the terms of the authorisation concerned where this is deemed necessary or expedient.  The table following the specific amendments shows a consolidated version of section 97 of the Patents Act, 1972 as it would appear following the adoption of amendment No. 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on the last occasion this Bill was in the Dáil, my party generally favours it and will not oppose it.  However, I have a number of reservations about it.  The Minister of State will recall that during Question Time yesterday I raised the issue of the perceived dangers in the area of traditional music.  I also raised that matter on the last occasion the Bill was debated here. I am disappointed the Minister of State did not endeavour to tackle this complex area, but I am pleased he will monitor the position in the period leading up to the enactment of the forthcoming Copyright and Related Rights Bill and that he will put any measures that are required in place. I ask him to be extremely vigilant in monitoring this area because we do not want multinationals <Col N="864" /> from outside the State to come in here and use modern technology to digitise traditional Irish music, which is not subject to copyright law, and claim copyright on it.  This matter has been raised on a number of occasions and it is extremely important and complex.</P>
      <P>An extraordinary situation has developed in that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is in danger of breaching copyright law.  Yesterday the Industrial Development Enterprise Ireland Bill was before us.  The patent to the title &ldquo;Enterprise Ireland&rdquo; is owned by another body and if there are exhibitions or functions it is the only body that can legally use that title.  I cannot understand how the Minister will set up an agency that is also expected to use that title.  There is a danger she could break the law in that regard.  The Minister of State is responsible for copyright legislation and I urge him to ensure this anomaly is corrected as soon as possible.  We will have an opportunity to do that tomorrow.  We do not want to come back here during the summer to deal with a matter as important as this in one sense but quite trivial in another sense.  Perhaps the Minister of State will ensure the name Enterprise Ireland is changed.  The Small Firms Association is entitled to the protection of the law and demand that in this area.</P>
      <P>We do not have any major difficulties with the other changes outlined by the Minister of State. The new subhead 4A states &ldquo;. whose removal appears to the Government to be necessary for the effective performance of the functions of Controller.',&rdquo;.  That is a sweeping provision, but as this Bill will be amended when the substantive legislation is introduced later in the year we will hold fire on that.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for bringing this legislation before us even though we would be happier if we were dealing with the substantive legislation.  It is important that Ireland is not brought before an international court.  I understand one of the main reasons for introducing this legislation is the Minister was more or less compelled to do so by the United States.  Otherwise we would probably have faced sanctions from the World Trade Organisation.  We do not want Ireland's name to be muddied internationally by delays caused by the Government's failure to introduce the substantive legislation.  For that reason we do not oppose this Bill and we want to do everything we can to ensure its speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I echo many of the comments made by Deputy Stanton.  This critical legislation must be passed as soon as possible.  However, it is disappointing that more than a year has passed and the team in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has not come forward with a substantial Bill.  It seems many of the fundamental issues on ownership, authorship and traditional music, referred to earlier and to which Deputy Rabbitte referred on Second Stage, had not been dealt with at this stage.  The Department <Col N="865" /> has been working on this for the past seven or eight years, but such significant legislation is essential to give us the impetus to develop our information technology industry, which forms such a critical part of our economy.  It was said recently we have two economies, one based on the high tech industry where there is a good deal of development and those engaged in it earn high salaries and another one in which those engaged in it earn a much lower salary.  This Bill is a prerequisite for the operation of the high tech economy.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello spoke on this Bill in the Seanad.  I note two small amendments to delete the word &ldquo;commencement&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;passing&rdquo; tabled by my colleagues, Senators Costello, Gallagher and O'Meara are still before us.  I also note the Government has tabled a major amendment dealing with the controller.  Why was such a fundamental amendment not included in the original Bill?  This is a small Bill and, to some extent, it represents fire brigade action.  It had to be introduced to enable us to solve a basic problem which had arisen and to give us a basis for the forthcoming substantial Bill.  Why did the Government not wait to include that major amendment in the main patent Bill?  Why is it seeking to amend the 1992 Act in such a seemingly significant way in relation to the controller's office?</P>
      <P>I note what the Minister of State said about the designation of the location where the controller may be based.  As a Dublin Deputy, I am of the view that enough Government institutions have been moved out of Dublin.  We have lost many Civil Service jobs in recent years.  I and my colleagues tend to keep a careful watch on this situation. Something in the region of 40 or 50 per cent of the Civil Service is based outside the capital.</P>
      <P>Why was such a lengthy and seemingly fundamental amendment not included with the rest of the Bill?</P>
      <P>Having said that, I welcome the fact that the Minister introduced this Bill to at least deal with the difficulties which arose earlier in the year with the World Trade Organisation.  The Americans were apparently threatening to take action at an international level against Ireland if we did not act speedily.  I commend the Minister for dealing with that now.</P>
      <P>I look forward in the autumn to liaising closely with the Department on the heads of the Bill which the Minister proposes to introduce. Clearly, it will be one of the most complex Bills which the 28th Dáil will enact.  I look forward to having a lengthy period to consider it and offering advice to the Minister on the future shape of patent and copyright law.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as, clearly, we were in grave danger of being blacklisted and in serious trouble with the World Trade Organisation.  I understand that at least one other European member state is already in trouble because <Col N="866" /> it did not introduce a minor legislative amendment such as this.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendments are necessary. However, I, too, want to return to the new subsection (4A) in amendment No. 6, which inserts a new section 5.  That subsection gives the Minister new powers.  It states: &ldquo;the Government may remove from the office of Controller a person who has become incapable through ill-health of effectively performing the duties of Controller or for stated misbehaviour or whose removal appears to the Government to be necessary for the effective performance of the functions of Controller&rdquo;.  I can understand a person becoming incapable of performing his or her duties through ill-health or misbehaviour, if a person embezzles or carries on in an illegal manner.  However, that last section, which seems to give the Government complete power to make a decision that a person is not effective and to remove him or her, appears to be an open-ended power.  A person might not get on with the Minister of the day due to a clash of personalities and the Minister could decide the person is not effectively performing his or her duty.  I hope the Minister can satisfy me that that is a tight control.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to fix a time period? I think he fixed a period of five years.  I understand that has not been the case to date.  The Minister has moved from having an open-ended appointment <i>ad infinitum</i> until the person reaches the age of retirement to a five year period.  I assume the person can be appointed for a second five year period.  Is that the case?  That would be only right and proper.</P>
      <P>I want to return to the issue my colleague, Deputy Stanton, raised and impress on the Minister the seriousness of the situation.  Deputy Stanton confirmed that &ldquo;Enterprise Ireland&rdquo; has been patented not only in Ireland but through an EU office.  The Small Firms' Association is identified with &ldquo;Enterprise Ireland&rdquo; in its conferences, seminars or exhibitions.  Deputy Broughan also raised this yesterday, as did my colleague, Deputy Perry. Yesterday the Minister appeared to rubbish that particular argument.  She said she thought the SFA was happy with the use of the name &ldquo;Enterprise Ireland&rdquo;.  Our understanding is that the SFA has taken legal advice to challenge the use of &ldquo;Enterprise Ireland&rdquo;.  As Minister in charge of copyright and patents, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, must seriously examine this so that, before we take Report Stage of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Bill, 1998, tomorrow morning, the Minister can be certain that there will not be a challenge to it.  We have co-operated to bring that Bill through this House at a speedy pace because the Minister seems adamant to set up Enterprise Ireland by 16 July.  It will not do any good, having sat last night in select committee until after 10 p.m. to agree Committee Stage and having agreed to take Report Stage, to then find that the Minister has not done her homework and cannot use the term &ldquo;Enterprise Ireland&rdquo;.  That would be a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> In reply to a question from my colleague, Deputy Stanton, the Minister of State said he cannot introduce the trade mark rules because the intellectual property unit of his Department is completely overburdened with work in preparation for the forthcoming copyright Bill.  The Minister of State must fight his corner to get staff to take care simultaneously of such issues as trade marks and the forthcoming copyright Bill.  These are areas of law which may not receive great resonance with the public.  However, when people find themselves at the receiving end of bad law, then they will make noise about it.  I realise it is difficult for the Minister of State to make a great song and dance about the fact that his intellectual property unit is understaffed, but if he does not get the necessary staff to introduce the trade mark rules which are required under the Madrid Protocol and at the same time finalise the forthcoming copyright Bill, he will end up in the courts and bring down Ireland's name internationally. With all the advantages and extra money which the Government has at present, why is the Minister of State unable to get the necessary qualified personnel even on a part-time contract basis to help with the forthcoming copyright Bill and the other work of the Department?</P>
    <P>In the forthcoming Bill it is essential that we deal with software and the fact that much software is now being pirated and used in an unlicensed manner.  The Minister of State will be aware that last week I tabled a question to all Ministers to ensure that every Department was using licensed software.  The forthcoming Bill must contain strong penalties.  There must be significant penalties of fines and jailing but also significant powers to make dawn raids.  At present firms buy two copies of licensed software.  If a firm has staff of ten, 12, 20 or 100, copies are made of the software and it is difficult to identify this practice.  It is not possible to incorporate alarm systems in the software to inform a person who is using it.  The only way to address the matter is to physically find the copied disks at the firm which is behaving illegally.  I hope the Minister of State will take on board the recommendations of the Business Software Alliance, which is alerting the Opposition to its concerns about software piracy.  This is probably the most serious element of the forthcoming copyright Bill which the Minister must examine because so much work is done through the use of software and information technology of all sorts.  The terminology of the forthcoming Bill must be adamant that we will stamp out the use of illegally copied pirated products on which people have spent a great deal of time, energy and academic skill to develop.  At present people can just take disks away and copy them and people lose their rights of copyright.  I hope that in the larger forthcoming Bill the Minister will take on board the concerns which have been expressed by the Business Software Alliance, and that the work of researchers and developers will not be pirated in this way.</P>

It has been agreed that this is a limited measure.  I hope there will be no taking the foot off the pedal in regard to the main Bill which the Minister of State has promised to introduce in the autumn.</P>
      <P>On the extraordinary insertion of a major substituting section, the Minister of State should be frank and explain what has brought this on now. It is an unusual section and I presume it has only come about as a result of the failure of the Minister of State and his staff and the controller to agree.  That can be the only explanation.  I do not want to abuse knowledge that I possess but I am aware of recent developments in this area.  It is extraordinary that the Minister of State is enshrining in law the substitutions listed and inserting in statute that the office shall be situated in a location to be determined &mdash; I presume Kilkenny &mdash; and that the controller shall locate there or else.  I would like the Minister of State who has included this major change among some minor amendments to explain why this is the case.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  Deputy Stanton raised the question of traditional music which was dealt with yesterday. I share his concern.  I have met representatives of Ceoltas Ceolteoirí Éireann and IMRO and clarified some of the issues raised.  I have given an assurance that we will monitor the position.</P>
      <P>On the question of Enterprise Ireland which was raised by Deputies Stanton and Owen, it is my information that the terms are unlikely to have copyright implications but may have trade mark implications.  I will discuss the matter with my colleague, the Tánaiste, who dealt with it on Committee Stage.  Software is a crucial aspect on which I share the views expressed.</P>
      <P>On the substantive issue, Deputy Rabbitte asked me to be frank.  He, more than anyone, is aware of the background to this important matter on which I offered the party spokespersons the opportunity to be briefed by officials of my Department.  It is fair to ask why the provision is being included in this legislation rather than in a more substantial Bill.  Negotiations are ongoing but there is an issue which needs to be addressed. The amendment reinstates a provision for general ministerial superintendence and direction which was in place prior to the enactment of the Patents Bill, 1992.  In effect, it marks a return to the normal relationship between the controller and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Seanad I gave assurances with regard to the rights of the individual in question.  It is <Col N="869" /> obvious that Deputies have been well briefed on the matter.  The Patents Office is to be relocated in Kilkenny in August.  It is in the interests of the good management of the office that any uncertainty on the points raised should be dispelled prior to relocation.  In that context it is expedient to employ this Bill, although the provision could be attached to any intellectual property Bill. When I was briefed on the matter I saw merit in attaching it to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the office will be run efficiently and effectively.  There are problems which need to be addressed but there is only so much one can say when negotiations are ongoing.  I dealt with the matter in more detail in the Seanad, the Members of which were clear on the implications of this provision and the background to it.  They were briefed by officials of my Department in advance of the debate.</P>

      <P>I suggested on the last occasion that the Bill does not distinguish between drugs, it treats all drugs as if they were the same.  I am reluctant to oppose a Bill that is a response to the drugs crime crisis &mdash; I have raised the issue and sought responses long enough &mdash; but the Minister must focus specifically on the heroin crisis which is the main cause of the crime and human misery associated with drugs.</P>
      <P>Anyone who is not an addict and who supplies heroin solely for profit should be imprisoned for at least ten years.  I would have no difficulty with that.  However, the Bill does not recommend the imposition of such sentences.  Under the Bill, mandatory sentences of ten years will be imposed based on the value of drug found, and not, as they should be, on the degree of harm, devastation or crime caused by that drug.  Heroin valued at £2,000 will be the cause of more human degradation and misery, devastation of communities and criminal activity than that caused by £200,000 worth of other drugs.  That is a fundamental flaw in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> If the Minister persists in pursuing the Bill in its current form, he will do a disservice to the war against drugs because fundamental to that war is our ability to identify and target the main cause of the problem.  Heroin should be our main target.  Other countries are beginning to direct resources against those who supply heroin.  I am sure the Minister of State will convey my views on this matter to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  When in Opposition, the Minister brought forward this idea to the then Select Committee on Legislation and Security and I expressed my views to him on it at that stage.  However, it is clear that he has not changed his mind.</P>
    <P>When the Bill passes through the House, will it suffer the same fate as the bail restrictions which have not yet been implemented?  I am concerned that it merely represents another PR response and that its provisions will not be implemented. When the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, announced plans for a bail referendum I fully supported her proposal, specifically on the basis that it was essential to restrict access to bail for those involved in drug dealing at a time when heroin was being sold openly on the streets of Dublin, causing havoc in communities and bringing misery to thousands of addicts.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, highly publicised raids by gardaí which resulted in the charging of dozens of heroin pushers has again focused attention on the need to implement the bail restrictions as a matter of urgency.  Those restrictions have been available for implementation since the referendum.  The heroin pushers to whom I referred who were charged in the courts a week ago are out on bail and are continuing to push heroin. Dozens of heroin dealers similarly charged &mdash; some were charged a number of times during the past year or more &mdash; are also back on the streets selling heroin.  This is frustrating for the Garda, local communities and public representatives such as myself who represent areas where heroin is the cause of crime and social problems.</P>
    <P>I spoke to gardaí in my area about named individuals who supply heroin in places such as Sheriff Street.  I was informed that in some instances these people have appeared before the courts on several occasions and they are currently out on bail and continuing to supply illegal drugs, an offence punishable under our laws by a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  In a recent parliamentary question I asked the Minister if the bail restrictions could be implemented on a phased basis with initial emphasis placed on crimes that are most likely to be repeated if the individual concerned was granted bail.  I cannot think of any other category of serious crime where persons, as soon as they are charged, leave the courts and return to the streets to continue with their criminal activities until the date of the next court appearance.  That is the reality of heroin dealing in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Surely there is a case for special separate court sittings to deal specifically with people involved <Col N="871" /> in the heroin trade where bail can be refused when gardaí give evidence that a person is likely to continue to re-offend.  I understand that, at present, bail can be refused only if there is evidence that a person is likely to abscond or that witnesses might be intimidated.  In that context, I was appalled to read recent newspaper reports that a person charged in connection with a serious offence relating to a contract murder had, when arrested, been found in possession of several false passports and other forged documents.  Incredibly, the reports indicated that he was granted bail on his third court appearance.  The individual in question promptly left the jurisdiction without any difficulty.  Will the Minister indicate if this really happened?</P>
    <P>I am interested in discovering the facts surrounding this case because I do not believe the media reports to which I referred have been refuted.  I have tabled a parliamentary question to be answered tomorrow in respect of this matter.  Was the judge who granted bail aware of all the aspects surrounding this case?  The Minister should seek clarification in respect of such cases. The case to which I refer is that of a Christopher &ldquo;Bud&rdquo; Dwyer which featured in articles concerning the sale of his house to the then Assistant Garda Commissioner.  Those articles raised important questions, some of which remain unanswered.  I emphasise that I am not suggesting or inferring wrongdoing on anyone's part, but issues such as this which are legitimately raised by responsible members of the media should be fully clarified by the Garda press office and, where necessary, by the Commissioner.  This would clear the air and it would be in the interests of the Garda Síochána and our democracy.</P>
    <P>I feel obliged to raise my concerns on matters of this sort in the House.  Since I entered the Dáil in 1982, I have raised every aspect of the drugs-crime issue and I would be entirely inconsistent if I did not express my concerns in respect of this matter.  I will say no more about this except to reiterate that questions put by reputable members of the news media should be answered in full.  I say that in the context of public servants who regularly call for the removal of the right to silence for ordinary citizens.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister is concerned about the causes of crime.  These are fundamental to the Bill which is a response to the drugs-crime crisis. On four or five occasions in recent weeks I stated that it is incredible that so much time is being spent on developing responses to the crisis involving drugs and crime.  At the same time in the Dublin north inner city drugs task force area six primary schools will lose teachers.  It is a scandal and an absolute disgrace.  Those schools and the children need more teachers to deal with the social deprivation that fuels the heroin crisis.  I hope the Minister will convey that message to the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Science.  The teachers must be allowed to remain in the schools and additional <Col N="872" /> resources given to them.  The most critical resource which the schools have should not be taken from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> This Bill is seriously flawed.  It is a blunt instrument to deal with a very serious problem and, unfortunately, it will not deal with it in the correct way.  It is typical of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who takes an axe to a problem when a scalpel would suffice.  Heroin is a nightmare for thousands of people, particularly in Dublin, and for the communities devastated by the problems that go with it.  It must be fought relentlessly.</P>
      <P>Some of the methods adopted in the Bill will achieve the opposite effect from that which, presumably, the Minister intends.  Putting heroin on a par with cannabis and making no distinction between them is dangerous.  There are great differences between heroin and cannabis.  Heroin is a drug that kills.  It reduces people to the level of vegetables and when it gets people in its grip it turns them into unthinking criminals who wreak devastation on their own communities, families and friends to feed their habit.  Heroin takes everything away from people.</P>
      <P>The Bill effectively considers cannabis to have the same effect.  Cannabis is an entirely different drug, especially in the way it is perceived in society.  According to surveys carried out by serious elements in the media many thousands of people regard cannabis as a recreational drug and use it as such.  It is time we debated cannabis in an honest and non-hysterical way, considering medical and sociological evidence in a rational fashion.</P>
      <P>Society would be better off without drugs of any description.  It would be a happier state of affairs if people did not use drugs.  Unfortunately, we live in a drug-ridden society.  Most of the drugs infesting society are legally available &mdash; alcohol and nicotine being the most widely used.  In that context, some of the biggest drug pushers are pillars of society pushing alcohol and cigarettes legally in fancy packaging with fancy advertising.</P>
      <P>Young people are increasingly cynical about this state of affairs.  The millions of young people in Europe who use cannabis as a recreational drug face the Minister's proposal in the Bill for an obligatory ten year sentence for being caught with a large amount of cannabis, whereas deadly drugs such as alcohol and nicotine are pushed freely and are the source of massive profits.  The Minister's message to young people is that heroin and cannabis are drugs of equal dimensions.  The Minister must address this matter and, hopefully, change the provision.  It is a seriously dangerous message to portray heroin and cannabis as equally damaging and dangerous drugs.  It is not the case and young people do not believe it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another danger in regarding these drugs in the same way.  The same gangsters who deal in heroin also deal in cannabis.  In the nether world where young people meet drug pushers to buy cannabis they meet the same people who <Col N="873" /> push heroin &mdash; one night cannabis is for sale and the next it may be heroin.  The issues must be discussed rationally and openly.  However, the Bill sends out a dangerous message that must be corrected.</P>
    <P>People who push heroin must be dealt with ruthlessly.  Local communities have dealt with them most effectively.  It was only when working class communities fought back that they forced the Government to take belated action.  Many pushers have been forced out and many young people saved from heroin because of the brave actions of working class communities.  Social problems, such as poverty, bad homes and a lack of recreational facilities, are the main reasons heroin is such a problem in certain areas of Dublin.  Addressing and solving those problems is the solution to the heroin nightmare rather than this crude legislative instrument.</P>

      <P>During last year's general election campaign Fianna Fáil committed itself to implement a policy of zero tolerance against criminals.  The people support such a policy because they feel that the criminals have had the upper hand of the authorities for too long.  The law enforcement agencies needed stronger powers to ensure criminals are brought to justice and prosecuted.  While this is recognised as a general principle for all activities that breach the State's criminal codes, it is more acutely required in the ongoing battle to defeat drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a strong legislative provision which gives the law enforcement agencies the power to tackle the drug barons head on and ensures that stiff penalties can and will be handed down to those involved in drug trafficking and pushing. The Bill is practical and substantive evidence of the Government's commitment to pursue a vigorous policy of zero tolerance against criminals, in particular drug traffickers, who continue to bring so much misery to so many people and to upset the social fabric of rural and urban communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New drug related offences are included in this Bill.  A person convicted of having drugs with a value of £10,000 or more will face a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years and, at the discretion of the court, unlimited fines can be imposed by the court, except in certain circumstances.  The circumstances include whether the person pleads guilty, at what stage the person pleaded guilty and the circumstances surrounding the plea.  The Bill distinguishes between those involved in drug related crime for profit and those who are merely drug addicts.  In the majority of cases where the minimum ten year penalty applies, the power conferred on the Minister under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 to remit or commute a punishment will not be exercisable until the minimum period <Col N="874" /> specified by the court has been served except for grave humanitarian reasons.  Confiscation orders can now also be served by the courts following a conviction for drug trafficking offences.  This provision can also be described as a tough crime fighting provision.</P>
    <P>Drug traffickers have been warned in advance that if they are caught peddling drugs with an estimated value in excess of £10,000 they will face a mandatory jail sentence of ten years.  Due to the severity of these provisions, it is possible that many people may reconsider their involvement in drug trafficking.  I strongly advise them to do so unless they are fond of long prison sentences.  We must not allow toleration of a drugs culture in Ireland.  We all know of the health and social effects of what are deemed hard drugs such as heroin.  However, we must remember that soft drugs, which are known as designer and synthetic drugs, continue to cause problems in our society and must remain illegal and banned substances. There are some elements in Europe, particularly some members of the Green group in the European Parliament, who recently pushed for the legalisation of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy, LSD and amphetamines in Europe.  The strongest message possible must be sent out to young people that the use of synthetic drugs is not only dangerous but illegal and punishable as a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>Clubs where drugs, whether soft or hard, are tolerated must have their licences withdrawn and appropriate prosecutions must ensue.  While I acknowledge that there is a need for social and educational interventions to tackle the root causes of crime, we must also deter the greedy, the evil and the selfish from pursuing criminal activities that wreak havoc on the lives, health and property of others.  These people must be deterred, and this Bill is to be welcomed as a package of deterring measures which is long overdue.  It is a well known fact that much crime that takes place on our streets is a direct consequence of people being hooked on drugs committing crime, as well as people who are in need of money to feed their drug addiction.</P>
    <P>It is worth commenting on the provisions of this Bill which refer to confiscation orders.  By means of this Bill a court, following a conviction for a drug trafficking offence, can determine whether the convicted person benefited from drug trafficking, and confiscation orders can be issued by the courts.  I welcome this provision because we have seen the total and real success of the Criminal Assets Bureau in confiscating the proceeds of illegally generated drug money.  The setting up of the Criminal Assets Bureau, which was initiated by Fianna Fáil when in Opposition, has proved a total success in giving the Garda Síochána the power to confiscate assets, whether revenue or capital assets, from known drug traffickers.  The provisions in this Bill relating to confiscation orders are complementary to those enacted for the Criminal Assets Bureau and mean that such orders will be issued by the courts <Col N="875" /> if drug traffickers are unable to account for their ill-gotten wealth generated on the backs of those who are tragically addicted to drugs.</P>
    <P>There is the international dimension to drug trafficking and the need for greater co-operation between the member states of the European Union if drug importations into Europe are to be detected and confiscated at source.  We live in a frontier free territory of the European Union with 15 member states, a population of more than 370 million people and an operative Internal Market where free movement of goods, persons, services and capital exists.  Ever since the Internal Market was completed by the European Union there has been the urgent need for enhanced co-operation between all law enforcement agencies in Europe so that all information relating to possible movements in Europe can be disseminated to the appropriate police agencies so that prosecutions can issue.  The recent Amsterdam Treaty which was passed by the people on 22 May last gave enhanced new powers to EUROPOL, the European police agency in the Hague, to oversee the battle against the drug barons at European level.  I strongly welcome these provisions in the treaty and hope that EUROPOL will use its new powers to intensify the co-operation that already exists between the member states of the European Union on the issue of defeating the drug traffickers.</P>

    <P>Drug abuse is widespread in Ireland.  It is causing immense damage to those who are unfortunate enough to be caught in the grip of this deadly habit.  It is ruining their lives and the lives of those who love and look after them.  It is inflicting mortal damage on the fabric of today's society.  How often do we hear of people being attacked and seriously hurt by people who commit crime to feed their drug habit?  How many times have we, as politicians, been invited by constituents, whose lives are being made a misery by dealers who operate in their area, to see the devastation that is caused in those areas.  They make a living hell out of the neighbourhoods where they ply their trade and dispose of their filthy merchandise.  I am sick to the heart of listening to elderly people who cannot live their lives in peace because of the threats and intimidation they suffer from locals who are involved in drugs.  This must be stopped.  The machinery is at hand to bring the battle to the drug barons.  The scourge of drug trafficking must be stamped out through the type of decisive action exemplified by the Bill. There should be total cross-party support for the <Col N="876" /> laudable aims of the Bill which seeks to curb this trade.</P>
    <P>I am deeply disappointed at the attitude of some members of the Opposition to the introduction of this vital legislation.  Some of the comments during the Seanad debate and here were not exactly helpful or constructive.  Deputy Upton's premise is a totally mistaken one.  It would give one the impression that he has not seriously studied the terms of the Bill.  I was surprised to read in the Official Report remarks made by Deputy Higgins, a Deputy for whom I have tremendous respect.  Deputy Higgins questioned the expertise of the Garda Síochána and the customs officials in giving evidence.  He obviously has very little faith in them and little appreciation of the Trojan work they are doing in their battle against the sale of illegal drugs.  He also seems to imply that judges are incapable of assessing the credibility of the evidence of those bodies.  His attitude amazes and disturbs me.  He quibbles about the differing value of drugs in different areas of the country.  I know that those who operate in the law enforcement area will not suffer from the problem of being unable to establish drug values.  There have been major drug hauls in the past.  There were no comments from the Deputy as to the capacity of those who made the seizure to assess the value of the drugs confiscated.  He had to wait until the Minister was seriously addressing the problem to express his doubts.</P>
    <P>The Opposition says this Bill is not an example of the zero tolerance the Minister set as his standard.  I say it is an important milestone on that road.  I ask again why must they always criticise. I would not object to serious critique of the Bill but I object to knocking the Minister for the sake of criticising him.  It would be nice to see some support for this Bill, the contents of which are vital to addressing the drug problem.</P>
    <P>There is too much at stake.  This is much too serious a matter to be used as a forum for word games or Minister bashing.</P>
    <P>The Deputies might have a slightly different slant if they had attended a recent function in Carrignavar College in my constituency.  I was proud to be asked to be present when the college was declared a drug free zone.  This was a positive step by the pupils of that institution to ensure that the evil of illegal drug sales will not hold in their own locality.  They did not seek to find out if the problem was being addressed by others.  They acted on their own initiative with the help and advice of the local gardaí and other schools who had taken similar action.  They rejected ecstasy tablets such as &ldquo;doves&rdquo;, &ldquo;elephants&rdquo; and other branded illegally produced drugs.  I commend them for their action.</P>
    <P>That is the road we should follow in this House. We should listen to the message the Minister is giving and not shoot the messenger.  The Bill adds a new offence to the existing Misuse of Drugs Act.  It relates to the possession of drugs for resale valued at £10,000 or more.  In future, drug related <Col N="877" /> offences will carry mandatory minimum sentences with a limited discretion in certain cases. There will be a mechanism for a second chance for those who have proven they have mended their ways.  This discretion has already been granted in certain circumstances and has been instrumental in helping people to embark on a new life.</P>
    <P>I must highlight the importance of the section of the Bill which lays down that the court has the discretion to recommend the seizure of assets. This was previously the prerogative of the Director of Public Prosecutions who had to bring the application.  There will be unlimited fines which should be channelled to fund the treatment of those unfortunate enough to have a drug problem.  Those moneys should not be used for any other purpose.  The treatment of drug abusers should not be an additional burden on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I wish to see this money used in that manner is that it would damage the drugs trade and the fines imposed on dealers would reduce their ill-gotton profits.  It is proper that we should use this money to put them and their associates out of business.  It would please the PAYE sector to see those who are causing such horrendous damage to our society paying for the rehabilitation of drug users through fines and the seizure of their property.  Let those who cause the problem fund the cure.</P>
    <P>Drug programmes could be organised both in and out of prison.  Funds should also be allocated to the Department of Education and Science to ensure there are ongoing drug awareness courses in schools.  Those programmes must play an important part in combating the drug problem. Prison terms are not the only answer.  The introduction of legislation in the absence of education is a waste of time.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a major step in the fight against the drug barons but it must be fully enforced by the Judiciary, the Garda and the customs service.  I am pleased that when a guilty plea is entered, under the new Bill a maximum sentence can still be applied.  Up to now, any defendant who took this course of action invariably received a reduced sentence.  This will no longer obtain.  There should be no loopholes for perpetual offenders who abuse the law in this manner.</P>
    <P>The Bill also states that persons in custody can be remanded to the nearest court.  They do not have to travel to the original court in which they were sentenced.  This will result in a major saving of Garda time and expense to the State.</P>
    <P>The menace of drugs has touched many families in every community.  I hope the measures we are taking today will help remove this cancer from society.  That is the reason I give my full support to the Bill and to the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill.  Drugs are one of the biggest <Col N="878" /> threats we face as a society.  I was struck by some of the earlier contributions from Deputies like Deputy Gregory who have first-hand experience of the way whole communities can be absolutely devastated by drugs.  I do not want to cover ground already covered by other Members but this is an issue on which we cannot be equivocal.</P>
      <P>I am surprised by some of the carping criticisms levelled at the Minister.  It seems there is a concerted effort to demonise this Minister for the most base political reasons.  That is very foolish and it is a disingenuous, backhanded attitude to the communities which are devastated by drugs.</P>
      <P>The drugs problem is a lively issue in my own constituency.  There are families in Bray, for example, who have been involved in criminal activity for some time and who have moved into the drugs scene in recent years.  They seem to be able to operate with an extraordinary degree of impunity.  It is bizarre that gardaí can arrest people, bring them to court after a lengthy delay during which time they engage in further criminal activity, yet the courts issue the most ludicrous sentences where, within a week or sometimes days of going to jail, these people can again walk around the community.</P>
      <P>Some of these people are unfortunate in that they have become hooked on drugs.  I have some sympathy for the argument that there are varying degrees of venality but the reality is that as a society we cannot begin to equivocate.  We will have to clamp down hard on this particular problem.</P>
      <P>In one portion of my constituency we have had five or six drug related deaths.  These are young people whose lives have been destroyed as well as those of their families.  In the majority of cases these young people have perhaps innocently got into the drugs culture but they become part of the problem when they begin to trade.  Whatever sympathy we may have for the way they entered this business, we cannot cloud the fact that they have helped to destroy, not just themselves, but their own families and communities.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister because he has single-mindedly attached himself to this issue but I am concerned about the manner in which our courts handle it.  I listened to Deputy Gregory earlier and I could give as many examples as he gave of bizarre behaviour by judges where people with long records of criminal activity, some of whom were involved in the most extraordinary crimes, walked out of court with a grin on their face because the judge, for whatever reason, was prepared to be more than sympathetic to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of the competence of some members of the Judiciary will have to be addressed.  The Minister knows my views, for example, on the manner in which judges delay cases.  I highlighted one particular case recently involving a very senior judge who should be dismissed from the Bench.  I have done some research on this matter. Recently in Britain, for example, a High Court judge was asked to &ldquo;take a walk&rdquo; because he delayed a case for 18 months due to his own <Col N="879" /> incompetence.  A delay of 18 months would be regarded by my constituents as intolerable.</P>
    <P>I am aware of cases where constituents have been denied justice for up to eight years, yet I cannot find any way of raising the issue in this House.  I cannot ask a question in this House about the competence of a particular judge or the issue of the destruction of family life because I will be ruled out of order.  The Minister cannot raise it with the courts because the Executive and the Judiciary are separate and I fully appreciate that the Minister's hands are tied in this matter. Even the Attorney General, who is supposed to represent the interests of the citizens and uphold the Constitution, is in a position where his hands are also tied.</P>
    <P>This problem has been highlighted dramatically by injustices visited on families who have been subject to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair need not worry about that.  I will not mention the particular judge I have in mind.  I have already done so and the judge is aware of my views about his behaviour and his fitness for office, as are other members of the Judiciary, but I operate under privilege and I would not abuse it.</P>
      <P>The general issue I want to raise is the competence of some of our judges in the manner in which they handle their office.  They are in a privileged position, and rightly so.  The independence and autonomy of the Judiciary is properly defended because that is the best defence of our civil liberties.  At the same time, however, the judicial establishment cannot be unaware of the bizarre behaviour of one or two of its members. Deputy Gregory rightly pointed out the extraordinary behaviour of judges who seem to have little sympathy for gardaí who are hard-pressed to get evidence.  This is a symptom of a wider problem.  Rather than cause distress to the House, however, I will move away from that aspect of this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue.  It is strong legislation aimed at combating a problem we have all analysed in recent years.  It is a good example of the zero tolerance attitude adopted by the Minister.  We cannot be tolerant of drugs.  There is no such thing as hard and soft drugs.  The point was eloquently made by a previous speaker that most drugs are legal drugs.  If we knew years ago what <Col N="880" /> we know now about cigarettes and nicotine addiction, I doubt that cigarettes would be accepted. That society was blind in the past is not a good excuse for society being blind now.  We should learn from the past.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a person convicted of having drugs to the value of £10,000 or more can face a mandatory sentence of ten years.  Any person who has £10,000 or more worth of drugs in his or her possession is not a hapless individual who has become addicted.  That person is involved at commercial level in dealing in death and it is right and proper that the State should adopt a strong attitude to that case.  While I have difficulty from time to time about minimum sentencing, it is necessary to give the Judiciary a strong indication on how we, the representatives, believe this matter should be dealt with.  I strongly support the idea of minimum sentencing of ten years.  I hope the discretion the court has in the issue will not be used to frustrate the wishes of society.  Unlimited fines should be imposed by the courts.  At the end of the day it is wrong that the perpetrators of the evil of drug dealing should be able to live handsomely, as many of them do, on the misery they have visited on others.</P>
    <P>I welcome confiscation orders which will be served by the courts following a conviction for drug offences.  The film &ldquo;The General&rdquo; portrays the extraordinary lifestyle of one person, that he owned highly valuable property while being a tenant of a council house and signed on while showing all the trappings of wealth.  There is something bizarre about a society where that happens.  In that case I would draw attention again to the extraordinary and horrific injuries visited upon a public servant who helped to combat crime.  Public servants, whether gardaí or servants in any of the other arms of the public service, who suffer because of their selfless devotion to the fight against crime should be handsomely compensated and there is no better way to do so than through the proceeds of confiscated assets of the people whom they seek to bring to justice.</P>
    <P>The severity of the provisions in the Bill is entirely appropriate.  I am not normally regarded as one of the &ldquo;hang 'em and flog 'em&rdquo; brigade. The opposite is the case, I would normally be regarded as a person who would take a very lenient view on civil liberties issues.  The drugs culture has, however, taken a deadly grip on parts of society and I see the results of it daily.  It is a problem that must be addressed and I commend the Minister and the Bill on doing so.  Drug trafficking offences which we are addressing are the biggest single threat to our civil liberties.  The Minister is right in not only giving encouragement to the courts to take a strong view of this matter but providing back-up to the Garda, the forces of law and order, and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
    <P>I was struck by a point made by Deputy Collins, the necessity for us as a society to make up our minds where we stand on this issue.  I mentioned the film &ldquo;The General&rdquo;.  It is astonishing <Col N="881" /> that one of the worst criminals in the history of the State should be eulogised.  I am sure there is a good side to everybody, but I cannot see the good side to a person who behaves in the manner he did.  It is astonishing there is equivocation as to what is meant by a person who is involved in the drugs issue.  For example, should we legalise cannabis?  The point was made that cannabis is used by a significant number of people.  If we pass laws to the effect that drug use is wrong, we should not tolerate equivocation on that issue.  It is either illegal or it is not.  The Minister prudently responded to the entreaties of those who argue we should judge between soft and hard drugs.  If a person has £10,000 worth of cannabis in his possession, he either has a great smoking problem or he is involved in trade.  It is necessary that that drug is treated as a drug.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem over the years has been the revolving door syndrome in our prisons, which are chock-a-block.  I support the Minister in his efforts to bring that extraordinary system to an end.  There is no point in gardaí arresting people or risking life and limb to bring people to justice and there is no point passing laws that force the courts to take realistic views in sentencing unless there is in place a sufficient number of places for criminals.  The Minister has operated in a way that is entirely praiseworthy.  Rather than talk about creating space, about putting new laws on the Statute Book, he has tried to put in place the mechanisms where those laws are supported by way of sufficient places for people who receive custodial sentences and I commend him on that.</P>
    <P>I will go back to a point made by Deputy O'Flynn.  I cannot understand some of the Opposition harking on this Bill.  This is an issue on which we should be united.  There should be cross-party support for this legislation.  In his operations in the past 12 months, the Minister has not taken a partisan view but rather he has indicated he is more than willing to listen and take on board good suggestions.  I hope issues such as this can in future be handled in a manner which crosses all boundaries.  This is a problem we must solve together rather than on a partisan basis.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill.  It will be a pleasure to vote for it.  As a person who serves in a constituency where there has been a drugs problem, I am grateful to the Minister for this timely legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very short time available to me I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House.  While Fine Gael is not entirely happy with it, it supports its general thrust.  Everyone is deeply concerned about the drugs problem which threatens the future prosperity of our youth.  The Minister will have the support of the majority of people in bringing in these measures designed to lock away for a long period of time the people who are wrecking the lives of the young and the not so young.  A concern on this side of the House is the fact that the Bill leaves the door open for lawyers to argue in court about the street value of the drugs and the <Col N="882" /> Minister should rethink that issue.  A notional value is put on the drugs by gardaí and clever lawyers are bound to contest that on behalf of the criminals they represent in such cases.  Nevertheless, I have heard calls for the introduction of a ten year sentence over the past 16 years from all sides of the House.  This should not be a political issue and there should be consensus.  I like to think that we will arrive at a consensus in this House on certain issues and crime comes to mind.</P>
      <P>Gangsters have got away with murder for too long and the zero tolerance policy adopted by the Government is a step in the right direction.  It has faults, nevertheless we must home in on gangsters who supply drugs.  Serious drug barons should be locked up and the key thrown away.  Deterrents are needed in society and it is the absence of them that gives gangsters the opportunity to ply their horrific trade at the expense of our youth at a very impressionable time in their lives.  The introduction of a mandatory sentence is commendable and I wish to see that applied to other wrongdoers in the community.  Obviously, because of the nature of politics we will have to nit-pick on this side of the House, but the Minister is moving in the right direction and I congratulate him for having the courage to bring that in.  I hope his measure will receive support in the House and that it will do something to stem the awful trade in drugs.  I also wish to see him examining other transgressions in society and the possibility of introducing mandatory sentencing, particularly in regard to hit and run and drink driving offences which result in fatalities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for contributing to this extremely important debate and I assure them the views expressed will be fully considered between now and Committee Stage. It is obviously right that undoubtedly strong legislative measures which are introduced to combat our crime problem should be subjected to the closest scrutiny.  Each of these measures must be justified by reference to the threat which it is trying to address and we must ensure what is proposed is proportional and balanced.</P>
      <P>Understandably, there are different views on how best to address these issues, but the Government believes that the measures contained in this Bill are justified.  It may well be regrettable that the Government feels obliged to introduce some of them, but it would be much more regrettable if we failed to take whatever action is reasonably open to us, particularly in terms of tackling organised crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Zero tolerance was mentioned during the debate.  Ultimately, the test of zero tolerance will be at the end of the term of this Government as to whether people feel safer on the streets and in their homes than they did before.  The people will be the judges of that and I am confident they will judge the Government favourably in this respect. To talk of the abandonment of zero tolerance makes no sense in the context of a Bill which contains <Col N="883" /> some of the toughest measures ever introduced in this State against those involved in the drugs trade.  Mandatory sentences will be imposed, trials will be speeded up and the courts will automatically initiate asset inquiries.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that concerns were expressed about the introduction of mandatory sentences.  The traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down the maximum penalty and for a court, having considered all the circumstances of the case, to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  There are, of course, already exceptions to this, particularly in the case of murder where there is a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.  The Government has no plans to depart generally from existing arrangements, but it believes that because of the unique nature of the drugs trade and the widespread harm it causes to the community, mandatory sentences are warranted.  Certain limited exceptions are included in the Bill to avoid injustice, but these exceptions are by no means general as suggested by some ill informed comments.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked about the manner in which the drugs were to be valued in the context of the provision of a mandatory ten year sentence for the possession of drugs with a value of £10,000 or more.  There were suggestions that there is a difference between soft and hard drugs which warrants different treatment.  The only concession I make is that there is no doubt that the availability of heroin and the activity which surrounds this represent the worst aspect of our drugs problem.</P>
    <P>The issue is not new and in bringing forward this legislation I gave a great deal of thought to whether a distinction might be made in terms of various types of drugs, but for reasons which I will explain I came to the firm conclusion that such a distinction would not be warranted or appropriate.  First, the provision of mandatory sentences is primarily geared towards those who trade in illegal drugs as part of an organised criminal enterprise.  We are not talking about, for example, a person who purchases enough cannabis just for herself and a friend and then sells it on to a friend.  We are talking about someone involved in the possession for supply of illegal drugs to the value of £10,000.  We are dealing by definition with someone who plays a substantial part in the supply of illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>Second, the nature of the organised drugs trade with which we are dealing is that many of those involved trade in hard and soft drugs as part of a ruthless criminal conspiracy which wreaks havoc in many communities.  We must bear in mind that the activities of these gangs are not confined to simply supplying drugs.  Their activities have involved murder and intimidation.  In those circumstances it seems only right that a person whose activities are a mainstay of that criminal enterprise should face a mandatory sentence in regard to the possession for supply of £10,000 or <Col N="884" /> more of illegal drugs, irrespective of the type of drug involved.</P>
    <P>Even if these were not valid considerations we would enter a quagmire in trying to make distinctions in the context of this legislation on the basis of the type of drugs at issue.  Not to put too fine a point on it, is it seriously suggested that a person who has £10,000 worth of ecstasy tablets to supply to school children should not face the mandatory sentence provided for in the Bill, simply on the basis that ecstasy might not be regarded as harmful as heroin?  In the light of these considerations it was decided the best approach to take on the question of mandatory penalties was to define the offence by reference to the value of the drugs involved.  I emphasise that no one involved in the supply of drugs to the value of £10,000 or more is anything other than a substantial player in the organised trade in illegal drugs.  Deputy McGahon and others have questioned whether the value concept should be applied.  The answer to criticisms of it is surely that the Director of Public Prosecutions will only bring a case where he is of the view that it can be successful.  He knows better than most he will have to be in a position to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.  In this context, the expert opinion of a garda working in the field, for example, would be required to establish the value of the drugs.</P>
    <P>Essentially what is at issue here is the Oireachtas taking a view that the unique threat posed by drug trafficking is such that special measures in relation to sentencing need to be taken.  Gangs are not concerned primarily with the type of drugs in which they deal.  They are interested in profit.  In those circumstances the approach taken in the Bill is to link the new drug trafficking offence to monetary amounts.  The unfortunate reality is that it is hard to imagine a more corrosive threat to the quality of life in our community than that posed by those who engage in the evil trade of drug trafficking.  Their activities have brought about death and destruction in an incalculable fashion and on an incalculable scale.  Families have been destroyed and communities have been placed under siege.  There is probably no greater fear among parents today rearing children than that their children will fall prey to drug abuse.</P>
    <P>It behoves the Government of the day to face up to that threat.  The Government is committed to tackling drug abuse in a comprehensive way. We will take steps to reduce the demand for drugs through education and community based initiatives.  We will offer services to those who have become addicted to drugs to help them break their habit.  We clearly recognise that a criminal justice system on its own cannot comprehensively tackle the problem of drug abuse.  The criminal justice system has a crucial role to play in curbing the activities of drug traffickers and this Government will ensure that that role is played fully and relentlessly.  As part of this approach we ask the House to support this legislation <Col N="885" /> in providing for minimum sentences in serious drug trafficking cases.  It has been pointed out that preliminary hearings have been part of our law for a considerable period and that we should be careful about making changes to them. What the Bill proposes in this regard takes into account modern realities.  A person cannot be tried on indictment without the consent of an independent director of public prosecutions and it contains the essential safeguard that a person will be entitled to apply to the court of trial to have the charges against him or her dismissed on the basis that the book of evidence would not support a conviction.</P>
    <P>There was &mdash; deservedly &mdash; praise in the debate for the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  This Bill attempts to build on the work by providing further provisions relating to the confiscation of assets.  In particular, there will be automatic asset inquiries where people have been convicted of drug trafficking offences.  There was also a welcome for the abolition of the year and a day rule. This rule has been focused in the context of the BTSB issue.  Other changes may be required in the law in the light of that and this is being examined.</P>
    <P>Deputies are correct in saying this Bill can only be part of the response to drug trafficking.  In this context it might be useful to set out some of the other justice related issues which arise.  Co-operation on the drugs issue, nationally and internationally, is the key to successfully fighting the evil merchants of the drugs trade.  Drug traffickers know no borders.  It is only through effective action at a national level, complemented by wider measures at European and international level, that we can hope to tackle drug trafficking and those who perpetrate such a despicable crime.</P>
    <P>Significant strides have been made to enhance co-operation both nationally and internationally, ensuring a sustained co-ordinated attack on those people who amass vast wealth at the expense of so much human misery.  Recently I attended an important United Nations Conference in this regard.  I take very seriously the duty of the State to protect the citizen's right to live in peace, free from the fear of criminal intrusion.  The most menacing form of criminal intrusion today is, without question of doubt, generated by drug dealers.  The stark reality is clearly highlighted by recent research which shows that drugs are responsible for 66 per cent of all detected crime in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>
    <P>Inevitably matters were raised during the debate in relation to the treatment of drug addicts.  This is a key issue in the overall strategy of coping with the drugs problem.  I will bring the specific points made by Deputies to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children.  We all recognise that a criminal justice response in itself is insufficient but it does have a key role to play and that is the issue on which we have been concentrating today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> One of the principal provisions of the Bill, the provision for a mandatory sentence of ten years, was voted down in this House by the Opposition, the then Government, not once or twice but three times.  We have reached a watershed, we either adopt the right approach now or the problem escalates out of control.  There is no room for hurlers on the ditch.  There is no room for prevarication or equivocation.  The message must go out loud and clear to those who would become involved in the pernicious trade of drug dealing that if you do so and are apprehended, charged and convicted, you will not only lose the illicit assets you have acquired but also your liberty for a very long time.  The message must be sent to these people that the net is tightening, that we will meet them at every turn and at every crossroads and that there can and will in future be no hiding place for them.  We must close off their options.  This legislation represents a milestone in that regard, it complements other recent innovative legislative measures which have been taken and will serve future generations of people extremely well.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete line 12 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) the local consultative committee concerned,</P>
      <P>(e) such local community bodies as the relevant housing authority consider appropriate, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During Committee Stage an undertaking was given to Deputy Hayes to look again at the question of providing in section 8 a specific reference to community groups to ensure their involvement in the process of preparing and adopting accommodation programmes from the early stages.  The debate on subsequent amendments concerning the public consultative process were also of interest and relevant to this issue.  It is now considered that prior notification of such groups is a more appropriate mechanism for ensuring consultation with the local community without prejudice to how such consultation should develop over the preparation and adoption period.  Amendment No. 2 is proposed in lieu of amendment No. 3 from Deputy Hayes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment and thank him and his officials for considering my Committee Stage proposal.  It is good housekeeping for local authority housing departments to inform the widest possible range of people, groups and organisations within their functional areas.  I am glad the Minister took my argument on board and in that light I will not move my amendment in favour of the Minister's, which is more technically correct.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 38, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and, if in his or her opinion the combined provision for travellers made by the accommodation programmes of the several relevant housing authorities in the State falls short of the extent, in the Minister's opinion, of the total national requirement for provision for travellers, shall, to the extent necessary to rectify the shortfall,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage <Col N="888" /> and I hoped the Minister would use the intervening period, even though it was not a long one, to reflect on my arguments.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure an adequate fallback position is available to the Minister in the event that the various programmes fall short of what is required.  On Committee Stage there was much discussion of the Minister's view that it is the local perspective which is important but while that is true, speakers from all parties said that the sum of all the local schemes must add up to a total which is adequate for the national requirement.  It must fall to the Minister to ensure that is so but the problem with the provisions as currently drafted is that there is no requirement on him to take action if it is his opinion that the total national allocation falls short of what is required. My amendment puts such a requirement on the Minister by providing that he &ldquo;shall&rdquo; act &ldquo;to the extent necessary to rectify the shortfall&rdquo;.  I made the case at length on Committee Stage and do not propose to repeat the arguments.  We have a different Minister of State today &mdash; I do not suggest Deputy Wallace is less attentive but he was not present for my Committee Stage arguments, although no doubt his officials will have relayed my case to him.  I hope he finds my amendment acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Howlin's amendment.  It is vital that there be national co-ordination to ensure the sum of all local authority schemes is sufficient to deal with the problem, so that we no longer have the previous problem whereby the weight of responsibility falls on willing local authorities while others escape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced this amendment contributes anything to the powers of intervention already available to the Minister under section 18, which enables him, following consultation with a relevant housing authority or authorities concerned, to require that accommodation programmes be prepared, amended, replaced, prepared jointly or co-ordinated by two or more housing authorities in a specified way and by a specified date.  It would be expected that any requirement to amend a programme on the basis of inadequate provision could only be based on the local assessment of needs.  The proposed amendment presumes the Minister has available separate information on the total national requirement for traveller accommodation but no such information is available to the Minister, other than what emerges from the local assessment of needs.  Introducing a national dimension to accommodation is, therefore, artificial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local assessment of needs, including the next statutory assessment due to be carried out in March 1999, will be the basis on which the local traveller accommodation programme will be drafted.  Local authorities are obliged to have regard to the needs identified in the assessment in preparing their programmes; any shortfall in the provision of accommodation can only be <Col N="889" /> identified on a local basis by comparing the assessment of needs with the proposals for meeting these needs as set out in each programme. Having regard to the general thrust of local government reform and the principle of subsidiarity, it is considered that the powers conferred on the Minister in section 18 are sufficient in the circumstances.  I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Alas, my fears are justified and we have not progressed since our Committee Stage discussion &mdash; the Minister is different but the script is the same.  One sometimes wonders whether Committee and Report Stages are of any value if arguments trenchantly made are not responded to.  Not only do I subscribe to subsidiarity, as Minister, I initiated it in the reform programme.  This is national co-ordination which we discussed at some length, both in the context of my amendment which we are now revisiting and the amendments of Deputy Mitchell.</P>
      <P>When Deputies of all persuasions argue for the need for co-ordination, it is not good enough for the Minister to say that under the principle of subsidiarity, every local authority must act in accordance with their own perceived need.  There is no one to ensure that the individual components add up to meet the national need.  That is the job of the Minister and he cannot abrogate that, retreat from it or pretend it is not his.</P>
      <P>We cannot say that when this measure is enacted we have done our duty and local authorities may do as they wish &mdash; that has been the problem all along.  Good local authorities have been prevented from acting because there is always a reason for some not to act.  Under section 18 the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; act.  That is not good enough.  My amendment proposes that he &ldquo;shall&rdquo; act if he becomes aware that the national provision is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not responded to the case I made on Committee Stage.  There is a national responsibility of co-ordination which resides in the Minister and his Department.  He cannot wash his hands of that responsibility by saying that under the principle of subsidiarity every local authority must be allowed to do its own thing.  We know from reality and hard experience that some have not done the right thing and have not lived <Col N="890" /> up to their responsibilities.  Unless there is a legal obligation on the Minister to ensure it is done &mdash; that he &ldquo;shall&rdquo; act rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; act &mdash; we cannot be confident that the important work of this Bill will be implemented as we require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We were given a commitment by the Government throughout discussion of this legislation that, where possible, provisions would be tightened so that the law could operate.  This amendment will copperfasten the objectives of this Bill rather than detract from them.  Deputies Howlin and Mitchell said that local authority members in areas where the traveller programme is working are frustrated that a minority of local authorities have done nothing.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is serious about implementing this legislation, he must accept that we will do everything in our power on Committee Stage and Report Stage to ensure the measures are tightened and effective.  This amendment and the proposals put forward on Committee Stage are intended to improve this legislation.  I ask the Minister to rethink his response to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a long discussion of this matter on Committee Stage.  There are adequate powers for the intervention of the Minister under section 18 of the Bill.  It is important to give the Minister the discretion to use such powers where necessary.  Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to press the amendment. I have argued my case as best I can.  It is clear my argument is falling on deaf ears because the Minister did say why he cannot accept my amendment.  Under section 18, the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; act when inadequate provision is recognised.  My amendment proposes that he &ldquo;shall&rdquo; act.  The notion that discretion should be left to the Minister allows the recalcitrants to be recalcitrant if that is their choice and is unacceptable.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment rather than divide the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) advise on matters which relate to increasing understanding and mutual respect between the settled and Traveller communities.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This series of amendments relates to the functions and composition of the local traveller committee.  We had a good exchange of views about this on Committee Stage.  This amendment seeks to include another function in these local committees, which is to &ldquo;advise on matters which relate to increasing understanding and mutual respect between the settled and Traveller communities&rdquo;. This matter is an important one.</P>
      <P>I am aware that over the past two years or so a variety of local authorities have established <i>ad hoc</i> traveller committees.  These committees have not worked well in every local authority area but in some areas they have.  The Bill is fundamentally flawed by the exclusion of residents and community organisations from local travellers' committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="894" /> Molloy said: &ldquo;Having regard to the role of the committees in improving the participation of travellers in the planning, design and management of their accommodation, and in order to foster improved understanding between local authorities and the local travelling community.&rdquo; That is wrong.  Of course, it should be to foster mutual respect and understanding between the local authorities and the travellers, but also between the local communities because that is where the build-up of prejudice is.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I pointed out the pioneering work of Fr. Micheál MacGréil on the issue of prejudice.  It shows the gaps that exist in the relationship between the traveller and the settled person in the community That is the work we have to do.  It is not just a question of involving local authority planners, people in community departments and members of local authorities; it is ensuring that the residents and the community are brought head to head and face to face with travellers.  If they do not choose to sit on these committees that is their problem but it is bad law to put in place a provision which specifically excludes them from the process.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities have set up these <i>ad hoc</i> committees and we have had some success with them.  Unfortunately, in my area the travellers' bodies refused to be part of those committees because they did not want to sit with residents. It is wrong of the State, therefore, to introduce legislation &mdash; particularly in sections 21 and 22 &mdash; which specifically excludes one group or another. That is the key issue at the heart of these local committees.  They are consultative committees and the ultimate power resides with the members. We are not talking about giving the committees any massive increase in their powers but we want a cross section of people there.</P>
    <P>If we have these committees in place, we can, over time, do something about the build up of prejudice between the traveller and the settled person.</P>
    <P>My amendments will improve the legislation and ensure that both groups have to meet on equal terms in the local authority area.  It is wrong to increase prejudice and misunderstanding by excluding residents and communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>An important point is involved in terms of the role and functions of the local consultative committee.  It is a difficult question because, by definition, there are wide disparities between the disposition of one residents' association and another, as there is between one part of Dublin and another or one part of the country and another.</P>
      <P>When I reflect on the constituency that Deputy Hayes and I represent, I have to smile when I read of some of the high profile initiatives in some parts of the country in respect of the accommodation of travelling people.  On any given day, we have more travellers in a corner of one field than some local authorities in other parts of Dublin, and especially outside Dublin, have in total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> The situation has been made immensely more difficult by the failure over the years to implement any fair network of halting sites and other provision for the accommodation of travellers.  The result is that west Dublin &mdash; where the problem is exacerbated at this time of year &mdash; has a grossly disproportionate problem to contend with.  I refer to it as a problem in the sense that providing accommodation for the number of families resident in west Dublin is a major one for any local authority.  I am not just talking about the difficulties of local residents, but about the cost of providing decent accommodation for travellers in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendment concerning the composition of local committees, subsection (3) of the Bill sets out the role of the local consultative committee and what it may advise.  If local people are not involved in the process it is a serious mistake in terms of trying to address the urgent necessity to provide decent accommodation for travelling people.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency, at Brookfield, there is a halting site properly established and maintained by the local authority.  It was originally constructed for ten families and it works exceptionally well.  In fact, at various times over the few years of the existence of what is a new community, the families had a representative on the residents' association.  The deputy county manager of the day gave a commitment that if the people of that area expressed their generosity in terms of facilitating such a site, no additional site or illegal encampment would be tolerated.  The county manager is now seeking to establish a second halting site within less than 1,000 metres of the one established a number of years ago. That situation is unconscionable.  It is not fair to impose a disproportionate share of this problem on any community.  It is not fair that one part of Dublin has to contend with a disproportionate share of the social problems from another part of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that this issue will not be addressed by a separate agency as recommended in the report or in the same way as the National Roads Authority was set up and empowered to make the necessary decisions on the planning of roads.  The backsliding by councillors and local administrations is likely to continue.  We are left in this situation today because such backsliding went on for years.  As a result, when a local authority, like South Dublin County Council, shows a progressive track record in providing for the legitimate needs of travelling people, it is expected to continue providing such accommodation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the resident halting site, which is properly managed, a large number of travelling families are housed in the adjacent area.  Not only are relations as good as I have said, they are represented on the residents' association.  However, the county manager wants to build a second halting site within 1,000 metres of the one already established.  That is not acceptable.  I do not know <Col N="896" /> what the Minister can do to ensure a geographic spread in terms of providing for travelling people, but it is a major issue in parts of this city &mdash; I cannot speak for other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There is merit in the amendment tabled by Deputy Hayes.  Apart from addressing the question of functions and the composition of local committees, it will force local people to learn about and become involved in this problem.  If they know they are likely to confront this issue, then it is better for them to do so.  For that reason, I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte it is wrong that any one community should have to disproportionately deal with the burden, if that is the appropriate word, of resolving this long standing issue.  In Bray in my constituency there is a proud record and tradition of settling travelling families within the community and it has worked well.  I commend in particular the local working class estates which have accepted that burden.</P>
      <P>The people who prognosticate and preach about this problem live in middle class enclaves well away from it.  <i>The Irish Times</i> mentality is that everybody should solve every social problem but not in my neighbourhood.  I had an extraordinary case of this mentality in my constituency where a journalist gutted the people of Rahoon and Galway for their &ldquo;rahoonery&rdquo; and the people of Bray for their unchristian attitude until it was suggested that a travellers halt would be built within half a mile of that journalist's eyrie.  The change of attitude was extraordinary.  There were personal approaches not just to me but to the Minister of the day to put pressure on the local authority to find a more suitable place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am addressing the issue. How do we deal with this issue and involve local communities?  I agree that local communities should be involved.  However, I disagree with the two previous speakers on one issue.  Deputy Rabbitte used the words, &ldquo;force local people&rdquo;, and Deputy Hayes used similar words.  The problem is on two sides of the divide.  Unfortunately, there are people in the travelling community who have adopted a militant attitude and they are not helping the situation.</P>
      <P>Travellers have been settled in one estate in Bray for many years without any problems and the local community has welcomed them. However, we almost had a riot in one community in Bray two nights ago because a household was attacked.  The house was entered by a group of people and a woman was stripped and had her jewellery removed.  It was the most extraordinary racism I have ever witnessed.  The woman was from the settled community and that issue must also be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that we need to be more tolerant of diversity but we must also begin to address the <Col N="897" /> problem of residents in settled estates who are disproportionately bearing the costs and consequences.  Deputy Rabbitte is right in saying that everyone wants to prescribe remedies but nobody wants to bear the burden.  It would be sensible to involve local communities but not from the point of view of forcing them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes mentioned the MacGréil study with which I am familiar.  However, I fault it because it comes from a particular viewpoint.  I had correspondence recently with a nun in my constituency who chastised me for being critical of a particular traveller group.</P>
    <P>Travellers enjoy the same rights as every member of our society and we have a responsibility to vindicate their rights.  However, they also have responsibilities.  Sadly, too many people who argue their case are prepared to ignore the fact that when they have rights they have responsibilities.  The responsibilities of citizenship are to be tolerant of all situations.  The only way to be tolerant of all citizens' viewpoints is to sit around a table.  There are troublesome families in the traveller and settled communities and the law should apply equally to them.  We should not force local communities to face these responsibilities.  Most working class estates I know have dealt with this issue more charitably and with a more Christian attitude than most of the people who preach about it.  There is merit in involving local communities.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Hayes was making his contribution, I was speaking to the assistant county manager of Wicklow County Council.  I suggested setting up a monitoring committee in Kilbride Grove in Bray where these difficulties have occurred in the past 48 hours.  I wish both sides could be brought together.  If a troublesome family in an estate must be ejected, it does not matter to me if it is from a traveller or a settled community.  If it behaves obnoxiously, it should be ejected, irrespective of the label attached to it.  We will only achieve understanding if the community is involved.  Much prejudice is based on fear and the only way to deal with fear is by providing information and knowledge and by being openhanded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte mentioned public officials who give undertakings and then break them.  I agree that is unacceptable.  That is why there is so much reaction in communities because they regard even the building of a small halt as a wedge.  If an undertaking is given by a public official on the issue, it must be maintained and honoured.  There is great wisdom in such a contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>These three amendments deal with the composition and role of the local traveller accommodation consultative committee.  The effect of amendment No. 7 would be to broaden the scope of the local consultative committee.  To give full effect to the intention of the amendment, it would be necessary to include community groups on the committee.  During the debate on <Col N="898" /> Committee Stage an undertaken was given to reconsider the question of community representation on the local consultative committees. Further consideration has been given to the question since then, including the feasibility of giving effect to any significant change in the current representation.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect which continues to be most difficult to overcome, an acceptable method of selecting representatives of community groups.  In considering the composition of the local committees, it is necessary to remember that their primary purpose is to facilitate consultation between local authorities and travellers to promote and increase awareness of travellers' needs and a better understanding and working relationship between them.  The proposed representation has been finely balanced to ensure that no group will be effectively excluded from or dominated in any of the deliberations of the committee.</P>
      <P>Any adjustments to the existing ratio would have to take this balance into account.  There is a real danger that the introduction of a large local community representation would adversely affect the ethos and working commitment of the committee.  If a community group were to be appointed, it is considered that its representation should come from within the places reserved for members of the authority and this should not exceed two.</P>
      <P>The question arises as to how to select two community representatives which could reflect the range of interests involved and the number of areas concerned.  The possibility of unrepresentative members being appointed was referred to on Committee Stage.  For that reason it is proposed to allow the present composition of local committees to stand and rely on the elected members who are already elected on an area basis to represent all the local community interests concerned.</P>
      <P>It is also considered that the provision for inclusion of community groups through the prior notice of the preparation of a programme under section 8, which was passed earlier, is a more appropriate means for involving the public.  The prior notification of such groups, the making available of draft programmes for public inspection, the opportunity for making submissions on the contents of a programme to the housing authority and bringing sites for caravans within the normal public notice procedures under the planning system all combine to make a comprehensive public consultative package, which Deputies must agree is a substantial improvement on the existing situation.  Housing authorities will be encouraged to develop other consultation measures appropriate to local circumstances in advice and guidelines and on implementation of the Bill which will be issued following its enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Rabbitte's point, local people will be involved in the process from an early stage as a result of amendment No. 2 which has been agreed.  There is also a statutory requirement <Col N="899" /> to make a draft accommodation programme available for public inspection and on which the public may make submissions.  As a result of recent amendments to the planning regulations, individual proposals for accommodation, including halting sites, will be subject to public notice procedures which apply to all local authority developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to this amendment in two minutes.  Amendment 2 deals with sending out the plan to residents' groups.  It does not deal with direct consultation and it was unfair of the Minister of State to make that comment in response to the point raised by Deputy Rabbitte. It is a try-on for the Minister of State to suggest that local authority members can stand down in favour of residents and communities.  We do not accept that.  That is a diminution of the status of a <Col N="900" /> local authority member.  Local authority members represent all the community, not only the settled community and, by implication, it would be unwise to go down that road.</P>
      <P>The other argument put forward was that a local authority cannot agree to a composition of local residents.  We agreed in South Dublin to have three representatives of local residents.  Such a decision can be agreed.  A national organisation such as ACRA or another national residents' association could be used, particularly in a climate when legislation will be introduced in the next 12 months to give effect to SPCs, which have a large community component.  A decision on this can be made if there is a will to do so.  We do not accept the arguments put forward by the Minister of State and I will press my amendments.  I welcomed the intervention of Deputy Roche and I look forward to seeing him shortly.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>whether the Government has considered the report of the Review Group on the Law Offices of the State; the recommendations, if any, the Government has approved, in particular the introduction of a unified prosecution service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14949/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to my reply to Question No. 1 of 24 February 1998 indicating that the Government had accepted the recommendations of the Review Group on the Law Offices of the State and in particular to establish a high level study of proposals for a unified prosecution service; a separate statute law revision and consolidation unit and a consultative committee among the law offices.</P>
      <P>The review group recommended that the matter of a unified prosecution service should be examined in much greater detail than its own expertise and resources would have allowed.  It is expected that the study will begin in September. The study group will be chaired by Mr. Dermot Nally, former secretary to the Government.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the statute law revision and consolidation unit are being discussed by the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I understand nearly all nominations have been received to the consultative committee of the law offices.  The Attorney General's Office which has the duty of chairing it proposes to hold the first meeting before the end of July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach clearly indicated the Government is not satisfied with the current level of prosecution services.  Has he requested the Attorney General to contact the Director of Public Prosecutions to ascertain why, after a period of more than ten months, he has not initiated any action following the referral to him of the report of the McCracken Tribunal?  I refer to the frequent references by the journalist Gene Kerrigan in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>  Has the Taoiseach seen the articles?  Has anybody in his office monitored them or asked the Director of Public Prosecutions through the Attorney General, as the Taoiseach is empowered to do under the relevant section, section 2(6), of the 1974 Prosecution of Offences Act, why no action has been taken?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, a review has been carried out and the Taoiseach referred to changing <Col N="903" /> prosecution systems.  There is a matter of major public concern in respect of which the report of a tribunal was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Better and more efficient systems of prosecution are likely to be introduced.  Has the Taoiseach exercised his powers under section 2(6) of the 1974 Prosecution of Offences Act to request the Attorney General to discuss the matter with the Director of Public Prosecutions while respecting the independence of his office?  I request that the Taoiseach be allowed to reply.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been ruled out of order.  I took legal advice on the matter.  It can only be asked in this manner.  There are numerous precedents where specific queries were raised on foot of a general question relating to the reform and improvement of prosecution procedures.  I urge you to allow the Taoiseach to answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not indicate particular matters that I raise with the Attorney General on a day to day basis.  I have seen the articles in question.  The Review Group on the Law Offices of the State was of the view that the matter of a unified prosecution service should be looked at in more detail.  While the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is accountable to the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is not.  The matter was argued at some length.  The review group came to the conclusion that a far more intensive examination of the issues involved was required with the various interests involved being given an opportunity to state their case.  I do not want to pre-empt the outcome.  That is where the issue rests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated he is aware of the articles in the newspapers.  Has he requested the Attorney General to raise the matter with the Director of Public Prosecutions as he is empowered to do under section 2(6) of the 1974 Act and, if not, why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach bring this exchange to the attention of the Attorney General so that he can decide whether it would be worth his while responding to the concern expressed repeatedly in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> by the journalist Gene Kerrigan?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the issues the review group believed it was not sufficiently expert to examine in regard to a unified prosecution service and which should be examined by a further body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is some time since I read the report but there are a number of issues, including whether a unified prosecution service is the best option.  This was the subject of considerable debate.  Recent reports in other jurisdictions suggest it is an issue which requires the fullest and most detailed consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that one of the great strengths of the Irish prosecutorial system as against that in the United States is that it is genuinely independent of the passing political pressures of the day unlike the American system which is very much affected by electoral considerations in prosecutors' offices and so forth?  Does he also agree we should preserve one of the unique strengths enjoyed by our judicial, prosecutorial and legal systems, namely, the independence &mdash; frustrating though it may be at times &mdash; of the DPP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton was involved with the Attorney General in commissioning the report in the first instance and he will be aware these issues were considered when the Director of Public Prosecutions and other interested parties put forward their perspectives on the matter. The issues in question did not come within the direct remit of the review group but it felt they were worthy of examination.  I recall from reading the report that there did not seem to be a tremendous appetite for changing the system in so far as it was examined by the review group.  However, because the DPP wished to have these matters examined in further detail the group obviously decided to examine them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The case of someone caught shoplifting in Dunnes Stores would not be heard in the Office of the DPP for ten months.  We should adopt a new perspective on this matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Assembly elections represent an important milestone in the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement and were an expression of the democratic will of the people in Northern Ireland.  The Assembly will allow politicians in Northern Ireland to take control of many aspects of their own affairs and give them an opportunity to work together in a democratic way for the betterment of all.  There can be no doubt that the majority of the people in Northern Ireland want the British-Irish Agreement, including the Assembly, to work.  It can and will work effectively.</P>
      <P>I had very positive meetings with the SDLP and Sinn Féin this week and I have also been in contact with the other parties to the British-Irish Agreement.  I have not been in contact with President Clinton since the Assembly elections because he is currently visiting China.  However, I have spoken with the US Ambassador who has been in contact with the President's officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister Mr. Blair while in Frankfurt for the launch of the European Central Bank yesterday, and we have also spoken on the telephone.  We took the opportunity to discuss recent developments and the results of the Assembly elections.  We expressed the hope that we could get through the marching season without further violence and agreed that dialogue was still the only way to achieve an outcome acceptable to everyone <Col N="906" /> involved.  We shared the view that at this critical stage in the development of political stability in Northern Ireland, everyone has a responsibility to ensure that the progress that has been made over the past 12 months is not eroded and that the momentum for real change and genuine reconciliation is maintained.  We looked forward to working together with the newly elected Assembly representatives in moving further forward with the Agreement's implementation in the coming weeks and months.</P>
    <P>At the twice yearly meetings of the Joint North-South Council in plenary format, I will be accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and by one or more Ministers depending on the agreed agenda for the session in question.  A subgroup of the steering group which has been set up to oversee implementation of all aspects of the agreement is focusing specifically on the North-South elements it contains.  This group is comprised of officials from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Finance, the Attorney General's office and my Department.  A round of discussions with Departments as a basis for developing further the Government's position regarding the implementation of the strand two arrangements has been completed.  The Government's earlier position in the multi-party negotiations was based on a large amount of interdepartmental work and consultation.  The results of the further recent round of consultations will now be considered by the steering group and at political level.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  When he met Sinn Féin representatives, did the Taoiseach impress on them the need for that party to use its influence to encourage those of its members and supporters who oppose parades to take a step back and engage only in silent and peaceful protests?  Does the Taoiseach agree, following his meeting with representatives of the SDLP, with the view expressed by Séamus Mallon that people, particularly Nationalists from other parts of Ireland, should stay away from Portadown in an effort to de-escalate tensions there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I met a Sinn Féin delegation last night and an SDLP delegation the night before.  I raised the points made by Deputy De Rossa and the Sinn Féin delegation agreed that the law must be adhered to in respect of marches, that decisions which have been made must be upheld and that people should not congregate at marches or gatherings near the Garvaghy Road, Lurgan, the Springfield Road and other places.  I made the point that Sinn Féin and others should do everything in their power to ensure that people do not gather to protest about these marches or answer calls to travel to Portadown. That would be entirely unhelpful, particularly if the marches planned for the weekend proceed.  I hope the law will be upheld and I believe people should not try to make the situation worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> The parades commission has made its determination and, provided nothing else happens &mdash; I hope it does not &mdash; that determination should be upheld.  People should accept the commission's decision and they should not try to make the RUC's job more difficult by congregating in the area in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's opinion, why, following the successful conclusion of the British-Irish Agreement and the holding of the Assembly elections, has the IRA not stated that the war is over and that its arsenal of weapons can now be considered redundant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot provide an answer because I have no contact with the IRA.  In terms of meetings with Sinn Féin and other groups, I hope I have emphasised to them that the war is over.  With regard to Provisional IRA activity, advice from the security forces indicates that things are calm and quiet.  I welcome that but I would also welcome any positive statements that organisation may have to offer.  Pádraig Wilson's recent statement was of some benefit because he is a senior representative of the organisation.  In the context of the full implementation of the agreement on all fronts, signals from paramilitary groups placing beyond doubt their commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic methods would be a positive development.  I take this opportunity to urge them to make statements to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach for his opinion on why the IRA will not state that the war is over.  Will he do so now?  What in the Taoiseach's view is the connection between Sinn Féin and the IRA?  I understand he met representatives of Sinn Féin last night.  Did they provide an indication why the IRA has adhered to the position it adopted last April that there will be no decommissioning of arms?  To date, no one has been nominated on behalf of the IRA or Sinn Féin to liaise with the decommissioning commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the decommissioning commission, the regulations have been signed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the British Minister of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Adam Ingram, and the clock has already started ticking on the two year period laid down in the Agreement in respect of decommissioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to my opinion on the IRA's position, I do not like to make assessments of people I do not know or with whom I have never had any involvement.  However, I have continually urged Sinn Féin to recognise that we are involved in trying to move forward with the Agreement.  I spend hours every day trying to ensure full implementation of the Agreement on all fronts and trying to convince everybody to be positive.  The <Col N="908" /> British Government and the other parties, including Sinn Féin, are being positive about moving the Agreement forward.</P>
    <P>Signals from the paramilitary groups which would put their commitment to exclusively peaceful methods beyond doubt would be a positive development.  I can only assume these groups watch what is happening.  I have met people from south Armagh and other areas in the North recently, who have nothing to do with the IRA and they have told me they see no diminution in road blocks or army and RUC checkpoints, the continued construction of army bases and towers and as many patrols as ever.  Perhaps that influences the paramilitary groups and they do not see demilitarisation progressing.  My response is that the people voted for the Agreement and the paramilitaries should not wait to see such demilitarisation.  However, that may be in their minds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I recollect the Taoiseach saying that he regarded Sinn Féin and the IRA as two sides of the same coin and I share his view.  In the context of the frequent discussions he has had with Sinn Féin, has he raised with it the desirability of a significant confidence building measure?  As Mr. Séamus Mallon has said, the power lies with Sinn Féin and the IRA to send a signal.  In his most recent talks with the Sinn Féin leaders has the Taoiseach raised the issue of a communication, in the form of words they choose, to indicate that the war is over?  The fears of many in the Unionist community could be assuaged by such an utterance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody would be happier than I if there was a statement from the IRA to say that the war was over and if it was prepared to follow General De Chastelain's recommendations on decommissioning.  In terms of progress there is no evident militant activity from the IRA. Sinn Féin's information is in line with what I receive on the security situation, that is, that the cease-fire is holding.  It is suggested that there is targeting but there appears to be far less targeting and fewer punishment beatings, although even one such beating is one too many.</P>
      <P>I get the sense that the Sinn Féin leadership is trying very hard, even harder than at the time of my earlier meetings with them, to keep control. Elected members of Sinn Féin spent several hours on the streets of Lurgan and west Belfast trying to prevent people from throwing stones and engaging in other such activities.  They also made efforts on the Garvaghy Road issue some weeks ago.  It is encouraging that the elected members are facing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach raised the issue of a declaration that the war is over with the Sinn Féin leadership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise it continually.  Those involved with issuing such a signal may be watching to see how matters develop.  The Sinn Féin <Col N="909" /> people I have met seem determined to do all they can to ensure there are no problems.  I have been through these issues with them many times over the past months and they are doing what they can to ensure these issues are addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Sinn Féin needs the UUP, Mr. Trimble in particular, in order to make the Assembly work and for its members to become part of the executive.  The decommissioning issue will be a longer term project but it is important that Sinn Féin recognises that a declaration to the effect that the war is over would assist Mr. Trimble greatly to move his party forward on the development of the executive and the Assembly. We are seeking to bed down politics at the centre of life in Northern Ireland and there must be constant pressure on Sinn Féin in particular to secure the required declaration.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulty Sinn Féin faces.  It has spent 30 years creating a situation of victimhood and antagonism in Northern Ireland and it must now attempt to put that back in its bottle, so to speak.  I appreciate that it is trying to do so and the difficulties that entails.  However, bearing in mind that the current arrangements are an unprecedented approach to solving the problems in Northern Ireland, all sides must have regard to the needs of the other sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about that. Sinn Féin needs the UUP and the UUP needs Sinn Féin.  All parties must work together.  I have talked to many interested parties in recent days and I detect that more confidence and trust is building up.  There is even more confidence now than there was three months ago.  Although the parties have not met formally, the signals are better than they have been in the past, notwithstanding that they have been through elections.  Any positive sign from any side helps build confidence.  I hope that will happen through the marching season.</P>
      <P>We hear much about the parades where there is no formal local contact.  However, we should give credit to the other thousands of parades which take place.  We will always hear about the Garvaghy Road parade but the better part of the 40 parades in Portadown this year have taken place and they went off well.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope there will be more co-operation.  People are determined to find a resolution to these problems and to work together.</P>
      <P>Deputies have been constructive on these issues.  Everybody must give a little.  Solutions will be based on dialogue, accommodation, mutual trust and respect and with such an approach everything is possible.  The tension between the sides is not as bad as it seems sometimes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has said that Sinn Féin and the IRA are two sides of the same coin. How realistic is it to expect Unionists to vote Sinn Féin members on to an executive which will rule over Northern Ireland if the IRA has not yet said that its war is over and it retains its arsenal of offensive weapons?</P>
      <P>What is the Taoiseach's opinion on the realism of that proposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am engaged with all sides in trying to implement the British-Irish Agreement and build trust and confidence with the Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, so that people can be satisfied that they can implement that Agreement.  It would be easier if everyone would do all the things we would like.  I cannot force the Provisional IRA to do what we want.  I cannot force the Orange Order, who want to walk through a 99 per cent nationalist area, not to do so.  I cannot force the loyalist paramilitaries to do anything.  All we can do is try, on the basis of mutual trust, dialogue and accommodation, to bring people to a position where we can move everything on.  We are managing to do that successfully.  Unionists and loyalists are not quite forcing this in the same way as the Deputy Bruton's tone suggests he is doing.  They know it is difficult for people.  Logic does not always prevail. If it did we could move on very quickly.  In a normal society where people take a normal point of view the problems of this weekend could be fixed in half an hour.  However, that is not the way things are.  The situation is complex.  Trying to get a resolution is a painstakingly slow process, but it is worth doing if it prevents people from being killed or injured.  I appreciate that the Deputy has done this in the past, and that is what we have to do now.  It is not always logical.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that it is very important that this matter be pushed and that there is a bottom line for democrats?  Will he agree also that it would solve the problem if the IRA were to say, as the IRA, what their commander in the Maze said in an interview with the <i>Financial Times</i>, namely, that if the institutions begin to function normally decommissioning will take place?  Would it not be helpful if Sinn Féin, who on other matters are clearly able to gain some attention because of their links with the IRA, were to formally and publicly ask the IRA to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the purpose of the Taoiseach's meeting with Sinn Féin last evening other than to talk to them about, among other <Col N="911" /> things, what they might say to the IRA at this stage?  Is it not the case that every time there is an advance the republican movement moves the goalposts?  First they say there might be progress if there were talks.  There were talks.  Then they say that if they are allowed onto the Executive there will be progress.  Always the posts are moved further away.  Concessions are being made by others and they seem reluctant to make this decisive move and say that the war is over.  Why can they not do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed many things last night which I will go through.  Among them was the likelihood of moving on in relation to decommissioning and the war being over.  I asked Mr. Gerry Adams whether he would participate in trying to make progress in relation to the marches.  Unfortunately, although he is prepared to go anywhere in Northern Ireland to meet the Orange Order or any other elected representatives, the Orange Order will not engage in any discussion whatsoever with residents' groups, Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party or any other nominees on this matter.  Any attempt to put the blame on one side would lead to an unbalanced debate.</P>
      <P>Last night I tried to get Sinn Féin to see that the nominations are not lopsided, even though they feel they are, that the criminal justice system review is useful, even though Sinn Féin had no input into it, and that they should have confidence in the five or six other views on the Agreement in respect of which they had no input.  There is a long agenda.  I do not like to comment on anything the IRA say, but what Mr. Wilson said as one of their senior officers was helpful, and it was done internationally in order to be seen in the international arena.  In terms of moving the IRA any further than having totally stopped militant activities, it seems that until we see some action on other fronts it is unlikely there will be another statement from them.  I will continue to push for it and to raise it whenever I can.  That is just one of the many things I discussed with Sinn Féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My question refers to Question No. 9 on the North-South Ministerial Council which will not come into operation if we do not get the kind of initiative from Sinn Féin to which the Opposition leaders have been referring and with which the Taoiseach has agreed.  In his reply the Taoiseach said he would be accompanied by the appropriate Minister.  However, the Agreement specifies that on the Northern side the first Minister, the Deputy first Minister and whoever else is necessary would be part of a ministerial North-South council.  It would be normal to have two permanent Ministers from the South plus the Minister for Agriculture and Food or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  Do I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that it will be just the Taoiseach and a line Minister relative to the agenda under discussion, or will the Tánaiste <Col N="912" /> be there <i>ex officio</i> or the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  The Taoiseach's reply was not clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's first comment, I do not want to mislead the House, but I would not be too pessimistic about progress on these matters.  Loyalists, Unionists, Nationalists and republicans are more pragmatic than we give them credit for.  I believe they are looking at how progress can be made.  I hope that is the case.  The more people can do to make that easier the better.  We have to continue to work on that.  It is envisaged that I and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be the two permanent Ministers.  It is possible that there could be four or five people involved on the Northern side because of the make up of that side.  If that is the case we will certainly have a consistent team.  One of the people involved would be from among our partners in Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy Liz O'Donnell attends all meetings and delegations, so either she or the Tánaiste will be part of the Ministerial Council.  Because of the composition on the Northern side there will be bigger rather than smaller groups.</P>

      <P>On the question of the war being over, will the Taoiseach agree with Deputy Bruton that there is a bottom line for democrats?</P>
      <P>Will he agree there is a need to acknowledge that Sinn Féin faces difficulties with the splintering of various forces and that it may not have the same control it had in the past in certain areas?  Will he agree also that there is a necessity to continue to pressure Sinn Féin to recognise that trust can only be built by itself in Northern Ireland, that there is little we can do here in relation to that and it is up to them to take the steps to persuade the IRA &mdash; to put it at its most benign &mdash; to make a gesture which would build the confidence of the Unionist community which has been at the receiving end of most of the IRA violence of the past 30 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  However, it would have been easy for Sinn Féin to go one way politically and leave others behind but that would not have been much good to them or to others.  In regard to these groups &mdash; and we have heard different figures as regards their size from various security elements both here and in other jurisdictions &mdash; I understand that since the late 1980s Sinn Féin has been trying to move those people towards the political system.  Some of those may have drifted into the Continuity IRA, the 32 county sovereignty committee and so on but the best that can happen is that these people will be encouraged to move away from these organisations and into democratic politics.  I understand that is what Sinn Féin is trying to do and at this stage it seems to be successful.</P>

      <P>I agree that Sinn Féin can only go a certain distance.  I am simply saying that as democrats we have to maintain the pressure. Like the Taoiseach, I do not necessarily regard this weekend as the doom laden situation being presented in some quarters and that the position in Northern Ireland has been transformed beyond recognition.  I disagree, however, in relation to Sinn Féin's activities in recent years. Sinn Féin has moved its supporters away from the notion of military activity, which is welcome, but towards street activity by deliberately fomenting opposition to marches.  They are now recognising that that is counterproductive and are seeking to end it.  That will be difficult but it must be done.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton asked me earlier if I raised the issue of their members or associates being involved in street activities.  As I have continually said in this House in respect of targeting, punishment beatings or any other type of street activity, they foment the same type of bitterness and hatred.  I was assured last night that during the marching season Sinn Féin will attempt to keep people out of these activities. That would be their stated position.  I know from security reports that Sinn Féin actively did that last week when their elected members went on the streets to encourage people to go home.  I know that was picked up by the British Government also.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 14, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the ceremony to mark the establishment of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt yesterday.  This ceremony provided an opportunity for the Union to celebrate the beginning of a new era in economic and monetary union.  The <Col N="914" /> ceremony consisted of an opening address by Mr. Wim Duisenberg, the first President of the new European Central Bank, and addresses by Prime Minister Blair, as outgoing President of the European Council, the President of the European Parliament, José Maria Gil-Robles, the Commission President, Jacques Santer, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Chancellor Victor Klima, the incoming President of the European Council.  The ceremony included recitals by the Royal Dutch Male Voice Choir and a performance by the Riverdance ensemble.</P>
    <P>I plan to visit France between 12 and 14 July to meet Prime Minister Jospin to discuss a range of European and bilateral issues and to attend the Bastille Day parade on 14 July.  I will visit China during the week commencing 14 September.  I also hope to visit Russia this autumn, either in late September or early October.</P>
    <P>The programme for my visit to China is still in its preparatory stages.  However, I hope to meet both the Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and President Jiang Zemin.  There are a number of issues which I hope to discuss with both leaders, including the development of bilateral links between China and Ireland, the economic situation in Asia and human rights.  I also hope to meet a number of business leaders as there will be a strong trade element to the China visit.</P>
    <P>In preparation for the visit to China, an informal interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, has been established to co-ordinate the economic aspects of the visit.  I will consider the necessity for additional preparatory meetings on economic and other issues as further details of the programme are clarified.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton because we are charting new waters and there should not be any uncertainty in regard to currency or financial matters.  Mr. Duisenberg stated he would consider his position when he reached retirement age.  His age is well known and it would be useful if he said he would stay on until he reached a particular age.  Perhaps he would have done that if it had not been for the extraordinary amount of pressure put on him by the <Col N="915" /> French at the time.  Because of that he was not prepared to take the job for the full term of office.  If the French had persisted on that day, I believe he would not have taken the job.</P>

      <QRef>[16424/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm that the funding for the <Col N="916" /> Whitefish Fleet Renewal Programme 1998-2000, which I announced in Castletownbere last week, will ensure effective and productive use of the remaining funding available for the fleet under the present fisheries operational programme which provides funding support for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet.  The programme also contains a funding measure for vessel decommissioning premia in the context of mandatory EU fleet reduction targets under the so-called multi-annual guidance programmes.</P>
      <P>I have been working since taking office to deliver on the Government's commitment to the renewal of the whitefish fleet.  My first task was to negotiate an equitable and reasonable decision for Ireland under the MGP IV decision to reflect the state of the Irish fleet and the acknowledged need for improvement in whitefish fleet safety, age profile and enhanced ability to compete on equal terms with competitor fleets.  In the context of that outcome, I concluded that a targeted programme of whitefish fleet renewal and modernisation, including the introduction of new vessels, could be delivered without recourse to a further decommissioning scheme on a 100 per cent tonnage replacement basis, while remaining within the tonnage objectives set for the whitefish fleet under the MGP decision for Ireland up to 2001.</P>
      <P>The whitefish fleet renewal programme has, therefore, been designed to utilise remaining funding to best effect for the fleet, while delivering on EU fleet parameters over the period.  Accordingly, the EU funding support package of £6.4 million for total investment of up to £40 million in the whitefish fleet combines the remaining funding under the decommissioning measure of up to £2.9 million and under the modernisation measure of up to £3.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the amount of funding under the 1998-99 operational programme for decommissioning and fleet modernisation.  How much of that funding &mdash; I welcome the Minister's announcement in that regard &mdash; has been allocated to the three year package? Given that funding has been transferred to the purpose announced by the Minister, am I right in thinking that no further funding will be available under the 1998-99 operational programme for decommissioning and modernisation, given that the funding has been used for the purpose announced by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The repackaging into the renewal programme will ensure that fleet funding under the operational programme up to 2000 is firmly directed at the priority needs of the whitefish fleet.  This strategic approach will deliver the most appropriate and effective use of available funding over the period.  From the positive reaction to the package, it is apparent the fishing industry shares my view that this is the correct and essential priority for funding support at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key element is that there was very little money for use on the grant package under the <Col N="917" /> operational programme, but money was available for decommissioning.  I felt, rather than become involved in decommissioning at this stage, it was more important to improve the safety of vessels and their capacity to operate on an equal playing pitch with those of the Spanish, French and other member states.  Consequently, the funds that were available have been directed to enhance the grant package.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by the Minister, but the question asked how much money is available under the operational programme for 1998-99 for vessel decommissioning and modernisation and how much funding was transferred for the purpose announced by the Minister relating to the whitefish fleet.  Under the programme there is a total of £8.9 million, including our own resources and EU resources.  Am I right in saying that funding was already available under the operational programme and there was no great input from the Exchequer?  Is it true the Minister announced he would invest £40 million?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree the trigger mechanism in the Finance Act relating to accelerated capital allowances, with which I agree, attracted interest by the banks in making available finance for the project?  No additional amount was made available from our own resources to top up the EU funding that was available.  How much money was available under the operational programme and, as a result of the Minister's announcement, how was that funding topped up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have had difficulty in understanding what I said.  I gave the figures under the decommissioning and modernisation measure, but did not give the amount spent prior to that date.  I outlined the position with which I was faced.  Prior to that date approximately £4.4 million in EU aid was earmarked for the adjustment of fishing effort measure.  Under the decommissioning scheme, 19 vessels were decommissioned during 1996, the money being used under that programme, accounting for £1.5 million, with an amount of £2.9 million in EU aid remaining.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the recent appearances of dangerous devices on the east coast.  I am disappointed, as I know the UK authorities are, that these devices apparently originated in the Beaufort Dyke dumpsite despite a management regime for the dumpsite which was agreed at ministerial level with the UK two years ago.</P>
      <P>On 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 June a total of 28 phosphorus devices were washed up on the east coast comprising 22 devices at the following locations in County Louth: Greenore, Dunany Point, Termonfeckin, Ballaghan Point, Annagassan, Salterstown and Clogher Head; three devices at Gormanstown, County Meath, one device at Loughshinny, County Dublin, and two devices at Greystones and Brittas, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I have been in contact from the outset with the Secretary of State for Defence, the Rt.  Hon. George Robertson, MP, and the Secretary of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Dr. Jack Cunningham, MP, as well as with Lord Dubs at the Northern Ireland Office.  In addition, officials of my Department have been in regular contact with their counterparts in the various UK Departments concerned.  I have sought information urgently on the cause of the disturbance of the Beaufort Dyke dumpsite and if any known disturbance had ceased.</P>
      <P>As a result of my inquiries a wide-ranging review by the Ministry for Defence in the UK has been carried out, involving other UK Departments and agencies.  This has attempted to ascertain whether activity in the area of Beaufort Dyke could have resulted in a release of the devices which were washed up on the east coast.  Preliminary indications are that the incidents early this month may not be attributable to identified activities in or near the dumpsite.  I am, however, awaiting a definitive reply in this regard from the UK Secretary of State for Defence and to my request for an urgent meeting at senior official level.</P>
      <P>It is known from the scientific survey of the dumpsite carried out by the Scottish Office more than three years ago that some material was short dumped, that is, outside the confines of the charted dumpsite, and lies in areas around the actual dumpsite.  The UK hydrographic service is currently carrying out investigations to determine whether dumped material, combined with particular meteorological conditions, could have resulted in devices being washed up on the east coast.  In the meantime I have asked the UK authorities to consider further strategies for managing the Beaufort Dyke, for example, extending the area of restriction around the dumpsite, if short dumped material is found to be the source of recent problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply.  Did the Department of Defence or the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources carry out an underwater investigation to find out the cause of dislodgement of these <Col N="919" /> devices?  Will the Minister agree that because the British are responsible, they should pay the costs involved?  Will he further agree that in accordance with information received from the British Government from time to time regarding Sellafield we are unlikely to believe what it tells us anyway and we should carry out our own investigation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of any further investigation of the dumpsite with a view to ascertaining its stability or state or to improve its management will remain matters for the UK Government.  The cost of monitoring the Irish coast and of disposing of these devices is subsumed into the ongoing cost of the emergency services.  However, to the extent that these activities have added to costs I will consider funding sources, including an appropriate request to the UK authorities.  The matter is still very much under investigation and that relates particularly to the agreements reached earlier, and which have been pursued since, in regard to the management regime in place for Beaufort Dyke dumpsite.  It consists of ongoing monitoring and restrictions around the dumpsite for activities such as dredging, drilling, submarine activities, etc. and the current regime will be reviewed in light of the findings of the investigation into the cause of the recent incidents.  We are determined to solve the problem in so far as it can be done. It looks most likely that they do not come directly from within Beaufort Dyke, but from around it as a result of short dumping, etc., and this is being fully investigated.  It may require further management measures subsequently.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Surveillance and costs are related. Surveillance involves the efforts to find what happened and how it happened.  Although it is more than three weeks since the last device was found surveillance will be continued in the meantime.  I hope those discovered arose from one incident which might be the case as the devices tended to be washed up together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am currently discussing with my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food the respective roles of BIM and Bord Bia in the seafood export marketing function and the future strategic relationship between the two agencies. Having considered this matter in detail, the optimum <Col N="920" /> benefits in terms of the use of resources will be achieved through defining clear complementary roles for both organisations.  To give an exclusive remit to either body would not offer the best results.</P>
      <P>In general BIM should retain a specialist marketing focus as the integrated development agency for the seafood sector.  There are a number of reasons I have come to this view.  They include the recent organisational change in BIM itself, my analysis of the specific characteristics and needs of the fisheries sector, trends in the EU and global seafood market and the stated preferences and needs of Irish seafood processors and exporters.</P>
      <P>This should not preclude an ongoing important role for Bord Bia in terms of incorporating seafood into its generic food promotion and trade activities overseas especially at the top end of the value added chain and in markets where realistically BIM cannot have a presence.  Bord Bia has been doing a first class job for the overall Irish food export sector since inception and the two agencies can work together effectively, as appropriate and without overlap, in delivering on their respective and complementary remits.  I will shortly discuss mechanisms for delivering this strategic relationship with the Minister for Agriculture and Food with a view to agreeing an overall strategic approach to be agreed by Government which will clarify and set the way forward for BIM and Bord Bia in this area.</P>
      <P>I am pleased good progress is being made to maximise existing and new markets for Irish seafood worldwide.  Exports have increased by more than 60 per cent since 1990 and are now worth over £250 million per annum.  There is exponential demand in the EU and worldwide for high value seafood as well as for the fresh product.  Strategic co-operation between BIM and Bord Bia reflecting their respective expertise and responsibilities will deliver the most cost efficient and effective use of State resources and networks in the global market and will be in the best interests of the seafood sector as a whole.</P>

      <P>Following the review of the expert group on the food industry in 1993 Bord Bia was established in 1994.  When the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry at the time, Deputy Walsh, introduced Bord Bia he stated that fish was included as one of the categories and it was now time for assimilating the promotion of BIM into Bord Bia's remit.  Does the Minister agree that when one looks at the marketing resources and locations of Bord Bia, they exceed the marketing potential of BIM; that there is a validity in all food being encompassed by one agency rather than parochial operations divided between the Departments of the Marine and Natural Resources and Agriculture and Food and it is probably necessary for Bord Bia to focus on all food activities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is particularly important for the seafood sector that there be a vertically integrated marketing approach so that a producer is not on a wing somewhere.  The producer should produce for a customer and this should be market oriented.  That runs through the entire sector and it is big enough for that.  The seafood sector will become much bigger and it is diverse.  I do not see any great difficulty in BIM co-operating and working out a memorandum of understanding with Bord Bia on how they will operate in specialist areas where Bord Bia will operate directly and in other areas where they can combine on an all Irish seafood basis.  I prefer that the operation of seafood production and development be market led and driven.  If it is to be market led, one must be in the marketplace providing support.  I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Agriculture and Food and we will look at the development of a memorandum of understanding in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question is relevant to the negotiating context in which I succeeded in achieving a four year stay on the driftnet ban, against a background where most member states, the UK Presidency and the Commission favoured an immediate ban.</P>
      <P>The following explanation of the &ldquo;Ioannina Compromise&rdquo; is not a legal interpretation but my own political assessment of the negotiating situation as it evolved.  There is a total of 87 votes in the Council, 62 in favour are required for a qualified majority, 26 votes against are required for a blocking minority, Ireland has three votes, France and Italy each have ten votes which is directly relevant in this context.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Ioannina Compromise&rdquo; was agreed in 1994.  When voting, if members of the Council representing a total of 23 to 25 votes indicate their intention to oppose qualified majority decision, Council must try to reach &ldquo;within a reasonable time&rdquo;, a solution which could be adopted by at least 65 votes.  The Presidency of the day is charged, with the Commission, to take all steps to facilitate a wider basis for agreement.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ioannina&rdquo; therefore is not a veto, nor does it confer a power to block a qualified majority decision and certainly not after the event.  It creates a situation where Council, the Presidency and the Commission effectively have to take account of the minority view and to work as far as possible to arrive at an accommodation.  Given the opposition of Ireland and France to the driftnet ban, combined with a significant level of opposition from Italy, totalling 23 votes, there was a climate of &ldquo;Ioannina&rdquo; operating right up to the final vote.  My negotiating approach before and during Council was to maintain the support of France and Italy and to fight to gain the maximum in that scenario for the Irish fishing industry.  When it came to the vote, I voted against the ban because of the adverse effect on Irish fishermen.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>
      </P>
      <P>France also voted against.  Italy abstained at which point invocation of &ldquo;Ioannina&rdquo; was no longer an option.  But that was only after the date of implementation had been pushed back as far as possible and getting a framework which will enable us to prepare for a new future in the fishery.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware the French are furious and have said they hope to invoke the &ldquo;Ioannina Compromise&ldquo;?  I recognise it is a blocking mechanism which operates.  With respect, the Minister said he had succeeded in achieving a four year stay on the driftnet ban.  If the Minister refers back over the records he will find that his colleague, Deputy Andrews, said four years ago he hoped to see an end to this issue.  Are the new regulations for tuna fishing operational?  Has the Minister dropped any potential legal action on this issue, as threatened?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The new directive comes into operation right away, beginning from 1998.  An amendment was accepted which provided for research and technical development funds.  We are pursuing that issue and discussing with the fishermen and BIM the implementation of those in relation to this season; in other words to see whether it is possible to have a trial of the new fishing methods undertaken during this season. That is under way at present.  I am not aware of any realistic basis for a challenge.  Our collective efforts would be more productively directed at ensuring a future for Irish fishermen in the tuna fishery, through research and reconversion in partnership and through, effectively, managing our continued involvement in the driftnet fishery over the next four years.  That management process is under way.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he may not be aware of a legal challenge, yet it was he who said he would probably proceed with a legal challenge. Can I deduce from the Minister's reference to research and technology that the regulations will apply as and from this year for tuna fishermen and that the same number of vessels would no longer be able to fish for the traditional driftnet tuna fishing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The confusion may arise from the fact that by voting against I left it open to Ireland to pursue any challenge subsequently.  That was one of the effects of my voting against the ban. The number of fishermen who fished in 1997 will be able to fish in 1998.  The numbers varied between 1995, 1996 and 1997.  We succeeded in having the three years included.  Therefore, we believe it will be possible to manage the situation reasonably well this year.</P>

      <P>As I advised the House last November I have been actively pursuing the issue of rates on fish farms <Col N="924" /> with the Minister for Finance with a view to obtaining a satisfactory resolution for the industry.</P>
      <P>The aquaculture industry has made a persuasive case for fish farms to be given parity of treatment with the agriculture sector which is exempted from rates under existing valuation legislation.  The disparity in the treatment between aquaculture and agriculture under the valuation Acts needs to be addressed given the obvious similarities of both sectors.</P>
      <P>My ongoing discussions with the Minister for Finance on this issue have been constructive to date and, while not wishing in any way to pre-empt the Government's decision in the matter, I remain very hopeful that the matter can be positively dealt with in the forthcoming Bill to amend the valuation Acts.

The draft memo included a proposal to concede the relief from rates to facilities used for the rearing and breeding of fish.  It went on to state that property used for processing, storage and retail of fish products will continue to be rateable.  Following a meeting between my Department officials and officials of the Department of Finance and the Valuation Office that has now changed.  I expect the heads of the valuation Bill will be presented to Cabinet this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in the House on 27 May 1998, the recent unfortunate tragedies and loss of life to which the Deputy refers have highlighted once again the dangers associated with recreational water activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is responsible for the initiation <Col N="925" /> and co-ordination of all maritime search and rescue, SAR, measures within the internationally designated Irish search and rescue region.  The local authorities are responsible for safety on their beaches and the appointment of lifeguards. However, I have instructed my officials to provide advice and assistance to marine local authorities, with a view to ensuring a high level of co-operation and co-ordinated action, where necessary.</P>
    <P>The Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES, of my Department has various response services declared to it as rescue facilities.  These services include the RNLI, Air Corps, Community Inshore Rescue Service, IMES helicopters, IMES coastal units and IMES radio centres and the national marine communication network.  These services, when alerted, are available to respond to any emergency on our coastline.</P>
    <P>IMES has engaged in ongoing discussions with Water Safety Ireland of the National Safety Council and with the local authorities to affirm the lifeguard Service as a &ldquo;Declared Facility&rdquo;.  I can report that in this regard IMES addressed the local authorities water safety development officers' conference at Dungarvan, County Waterford, on 1 April 1998.  The conference was advised of the resources available in Ireland for search and rescue and how to alert them and the subject of lifeguards as a declared resource to IMES was raised.  The benefits of a liaison agreement to both IMES and lifeguards were discussed and received a positive response from those in attendance.  IMES also met representatives of Sligo County Council on 29 May to discuss the Strandhill tragedy, to offer whatever assistance it could and to examine ways of progressing the establishment of a liaison agreement with Sligo County Council.</P>
    <P>The purpose of establishing the Lifeguard Service as a &ldquo;Declared Facility&rdquo; is to improve co-operation between the duty lifeguards and IMES, to provide effective and timely mutual support in search and rescue operations and maintain effective SAR communications between the lifeguards, the Irish Marine Emergency Service and its response services in a marine emergency incident.</P>
    <P>It is my Department's intention to have liaison agreements with all maritime local authorities and hopefully to sign all agreements at the same time.  In this regard we are working with Water Safety Ireland of the National Safety Council, which has undertaken to circulate the draft documents.  My Department will continue to progress this important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. When does he expect the lifeguard facilities operated by local authorities to become declared facilities for IMES purposes?  In his reply to my colleague on 27 May he indicated that in order to be a declared facility the lifeguard service would have to meet specific standards or set criteria laid down by IMES.  In what regard is the lifeguard <Col N="926" /> service provided by the local authorities not meeting the criteria or standards set down by IMES?  Is it in some way deficient in relation to those standards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As to when it is likely to happen and when the procedures are likely to be completed, it is expected that a liaison agreement will be in place for the beginning of next year's lifeguard season.  It will involve training, among other things, and I will return to that point.  Even without that agreement, the IMES search and rescue resources are available to the lifeguard service at present, but with it the arrangement will be much tighter, with suitable training and a fully declared facility.  The lifeguard can notify IMES using the 999 system as advertised in the telephone directory and the safety awareness booklets promoted under my Department's marine safety initiative.  These booklets have been circulated to all relevant bodies, including harbour and local authorities.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Strandhill tragedy, a lady at the scene phoned 999 and an IMES helicopter was there within six minutes, but tragically there was an underdraft and the people were swept out to sea.  The helicopter helped with the search and recovery.  It is not always possible to be on the spot so quickly but they happened to be on a training operation nearby.  That is what is possible now and we are trying to tighten up further.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the criteria, which are currently in draft form and being developed.  We would have tried to further this relationship in any event.  The extra elements in the criteria include that all beach lifeguards will develop and make available to IMES written operational procedures, which will include a full, normal operating policy and emergency action plans; all lifeguards are to have a valid and nationally recognised beach lifeguard qualification and possess an approved first aid certificate; an agreed training programme and assessment for lifeguards is to be put in place, including a seven to 14 day fitness test, and to be undertaken on a regular basis throughout the season, with a log book used to record the training; all lifeguards are to satisfy IMES training requirements for basic radio communications procedure and to be qualified to at least a VHF restricted certificate of competence and radiotelephony and each unit is to be licensed to the radio surveyor's office.  There are various other requirements relating to equipment, the use of readily identifiable and specific uniforms, etc. Those are the kind of criteria being developed, which would mean a tightening up of the relationship when the facilities are declared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that IMES had additional requirements &mdash; such as training in procedures, first aid certificates, fitness testing and fundamental radio procedures &mdash; which seem quite basic.  Is he saying that our lifeguard service this summer does not match up to the IMES standards as regards these basic requirements, which it must meet in order to be a declared facility?  Is our current service deficient as regards basic fitness, emergency procedures and radio training, all of which one would have expected to be prerequisites?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of these are in place and we have many excellent lifeguards operating on our coasts, as the Deputy knows.  What is involved here is much greater co-ordination and standardisation of approach and better liaison between the services so that they instantly know what they are doing and can act in unison &mdash; if one does not have a declared service that is not the case.  It requires more detail on the standard operating procedures, and while these may seem simple the difference where the facility is declared is that one operates these plans instantly on a co-ordinated basis across the country or within a region.  Currently lifeguards work to local authorities, some of whom may have different procedures, although all of them will be good.  I also envisage that this will lead to the service being better equipped on a standardised basis and that is something we are discussing in our liaison with local authorities.  I think this will be a good development and lead to an enhanced and more co-ordinated service, which is what people want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is saying is desirable in the context of lifeguards, the Irish Marine Emergency Service and the local authorities but perhaps he could broaden it slightly. In the Strandhill incident there was criticism that the slipway was inaccessible because of various objects.  Will the Minister, in consultation with local authorities, where there is an emphasis on the marine, ensure that a directive on slipways is issued?  It is important that good housekeeping prevails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This will become a normal part of liaison.  When one concentrates sufficiently at a high enough level, everyone is brought together to look at how everything is linked and the weaknesses in those links become very apparent.  This raises the question of resources.  Reports on beaches are issued to local authorities by my Department, and we must look at how these are integrated into the system.  There is a follow through as regards declared facilities.  Many matters which may not be foreseen so readily now come together more efficiently if there is liaison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant co-ordinated investment in infrastructure amounting to some £60 million at Dublin Port and Dún Laoghaire Harbour, servicing the central Irish Sea corridor, has been completed in recent years or is under way and nearing completion.  The development of the Dublin Bay ports' facilities catering for ro-ro and lo-lo traffic has attracted new and improved services with the level of business increasing significantly.</P>
      <P>The success of these operations in attracting additional freight traffic is demonstrated by record throughput statistics for the central corridor which show a 136 per cent increase in ro-ro freight carried in 1997 as compared to 1994.  Passenger numbers recorded a 20 per cent growth for the same period and the number of accompanied private cars and buses increased by 23 per cent.</P>
      <P>Dublin Port's lo-lo traffic has grown by a very significant 46 per cent over the same period to 381,000 twenty foot equivalent units in 1997.  The central Irish Sea corridor can now boast state of the art facilities catering for ro-ro and lo-lo traffic at the Dublin Bay ports which compare very favourably with other ports abroad.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response and his involvement in and encouragement of the recent investment in Dublin Bay. Will the Minister encourage leaders in the business community to support Dublin Bay?  His attention has probably been drawn to the promotion of a port outside our jurisdiction by one of the leaders of Irish industry.  Will the Minister ask those who have used these new state of the art facilities to encourage others to maximise the full potential of Dublin Port?  Is the Minister concerned about the increase in seabed levels, particularly where it affects watersport activities in the Sutton Creek area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The facilities, services, standards and efficiency of the port provide the greatest encouragement for use.  These are the main objectives of my Department.  As Deputy Callely and Deputy Gilmore know, we have considerably increased the efficiency of the port and have reduced charges by 15 per cent, which is an important attraction.  We are now looking at ways of reducing charges further to make the port more efficient.</P>
      <P>As regards competition with other ports, the factors which matter are the speed of turnaround, the efficiency of operations and the facilities available.  All the indications are that Dublin Port is shaping up well and is attracting extra business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rising seabed level around Dublin Port is a problem.  This is a constant source of concern because of the need for dredging and the effects <Col N="929" /> of the position of alluvium as the River Liffey enters the sea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">

One only has to look for 57 varieties to lead the Minister directly to the industrialist to which I refer.</P>
      <P>The Minister has acknowledged the increase in seabed levels, in which I have an interest particularly as regards the Dollymount area &mdash; I know the Minister has an interest in the problem as regards the Sutton Creek area.  This problem is impinging on water sport activity a matter on which I put down another question.  Is there a programme for dredging the bay to ensure there will be no interference in activities which people have enjoyed over the years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a serious problem with the build-up of sand.  Dredging of the channel is economic and direct and must continue.  Dublin Corporation is considering the implications for Dollymount Strand and we will give it any assistance or information we can.  I recently provided some information on the cost of building a passageway under the main causeway to Bull Island in a reply to a question put down by Deputy Callely.  These matters must be considered by Dublin Corporation in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I will follow up the Deputy's question on the Irish business people to ensure we do not lose business in Dublin Port.  However, 90 per cent of business in the Republic goes through the ports &mdash; in the entire country the figure is 99 per cent. The ports will continue to be busy as the Celtic tiger continues to develop.  If we do not develop our ports we will not have many more Celtic tigers in the future.  The ports are crucial to our economic development.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree the impressive performance of the central sea corridor between 1994 and 1997 is not unrelated to the political stewardship during that time. Does he believe Dublin Port, in particular, is capable of meeting the huge increase in demand for port services, mainly as a result of the increased level of economic activity?

      <P>I was familiar with the importance of the turnaround time and the speed of operations.  I was often at the port at 5.00 a.m. It was once known as the most expensive lake in the world.  I developed the concept of a central corridor in 1992 and the report was well under way at that time.  Even though I had to keep my head down, I gave the go-ahead to the development at Dún Laoghaire.  I am sure Deputy Gilmore had to lower his head even further because of the many objections to what we were doing at the time.  I am pleased, however, it worked out well and that business has increased significantly.</P>
      <P>I was a little concerned about the size of the HSS, but a few months ago I brought some Americans to Dún Laoghaire who were very impressed by the HSS.  They said it must be the biggest in the world.  That put it in focus and highlighted the significance of the service.  Similar developments are taking place in Dublin.  I am pleased one operation did not have to exclude the other.  I am also pleased our successors carried on the concept of the central corridor.

      <P>A commitment was given to reconsider this amendment which seeks to increase the representation of travellers or their representatives on local committees.  The Bill provides that the members of a local authority cannot exceed half of the membership of the committee and that the representatives of local travellers and traveller bodies should not be less than one quarter of the membership.  This leaves a maximum of one quarter for local authority officials.</P>
      <P>This committee composition is designed to achieve a fair working balance between the groups represented.  The large representation of members is in view of the need to allow representation of different electoral divisions and urban districts within the functional area of the appointed authority.  It should be noted, however, that as traveller representation should not be less than one quarter, there is scope for higher representation by travellers or traveller bodies.  The existing provision is designed to allow maximum flexibility to authorities, particularly where travellers are not willing to participate in such a committee or where there are fewer travellers in the functional area of the authority.</P>

      <P>The Minister's response is disappointing.  This proposal stemmed from a submission from the Irish Traveller Movement which represents most of the traveller bodies.  It believes that to achieve a proper balance on the committee at local level, traveller representation should be increased from one quarter to one third.  Notwithstanding the arguments I made earlier about the extended composition of resident and community organisations on local committees, I encourage the Minister of State to reconsider this proposal.  It is not good practice on Report Stage to refuse to accept amendments discussed on Committee Stage which strengthen the legislation.  This is not a major change.  Many of the groups who made submissions to us requested it. I urge the Minister of State to reconsider the matter.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment.  For decades travelling people were ignored and were not consulted on their accommodation needs.  Society as a whole, as well as the travelling people, paid a price for that.  So-called solutions were foisted on the travelling people, which were neither suitable nor acceptable from many points of view.  Therefore, strengthening the travelling people's position on consultative committees such as this is absolutely essential and will reap good rewards. The more representatives of the travelling community who are involved in drawing up their accommodation needs, designs and sites &mdash; and in overcoming the problems that unfortunately arise between them and settled people in some instances &mdash; the more it will be a real factor in overcoming those problems.  With that in mind I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I apologise for having been delayed in returning to the House.  I was attending another meeting.  The composition of the local committees is a very important issue.  On Committee Stage we had a debate on the relative strengths of the different component parts.  It is quite clear that those people outlined in section 22(1)(c) as &ldquo;representatives of local travellers and traveller bodies&rdquo; should have a significant voice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister of State has not accepted the previous amendment from Deputy Hayes on a specific voice for resident groups, the three component groups will be local authorities, travellers' representatives and officials.  It is important that the travellers or their representatives should not be intimidated by being in too much of a minority.  One third of the overall membership is a much more acceptable proportion than one quarter.  In terms of voice and representation it is a <Col N="934" /> little bit more acceptable to be outnumbered two to one than three to one.  I hope the Minister of State has had a chance to reflect upon that reasonable request from the traveller movement. I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment in the spirit that I know he wishes to bring to the Bill.</P>

      <P>To take up Deputy Howlin's point, it would be a pity if we were to see this as a two to one representation because that is not the purpose of the local consultative committee. Everybody, including public representatives, officials and travellers' representatives, is there to deal with this problem which, we all agree, has gone on for far too long.</P>
      <P>Section 22 states that the number of &ldquo;representatives of local travellers and traveller bodies.  .. shall not be less than one quarter of the membership of the local consultative committee&rdquo;.  There is no reason it cannot be higher.</P>

I hope all the representatives, whether they are public representatives, officials or travellers' representatives, will be there to try and deal with a problem that has gone on for too long.  We are trying to deal with it now and I hope we can do so effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister of State has not changed his view since Committee Stage. While he made a valid point in saying this matter should not be seen as &ldquo;them and us&rdquo;, we are providing for representation.  Section 22(1)(c) refers to &ldquo;representatives of local travellers and traveller bodies&rdquo;.  It is intended that they should be representative.  I suggest that representative group should comprise at least one third of the overall, which is not an outlandish request.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I asked if we were dealing with a group on women's rights, would it be necessary even to put an amendment that one third of the membership be women or their representatives? Would it be the case for any disadvantaged group?  If we were talking about a group providing accommodation needs for people with a physical disability, would their representatives not have a significant proportion of the overall membership?  It would not even be an issue, so why is it an issue in relation to the representatives of travellers?</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to think again about this matter and to accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is moved; to bring a balance to the consultative committees at local level so that, while we have a balance in terms of representation, the voices of those most directly affected by the legislation &mdash; the travellers &mdash; will be heard with significant force.  That can only be done by having sufficient numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> It is not good enough to say there is a possibility the representation will be higher than the minimum allowed for.  In reality we know that what is allowed for will become the norm.  I hope I am not wasting my efforts on this matter and that the Minister of State is still open to accepting the arguments I am trying to put forward.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 19, lines 10 and 11, after &ldquo;persons&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for any period not exceeding 2 years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>All the amendments we are taking together were discussed on Committee Stage.  They are all essential towards ensuring that the Bill &mdash; and the intentions of both the Oireachtas and the Minister of State &mdash; works to best effect.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;for any period not exceeding 2 years&rdquo; in relation to the length of time families are housed on sites with limited facilities.  As I said on Committee Stage, it has been reported to me &mdash; and the Minister with responsibility for housing has not denied this report &mdash; that families have been housed on such sites for up to 18 years.  By definition, these sites are intended to be of a temporary nature.  It is reasonable to expect that a period not exceeding two years should be inserted into the section.  Otherwise, people will have to endure inadequate and insufficient facilities for the greater part of their children's developing years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister of State mentioned a period of five years as being the normal time frame of individual plans.  I indicated that I would welcome his amendment if he wished to put a very high threshold of five years on the legal period of time that travellers could be accommodated on these inadequate sites.  In the list of amendments I see the Minister of State has not put forward his own amendment to follow through on the suggestion made on Committee Stage.  I can only assume he is fixed on the idea that people can be condemned forever to these sites.  That is not the spirit of the Bill or the intention of the Oireachtas or the Minister.  The Minister <Col N="936" /> is loath to put in primary statute a legal requirement that people are not accommodated in inadequate facilities such as those for which we are making provision.  They are meant to be of a temporary nature.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 seeks to put an upper limit on the number of families that can be accommodated on a single site.  I suggest 20 should be the upper limit.  We had a long discussion on Committee Stage about situations where scores of families were accommodated on an individual site.  The Minister has accepted that is not good policy.  He indicated on Committee Stage that 20 would be a large number of families to accommodate on a single site.  Yet it looks as if we will not legislate to forbid sites accommodating more than 20 families.  This has been suggested by the Irish Traveller Movement whose members are experts in this area and who are fully aware of the tensions that can be created if a large number of families are accommodated on an inadequate site. I reiterate my concern about this matter.  I do not see why we cannot legislate for it, particularly when all parties agreed to it on Committee Stage. It is wrong to think this matter can be catered for in the guidelines the Minister proposes to issue for which housing authorities may have regard but which may not have the force of law.  That is an inadequate way of dealing with the intentions of the Oireachtas in this matter.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 seeks to broaden the definition of limited facilities beyond the extremely basic definition in the Bill.  Section 28 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(7) In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;sites with limited facilities&rsquo; means which, having regard to the temporary nature of such sites or the short duration [18 years] of periods of use, have sufficient water, facilities for solid and liquid waste disposal and hard surface parking area for caravans.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I suggest that these three requirements be extended to include &ldquo;and such other facilities as are reasonably required&rdquo;.  These three requirements are too basic even in a definition of basic facilities.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we will make the mistakes of the past if we do not put in primary statute, not in guidelines which may or may not be followed, our intention that families who use sites with limited facilities will not be there for long periods of time.  I have suggested two years as the upper limit.  I am open to the Minister's suggestions for an alternative period if he thinks it should be slightly longer.  I have suggested that no more than 20 families should be accommodated on any single site and that we broaden the definition of limited facilities to include things which are basic and essential for good human living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Amendment No. 13 outlines the extra facilities which should be provided on the sites referred to in section 29. <Col N="937" /> Section 29 deals with the provision of temporary halting sites for travelling people who are awaiting transfer to a permanent location.  It also deals with transient sites, which are set up for groups of travelling people who may be passing through or in an area for a particular period. Transient sites have not been developed by local authorities.  If transient sites were developed, properly managed and well looked after, it would help to resolve many of the problems facing the travelling and settled communities in certain areas.</P>
      <P>The problem with temporary sites where the travelling people are waiting to be permanently accommodated is that they remain the same for years and years.  It is not adequate that families and individuals are obliged to live in these temporary sites and that the only facilities provided are cold water and sewage and waste disposal.  It is shameful and shocking that some temporary sites in this city are shanty towns because of the lack of facilities.  That situation must be urgently addressed.</P>
      <P>We must insist on a higher level of facilities. The only extra facilities I want are electricity and public telephones.  No one could argue against the fact that electricity is a basic necessity.  It is not a major task to supply the bays in the sites with electricity.  Meters could be found which would suit the location and circumstances.  &ldquo;Pay in advance&rdquo; meters are used by the ESB and these would be suitable in such cases.  Travelling people need generators.  However, they are not satisfactory in places where families live together because they are noisy, dirty and dangerous, particularly if there are children in the area.  Electricity terminals must be properly installed.  The Government should indicate this to the local authorities through this Bill.</P>
      <P>Public telephones are also a necessity.  Many of these sites are not immediately adjacent to places from where people can telephone.  It is essential that people have access to a telephone, particularly in emergencies or if old people or children suddenly become ill.  It is a condemnation of this society that many children in these sites get more diseases than children in the settled community. The type and location of the telephone can be discussed with the people on the site.  It will depend on whether there is a caretaker and on the arrangements at the site.  Many of these sites are far away from places where such facilities are available.  The minimum the Government should do is indicate there is some basic level of so-called civilisation to which travelling people are entitled and should have as a right.  I hope the Minister of State will accept this group of amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>As explained on Committee Stage, the difficulty with these amendments arises from sound legislative practice developed over years of experience with inserting too much administrative detail in primary legislation.  I assure the Deputies there is no difficulty with the practice or the intention behind the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> However, there will always be the extenuating or exceptional case which a local authority could legally be prevented from dealing with if the primary legislation is too rigid or detailed.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the definition of &ldquo;sites with limited facilities&rdquo; is an enabling provision to allow the Minister to issue guidelines on the level of services and facilities to be provided on such sites.  Guidelines for these sites are already being drafted in consultation with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group on which travellers are represented.  The proposed guidelines will detail a range of services appropriate to different situations ranging from basic services at roadside encampments, services where families have to move to a temporary site where the existing accommodation is being redeveloped and services and facilities at sites where longer stays, pending the provision of permanent accommodation, are envisaged.  It is proposed these guidelines will contain a range of matters of detail not appropriate for inclusion in primary legislation including appropriate references to the need to avoid stays by individual families for any longer than four or five years; the number of bays to be allowed on sites and the level of services to be provided on such sites.  Guidelines in relation to transient halting sites, which come within the definition of sites with limited facilities, will also be prepared in consultation with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group.</P>
    <P>Regarding amendment No. 13, I expect the level of services to be provided at transient sites or longer term temporary sites would at least be of the level proposed in the amendment. However &ldquo;sites with limited facilities&rdquo; also covers a situation where temporary facilities have to be provided during the redevelopment of a site or the construction of a new site.  It may not always be feasible to safely supply electricity in such circumstances.  Such a supply may not be necessary as travellers generally have their own electricity generators when they are travelling.  Also, it may not be feasible to provide a public phone in these circumstances.  Again in many cases it may not be necessary because of the availability of mobile phones.  There have also been problems with maintaining public phones on sites for caravans and, in some cases, this service has had to be withdrawn because of recurring vandalism.  In addition, I am not aware of any other statutory requirement on a local authority to provide a public telephone as part of its accommodation.</P>
    <P>There is a drafting defect in Deputy Higgins's amendment as refuse collection is already covered by solid waste disposal.  In view of the above it would not be appropriate to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not surprised, but I am disappointed the Minister of State has not changed tack since Committee Stage.  My strong personal view, which I indicated, is that a good deal of important work is taken from primary statute law and put into regulations and guidelines, subject <Col N="939" /> to the drafting skills of civil servants but not amenable to discussion in this House in the normal course of events.  It is our duty to set the law. That is what we are elected to do.  If we believe people should not be accommodated on such sites with limited basic facilities for years on end, then we should state in the law that this is our intention.  The guidelines are all well and good and, as section 29(6) states, the Minister may issue guidelines and the housing authority shall have regard to such guidelines, but in terms of real effect unless we put a binding legislative provision in place in that regard, they are legislatively meaningless.  The points made by Deputy Higgins and me are important and basic and I will press my amendments.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> The Minister of State said there should not be a detailed outlining of the facilities to be provided, but that is contradicted by section 29(7) which details a number of facilities, including sufficient water, facilities for disposal of waste and hard surface parking.  Why is it all right to detail those and not the few other basic necessities I outlined in my amendment? We could not have much more basic needs than the need to have access to electricity and a public telephone.  It would not be acceptable in any other development that they would not be included as part of the infrastructure.  It is essential that those basic facilities are provided in apartments, flats and any type of shopping area but particularly in areas where people live.  Why make an exception when it comes to travelling people?</P>
      <P>I note what the Minister said about generators. As I outlined, generators, especially at night and in the winter are not a satisfactory answer where there are reasonably large groups of people, whether ten, 12 or 15 families living in several caravans.  Generators are unsatisfactory and noisy.  An electrical supply to terminals that can be accessed by the families is the most basic necessity.  I will be disappointed if the Minister insists on rejecting this amendment calling for such facilities.</P>

      <P>Of the several amendments fairly comprehensively rejected on Committee Stage by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, I chose to resubmit only this one on Report Stage.  I did so because it is fundamental to the success of this Bill if it is to achieve its aim to take travellers off the roadside. This amendment fundamentally seeks to change the Bill because, as it stands, it is open-ended.  It places a limitless responsibility on local authorities to provide for all travellers so that no matter how many sites any local authority has provided, it still has responsibility to provide accommodation for any and all travellers who may turn up unannounced even though they may already have been allocated a site elsewhere.  To most rational people, it would appear that an obligation on local authorities to provide a halting site must be matched by a similar obligation on the part of travellers to use the halting sites which have been provided and at least not to vacate a site without first ensuring that there is a site available before they travel.</P>
      <P>Unless the Minister introduces this requirement, we will continue to see the spectacle of illegal roadside encampments, children uprooted from school and the continued confrontation between the settled community, the travellers and the local authorities and this badly needed Bill will have failed in what it sets out to do.  If the Bill is passed in its present form, it will inhibit progress in the provision of accommodation because not only is there no incentive for local authorities to proceed with their accommodation programmes but there is a disincentive.  The local authorities see, even when they have provided for their indigenous travellers, that they have limitless responsibility to continue to provide accommodation as long as travellers can move at will around the country.  It will also increase public resistance to the halting site programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure all Deputies, including the Minister <Col N="941" /> of State, Deputy Molloy, and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, are aware that there is great resistance to halting sites.  Indeed, this Bill would not be necessary if there was no resistance. Only if we can guarantee an end to illegal halting sites will we have any hope of convincing the public to accept permanent sites.</P>
    <P>I said yesterday that even the most reasonable people, those who are most receptive to the concept of providing halting sites, are gobsmacked when they hear that not only have they to provide permanent accommodation but also a choice of holiday accommodation throughout the country. I have heard it said again and again by members of the public that this is political correctness gone mad.  It is wrong to enshrine this right in legislation and it is wrong to mislead travellers into believing that such a provision can or should be made.  It is not good enough to throw our hands in the air, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and say travellers will travel.  Of course they will travel and they are entitled to travel, but they are not entitled to wander.</P>
    <P>Even if it were a reasonable provision, it is not a realistic one.  It is simply impractical to ask a local authority to have largescale facilities ready and vacant on the off chance that any number of travellers may turn up unannounced even though, and not withstanding the fact that, they already have permanent accommodation elsewhere and despite the fact that the local authority in which they are located has already provided a comprehensive network of halting sites for travellers.</P>
    <P>It is also unrealistic and impractical, particularly in the Dublin urban areas where there is already a shortage of land, where there is already a drift of travellers to those areas and where there is huge resistance to the provision of halting sites, to expect local authorities to provide the required network of halting sites.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to ask travellers to pre-book a site.  It is a small curb on their behaviour but all of us, if we must live cheek by jowl with one another, must accept some curbs on our behaviour so that we can live in harmony with others.  It is reasonable to ask them to pre-book a site before they leave the permanent site which they have been allocated.</P>
    <P>I have little expectation of this amendment being accepted, given the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to it yesterday, but I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to listen to the import of this amendment and make provision, if not in legislation at least by way of later regulation, to set up a national co-ordination body which can facilitate the booking of sites before a traveller leaves an existing one.</P>

      <P>As was explained on Committee Stage, amendment No. 15 is meaningless as it does not link in with any of the existing provisions in relation to follow-up action by the housing authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from this technicality, I have an objection in principle to the purpose behind it.  The <Col N="942" /> Deputy appears to be suggesting that there should be some kind of quota system under which housing authorities would be obliged to accommodate their share of travellers and, once accommodated, there should be no further obligation on any authority to accommodate any additional traveller families.  This could not be accepted by any Administration.</P>
    <P>There are implications here for the right to free movement.  It is also proposed to impose restrictions on a section of the community but not on all.  If travellers wish to change their place of residence, that is their right.  However, in doing so they must accept the consequences of loss of any priority on waiting lists which had been built up with previous authorities or no provision being made in the five year programme of the current authority in which these are situated.  However, the choice to move must remain for whatever reason the traveller deems it justifiable to do so.</P>
    <P>There are also difficulties from a resource point of view.  The effect of the proposed amendment, if properly drafted, would mean that the Minister would have to investigate in the case of each unauthorised encampment whether the housing authority has implemented its accommodation. This could take a considerable amount of time and render redundant the question of serving a notice by a housing authority.  It is envisaged that the need for accommodation programmes will be ongoing based on the most recent assessment of needs, which have been carried out periodically.</P>
    <P>The amendment would also involve the Minister in local issues in an unnecessary and bureaucratic way contrary to Government policy of devolving greater powers to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Therefore, unfortunately I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it is true that what I am suggesting in this amendment is asking more of or placing greater restrictions on travellers than on the settled community.  The settled community do not travel without making some provision for when they arrive.  That is all I am asking; I am not saying that there should be a limit on local authorities' responsibility.  What I am saying is that if travellers have a site, they should ensure there is a site for them to move to before they move.  It is possible to produce a swapping system if there is national co-ordination.</P>
      <P>At present, co-ordination is not possible and it will not happen under the Bill when enacted unless the Minister introduces changes.  At present, travellers have realised that it is wiser not to apply for accommodation to a local authority because they feel they have a right to wander.  They will go on doing that as long as they are given to believe that it is their right.  They will never be off the roadside and there will never be a programme of accommodation throughout the country.  I ask the Minister to take that on board.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Mitchell.  The travelling people are the black community of this country and they are deprived from birth.  I welcome the initiatives which are being taken to help make their lives easier.  Their lives are not easy but they themselves do not make them any easier. Side by side with helping them, they should be made aware of their responsibilities.  They are their own worst enemies.</P>
      <P>I come from Dundalk, a town which has been to the forefront in providing halting sites and integrating the travellers into the settled community.  It is one of the leading examples here. Many local authorities have not done their best or held back on that commitment because of the antipathy of the settled community towards the itinerant people.  I welcome every effort to make their lot an easier one.  However, side by side with the desire to help should be an obligation on the travelling folk to accept responsibility for their actions.</P>
      <P>No group should be allowed to park willy-nilly on the public highway and defy everybody.  That is one of the reasons the settled community is so antagonistic towards them.  On the Dundalk inner by-pass, the national primary route between Dublin and Dundalk which has the heaviest traffic in the country, these itinerant people regularly park their fancy Volvos and wagons causing a hazard to traffic using the road.  In doing so, they are aware of how long it takes to get the council to take them to court.  A mechanism should be introduced in this House to enable local councils to tow them away immediately where they are a traffic hazard.  This would go some way towards offsetting public antagonism to itinerant folk.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 5 to 8 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Chief Executive Officer of each health board shall, immediately upon the coming into operation of this Act, appoint officers of the board to be designated officers for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this amendment to section 2 is that on Committee Stage the Minister of State restructured aspects of the Bill, particularly with regard to health board personnel to whom allegations of child abuse can be made in circumstances where the person making the allegations is immune from civil liability.  It was envisaged <Col N="944" /> originally that a health board would appoint an officer to be a designated officer to receive all such complaints from members of the general public, teachers, members of the medical profession <i>et al.</i>  It was indicated, however, in a useful and constructive discussion on Committee Stage that there were a wide variety of health board personnel to whom the general public considered it was appropriate to make reports of child abuse, including community nurses, social workers, hospital nurses and members of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated in response that it was the view of chief executive officers of health boards that a broad category of personnel should and would be designated by them.  The amendment seeks to ensure this.  Under the Bill, as it stands, a chief executive officer can appoint one or more officers to be designated officers.  It would not be adequate to appoint only one officer to be a designated officer.  The amendment would ensure there would be an obligation on chief executive officers to appoint a number of personnel.  This would be in accord with the Minister of State's expressed view on how we should proceed.  I hope he will see fit to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The form of wording to be used to allow for the introduction of the designated officer of a health board for the purposes of this legislation has been the subject of considerable debate.  It was necessary to amend the Deputy's original proposal which would have allowed a broad reporting structure compared to that proposed in the Bill.  My amendment will restrict the persons to whom one can report while enjoying the protection afforded by the Bill to employees of those agencies, namely, the health boards and the Garda Síochána, who have a statutory obligation and the professional training to respond.  This was the fundamental point at issue and is one of my central amendments to the Bill as originally proposed.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officers of health boards have confirmed that they intend to appoint the widest possible range of personnel to be designated officers.  I see no merit in amending the section, especially as I have given a commitment to communicate with the chief executive officers who have assured me of their co-operation.  I regret, therefore, that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister of State is not accepting the amendment which seeks to ensure that what occurs in this area complies with the wishes of the House.  The Minister of State can issue all the instructions he likes and make all the comments he wishes to chief executive officers but under this legislation they will not be bound to appoint more than one officer to be a designated officer.  There is no reason the Minister of State should not accept this amendment, other than the usual obstinacy which one experiences <Col N="945" /> when one suggests that legislation should operate in the way envisaged.  I have expressed reservations previously about the manner in which the Minister of State is limiting immunity under the Bill to specific reports of abuse.  He is mistaken in dealing with this aspect in this way.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 seeks to confer a legal obligation on the Minister for Health and Children to publish guidelines.  When we dealt with a similar amendment on Committee Stage the Minister of State did not want to include it in the legislation. He is not willing, apparently, to accept amendment No. 1.  If he does not accept amendment No. 2, much of what he said will be meaningless in a statutory sense.</P>
      <P>I can only express my disappointment at the approach taken.  I am concerned that health boards may deal with this differently.  There are eight health boards.  Following the reform of the Eastern Health Board, there will be ten.  We have an obligation in passing important legislation such as this to ensure consistency.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister for Health and Children shall publish guidelines describing the category of persons who shall be appointed designated officers as provided for in <i>subsection (1)</i> of this section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment which deals with a related matter would give statutory force to any instructions the Minister of State might issue to chief executive officers to ensure a broad category of health board personnel can be the recipients of allegations of child abuse in circumstances where the person making the allegations is not at risk of civil liability provided they act in good faith and reasonably and their actions are not motivated by malice.  If the Minister of State were to accept this amendment to a great degree, it would resolve some of the difficulties outlined.  I hope he will accept it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and I have agreed on a number of improvements to the Bill as originally drafted.  I rejected this amendment on Committee Stage, however, as I considered it to be unnecessary and excessively prescriptive.  It was the subject of a lengthy discussion and my views are well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have gone a considerable distance towards meeting Deputy Shatter's concern that the categories of persons to whom reports may be made should be as flexible as possible.  In that context, I gave a commitment to communicate with the chief executive officers of the health boards on the subject of officers of the boards to whom <Col N="946" /> reports might be made.  I repeat that I do not doubt their co-operation in this matter.  This type of communication is a strength of the Bill in that it does not restrict us to a narrow list of persons or professionals to whom reports may be made.  I will not, therefore, be accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I support amendment No. 2.  The Minister of State has fallen into the trap of considering how things stand at present and of making comments in light of discussions he has had with the current chief executive officers of the health boards.  That would be fine if the position were to remain constant.  However, in drawing up legislation, we must provide for the future when a different Minister may hold office and when different chief executive officers may be employed by the health boards.</P>
      <P>The Bill should prescribe the manner in which we intend to proceed for the foreseeable future. In five years, the personnel may have changed. At that stage, if problems arise in respect of reporting procedures or if the guidelines are not being followed, there will be no point in quoting a conversation which took place in 1998.  That is not adequate.  We must be clear about what is expected of people who have responsibility in this area.  For that reason, it is essential that clear guidelines be laid down from the outset.  I wholeheartedly support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I find it extraordinarily difficult to understand the Minister of State's obstinacy and obstructiveness in respect of these issues.  Having originally introduced the Bill, I have sought to deal with matters on a consensus basis so that this measure can pass speedily through the House and provide additional protections which do not exist in the current legal system.  To a degree, the Bill has been redrafted to satisfy the Minister of State and his officials.  That has been my experience on a number of occasions regarding Private Members' Bills and I do not know whether it derives from the possessive views of Ministers in respect of their offices or from the views of the officials in their Departments.</P>
      <P>It is utterly absurd that the Minister of State will not accept the amendment.  He stated that he intends to issue some form of guidelines to chief executive officers.  The amendment would give him a statutory right and obligation to issue such guidelines, with which chief executive officers in each health board area would be required to comply.  They would also be obliged to appoint a number of people as designated officers who would be in a position to deal with or be the recipients of allegations of child abuse in circumstances where the person making those allegations is immune from civil liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the Minister of State nor I can predict the action which might be taken by the chief executive officers of different health boards in this regard in the future.  Any instruction he issues will have no legal effect or statutory implication <Col N="947" /> of any nature.  We could face a situation where the various health boards will deal with this problem in different ways and some of them may have an adequate number of designated officers while others may not.</P>
    <P>In dealing with issues of child abuse, health boards currently operate under the 1987 guidelines.  However, three of the health boards &mdash; it may now be four &mdash; have shown initiative by developing child abuse guidelines which are superior to the national guidelines.  The effect is that children receive a different and better level of protection within some health board areas which have been more active and dynamic in updating guidelines and procedures.  The amendment is designed to ensure that these issues are dealt with uniformly.</P>
    <P>I hope I am wrong and there will be no need for the amendment.  There is no point in my pressing the amendment beyond a voice vote because I am sure it will be defeated.  There would then not be adequate time to deal with other amendments of equal importance which must be discussed.  I predict that time will prove the Minister of State wrong with regard to the way he is dealing with this issue.  I hope he is willing to accept that responsibility.  In five to seven years when his successor is appointing another tribunal or commission to investigate why allegations of child abuse were not followed up or communicated in a health board area which led to the victims of that abuse not being given protection, I hope the Minister of State will come before the House and accept responsibility for his foolish approach to dealing with a basic amendment which achieves an objective that Deputy Shortall and I believe to be desirable.</P>
    <P>From what he stated earlier, the Minister of State apparently wants to achieve exactly what the amendment is designed to achieve.  However, there is no point in saying that he wants to take a certain course of action.  As legislators, we have the opportunity to incorporate in the Bill provisions to provide essential protection for children.  There is no basic reason why the amendment, which is not a party political measure, should not be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter will be proved wrong because guidelines with a legislative base do not necessarily have a greater standing than other guidelines given to health boards in respect of their daily operations.  I do not accept that guidelines must be given a legislative base.  I am satisfied that the negative aspects of such a proposal would be as strong as its positive aspects.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1) A person who, apart from this section, would be so liable shall not be liable in damages in respect of the communication, whether in writing or otherwise, by him or her to a member or members of the governing body of a sport or of the committee of a sports club of his or her opinion that a child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated or sexually abused by a member of or an employee of such governing body or sports club unless it is proved that he or she has not acted reasonably and in good faith in forming that opinion and so communicating it.</P>
      <P>(2) Where a report as described in <i>subsection (1)</i> of this section is made, a meeting of the governing body or relevant committee, whichever is the case, shall forthwith be convened and if the committee finds that there are grounds for the complaint, it shall immediately furnish the details of the complaint to a designated officer of a health board an/or a member of the Garda Síochána and the complainant shall be advised of the finding of the committee and the action, if any, taken or to be taken by it as shall the person in respect of whom the complaint is made.</P>
      <P>(3) The action taken as referred to in <i>subsection (2)</i> of this section may include amongst other things the suspension from sporting, coaching and training activities of the person in respect of whom a complaint is made and the governing body or relevant committee which suspends any person following receipt of a communication to which <i>subsection (1)</i> of this section applies shall not be liable in damages to such person for so doing if it is proved that it acted reasonably and in good faith in taking such action.</P>
      <P>(4) The reference in <i>subsections (1)</i> and <i>(3)</i> of this section to liability in damages should be construed as including a reference to liability to be the subject of an order for any other form of relief.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> This is a particularly important amendment.  On Committee Stage the Minister reduced the extent of the protection by narrowing the scope of the Bill in so far as it extended civil immunity to those who make allegations of child abuse reasonably and in good faith.  Since the Committee Stage the Murphy report on the abuse of children involved in swimming has been published. As the Bill stands, if I believe my child has been abused I can report the issue to a health board or to the Garda and, if I am acting reasonably and in good faith, I will be immune from civil liability.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Bill as amended is that if my child is a member of a swimming club and I believe the coach of the club is abusing my child or other children and if I decide to report that to the committee of the club or the governing body of the sport, I will be at risk of being sued.  If I am sued for defamation the court may decide that I have behaved properly and I may not be liable for damages.  I would also be at risk of being threatened by the coach against whom I make the allegation that he will get a court injunction to prevent me pursuing the issue.  The committee of the club or the governing body of the sport would also be open to that threat.</P>
    <P>Swimming is not the only sport in which there have been problems with the sexual abuse of children.  This problem has affected the GAA, football clubs and a range of other sports clubs.  It so happens that it is in swimming that there have been recent shocking revelations.  The Murphy report is clear in its conclusions.  Commenting on how those properly accused of child abuse successfully suppressed allegations made against them by threats of civil proceedings the report recommended, &ldquo;A complainant should be assured that the reporting of such a complaint is privileged and, accordingly, will not be defamatory unless it is made with malice.&rdquo;. The report further stated:</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to the provision of statutory immunity to protect persons who, in good faith, complain of possible sexual abuse of children.</P>
    <P>Other than to establish whether there are grounds for a complaint in relation to child abuse it is not appropriate for individuals, club committees or the Association [in this case the swimming association] to carry out internal investigations.</P>
    <P>They should suspend judgment and, having determined that there is a reasonable basis for the allegation made, inform the health board and/or the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims to provide protection for persons reporting child abuse.  The amendment I propose is designed to implement the recommendations of the Murphy report referred to in paragraphs 3.5, 6.8 and 6.9 of the recommendations of that report.  If we pass the Bill without incorporating this provision we will effectively reject the recommendations of the Murphy report about which <Col N="950" /> there has been so much publicity and in respect of which there has been agreement on all sides.</P>
    <P>I attended the Oireachtas committee which discussed the report with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on the day it was made available.  I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that this Bill is a vehicle to provide for this essential protection for those who report child abuse.  It is primarily a protection for children.  It is about ensuring that where children are being abused, allegations of abuse are taken seriously and those who may be abusers cannot use the legal system to frighten off people who seek to protect children at risk.</P>
    <P>The Murphy report was categorical in its view that part of the difficulty in the context of the swimming clubs and the association dealing with the complaints made to them derived from the threats of writs.  There were many other problems in the way in which parents who made complaints were dealt with.  However, we should legislate for this part of the problem.  Never again should a parent whose child is participating in a sports club, who suspects the child is being abused and who reports that suspected abuse to the committee of the club or the sport's governing body be threatened with the possibility of writs and court proceedings to deter them from pressing the complaint.  It is the duty of the House to ensure that never happens again.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that in the last week before the summer recess the House has an opportunity to give a stamp of approval to the Murphy report's recommendations by incorporating this section in the Bill.  The section also has the additional effect that if the governing body of a sport or the relevant committee of a sports club receives a complaint which it determines to have a basis it is in a position to suspend the person against whom the complaint has been made without being threatened with civil action.</P>
    <P>The provision does not envisage that the committee or governing body should conduct a full and final investigation into the allegation.  I accept the Murphy report's recommendations that it is not appropriate for them to do so because they do not have the expertise.  However, it is appropriate that they make a finding as to whether there is a basis for the allegation made and, if so, that they refer the matter to a health board and the Garda.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will accept this amendment and, having exchanged cross words on the previous amendments, we can join across the floor and incorporate this provision in the Bill.  If we do so we will have done a good day's work in addressing issues of immediate concern which have been so sadly highlighted in the context of the many children who suffered at the hands of swimming coaches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We were shocked by the appalling revelations of the independent inquiry and I appreciate Deputy Shatter's motivation in proposing this amendment.  However, much of what <Col N="951" /> the Deputy says makes the case for the Government's approach to the Bill.  Why would any parent report a suspicion of abuse to the chairman of a football or youth club rather than to the health board or the Garda?  We are trying to put in place a comprehensive structure so that we can have effective reporting of child abuse and the reports are brought directly to the attention of the statutory agencies involved.  We are trying to improve the protocols, procedures and regulations governing this type of reporting.  If the swimming debacle showed anything, it showed that the system broke down because reports made by parents were not acted upon by the swimming authorities.  It is for that reason we feel very strongly that any individual who has a suspicion, be it a parent or a member of a committee, should report it to the relevant statutory authority, namely the Garda Síochána or the health board.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that arising from the publication of the Murphy report the Government decided on a number of actions.  The report has been submitted for urgent consideration by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  This committee had already been considering the matter of the protection of children in sport.  The first meeting of that committee was held on Friday, 26 June and the lessons to be learned from this important report and the practical implementation of its recommendations for all sports clubs are being examined.  The Government decisions on these matters were taken on 12 June.  I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill already encompass the concerns of the swimming inquiry as expressed in recommendation 6.8 of the report: &ldquo;that consideration should be given to the provision of statutory immunity to protect persons who in good faith complain of possible abuse of children&rdquo;.  I am satisfied that that principal recommendation in the report is covered by the amendment we introduced to Deputy Shatter's original proposal, which he accepted.  His main concern was with the fact that we were designating child care managers only, and the part of the debate that took place on that day was about that.  Why were all the concerns he now raises not brought up then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been extremely conscious of the need to channel reports to the most appropriate agency with all appropriate speed.  That is why I brought in my amendments to the Bill as originally proposed.  We are most anxious to encourage the general public to report any concerns to the statutory agencies competent to deal with such reports.  They are the health boards and the Garda Síochána.  We do not welcome or want excessive third or fourth party involvement of persons who have no training or expertise in that area.  That was essentially the problem in the swimming association.  What Deputy Shatter is now asking is that we should impose on volunteers, ordinary parents who are involved in sports <Col N="952" /> clubs, a quasi-judicial function to sit in judgment and decide whether or not to report.</P>

      <P>The Minister might tell the House where in this report it is suggested that immunity from civil liability for the making of such complaints should apply only where the complaint is made to a health board or to a member of the <Col N="954" /> Garda Síochána.  I can tell the Minister the answer to that.  It is nowhere.  If a child is being sexually abused by a coach, are the parents to be told to tell the health board or the Garda Síochána but to keep it secret from the committee that employs the coach and, while the Garda take a few weeks to investigate the matter, leave the coach to abuse other children and that the committee should take no action whatever?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the implications and the foolishness of what he is saying?  Is he aware that he is doing more than simply protecting the bailiwick of the Department of Health and the structural perceptions of the Department?  If my child were being abused by a football or swimming coach and I reported it to the Eastern Health Board, how speedily would somebody investigate that, not just to protect my child but to protect all the other children in the club?  The Minister might answer in the context of a reply to a Dáil Question as recently as June 1998 in which we were told that at the end of December last there were 379 reports of child abuse made to the Eastern Health Board that have not yet been investigated.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister of State any perception of what he is at?  Has he asked Dr. Murphy if that is what he meant?  It was the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation who appointed Dr. Murphy to carry out his investigation and produce his report.  Has the Minister of State asked Dr. Murphy whether what he is now doing meets his recommendation?  Does the action he is now taking in this House accord with the views of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and other members of Government?  Has the Minister of State requested the Cabinet's agreement to jettison the recommendations of the Murphy report, an extraordinarily serious step for a Minister of State in the Department of Health and Children to take?</P>

      <P>I respect Deputy Shatter's intention in tabling this amendment but I do not agree with the approach.  A more considered approach is needed to recent events as well as to the Murphy report.  There is immediate and widespread concern about this issue but it is not necessarily a good idea to come up with immediate responses, and it strikes me that this is a knee-jerk response. There is an element of mandating people to report.  We have had that debate to some extent but it needs further consideration.  Why should these provisions apply only to sporting organisations? Surely they would apply to youth organisations or private educational establishments, for example.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State said, a Dáil committee is examining the recommendations of the Murphy report and I look forward to those recommendations being implemented at an early stage.  That is a more appropriate approach to take than including some of them under this Bill, however well intentioned the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this issue we should make it as easy as possible for parents and children to report incidents of child sexual abuse. We should not put barriers in the way of children or parents reporting such incidents.  If the abuse occurs when children are attending a sports event or are involved in a club, the people to whom they would like to report the incident may be committee members or coaches.  If those people then take action and report what has been told to them, they should be absolutely sure that the reporting of the complaint is privileged.  That is vitally important.  That is what the report recommended when it stated that a complainant should be assured that the reporting of such a complaint is privileged and, accordingly, will not be defamatory unless it is made with malice.  The report also states that consideration should be given to the provision of statutory immunity to protect persons who in good faith complain of possible sexual abuse of children.</P>
      <P>We must do everything possible to make it easy for people to report and to ensure the complaints are taken seriously when they are reported.  While I accept the health boards and the statutory agencies are the more formal bodies to which complaints can be reported and dealt with satisfactorily, currently there are long waiting lists.  That raises questions about delays in action being taken once the complaint has been made in the setting where it occurred, as happened in the particular cases currently under investigation.  We should remove the barriers and make it easy for people to take action.</P>
      <P>People are concerned that their complaints might be seen as malicious &mdash; I have come across that many times in schools &mdash; and that prevents them reporting incidents of abuse.  The result is that they err on the side of passivity and do not take action.  We should give protection to people who hear about these complaints and who report them in good faith.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed there is not all-party support for the amendment on this side of the House.  We should reduce barriers and make it easier for people to report by giving them the legal protection proposed in Deputy Shatter's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately there will be more barriers and I do not understand why the Deputies cannot see that.  If someone immediately reports the incident to the Garda or the health board, there is nothing to stop the club involved from immediately suspending the coach on foot of that report.  That is the normal procedure.  However, Deputy Shatter is trying to set up a second tier in that the governing body or the committee of a club would be given responsibility to convene a meeting of the club, determine if there are grounds for the complaint, advise the complainant thereof, perhaps suspend the person involved and then decide whether they should go to the health board or the Garda to make a complaint.  Why put that onus on volunteers in a sports club when it would be more appropriate to <Col N="956" /> go immediately to the Garda or to the health board?  Deputy Shatter is putting up major barriers by the approach taken in his amendment. There is nothing to stop a club imposing an immediate suspension as a result of a report to the Garda.  I assure the Deputy that the Garda and the health boards&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will tell the club &mdash; the Garda or the complainant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;will immediately investigate such complaints, particularly in the light of what has happened.  The Deputy must understand that the real problem in the swimming case was that the complaints were made to the governing body but the governing body failed to report them to the Garda or to the health board.</P>
      <P>Our approach is simple.  We want to create a culture where people are empowered, if they have any suspicion of abuse, to go to the statutory agencies who have been given the responsibility to examine those reports and deal with them effectively.  As I said in this House on a number of occasions, we want to put the best and most efficient set of procedures in place which involves more resources so that there can be an immediate response to those reports.</P>
      <P>Murphy said that consideration should be given to the provision of statutory immunity to protect persons but the report states that qualified privilege protects the person making the complaint. The report did not say that the provision of statutory immunity was mandatory.  I am satisfied that the people Deputy Shatter is trying to protect are already protected in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's approach is beyond comprehension.  I am extremely angry at the way he is dealing with this matter.  I wonder if his colleagues understand the implication of what he is doing &mdash; I am not sure he does.</P>
      <P>I want to give the lie to what the Minister of State has said.  This proposal does not create any additional barriers.  If a child is being abused by a coach in a sports club, under this legislation there is nothing to stop the parent going directly to a designated officer in a health board or to a member of the Garda Síochána.  This amendment does not prevent a parent from making a decision to do that and for the Minister of State to suggest otherwise is not just mischievous but dishonest.</P>
      <P>It is most regrettable that the Minister has adopted an obscurantist and deliberately mischievous approach.  He is not dealing honestly with the Murphy report which applies to swimming in the context of putting structures in place to ensure clubs deal correctly and responsibly with allegations of abuse.  The recommendations it makes could apply equally to other clubs.  Paragraph 3.5 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a complaint of sexual abuse is made <Col N="957" /> [to a swimming club] the committee, in the first instance, should deal with the complaint in an expeditious manner.  If there is, in the opinion of the committee, no grounds for the complaint, they should so inform the complainant. If the committee finds that there are grounds for the complaint they should inform the IASA Child Protection Officer and the Health Board and/or the Gardai.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6.7 states:</P>
    <P>Any complaint of whatever kind made to the Branch or to the Association in relation to child abuse, particularly sexual abuse, should be taken seriously and acted on as a matter of urgency.  It should not be dealt with on the basis of the complaints procedure at present.</P>
    <P>There is also a recommendation on the provision of statutory immunity.</P>
    <P>If my child was abused in a sports club I would regard myself as having a number of responsibilities.  The first would be to report the matter to the Garda.  Of equal importance would be to report it to the health board, but I would be very sceptical of the capacity of the Eastern Health Board to respond with any degree of speed.  Six months later it might investigate the complaint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more than 400 cases outstanding that have not been investigated, and the Minister is aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>All cases are investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not.  There is a list and somebody decides what should be given priority without first visiting families.  That is what happens in practice.  If I made a complaint to the Garda it would conduct an investigation, which it would regard as confidential.  It would not immediately report the entire episode to the committee of the club involved.  It would try to interview the person against whom the complaint was made and see if there was medical evidence that a child had been abused.  It could take the Garda many weeks to make real progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My third obligation would be to tell the committee of the club that my child had been abused. As the law stands, if I did that, I would be at risk of being civilly sued by the coach against whom I made the allegation.  As Murphy reported, the coach might threaten the committee if it relayed <Col N="958" /> that information to anybody else that it might be injuncted.</P>
    <P>Murphy makes very clear recommendations. The Minister did not answer the question I asked. Did he contact Roderick Murphy to find out whether he agrees with this amendment?  He did not, and he does not know whether he agrees with it.  If the Minister looks at the report he will know he is misrepresenting it and narrowing the scope of the recommendation.  He is seeking to deprive parents of an immunity to which they are entitled if their children are abused in a sporting club and they want to report it to the committee of the club.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Minister is a disgrace.  It is dishonest to suggest he is implementing the Murphy recommendations.  I am astonished that within two weeks of publication of the report key recommendations in it are rejected by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the first line in paragraph 6.8 he will see how wrong he is.  It states: &ldquo;A complainant should be assured that the reporting of such a complaint is privileged.  ..&rdquo;. Can it be more simple and straightforward than that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is related to the next sentence which deals with the implementation of immunity.  That is not a separate privilege that has been invented suddenly.  The privilege derives from the immunity that is recommended should be enacted into law, as contained in the second sentence of that paragraph.  Excessive legalism in dealing with a practical issue to confuse what is contained in this report is a disgrace.  It sticks in my craw to hear Deputy Shortall tell the House that this amendment is precipitate, that we should not implement Dr. Murphy's recommendations with speed, that we should do what we always do with reports, let them gather dust, primarily on the shelves of the Department of Health and Children.  We did so with the Kilkenny incest report and the Kelly Fitzgerald report.  Most of the recommendations in those reports have not been implemented.  Deputy Shortall recommends that the Murphy report should equally gather dust.  It can be deliberated on <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation which does not have expertise on child protection issues.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that the terms of reference contained in the resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on the 7th of October, 1997 and by Seanad Éireann on the 8th of October, 1997 under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979 be amended as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  By the deletion from paragraph A.5 of the words &ldquo;committed on or after the 20th June, 1985.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>2.  By the addition of the following paragraphs after paragraph D:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;E The Tribunal shall, in addition to the matters referred to in paragraphs A(1) to A(5) hereof, inquire urgently into and report to the Clerk of the Dáil and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit, in relation to the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
      <P>1.  Whether any substantial payments were made or benefits provided, directly or indirectly, to Mr. Raphael Burke which may, in the opinion of the Sole Member of the Tribunal, amount to corruption or involve attempts to influence or compromise the disinterested performance of public duties or were made or provided in circumstances which may give rise to a reasonable inference that the motive for making or receiving such payments was improperly connected with any public office or position held by Mr. Raphael Burke, whether as Minister, Minister of State or elected representative;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  Whether, in return for or in connection with such payments or benefits, Mr. Raphael Burke did any act or made any decision while holding any such public office or position which was intended to confer any benefit on any person or entity making a payment or provided a benefit referred to in paragraph 1 above, on any other person or entity, <Col N="962" /> or procured or directed any other person to do such an act or make such a decision.</P>
    <P>And that the Tribunal be requested to conduct its Inquiries in the following manner to the extent that it may do so consistent with the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998:</P>
    <P>(i) To carry out such preliminary investigations in private as it thinks fit (using all the powers conferred on it under the Acts), in order to determine whether sufficient evidence exists in relation to any of the matters referred to in paragraphs E1 and E2 above to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry in relation to such matters;</P>
    <P>(ii) To inquire fully into all matters referred to in paragraphs E1 and E2 in relation to which such evidence may be found to exist;</P>
    <P>(iii) In relation to any matters where the Tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry, to report that fact to the Clerk of the Dáil and to report in such a manner as the Tribunal thinks appropriate on the steps taken by the Tribunal to determine what evidence, if any, existed and the Clerk of the Dáil shall thereupon communicate the Tribunal's report in full to the Dáil;</P>
    <P>(iv) To report on an interim basis to the Clerk of the Dáil on the following matters:</P>
    <P>the number of parties then represented</P>
    <P>before the Tribunal;</P>
    <P>the progress which has been made in the hearing and the work of the Tribunal;</P>
    <P>the likely duration (so far as that may be capable of being estimated at that time) of the Tribunal proceedings;</P>
    <P>any other matters which the Tribunal believes should be drawn to the attention of the Clerk of the Dáil at that stage (including any matter relating to the terms of reference);</P>
    <P>and to furnish such further interim reports as the Tribunal may consider necessary.</P>
    <P>F And that the Sole Member of the Tribunal should be informed that it is the desire of the House that:</P>
    <P>(a) the Inquiry into the matters referred to in paragraph E hereof be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest date consistent with a fair examination of the said matters, and</P>
    <P>(b) all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the Inquiry should, so far as is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those individuals.</P>
    <P>G And that the Clerk of the Dáil shall on receipt of any Report from the Tribunal <Col N="963" /> arrange to have it laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas immediately on its receipt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Pursuant to resolutions in both Houses of the Oireachtas in October 1997, a tribunal of inquiry, with Mr. Justice Feargus M. Flood of the High Court as its sole member, was set up to inquire into certain planning matters.  The motion before the House today amends the terms of reference of that tribunal in two principal respects.</P>
    <P>The motion provides for the amendment to the original terms of reference of the tribunal sought by Judge Flood in his interim report to the House of 26 February 1998.  It extends the remit of the tribunal to enable it to inquire into all substantial payments made or benefits provided, directly or indirectly for whatever purpose or with whatever motive, to Mr. Raphael Burke, the former Minister, Minister of State, Dáil Deputy and county councillor.  This implements fully the commitment of the Government given by the Taoiseach in this House on 3 June 1998.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998, Mr. Justice Flood has consented to the proposed amendment following consultation with the Attorney General on my behalf.  The text of the resolution before the House today is the result of detailed and extensive consultations between Mr. Justice Flood, the Attorney General and their staffs.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has given its consent in accordance with the Act.  The formal consent has been laid before the House and copies are available for Deputies.  In relation to the first amendment, the formal request by the tribunal laid before the House yesterday and referred to in today's Order Paper has been superseded by a later document incorporating a legally technical amendment as agreed between the tribunal and the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The original terms of reference of the Flood tribunal provided for the fullest possible investigation of the propriety from the viewpoint of the planning system of the payment which Mr. Burke himself acknowledged receiving from Mr. Gogarty, and indeed any other payment to him that might have been connected in any way with the operation of the planning system.  As soon as the Government had grounds for believing that Mr. Burke had received at least one other large contribution, notwithstanding his statement in this House last September, we determined that this and any other substantial contributions or benefits received by Mr. Burke should also be investigated to establish if there was anything untoward relating to the purpose or motives of the donor in making such a payment or of Mr. Burke in soliciting, receiving or rewarding it. Having determined that an investigation should take place, the options open to the Government were threefold: to set up a new tribunal of inquiry or to request one of the two existing tribunals to take it on.</P>
    <P>In the course of considering the most appropriate <Col N="964" /> option, the Attorney General consulted with both the judges in charge of the existing tribunals. It became clear fairly quickly that the best course was to extend the remit of the Flood tribunal as it was already examining at least one payment made to Mr. Burke and that judge was agreeable and satisfied that it did not create undue problems.  On behalf of the Government, I formally place on the record our thanks to Mr. Justice Flood for agreeing to widen the remit of the tribunal in the manner proposed, particularly given the already heavy workload of the tribunal and the demanding task with which it has been charged.</P>
    <P>It is very important that neither I, in introducing the motion, nor any other Member in speaking on it, should be seen in any way as preempting the work of the tribunal in relation to the matters in question.  Therefore, I do not intend to comment directly on the allegations which have led to today's resolution.</P>
    <P>That there is general agreement among all parties in this House that Mr. Burke's activities should be judicially investigated shows general concern with ensuring that the integrity of our democratic system, and of the politicians who hold positions of trust under it, is not only upheld but seen to be upheld.  I believe that this can be achieved in the present instance by having an independent tribunal inquire thoroughly into the allegations which have been made concerning payments to Mr. Burke.  It is also important that Mr. Burke's rights to justice and a fair hearing are protected.  The tribunal procedure will ensure that fair procedures are applied and the principles of justice upheld while ensuring that the public interest is served in arriving at the truth of these matters.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McCracken stated quite clearly in his report on his inquiries into the Dunnes payments that it is unacceptable for any Member of the Oireachtas to receive large personal gifts and went on to refer to the potential for bribery and corruption.  Speaking in the context of large sums of money, he also said that if politicians are to give effective service to all their constituents or to all citizens, they must not be under a financial obligation to some constituents or some citizens only.  The Taoiseach speaking in this House on 3 June last made it clear he fully subscribes to these views.  In doing so he spoke for the whole Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>It is entirely inappropriate for any politician to solicit or accept on a personal basis substantial payments or benefits.  Acceptance of such payments is open to the interpretation, however ill-founded this may be in any particular case, that the donor expected or the recipient provided some benefit.  This is especially true in the case of an office holder and applies to local elected representatives, whose decisions on development plans can add considerably to the value of land, as much as it does to Ministers or Deputies.  For these reasons, it is at least as much in the interests of my party as any other to ensure that the tribunal <Col N="965" /> clears up the circumstances of these payments.  I can say categorically that Mr. Justice Flood and his team will continue to have the fullest possible co-operation from the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>We should also not lose sight of the fact that as a result of consensus and co-operation among all parties we have imposed legislative constraints which should go a long way in guarding against any repetition of the type of activities now being inquired into.  Under the Electoral Act, 1997, political parties and members of each House of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament are, since 15 May 1997, required to furnish a donation statement each year indicating whether a donation exceeding the relevant threshold was received during the preceding year and giving particulars of any such donation.  Following an election, candidates not elected must furnish a similar statement in relation to donations received by them at the election.  The disclosure threshold for a political party is £4,000 and for individual members and candidates it is £500.  I think it important to say that this new disclosure regime was supported by all parties in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the only part of the Act which was &mdash; let the Minister remember that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  It was the most important part of the Act.  The new procedures on political donations introduce transparency into the system of funding of political parties and candidates for election.  We must be vigilant in ensuring that these procedures operate effectively both in our own interests in defending our integrity as elected representatives and in the wider public interest of safeguarding the integrity of the democratic system.</P>
      <P>Another significant step in ensuring high standards in public life and underpinning public confidence is the Government's commitment, already announced by the Taoiseach, to establish a permanent commission on standards in public office. This would have a wide ranging mandate to investigate allegations of misconduct in public office by all elected representatives and officials.  Proposals in that regard are being considered by the Government at present and I expect them to be welcomed in this House.  While the tribunals currently under way and those which have completed their work are doing and have done commendable work, it is questionable whether setting up <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals is the most effective way of dealing with allegations which are made with increasing regularity and which can have a corrosive effect if not dealt with promptly and decisively.  Apart from anything else, it places great demands on the Judiciary at a time when the courts system is at full stretch.  The House will have an opportunity to debate this wider issue when my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, brings forward his proposals.</P>

    <P>The extended terms of reference before the <Col N="966" /> House are extremely comprehensive in relation to any payments or benefits given to Mr. Burke and show beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Government is determined to have all the allegations in this respect fully investigated and the truth laid bare for all to see.  In the first place the tribunal will have to establish whether any substantial payments were made or benefits provided directly or indirectly to Mr. Burke during his political career.  If there were such payments, then it will have to decide on the motives of the benefactors &mdash; whether they were corrupt or intended to influence matters improperly.  Furthermore, it must decide if the payments were made in circumstances which may give rise to a reasonable inference that the motive for making or receiving the payments was inappropriately connected with any public office held by Mr. Burke, not only as a Minister or Minister of State but also as a Dáil Deputy or county councillor.  Then, in addition to the foregoing, the tribunal must decide whether, in return for any payments, Mr. Burke did anything directly or indirectly while holding any public office which was intended to benefit the donor or indeed anybody else who may be connected in any way.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone could deny that these terms of reference are quite exhaustive and should enable the tribunal investigate all relevant aspects of the payments that have been mentioned or any others not yet mentioned, if there are any.  It is in the interests of every Member of this House that the tribunal be able to report definitively on all matters that have given rise to concern in this case.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we are all concerned that the Tribunal should have terms of reference which are well focused and ensure that its time is not wasted on investigating irrelevant matters.  The tribunal therefore will have to form a judgment on whether any particular payment or benefit warrants investigation.  I am confident this discretion will enable it to carry out its work in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
    <P>These are the core provisions of the addition to the terms of reference of the planning tribunal but provision is also made for the way in which the tribunal is to carry out its work.  These provisions are similar to those which apply to the tribunal's existing mandate.  The tribunal will carry out its preliminary investigations in private in order to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry.  Should the tribunal find there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a fully public inquiry, it must report this to the Clerk of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is a requirement that the tribunal provide an interim report to the Dáil on the new matters referred to it, indicating in relation to them the number of parties represented, progress to date, the likely duration of the proceedings and any other matters which it believes should be brought to the attention of the Dáil.  The latter may include views on the terms of reference.  In <Col N="967" /> this respect, I assure the House that, if the tribunal in the course of its deliberations becomes aware of any deficiencies or unintended constraints in the terms of reference, the Government will do whatever is necessary to ensure the inquiry fully achieves its objectives.</P>
    <P>The other amendment in today's motion grants in full Mr. Justice Flood's request to enable him to consider matters included in the original terms of reference which had arisen prior to 20 June 1985.  This is the date of the local elections held before the making of the payment to Mr. Burke by Mr. Gogarty.  It was inserted in the original terms of reference and accepted by all sides of the House as a reasonable timeframe within which the tribunal should operate.  It was certainly not intended to limit the effective discharge of the tribunal's work.  In his interim report of 26 February 1998, Mr. Justice Flood stated he was advised that evidence in relation to matters which occurred prior to 20 June 1985 is admissible if and in so far as it is relevant to matters which occurred subsequent to that date.  However, he stated that the fact that such a date is specified may give rise to a legal challenge which would inevitably delay the proceedings of the tribunal in relation to such matters.  Notwithstanding the advice and to avoid any such legal challenge the tribunal sought the deletion of the words &ldquo;committed on or after the 20 June 1985&rdquo;.  When the terms of reference were debated in this House last October, I said in relation to paragraph 5 that if these did not prove effective I would be happy to come back to the House to make the necessary amendments.  I am happy, therefore, to return to the House to propose the requested amendment.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I have a particular concern in relation to the integrity of the planning system, which is much too important to tolerate any hint of corruption or impropriety.  Great demands are placed on the planning system to support our economic development both in processing planning permission applications and in adopting development plans and zoning land for specific uses.  We must be sure that all these decisions are taken on the basis of proper planning and development considerations.  Planning decisions can affect the value of land and benefit landowners enormously.  On the other hand, ill-considered zoning can lead to increased costs to the taxpayer for infrastructural services and to poor quality living environments where people are cut off from everyday services.</P>
    <P>In my year as Minister for the Environment and Local Government, planning policy has been a major priority for me.  I have instituted the most comprehensive review of the planning code since it was introduced in 1963.  Following extensive public consultation, my Department has reached an advanced stage in developing proposals for reforming and modernising the Planning Acts to meet current and future needs.  It is my aim to <Col N="968" /> bring a comprehensive Planning Bill before this House at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned to increase the effectiveness of the planning system and to ensure that planning decisions are made in good time.  In this context, there is a resolution before both Houses of the Oireachtas to enable me to increase the number of board members of An Bord Pleanála by three so that the board can deal more effectively with the continuing strong upward trend in the volume of planning appeals.  Last week, the House passed the Urban Renewal Bill, 1998, to provide for the renewal of run down urban areas by means of integrated area plans.</P>
    <P>I am very aware that all of this work will be for nought if the public does not have confidence that the planning system operates in a fair and open manner for the overall public good.  I believe that the great majority of elected representatives and officials operate the planning system honestly and diligently and deserve to have confidence in the system vindicated.  It is to be hoped that the thorough inquiry being carried out by Judge Flood will achieve this result.</P>
    <P>While this latter amendment could have been made after the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1998, was enacted in May, prudence dictated that it should not be proceeded with until the means of investigating the matter of other payments to Mr. Burke which had by then come into the public domain was decided on.  In the event, it was clearly better to avoid making two separate resolutions amending the terms of the reference.  I commend the resolution and the amended terms of reference to the House.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note that about a quarter of the Minister's rather bland and low key speech was devoted to matters other than those central to the tribunal and the change in the terms of reference.  This motion to amend the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal is the latest incident in a long running saga.</P>
      <P>This House adopted the original terms of reference on 7 October last.  Those terms of reference were argued over for a week before they came before the House and had been redrafted 12 times.  During the debate in the House, the Minister accepted six amendments which I put forward, one of which was in a form slightly modified by him.  During a week of argument and twelve drafts of these terms of reference, the Government refused point blank to include the name of Mr. Burke.  Now, nine months later, this motion specifically names him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At various times during those nine months, in connection with this tribunal and the Moriarty tribunal, the Government asserted it was not possible to change the terms of reference of a tribunal once it had been set up.  Following a request from the chairman of this tribunal, the Government finally accepted that the terms of reference could and should be changed, but opted for legislation rather than a simpler method.  The Government <Col N="969" /> agreed that the terms of reference could be changed at the request of a sole member of the tribunal.  It has now agreed that the terms of reference can be changed in a way which was apparently not requested by the chairman of the tribunal, but one with which I agree.  There has been a major change in the Government's position following a long, acrimonious argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have done all of this last October.  There has been comprehensive consultation between the Attorney General and the Flood tribunal on the amendments to the terms of reference.  This motion is the outcome of those consultations.  At various times in the past nine months, including during the debate on the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence)(Amendment) Act, 1998, the Government said it would be wrong for it to hold any consultations with the tribunal chairman as this would infringe the judicial independence of the tribunal, yet we now have an amendment to the terms of reference which has been the subject of comprehensive consultation between the Attorney General and the Flood tribunal.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the original terms of reference on 7 October last, I said:</P>
      <P>The Government has been hugely damaged by what has happened over recent weeks.  It has been damaged by the way the Taoiseach handled this affair and by the hesitation and vacillation shown by the Tánaiste in dealing with it.  The forced resignation of a Minister after a lengthy period of controversy can only damage a Government.  The Taoiseach's judgment is in question because that period of controversy was lengthened by his failure to take the kind of action demanded and needed some time ago.</P>
      <P>Nothing has changed.  The Government has learned nothing about handling an affair of this kind.  That is not to say that the Government, this House and the public have not learned some interesting facts in the meantime.  We have learned that Mr. Burke's statement to this House on 10 September last omitted many facts which were material to the concerns which this tribunal was set up to investigate.  We learned that in September, people in the Fianna Fáil Party and at least one Member of this House who is a former treasurer of the party &mdash; he has that in common with the Taoiseach &mdash; were in a position to know that the picture painted by Mr. Burke in his statement on 10 September was seriously deficient and incomplete.  They appear to have said nothing about this until recently.</P>
      <P>The Minister made some interesting points in this connection.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as the Government had grounds for believing that Mr. Burke had received at least one other large contribution, notwithstanding <Col N="970" /> his statement in this House last September, we determined that this and any other substantial contributions or benefits received by Mr. Burke should also be investigated..</P>
    <P>I take this with a grain of salt as they received that information some time ago, a long time before we saw these proposals for a change to the terms of reference of the tribunal.  We have also learned since last October that the Taoiseach was advised in advance to be cautious about the appointment of Mr. Burke to the Cabinet.  He did not tell the Tánaiste about this at the time and he revealed certain matters to her only in March of this year.</P>
    <P>We have learned that the account given by Mr. Burke to his party and this House of donations he received in 1989 was woefully incomplete.  We have learned that people in positions of trust in the Fianna Fáil Party were unhappy in 1989 because they knew, on the basis of discrepancies between what Mr. Burke told them and what they learned from those who had donated money to the party, that something was seriously amiss.</P>
    <P>We deduce from what has emerged in the past few months that no substantial action was taken to remedy those concerns or to follow up the discrepancies which appeared.  A form of collective amnesia seems to have gripped those in authority in Fianna Fáil until the many questions left unanswered by Mr. Burke were probed and teased out in this House and the media.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, &ldquo;I can say categorically that Judge Flood and his team will continue to have the fullest possible co-operation from the Fianna Fáil Party&rdquo;.  Continue from when?  Certainly not from last October or last March, which is fairly recent.  I welcome their conversion.  In my more biblical moments, I recall there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than ten just men who do not need repentance.  There must be joy somewhere today.  This demonstration of that view by the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party is long overdue.</P>
    <P>We have learned other things since last October.  We have learned that the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy John Bruton, was perfectly right, and displayed his customary foresight, in raising questions about donations made to Mr. Burke and the possibility of links between those donations and acts carried out by Mr. Burke in his former ministerial capacity.  Those questions raised by Deputy Bruton incurred the wrath of the Independent newspapers group, which indulged in a bout of vituperation of unprecedented ferocity.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;following a comprehensive consultation between the Attorney General and the Flood tribunal.  I bet my bottom dollar we will not have a vituperative editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> tomorrow morning.</P>
      <P>On 7 October last, in connection with Mr. Burke's resignation, the Taoiseach spoke of &ldquo;.  .. the persistent hounding of an honourable man to resign his important position on the basis of innuendo and unproven allegations&rdquo;.  He talked about this man having been &ldquo;harried and hounded&rdquo;.  On the same day, during the debate on these terms of reference, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government stated, &ldquo;What we have seen is an infinitely clever erosion of a reputation based not on upfront accusation and production of evidence but on instalments of venom&rdquo;.  He went on to state:</P>
      <P>What we have witnessed in the recent weeks is the feeding of prejudice against an individual.  At no stage has enough evidence been offered to justify that steady feeding of prejudice.</P>
      <P>Later in that debate the Minister spoke of &ldquo;malicious, unjustified rumours&rdquo;.  The matters about which the Minister complained on that day are the reason two paragraphs are now being inserted in the terms of reference of the tribunal which specifically name Mr. Burke, whom the Government refused to name last October&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in spite of what had taken place prior to that and in spite of advice given to the Taoiseach by a predecessor.</P>
      <P>Perhaps by now the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have learned to weigh their words more carefully and to satisfy themselves more fully and more diligently on the basis for statements that they make in this House.  They are, after all, the people who have been obliged, on the basis of what has been revealed to them and to the public since then, to insert paragraphs E (1) and (2) into the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the substance of the proposed amendment to the terms of reference.  I will deal first with a technical point about the form of the amendment.  I understand it is proposed to add the new paragraphs E, F and G after paragraph D of the existing terms of reference. Paragraph G in the amendment before us is identical to paragraph D in the original terms of reference.  Therefore, we should delete paragraph D of the original terms of reference, and insert new paragraphs D, E and F, corresponding to E, F and G in the present resolution.  That would effectively move paragraph D of the current terms of reference to the end of the amended terms of reference, and have the same effect as <Col N="972" /> paragraph G in the proposal before us and paragraph D in the original terms of reference.  It is not necessary to include this provision twice in the amended terms of reference.</P>
    <P>There are some differences in detail between the drafting of the provisions it is now proposed to insert in the terms of reference and the analogous provisions included in the original terms of reference.  The specification contained under paragraph E of the proposed terms of reference on how the tribunal should go about its work does not specifically refer to seeking discovery of documents, files and papers.  I am satisfied, however, the provisions already contained in the 1921 Act and in the legislation passed between 1979 and 1998 give the tribunal the powers and instruments necessary to carry out its work.</P>
    <P>Paragraph E(1) of the proposed amendment to the terms of reference contains the first explicit reference to Mr. Burke.  This is being inserted after the phrase &ldquo;comprehensive consultation between the Attorney General and the Flood Tribunal&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister for the Environment and Local Government would now confirm he has changed his mind on the statement which he made in the debate on the original terms of reference on 7 October last.  On that day, he stated:</P>
    <P>The inclusion by name of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, former Deputy Burke, in that context would inevitably create guilt by association.  This would be grossly unfair and would infringe on the basic rights of such an individual.  It would also indicate an abandonment of fair-mindedness on the part of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>There was no basis for that statement last October and the Government admits that today. This is a remarkable about-turn by the Government and serves only to underline how badly this affair was mishandled by the Government last year.</P>
    <P>The paragraph to which I have referred is very broad in scope.  It considers the actions of Mr. Burke in any public office or position, whether as Minister, Minister of State or elected representative.  It covers the entire scope of his activities as a county councillor, a Deputy and a Minister. Similar considerations apply to paragraph E(2) in the proposed amendment to the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Paragraph E(1) contains a reference to payments made or benefits provided.  It states:</P>
    <P>.which may, in the opinion of the sole member of the Tribunal, amount to corruption or involve attempts to influence or compromise the disinterested performance of public duties or were made or provided in circumstances which may give rise to a reasonable inference that the motive for making or receiving such payments was improperly connected with any public office or position held by Mr Raphael Burke, whether as Minister, Minister of State or elected representative;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> It has been represented to me that the insertion of the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the sole member of the Tribunal&rdquo; ensures the judge can screen out allegations which have no evidence to back them or which may be frivolous or vexatious.  That is fine; I am sure the learned judge needs no lessons in that regard.  On the other hand, I am happy that, at my insistence, the current terms of reference and the proposed amendment provide that, where the tribunal finds there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry, that finding, and the reasons for it, will be reported to the Clerk of the Dáil, that report will include a statement on the steps taken by the tribunal to determine what evidence, if any, existed, and the Clerk of the Dáil shall communicate that report in full to the Dáil.  It is essential this House has full access to all the relevant information and considerations.  That was not what the Government originally proposed to us last October.</P>
    <P>Now that the Government has finally nerved itself to take this step in relation to the Flood tribunal, I wonder if there is any hope of a similar approach to the Moriarty tribunal.  Would the Attorney General now engage in comprehensive consultation with the Moriarty tribunal in relation to its present terms of reference?  Intensive consultations have been held with the chairman and sole member of the Flood tribunal and the sky has not fallen in, as the Government claimed for some time it might.</P>
    <P>I have read and reread all stages of the debate on the Tribunals of Enquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998.  Deputy Jim Higgins and other Members of the House repeatedly asked a series of questions during that debate.  They asked whether the names of the Ansbacher depositors would be revealed.  They asked what mechanism would be used to reveal those names.  They asked when we could expect the names to be revealed and if the people who deposited £38 million would be allowed to retain their cloak of anonymity.  Those questions were never answered.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform simply repeated the standard Government mantra on the issue.  He said the Revenue Commissioners would keep a close eye on the work of the tribunal and repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> that the Minister for Finance had said that if the Revenue Commissioners felt they required additional powers, they would be facilitated by the Minister for Finance.  He said that any issues arising would be issues between individual depositors and the Revenue Commissioners.  He failed to answer the question as to how the Revenue Commissioners could even think of approaching individual depositors unless those depositors were named.  He failed to answer the question as to how, by what means or when, individual depositors would be named for the Revenue Commissioners, if for nobody else.</P>
    <P>In the light of this constant repetition of the Government mantra, I have no confidence whatever that even the Revenue Commissioners can <Col N="974" /> be sure they will get the kind of information they require in order to investigate individual cases to determine whether tax evasion has taken place.</P>
    <P>The lessons from these two affairs are very clear.  The first is that on every occasion and in every connection in which the Government has been timorous, hesitant and reluctant in its approach to these investigations, the reasons it has given for a softly softly approach have been demonstrated to be without foundation.  The very fact that the Minister is proposing this amendment is proof of that.  The second lesson is that the clear wish expressed by the Opposition to have a full investigation and to have full information made available to this House has in every case been one which could be followed up.  The third lesson is that sooner or later the Government has on every occasion and in every respect been forced finally to agree to the reasonable wishes expressed by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>It is now time for the Government to apply these lessons to the work of the Moriarty tribunal in the same way it has been finally obliged to learn them in the case of the Flood tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than a little amusing to find that what we are seeking to do &mdash; indeed, what the Government and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government are inviting us to do &mdash; is what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance told us we could not do, i.e. change the terms of reference of a sitting tribunal of inquiry. Over the last six months this House has been, to borrow a phrase used by the Taoiseach, up every tree and down every avenue in relation to the Tribunals Acts.  They have been visited more often in the last six months than in the 60 or 70 years since their original enactment.  Thankfully, the Government has finally and belatedly conceded the points that the rest of us have argued all along &mdash; that this House must be able to change the terms of reference of a tribunal, which it has framed itself.</P>
      <P>My party's position from the beginning has been that the original tribunals legislation allowed the terms of reference of a tribunal to be amended by the Oireachtas.  We believe that not only did such a right exist but that such a mechanism was essential if we were to get to the bottom of the events of the last two decades which have sullied the name of politics and caused harm to the political institutions of this State and to the profession to which Members of this House belong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reread the contribution of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform during the debate on the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, defending the position originally adopted by the Government.  To say that the argument is less than convincing would be a gross understatement.  Neither can we say we are satisfied with the new legislation introduced by the Government.  My party believes that the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) <Col N="975" /> (Amendment) (No. 2) Act is inferior to the Bill published by the Leaders of the Opposition, supported by Opposition parties and moved by the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <P>The motion we are discussing today is possibly unique in the history of this House.  Despite the seriousness of the issues involved for the conduct of politics and the body politic, we are not entitled in this debate to amend the proposals before us.  I cannot think of any measure that has been debated in this House, either from the Government or Opposition benches, that could not be amended by the other side.  That particular scenario could have presented this House and the Government with an extraordinarily serious situation.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that there was consultation between the Government and Opposition Whips on the issue of the terms of reference before they came to the House this evening.  I also acknowledge, as spokesman for the Labour Party, that we are broadly satisfied with the amended terms of reference.  However, what would have happened had there not been agreement and had the Government decided on terms of reference with which the Opposition had grave difficulties? Would the Government have sought to ram amended terms of reference through the House without Opposition agreement?  That is certainly not a fantastical proposition.  In fact, over the last year this is the first occasion on which we on this side of the House can say we are broadly in support of a set of terms of reference emanating from the Government in relation to a tribunal of inquiry.  As Deputy Dukes said, on every previous occasion we sought to bring about amendments we were not satisfied.  However, had we not been satisfied with the measures before the House today we would, in effect, have been denied the right to debate this issue in the normal fashion, to identify our perceived difficulties with the proposed amendments and to seek to amend them.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House, we have always recognised that amending the terms of reference of a sitting tribunal would be problematic.  Our published Bill clearly recognises that fact.  However, we remain of the view &mdash; and I think it is an essential view for the maintenance of the authority of the House &mdash; that it is the right and responsibility of this House to determine the matters appropriate for inquiry by a tribunal.</P>
    <P>We remain dissatisfied that the agreement of the chairperson of a tribunal must be sought prior to a resolution being put to this House.  We have consistently argued that the process should be constructed the other way around, that this House should decide what is appropriate first and that the discussion should then take place with the chairperson.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduced in the House in recent months was simply to hide the nakedness of the Government in finding that its initial position on the amendability of the terms of reference was <Col N="976" /> not sustainable.  The Government has put this difficulty in our basic law and it is one that may well yet come back to haunt it.</P>

      <P>As I stated last night, Deputy Higgins's Bill gives us the opportunity to discuss the important issue of access to television coverage of major events.  I welcome the Minister's clear statement that access to major events will be protected and I look forward to the publication of the Government's proposals in this regard.</P>
      <P>An important and rapidly growing section of the media is the Internet.  It is true that it was not included in the terms of reference of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.  Perhaps that was for a good reason as it is wrong to put the Internet, which relies so heavily on telecommunications facilities, with traditional print and broadcast media.  This Bill refers to the provision of Internet services without any further definition.  While it is natural to think of the Internet in terms of other media, we should not forget that at present most Internet services in Ireland are provided by telephone lines through existing networks operated by Telecom Éireann.  The Internet is not a cable television system where programmes can be easily controlled.  It does not respect sovereignty and anyone with a small amount of know-how can access an Internet service provider anywhere in the world.  The operators are seldom more than a coded address and they do not have to identify themselves.  The Internet cannot be policed properly and that is a cause of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us agree with the European Union's directive on broadcasting and the section which attempts to constrain the cheque book television coverage of sporting events.  We are all aware of how important the enjoyment of sport is to professional and amateur sports people and to those who have not participated in a sporting activity. Only a small percentage of people are lucky or energetic enough to be able to attend these events.  The buzz of live sports is irreplaceable, but there are many who believe that it is possible to see more by watching an event, whether it is a golf tournament, a cycle race or a football, hurling or camogie match, on television.  Television coverage offers a greater number of angles on the <Col N="977" /> action and the viewer is able to be in more than one place at the same time, usually where and when the game is being won.</P>
    <P>We are all too sadly aware of the growth of cheque book sports coverage where huge media companies, usually those involved in satellite television, snap up television rights for the coverage of important sporting events which are then available only to the channel's subscribers.  Non-subscribing sports fans are left with few options. They may be compelled to be content with the 30 seconds of coverage in the nightly news broadcast, a snippet which brazenly brandishes the satellite company's logo in a corner of the screen. If that is not satisfactory, they may be forced to congregate outside the windows of television shops instead of watching it in the comfort of their homes.  There is also the option of going to the pubs or clubs which offer satellite television coverage as an enticement.</P>
    <P>These developments could have detrimental effects on the fabric of society and family life.  The days of the 1930s when one family in a parish owned a wireless and provided free hospitality to everyone on the day the county team played an important match are long gone.  There are other negative developments.  Existing broadcasters who have built up a unique bank of expertise in the coverage of a particular sport are often forced into a mad and insane decision to outbid the satellite television companies for the coverage of sporting events.  If they are successful, coverage of less popular, although no less important, sports is affected.  The arithmetic of profit and loss combined with the rise and fall of audience figures take the place of commonsense and fair play.</P>
    <P>We must not forget the important and often vital role that televised sports coverage has had on the development of individual sports and athletes.  Nick Faldo freely admits that his interest in golf was stimulated by watching the BBC's coverage of the game when he was a teenager.  Many other examples could be cited.  However, far more significant for society is the fact that those who watch sport on television enjoy it and get something from it.  They may not achieve international, national or local glory or take up football or golf, but they acquire a sense of well being and fulfilment by watching others compete and push themselves to the limit.</P>
    <P>So far we have been relatively untouched by the poaching of sporting events by satellite television companies.  Nevertheless, I am sure the Government is alive to the inherent dangers in these developments.  I welcome the intention of the Minister and the Government to introduce comprehensive and watertight legislation which takes into account all the possible loopholes and hidden traps into which hurried legislation, no matter how well intentioned, might fall.</P>
    <P>This Bill envisages the use of criminal sanctions to curb these practices should they raise their ugly head.  However, such sanctions would be difficult to enforce.  What type of effective sanctions could be used against organisations which are likely to <Col N="978" /> be based outside the State?  A more effective solution might involve a form of heavy financial penalty which would be imposed on any organisation seeking to unreasonably or unfairly restrict media access to a sporting event.</P>
    <P>The various forms of the media have made the world a smaller place.  Events, whether good or bad &mdash; sadly they are more often bad than good &mdash; are visible to us on our television screens. However, we must always remember that much of what matters and the news people want to hear and know about does not occur in a far off land seared by intractable conflict but in localities in our neighbourhoods.</P>
    <P>We must not lose sight of the valuable role played by the local media, especially in our own country.  Many of our local newspapers have been in business for over a century or longer.  Throughout our troubled past, they seldom failed to issue their newspapers each week.  These are a unique record of the events, local tragedies as well as events of national importance, which occurred in their respective areas.  They are a witness to the quiet revolutions which swept this country, such as the breaking up of the landed estates, the opening of local cinemas and the arrival of new technology such as the motor car and the radio. Some newspapers were fortunate to remain in the ownership of one family and, through pioneering proprietors and editors, they promoted a new outlook on life in their area.</P>
    <P>The concept of local in anything today, whether it is politics or the media, is often used pejoratively.  It is considered the antithesis of the global. Yet local newspapers have seldom closed their eyes to what was happening beyond their readership areas.  They recounted events of importance throughout the world and elsewhere in Ireland as well as carrying instructional pieces on local history, farming practice and practical health care.  All this was placed within the reach of anyone who could read and at a price which everyone could afford.</P>
    <P>The local press did not lose sight of the vast multitudes leaving their native place for distant shores.  We can still read in their pages the pride with which the exploits and feats of the native sons and daughters were recounted.  Furthermore, they acted as a unique window on home for many who had emigrated and who could read of events in their home parish, the triumphs or failures of their local football team or the death of a well known or long lived character in a locality.</P>
    <P>Many local newspapers have moved with the times, employing the most modern printing and reproduction machinery.  In the age of the Internet and the information superhighway, they are making a contribution to the rapidly changing world.  An increasing number of local newspapers maintain websites where readers, including latter day exiles, can download the newspapers and read about their home place regardless of how far away they may live.</P>
    <P>In my own county the publication of <i>The Anglo-Celt</i> began in 1846.  It has always enjoyed <Col N="979" /> a wide readership, not only in County Cavan but in counties Monaghan, Fermanagh and Meath. Since 1868 the paper has been in the hands of the O'Hanlon family and they have also supplied the newspaper's editors.  The O'Hanlons, through the medium of <i>The Anglo-Celt</i>, have helped to promote a wide range of issues and activities, particularly Gaelic games.  The unprecedented success of the GAA in Cavan and its neighbouring counties in due in no small measure to the support and coverage of <i>The Anglo-Celt</i> and the patronage of the O'Hanlon family.  No worthy story, no matter how local, has ever been unimportant for inclusion in the pages of the newspaper, available for many years for the price of one penny.  It is still an important bridge between Cavan and the wider world and many emigrants not only subscribed to it but contributed letters and articles. Today <i>The Anglo-Celt</i> still has readers in Cavan, neighbouring counties and throughout the world among the global community of Cavan people.</P>
    <P>A more recent addition to the world of local media is local radio.  There were many writing the obituaries of local radio in Ireland before it had started broadcasting, but today it provides an exciting and lively aspect of local life.  It has helped to stimulate interest in sports at local level and given air time to those events and people whose stories might otherwise go unheard.  It has concentrated the minds of the national broadcasters on the need for regional coverage.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Higgins on the publication of his Bill and I look forward to the Minister bringing forward effective legislation to regulate this complex area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate Deputy Higgins on introducing it.  I am concerned about the move towards pay per view for television coverage of major events.  The Minister raised the matter of access to these events. However, the first point that should be mentioned is the cost of television licences.  RTE can decide to increase the licence fee and the Government of the day usually accedes to its request. There is a good reason Governments in the past introduced a scheme of free television licences for certain categories, particularly the elderly and social welfare recipients.  That was a welcome move and I have always been told at election time that it has been of great benefit.  However, many people in the west have access to only two stations and it is difficult for those people, particularly retired emigrants, to accept that limited choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other categories of people should also have a free television licence.  I raised this matter in the past in respect of boards of management of schools who are required to pay a licence for a television which may be used for showing videos in schools which are not open 12 months of the year.  The same case could also be made for students, particularly members of the students' union in Galway, who wrote to me stating they <Col N="980" /> may have to get a licence for eight or nine months of the year.  They may have to change accommodation during that time but they are required to pay the full television licence.  I have raised this matter with the former Minister, Deputy Higgins, and the Minister for Education.  This matter should be resolved because it is fundamental to access to television coverage of major events.</P>
    <P>We started off with one satellite sports channel but there are now a number of sports channels with which RTE has to compete.  It has done very well in its coverage of soccer matches, the Olympic Games, athletics and the World Cup 1998, which we have been told may be the last free coverage of that event.  Access to coverage of it in the future will be on a pay per view basis. I would be very disappointed if that were to happen.</P>
    <P>We must be concerned about the major sponsorship involved in sporting events.  Vast amounts of money are available to participants, the organisers and the clubs involved.  Money can dictate the days on which sporting events take place and the times they are broadcast.  There is a large amount of money available from the corporate sector in this regard.  Megabucks are taking over these events and seats at them are being bought up.  It seems there cannot be a sporting event now without a corporate or a hospitality tent.  We have super Monday in the premier league and super Tuesday and RTE and the GAA are competing with that.  They have done very well in promoting the GAA games in hurling and football in the past few years.  Next Sunday RTE will broadcast two live games, the Munster football semi-final and the Leinster hurling final.  Great credit is due to the RTE and the GAA for organising that on the same day.</P>
    <P>There is great confusion in the west about the broadcasting of programmes.  We are waiting for applications for the deflector system to be decided by the regulator.  Those operating the MMDS system said they would provide access to multi-channels, but they have not been able to provide that service in all parts of the country. The price of that service may have been reduced and service providers may be spending more money on it, but as of now it is not successful. The satellite system is expensive and it is becoming more so because as well as viewers having to pay for the sports channel they have to pay for an extra fee for viewing a major event, such as the heavyweight boxing championship.</P>
    <P>Access to multi-channel television is available free of charge on the east coast because of a geographical accident, but people in the west have had to come up with systems, such as the deflector system, to provide that service.  Great credit is due to those involved in providing it.  Deputy Tom Gildea said, &ldquo;the Government made our wee system illegal&rdquo;, and he was elected to the House on that issue which must be resolved.</P>
    <P>I am taken aback that there is no <i>quid pro quo</i> in the sense that RTE programmes cannot be broadcast into Great Britain.  I have met members <Col N="981" /> of emigrant associations, particularly in Birmingham and the West Midlands, who told me they pay for a service in Britain to have Irish television programmes relayed and they are usually shown on a deferred basis.  Similarly Teilifís na Gaeilge is not available in parts of Northern Ireland, a matter the Government should address.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement states that we should cherish Irish people living abroad.  We could do that by ensuring our programmes are available through Teilifís na Gaeilge and RTE. Great credit is due to RTE for the promotion of Irish games and other games including rugby, soccer and athletics.  Recently when Irish, English and Welsh rugby teams travelled to the southern hemisphere, Sky Television took over the coverage of those games.  Viewers here are in a better position than American viewers.  I was in the United States a month ago and viewers there may have a quantity of channels, but they do not have great quality programmes.  They have merely game shows and vox pop programmes, but no serious discussion programmes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that TV3 will be on air in the autumn.  RTE has had the monopoly up to now, but TV3 will present it with a challenge and I hope it will take it up.  I hope TV3 will provide an opportunity for new faces and that it will have strong current affairs programme that will enhance our political process.  Above all it will add to the choice we deserve in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to compliment Deputy Higgins for bringing this Bill before the Dáil.  He had responsibility in the last Government for arts, culture and the Gaeltacht. He has a great understanding of the arts and is a man of great culture.  I understand why he brought this Bill before the Dáil and I am glad his leader, Deputy Quinn, has raised on the Order of Business on many occasions the problem of Sky Sports taking over coverage of major sports events in this and other countries.</P>
      <P>I was not a strong supporter of Teilifís na Gaeilge.  However, I compliment the people involved on getting Teilifís na Gaeilge up and running and on their interest in local matters.  For example, a few weeks ago Teilifís na Gaeilge televised the Gaeltacht football final in Donegal.  A school in Belmullet, St. Brendan's, won an all-Ireland competition and Teilifís na Gaeilge televised that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local radio is strong because RTE forgot about rural Ireland.  Its problem was that it geared itself towards the cities and it forgot there were other parts of the country.  In saying that, I am not being critical of RTE.  It did an excellent job over the years and broadcast some excellent programmes despite all the criticism.  The only criticism I would have of RTE and various Governments relates to the fact that for many years parts of the west could not receive RTE properly.  That is still the case in some instances.  We cannot get Network 2 in County Mayo.  Parts of the Gaeltacht area in County Mayo cannot get Teilifís na <Col N="982" /> Gaeilge, despite all the questions I tabled here, yet now we are talking about TV3.  At least people can get Sky television in part of the county, but the broadcasting companies let these people down and it is wrong.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the future RTE will be the national broadcasting agency on a regional basis so that there will be stations in the west, the south and the east.  People could then tune in for local news and events and return to the national scene. RTE made a mistake in not implementing that system for local radio.  It always thought it could hold its market share while the local radio people were out selling a product to which people responded.  Local radio has been well supported by the community because it broadcasts local events about which people want to hear, as well as national events.</P>
    <P>Local radio has done a wonderful job.  In my area, the listenership of Mid West Radio, under the leadership of Mr. Paul Claffey, is greater than that of RTE.  It is the top radio station in the country.  It is the first station people in my county switch on in the morning.  They listen to the news on local radio and they continue to listen all day. They switch over to RTE at certain times of the day but RTE has lost a market.  If, like the BBC, RTE had regionalised radio over the years, there would have been no need for local radio.  People could have listened to local programmes and returned to the national service at certain times of the day.  RTE did not do so and it did not compete.  It has lost a market which it will not get back because local radio will win out.</P>
    <P>With regard to coverage of arts and culture, on three Sunday nights recently I watched &ldquo;Amongst Women&rdquo; which was filmed in my constituency.  I compliment everybody who was involved in that splendid programme.  There was no dirt or filth and there was no need to broadcast it at 1 a.m. It was broadcast at 9 p.m. and I watched every episode.  It was wonderful to see Bertra Beach and villages in County Mayo and other parts of the country.  I was delighted to see many of my friends in it, such as Mr. John Mayock who is my good supporter.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of &ldquo;The Field&rdquo;, which was filmed at Leenane, although not by RTE, and &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo;.  Those are the kinds of films which I and other people like, yet RTE and BBC continue to broadcast violence every night.</P>
    <P>Despite what people say, the greatest influence on family life over the past 50 years &mdash; there have been many, such as the Internet, computers, landing people on the moon &mdash; must be television. Young kids watch television at dinner time, in the morning and in the evening.  They watch American and Australian programmes, such as &ldquo;Home and Away&rdquo; and &ldquo;Neighbours&rdquo;, and Irish programmes such as &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; and it has a great influence on them.  That is why it is important that we keep control of Irish airwaves.  It is fine to see Sky television available, but it must be controlled. The Government must be able to keep control of these stations.  They should not be allowed to <Col N="983" /> broadcast uncensored filth beamed from another country.  Something must be done in that regard in the near future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the deflector question, many people in the Dáil, Dublin and elsewhere could not understand why 1,000 people would turn up to a public meeting on this issue.  RTE was there to cover the story and it showed the people at a meeting in Westport.  The following Friday night there was a meeting in Claremorris.  This occurred over Easter and people had plenty of more important things to do on Good Friday.  On the following Sunday night another 1,000 people turned up in Ballinrobe.  People bothered to do that because for many years they could receive only RTE 1.  For a long time people could not even receive Network 2 in certain parts.  We listened to our comrades all over the country telling us how they were watching BBC, UTV and Channel 4 while we in the west could not receive those stations.</P>
    <P>Then there was a major debate about the award of licences.  If the cable people concerned who received exclusive licences &mdash; we now know why &mdash; had provided the signal where it was required in the early days, there would have been no disputes.  Ministers in two Governments introduced a regulator.  It annoys me that every day the Dáil gives away powers to people who are not answerable to anybody.  When that regulator was first asked to come before a Dáil committee she refused.  I do not know whether she has now come before the committee but she was to do so.  Such people have no responsibility to the Dáil.  In response to every second question I table in this House the Ceann Comhairle writes the next day that the Minister has no responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>People were annoyed that every Minister avoided the issue of television deflector systems. We now know why.  These people got exclusive licences accompanied by letters telling them that nobody else would get the franchise, there was millions of pounds to be made and they could go out and make it.  They became involved in the cable service because they thought they would also get the licences for local radio.  It is a good job that did not happen.  If one good thing came out of the Burke affair, it is that these people were scalded by the cable system and they were not quick to get involved in local radio.  That was great because it would have lead to a media monopoly, although one almost exists already.  That would not be good in a small country like this where people are influencing editors and telling them what they can and cannot put in newspapers.  Editors might say that does not happen but it does.  People should not be codded.  If one sells a £50 ticket to a person and if he wants a medical card or wants a Deputy to do something for him, he feels the Deputy owes him something. What if a person gave a Deputy £30,000, £50,000 or £100,000?  How would the person feel?  Would he not feel that he deserved a reward from the State?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> Some cynics in the media will ask why we should have deflector systems.  The deflector systems were set up and run by the community and nobody makes money out of them.  The general public have a service which they can afford.  They would have paid for it from the people who got the licences if they had provided the signal, but of course they did not bother doing that.  Now the company sees it may have a case and it may be able to sue the State for millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Perry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to turn now to sports, particularly the GAA, soccer and tennis.  I enjoy all kinds of sport.  I am not a GAA man, a soccer man, a tennis man or a golf man.  I do not play golf.  Many of my colleagues spend a great deal of time playing golf but I do not.  However, I enjoy sport and I would watch it on television at any hour of the day or night.  RTE is doing an excellent job in covering major sports events despite stiff competition from the BBC, UTV and Sky Television which are prepared to pay large sums to secure exclusive rights.  They should not be allowed to secure exclusive rights to the all-Ireland hurling and football finals and soccer internationals, control of which should be retained under legislation by the national station.</P>
      <P>Following the success of Michelle Smith-de Bruin in winning three Olympic gold medals &mdash; she is now the subject of much bad publicity which is undeserved &mdash; there was much talk about a 50-metre pool and the question was asked why the Government was not assisting sporting organisations.  How many footballers who played with English clubs and how many runners and cyclists who competed abroad and made much money have come back to this country to live rather than places like the Isle of Man?</P>
      <P>Sporting organisations are being supported by the taxpayer.  They are also being supported indirectly through the deployment of gardaí at major sporting events, although in some cases promoters are required to pay for this service. Despite this, many are critical when Ministers are at the airport to meet those who have won major honours.  Why should the Ministers, Deputies de Valera and McDaid, not be present to meet them?  The process begins with the local club for which Deputies Higgins and Perry and I make representations to secure national lottery funding.</P>
      <P>We have not done too badly as a small country. We have produced many fine footballers, athletes and swimmers who have done themselves, their families and their country proud.  I hope many more Olympic gold medals will be won.  I hate the knockers as they always knock politicians.  Many were critical when the Government gave the GAA £20 million recently.  I hope we will be in a position to spend much more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the national lottery was established by <Col N="985" /> Donal Creed many said it would not work.  It was envisaged that a major percentage of the proceeds would be devoted to sport but that is not the way it has turned out.  The money that has been allocated, however, has been spent wisely. One can point to many fine achievements throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I hope the Government will accept the Bill.  It would be wrong to allow people like Rupert Murdoch and millionaires like Tony O'Reilly to secure control of the airwaves. While RTE should be supported and assisted in every way possible, it has an obligation to viewers throughout the country, not just in Dublin.  It is beginning to realise that it made a fatal mistake in relation to radio broadcasting.  It will not make the same mistake in the case of television.</P>
    <P>The development of digital television will have major implications.  If people want to subscribe to Sky Television, so be it but there should be some control over what is beamed into people's homes. It would be wrong of the GAA and soccer clubs to sell exclusive rights to the BBC, UTV and Sky Television.  It would be a sad day if the people who support the GAA throughout the year could not watch the all-Ireland football and hurling finals on television.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Higgins on introducing this Bill which is designed to protect public right of access and diversity of ownership. The provision under which a ceiling of 25 per cent would be set is an excellent one.  When one considers what is happening in the retail sector where there has been an avalanche of multiples establishing here, it is critical that we ensure diversity of ownership of the media.  The development of Internet services, satellite and digital television will have major implications.</P>
      <P>There are major divisions between broadcasters with public service obligations and those whose primary aim is to maximise profits.  Perhaps the best medicine is to ensure public service broadcasters which put the public interest first and which are committed to sustaining a creative non-derivative production base are properly supported and funded.</P>
      <P>Television has a much greater impact than school in the education of children.  This presents a delicate problem.  In this context there is a need to preserve the role of public service broadcasters.  This cannot be done by extending the principle of universal services.  That would be a grave error.</P>
      <P>In the information society the protection of intellectual property rights holds the key to protecting employment and the profits of small and medium-sized companies and ultimately economic success.  Dominant global players do not always use their economic power to support the European audiovisual industry, particularly here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadcasting holds the key to promoting our culture, traditions and heritage.  It is the modern storyteller.  We must consider how future generations will learn about us.  We should be able to <Col N="986" /> depend on public service broadcasters to fulfil this role.  As Deputy Ring indicated, major films made here with the support of the taxpayer serve to promote the country and its scenic beauty.  This is worth millions of pounds in advertising.  I commend Deputy Higgins for commencing this process which has been continued by the Minister. Commercial television relies on cheap secondhand American imports at the expense of original European productions.  This will eventually cost them dear.</P>
    <P>Public service broadcasting holds the key to guaranteeing access to information.  The development of digital television heralds great changes and should allow full access to all programmes for all citizens but we are in danger of moving towards premium services and pay per view. National broadcasters should have the right to secure clips of major sporting events covered on this basis.  RTE should have an entitlement, for example, to secure clips of all matches involving Manchester United to be rebroadcast as soon as possible after the event.</P>
    <P>Free to air television is a thing of the past in the case of major sporting events.  At present, the cheque book syndrome holds sway.  Free to air broadcasting means that viewers should be able to watch major events on any channel and there will be major difficulties if this is removed.</P>
    <P>Television is an important medium in terms of information, education and entertainment.  Those words were used to launch the BBC and they are the principles by which other European public service broadcasters have stood.  Let us begin by defining public service broadcasting in the context of television.  Public service broadcasting is available to everyone, it offers a reference for our national and European identity, it ensures that a range of opinion is expressed in balanced debates and reports, it broadens the choice of programming and caters for all tastes and it is politically, editorially and financially independent.  Public service television represents the foundation stone of a healthy, interactive and democratic society. Television's power lies in its value as a common reference point for millions of people.</P>
    <P>Public service television's main role is to put quality first.  Commercial channels put their advertisers and shareholders first and that is where the major difference lies.  As in any business, competition is important.  While Ireland has benefited from its membership of the European Union, we must not be afraid of competition. RTE is doing an outstanding job in the production of home-based programmes and we must increase our efforts to sell such programmes on the European, US and world market.  We have imported many American television programmes in the past but it is time we began exporting our own.</P>
    <P>We should call on broadcasters to consider their role in respect of audio-visual creation, fostering new talent, setting aside broadcasting time for innovative programmes and enabling a network of independent producers to be maintained. <Col N="987" /> It is here that the Minister has played a major role because independent producers are the key to Ireland's future success.  We must use our third level institutions to promote, encourage and educate a new generation of independent producers. This will provide others with the incentive to follow in their footsteps.</P>
    <P>I call on broadcasting companies to broadcast programmes with a multicultural content which will promote a feeling of solidarity among people of different cultures.  That is extremely important. I call on the Minister to ensure the continuation of free to air transmission of major sporting, entertainment and scientific events of particular value and interest.  The legislation drawn up to deal with this area must confer on the Minister of the day the power to ensure that people's choice of programmes is not interfered with by monopolists intent on making them pay per view.</P>
    <P>A key element in the future development of an information society for all will be to ensure that the largest number of citizens are catered for.  In that context, let us consider the partnership between television producers and viewers.  Producers must realise that viewers are intelligent and that they demand to be well informed in terms of public debate.  Public broadcasters must be allowed to broadcast new digital material provided it is compatible with their remit and instructions to consumers in respect of decoder systems must be made public.  We must also recognise that certain measures may endanger the financing of television channels such as TnaG and TV3.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ring stated, the arrival of local radio was a great development.  This medium has created a new debate in terms of Irish culture and music and local radio stations attract massive audiences.  Despite the advent of pay per view television and major competition from across the globe, I believe Ireland can stand firm.  We have a strong television industry which was given great support by the previous Minister, Deputy Higgins, to whom great credit is due for raising arts and culture in Ireland to a new level.  The current Minister, Deputy de Valera, is doing a good job in the promotion and preservation of our culture.</P>
    <P>Given today's historic events in Northern Ireland, we now have a 32 county culture.  Deputy Ring referred to the regionalisation of television and in my opinion RTE could do more to develop and explore the production of programmes concerning culture throughout the regions.  Television represents a great way to tell stories and people are often enlightened by educational programmes as opposed to American imports.  In the past, RTE was obliged to import foreign programmes because of the costs involved in home production.  However, I believe viewers would not be overly critical of home produced programmes if they were made aware that these were being used to develop new skills in TV production and foster a new generation of producers and directors.  As already stated, local radio is well established and in the future we will see the <Col N="988" /> development of and major competition between regional television channels.</P>
    <P>Competition is very important in terms of the control of ownership of the media and the national press.  I accept that there is a 25 per cent threshold, but it is imperative that new competitors should be encouraged to enter the print and television media because it would be dangerous to allow a monopoly to develop.  I accept that we have a free press but it is important that people with a passion for development should be encouraged to enter this area, which has major potential for growth.</P>
    <P>Profitability is the bottom line in any business. However, to preserve our culture and encourage the growth of the industry, the Government must continue the process of subsidisation in terms of promotion and development.  Controls must be put in place to ensure that a monopoly does not develop in the media before the turn of the millennium.  As an example, let us consider the fact that we welcomed competition in the retail trade with the arrival of British multiples on the market.  While these multiples are not major players on the Irish scene, they are dominant in Europe and hold a monopoly there.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that our hard work and investment in the television industry is preserved in the future and that the country is not overrun by European multichannel stations.  Someone waving a cheque book should not be allowed to purchase exclusive rights to the All-Ireland hurling or football championships or the fleadh.  As with copyright legislation, we must ensure that the rights of people who are marginalised, who may not have access to multichannel television and who are happy to watch two channels are protected.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I look forward to the Minister's forthcoming visit to County Sligo.  She has shown great passion in the battle to preserve our culture.  The print media is the major area in respect of which she can take further action.  I compliment Deputy Michael D. Higgins on introducing this innovative Bill.  His efforts in this area are no surprise, given the major role he played as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in the previous Government.</P>
    <P>My predecessor, Ted Nealon, was one of the first Ministers given responsibility for arts and culture and he set high standards in that area.  I have no doubt that he will be delighted by the development of its role in our society.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of respect for Deputy Michael Higgins and the work he has done.  However, this Bill is a hurried attempt by the Labour Party to try to capture a few headlines <Col N="989" /> without adopting a constructive approach to the Government's proposal which will be put before the House in the autumn.  This is a missed opportunity to tackle some of the key issues facing broadcasting and the media in the decades ahead. Among those issues are digital television, increased competition for RTE and the impact of broadcasters from outside the country being allowed to hijack many of our major sporting and cultural events for pay per view television.  Legislation is required but it must be framed in a manner which addresses these issues.  It must not be presented with political motivations.</P>
      <P>We must take a detailed and unbiased look at the competition in the media market.  We cannot rush in with proposals which some Members would like to direct at one particular element of the media.  I may be correct in assuming they wish to target a successful man who they feel is not helpful to their political viewpoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill should not be about such an approach.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister's approach to the Bill. She has given an indication of her ideas with regard to RTE's request for a review of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 1993.  RTE wishes to develop a new company with a strategic partner to avail of the opportunities of digital television.  It considers that it must do so to face competition.  It will have to compete with an independent TnaG and the new TV3.</P>
      <P>The Minister's approach is common sense and practical.  I support her view that this Bill would be ineffective at this time.  All relevant details must be available before we proceed with legislation.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has requested the Competition and Mergers Review Group to look into matters related to this issue.  That report will take time to complete in view of the complex issues involved in the field of cross-ownership of the media and the format of modern broadcasting. There are issues about terrestrial rights, satellite rights, digital and analogue television, paid and unpaid viewing and concern about the rights of viewers in this age of rapid change.  This change parallels and is linked to the daily advances in computer technology.</P>
      <P>If we enact legislation to meet the challenges of the next century we cannot afford to take shortcuts.  The last comprehensive survey of broadcasting took place in 1960.  This indicates a need for new legislation but such legislation must be introduced for the right reasons.  We cannot use a Bill to settle old scores.  We should wait until there has been full consultation with interested parties and until such time as the review group has reported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>European law prohibits actions in member states that would deprive a substantial population of its traditional right to free television viewing of many national highlights under section 3(a) of Council Directive 89/552/EEC. This directive is often referred to as &ldquo;Television without Frontiers&rdquo;.  It has been introduced at an exciting time for the broadcast and print media.</P>
      <P>In the light of such developments we must ensure that public access and a right of complaint are acknowledged.  We need to consider new bodies to monitor standards in the broadcast and print media.  We should consider setting up an independent complaints commission which would allow viewers, listeners and readers to take complaints to an independent body.  There should be a body with definitive powers to punish those who infringe controls.  People may find they are badly treated by the media &mdash; I have been badly treated on one or two occasions.  They may find a particular story or photograph distasteful, they may regard a television or radio programme as unsuitable or they may find a subject is treated in an unfair manner or is misused solely for commercial or sales purposes.  People must have a mechanism of appeal against practices they consider objectionable.</P>
      <P>We cannot allow what happened with local television to happen again.  One group should not be allowed to control a service in any given area. This is a problem we must address in the home market and it is as important as ensuring that pay per view services controlled from outside the country cannot be allowed to dictate that the only way we will be able to watch the millennium all-Ireland finals will be by paying through the nose for the privilege.</P>
      <P>While implementing part of the EU directive we must be aware of the challenges to our networks from within the EU and from other sources.  The EU must use its power to address the monopoly that re-transmits from satellites. Satellite television and pay per view services have brought new and unwelcome developments to television and radio availability in Ireland.  There is an unacceptable hijacking of major sporting events by the pay per view services.  This is a threat to events from all-Ireland finals to local club matches in all sports.  Sky television controlled the rights to Ireland's recent rugby tour of South Africa.  This drove many people from their homes to pubs to watch the games.  In some cases Sky Sports 3 broadcasts were not received on MMDS services and people could not view the games live.</P>
      <P>The monopoly of major events by pay per view is the most disturbing development facing the industry.  The large British soccer clubs are selling their weekly games on satellite services.  Quite soon television viewing will be akin to a visit to a gaming arcade where one will have to pay more each time one wants to watch a major event.  This is nothing short of one armed bandit television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its essence the Bill seeks to define the ownership of the media and proposes to define <Col N="991" /> the limits of the cross-ownership of different media.  I agree that certain controls should be imposed and that limits of involvement would be dictated.  We must ensure that the monopoly of big interests does not gain control of the Irish media.</P>
    <P>We can look with pride on the outstanding growth of major and local Irish media companies. Dr. Tony O'Reilly's Independent Group is a shining example of an Irish company which has done well at a world level.  It has control of media groups in the US, South Africa, Britain and Australia.  We should admire its acquisitions.  Unfortunately, success seems to foster jealousy and unfounded suspicion.  I would not like to think that some among us would begrudge this or any other company its success.  Is it possible that the begrudgers believe that the many jobs generated by such successes are irrelevant?  Surely they cannot be so blind.</P>
    <P>The Independent Group's journalists are among the best in Europe and it is not given credit by some for having been at the forefront of exposing some of the major recent scandals in Irish society.  I would not like to think that those exposures would have been more acceptable coming from another source.</P>
    <P>The Crosbie family in Cork has been in the media business for over 150 years.  It has developed a national newspaper title of which we can be proud and which not only competes with the other national titles but surpasses them.  The Crosbies are expanding into other media and their expertise has helped to bring success to smaller operations serving provincial areas.</P>
    <P>Other successes include 96FM in Cork and 98FM and FM104 in Dublin.  Many small radio stations are thriving and expanding into other media.  The Irish media thrive on competition and with the right management and ownership structures will continue to grow and to create much needed employment.  In the current climate there are many success stories with much of the new broadcasting talent going into foreign markets. There are many media successes and, despite the fears of certain Members, the big guns of the global media are not controlling all the success generated.</P>
    <P>In recent times two capable young journalists set up the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> and sold a major stake in the business, yet they retain control of it. I do not think I have featured in that newspaper but it has been very successful over the past decade.  In Cork 96FM is the best example of a local station achieving great success in listener ratings, using quality and commercial yardsticks in presenting a product of which it can be proud.</P>
    <P>I agree that for any one company to have too great an interest in different media is dangerous and must be controlled.  Certainly, let us control and prevent monopolies, but let us not cap expansion wholesale.  Let us not lose the opportunity to tap the proven expertise that exists in the marketplace <Col N="992" /> and which can be of benefit to those coming into or developing a media product from a smaller base.</P>
    <P>There are many issues in radio and television which need examination at this point.  I am sure everyone here can think of some.  One that springs to mind is the large volume of uncontrolled pornography which is being unleashed on us day after day courtesy of Sky Television. Another increasingly common practice in national broadcasting of widespread use of foul language by certain journalists and radio broadcasters is to be deplored.  Some of these people may believe that this vulgarity makes them acceptable to the so-called &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; who are making a good hand of destroying Irish culture and values.  We must get the message across to them that we do not respect or admire profanity. When is it all going to stop?  I have no easy answer.  Fortunately, most of our broadcasters continue to observe the standards we expect from and admire in them.</P>
    <P>The intent of the legislation being prepared by Government is to ensure that no multinational could buy the exclusive rights to events such as national sporting fixtures.  If that happened viewers would have to pay for reception of certain fixtures such as hurling and football finals.  The public here have never had to pay any fee other than the annual television licence and it would not be greeted kindly by them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right to give priority to the needs of Irish viewers in line with the commitments given in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium.  She knows that now is the time to introduce new, comprehensive and well researched legislation.  She intends to engage in a process of widespread consultation with the various sectors of society.  It would be regrettable to see free sporting coverage lost to viewers, and possibly listeners, of the national station.  The public reaction would be hostile, and this I would understand and support.</P>
    <P>I re-emphasise my total support for the Minister in her approach to this Bill and I ask Deputy Higgins and the Labour Party to withdraw their Bill rather than forcing a vote on it and allow the Minister time to finish her consultations and deliberations and bring forward her own Bill in the autumn as she has promised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the debate that Deputy Higgins has widespread support for the principles underlying his Bill.  The Deputy has shown great interest in this area.  He initiated the Green Paper.  During his term as Minister he had much to say and did a reasonable amount of work in this area.  He deserves congratulations for that work and for bringing the Bill forward.  However, the Minister has done a considerable amount of work in this area since she came into office.  A variety of groups are working on the matter and the Minister is shortly to bring forward her own proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sport at any level affects us all, from those who <Col N="993" /> organise at community and club level to those involved at the highest level of competition nationally and internationally.  Players at these higher levels can become national heroes or villains, shared by us all in our conversations and stories.  The power of sport was highlighted last night when many people watched England and Argentina in the World Cup.  Most of us were cheering Argentina.  From about the third minute the English were the underdogs but they fought back.  Even though they lost, a fair number of people were cheering for them at the end and hoping they would win, purely because of the determination and grit they showed on the pitch. It was a great example of sport at its best.  People talked about heroes and villains.  I hope certain people are not made out to be villains.  The negative side of mass broadcasting and coverage of sport is that there always has to be somebody to blame after a game.  I hope that does not happen.</P>
    <P>Sports men and women are looked up to for their dedication and they inspire others to emulate their achievements.  The ability to participate in major events through the medium of television has become part of our culture.  Many of these events transcend sport and participation is a feature of social inclusion and of our own story as a country and as a community.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins that there are those who seek to regard such events as simply a commodity to be bought and sold in the marketplace, for whom these events have no more cultural significance than a tin of beans, to use the Deputy's words.  The exclusion of many from participation in such events through free television is unacceptable and will have significant repercussions in terms of social exclusion and fragmentation if measures are not taken to protect access for &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; broadcasters.</P>
    <P>However, it is not enough to put together a set of proposals and accuse anyone who might oppose them as being uncaring or too slow to act in the face of threats from transnational media conglomerates.  Any measures which might be taken will have to work and be able to withstand challenges at national and international level.  It is simply not sufficient to take the provisions of section 1 of Article 3a of the Television without Frontiers Directive and regurgitate them almost without change as a provision in Irish law.  The section is not mandatory.  It leaves the option open to member states to list events and to designate whether such events will be available on a live or deferred, whole or partial basis.  The article does not establish criteria.  This is left to individual member states.</P>
    <P>Any legislation which is produced in this area must clearly be seen to be in the public interest and it must be seen to balance the needs of the common good against the private interests which might be affected.  It can be argued that it is in the common good to ensure that everybody can obtain free access to every sporting event at every level if that is what they want.  We all know of course that this would cut no ice when defending <Col N="994" /> an action under such legislation in the courts. What would happen, for instance, if a broadcaster provided &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; coverage of a listed event under Deputy Higgins's Bill via satellite?  No subscription or &ldquo;pay per view&rdquo; fee would be necessary.  It could argued that a satellite signal would be available to the whole country.  However, in order to receive a signal, even if it were not encrypted, a person would have to invest in the necessary satellite dish or associated receiving equipment.  What would happen if a &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; broadcaster offered a clearly derisory amount to the organiser of the event listed under Deputy Higgins's Bill?  Would this organiser be forced to sell the broadcasting rights?  Many sporting bodies rely on the income from their premier events to fund activities such as training, coaching, the provision of facilities and the development of skills.  Perhaps the Deputy might deal with these questions in his response to the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny's idea that sporting bodies would be applying to be included in the list of designated events which would be drawn up under this legislation was interesting.  I am not sure whether Deputy Kenny has an expectation that there would be no limits to the Minister's powers to designate events as being of major importance to society or expects that broadcasters would be obliged to carry events which are listed.  Deputy Kenny mentioned that the game of bowling might be usefully included in the list of events designated as of major importance to society in Cork.  I have no doubt that this sport has its committed followers and practitioners. However, I am not aware of any transnational broadcaster rushing to sign coverage rights of the sport on a &ldquo;pay per view&rdquo; basis.  Perhaps this is why I am not the owner of an international media conglomerate.  I do not believe this is what Deputy Higgins has in mind, but this is an indication of how his proposals might be misinterpreted.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in her contribution to the debate, we must be sure of the objectives of any legislation which is brought forward.  We are dealing here, as indicated in the provision of the Television without Frontiers Directive, with events which go beyond the interests of the committed fan and which have a special resonance in society as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny mentioned that live English premiership soccer is now only available through BSkyB's subscription sports channels.  Many Irish people have a significant interest in the fortunes of English soccer clubs.  They are often rewarded for their pains by having to pay ever-increasing prices for the increasingly expensive merchandise associated with their chosen club.  We have to introduce a note of reality here.  They are English football clubs, some of them in private ownership and some public companies dealing with an English-based broadcaster.  The games are not protected under British legislation.  BSkyB has also secured exclusive coverage rights for live coverage of games in the lower divisions of <Col N="995" /> English soccer, and this is seen as a bad thing. The impression is that somehow we have been deprived of a right.</P>
    <P>I am not here to defend Mr. Murdoch but we must ask ourselves some questions.  How many premiership, former first division or second division matches were available on live television before the advent of satellite TV?  How many lower division matches were available?  How many matches are available at the top division, apart from the clashes of some of the bigger clubs which now generate mass audiences?  What have we actually been deprived of?  As a soccer supporter I can tell the House we have been deprived of very little.  We see far more soccer now, including lower division games, than we did in the past. In many ways satellite TV has helped football in that it has given lower division clubs greater access to a much wider audience.  If there was no satellite TV those clubs would lose out.</P>
    <P>I am not saying there is no cause for concern. There is a threat to the events of major importance if action is not taken.  More importantly, there is a threat to the basic concept of the provision of communications and information as a public service.  There is also a threat to social inclusion and our sense of community if it becomes no longer possible to share the experience of certain events together.  We must be realistic, however, in the type of event we want to protect if we are to produce strong and effective legislation.</P>
    <P>In his contribution, Deputy Bruton made some well considered remarks about the rights of the organisers of these events and these will have to be addressed in any proposed legislation which may be brought forward.  The criticisms of Deputy Carey and others with regard to the length of time it has taken the Minister to produce these important proposals ring hollow when one considers the same promises were made about comprehensive broadcasting legislation during the term of the previous Government which never materialised.  It is obviously better to wait until the Minister's proposals, which she has told us are at an advanced stage, are brought forward.</P>
    <P>Turning to the second part of Deputy Higgins's Bill, and probably the most important aspect, it is clear from the contributions from all sides of the House that he has raised an issue about which there is general concern.  Media analysts have taken on the role of interpreters of our society. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with that but it puts them in a position of considerable power and responsibility.</P>
    <P>Concentration of media ownership, whether it is in one particular sector or across different media sectors, justifiably raises concerns about the potential abuse of this powerful position.  This is a complex area involving freedom of speech, rights to information and to the functioning of the democratic process.  As late as yesterday the Tánaiste indicated that she hoped to bring in <Col N="996" /> legislation on media ownership after she has received the report of the expert group on implementing the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry.</P>
    <P>All sides of the House would agree that diversity and plurality of opinion in the media is important to the functioning of our democracy. However, as the Minister said in her contribution, the issues involved are complex and we should have the best advice available before we address them in legislation.  Accordingly, the matter should await consideration by the Tánaiste of the expert group's report.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of sport, one aspect that disturbed many people this year, including myself, was the feeling that they lost rugby when it was taken over by Sky Television.  If the GAA were to go down that road it would be an enormous loss.  The GAA is not just about a game, it is about Micheál Ó Muircheartaigh and others who comment on it.  The absence of personalities like that would be an enormous loss for Irish sport and culture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and the Deputies from all parties for their contributions on this legislation.  It is impressive in a political sense that there was perhaps only one objection to the principle of the Bill.  People made a criticism of the different means of achieving what is set out in the Bill, but if one is encouraged by that one is therefore profoundly disappointed by the fact that the Bill will not be allowed to pass the stage of principle &mdash; Second Stage &mdash; and go forward into committee where the amendments suggested from all sides of the House would be considered by me as the sponsor of the Bill.  I can assure Deputies of that and I appeal to them at this stage to consider the inconsistency of saying one is in favour of the Bill in every respect except that of detail, yet it must be killed off now.</P>
      <P>I have a difficulty also in accepting that the death of the Bill on Second Stage should happen at 8.30 p.m. when we have no sight of the Bill which is its substitute.  There seems to be a certain amount of confusion.  Is there to be separate legislation implementing Article 3(a), which is promised, or is there to be inclusive legislation on broadcasting in which the principles of this legislation will be enshrined?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is helpful in telling me there will be two separate pieces of legislation but if that is the case she will therefore implement only half of my Bill.  My Bill deals with two issues &mdash; implementing Article 3(a) of the 1989 <i>Television Sans Frontières</i> directive, and the issue of cross-ownership.  What then is the problem with accepting my Bill on Second Stage and implementing that first principle?  It simply does not make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to address some of the points that have <Col N="997" /> been made because I am genuinely grateful to Deputies from all sides of the House for the manner in which they contributed to the debate.  They emphasised an important point.  There is great unease at the idea that the communications system of a country or a people should be reduced to a relationship between markets.  That is what the decency at the base of all the contributions represents.  Yet I must emphasise that this is precisely what will happen.</P>
    <P>During the debate last night, people outside this House were watching the World Cup, the rights of which for the year 2002 and 2006 have already been bought by the Kirch company in Germany, with whom the European Broadcasting Union will have to deal if it is in turn to sell it back on a capacity of ability to pay to its participating members in the year 2006.  Under the market price, the international Olympics have decided to go with the European Broadcasting Union into the future.</P>
    <P>There is something very fundamental at stake here.  It is sometimes difficult for politicians to swim against the tide and say there is need for new re-regulation in matters of broadcasting and ownership of the media.  If that does not take place, it is clear what will happen.  Public service broadcasting is protected in the Ninth Protocol of the Amsterdam Treaty but other issues are included in that.  Citizens enthusiastic about Europe who speak to me know how the State was pushed aside, that we had regulators instead of State ownership and so on, but they do not know that cynically, politically and ideologically laden reasons were at the basis of the concentration of ownership directive that had been in draft by Commissioner Monti and which has been thrown in the bin by the European Commission.  There is now nothing to stop a complete handover of that matter in which the State used to be active to perhaps 15 or 20 major international conglomerates.  The European Commission has disgracefully abandoned any attempt at having a concentration of ownership directive.</P>
    <P>This legislation was drafted on the basis that communication was a public area, that it was more than a marketplace.  There were different phases in broadcasting.  For example, from the 1920s to the 1960s there was the rise of public service broadcasting; from the 1960s to the 1980s, the introduction of independent editorial competition of different kinds; the 1980s allowed the delivery of systems such as satellite and fibre-optics and the 1990s is the era of digitalisation.</P>
    <P>The issue facing us is a fundamental one.  Are we to say there will be no regulation whatsoever of the delivery of technology to communities? Some people may say they must listen to everybody in the world before making a decision.  The evidence is in front of people.  The suggestion that this Bill should be defeated on Second Stage on the basis of a Bill that does not exist will mean that between now and the introduction of that legislation, if ever, a whole new round of exclusive contracts will have been signed and it will be <Col N="998" /> too late to act at that stage.  People should be aware of what is happening in regard to this, which is more than a cultural matter.  Citizens are proud of people who excel in sports.  It is not that they play themselves, but they feel good about it. Is there to be a totally private market where people who pay belong and have significance? There is a changed relationship in terms of sport.</P>
    <P>I wish to reply to an erroneous point in the Minister's speech.  She dangerously and somewhat glibly accepted the suggestion that sporting organisations have an absolute right to regard television and radio coverage of events as a private right.  Clearly there are private rights to organise access to pictures and so on, but in regard to regulation of media coverage, that is between a public and a private right.  Let us not fudge the matter.  The issue is very simple.  Will Berthesmann, Kirch and Time Warner, or perhaps 20 other companies, decide what we will view?  Will we say, &ldquo;I have not listened to everybody on the Continent yet and, when I have, I will listen to everyone in the world before I make a decision&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Article 3a has been in existence since June 1997, the month I went out of office.  It is explicit and should be implemented.  The notion that the Government will not accept this legislation because it intends to introduce its own legislation is unacceptable.  I can help in that regard.  If legislation on digitalisation does not appear until later in the year, as I suspect, I will set about preparing legislation on that matter during the summer and early autumn and I will combine the two Bills.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to waste my time, but I will give the Minister an answer she might not like.  I was a member of two Governments, one of which involved her party, and I prepared a Green Paper on broadcasting followed by heads of legislation.  We then held the EU Presidency.  I have heard the Deputy's leader say occasionally that it is difficult to get legislation through Cabinet.  I agree that is difficult, but at least I had reached the stage of having the heads of legislation and a few months later a broadcasting Bill would have been published.</P>

      <P>There was a debate on the Green Paper on issues of communication and the marketplace and the contribution by the current Minister to that debate was pathetic.  She adopted a yahoo approach to the Green Paper and said that I as Minister was talking about complicated, abstract things such as the communication order and so on.  At that stage she was going around with her hand behind her left ear trying to find out if anybody had anything worrying to say.  Now she has her hand behind her right ear and she still cannot make up her mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> I will deal with the contributions to this debate other than the few pathetic statements made by the Minister.  The issue of ownership, dealt with in the second half of the legislation, is very important.  I listened to an interesting contribution to the effect that this legislation is aimed at one person and that it could be begrudgery.  I think Deputies are willing to accept my assurance that that is not the case.  When moving the legislation I drew a distinction between dominant position and abuse of dominant position.  I argued that a vibrant culture that is active, inclusive and participatory requires diversity of ownership to assure plurality of opinion.  That has resulted in good work in newspapers all over the world. Events surrounding Rupert Murdock, whom I used as an example, in terms of International News and his threatening attitudes are not in the interests of plurality of opinion.</P>
    <P>The public is entitled to more than the trust that there is a distinction between ownership and editorial and journalistic practice.  I argued for the second part of the Bill because the diversity and plurality of editorial opinion would create the best atmosphere in which the citizen and the profession of journalism would be best served.  There would be no concentration of ownership which would create the perception of the possibility of an abuse, which is extremely important.</P>
    <P>I would understand opposition to this legislation in favour of more inclusive legislation.  If the Minister tells me that her legislation will result in an international campaign to make the case for re-regulation, she will have my support in that, but that will not happen.  Not only will there be no campaign in Europe for re-regulation or for a future for public service broadcasting internationally, but there will be no broadcasting regulator.  The whole country is asking why there is no promise by Government in that regard to ensure at least parity between the technology and the content regulation, which would assure the diversity that is at the heart of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would accept opposition to the Bill in favour of a campaign on the ownership directive introduced by Commissioner Monti, but that is not what was offered.  Instead, the Minister said that important legislation is planned and will be introduced in the autumn, certainly before the winter.  The implication was that the decent thing for anyone else who is thinking about this matter is to get out of the way, lie down and wait for it <Col N="1000" /> to happen, but my answer to that is, no thanks. Those affected are the sporting interests, those interested in viewing sport as citizens within a communicative order &mdash; I use that term without apology.  Citizens communicate and consumers purchase.  If anybody finds that offensive I am sorry, but that is the reality.  That is the choice facing us internationally.</P>
      <P>In regard to curbs on ownership, the issue is whether that which is produced in a newspaper, film or piece of audio visual is a commodity like a bucket or a can of peas or beans, or whether it is something invested with a culture of significance which should be treated differently from commodity and competition.  There is a practical side to this.  If there is a vibrant assertion of the cultural aspect, we will gain jobs.  DG10 in the Commission calculated that by the year 2005 the European Union audio visual market will be the same size as that of the United States.  At present the world market in audio visual is about $176 billion. The growth will result almost entirely from pay television if things are left exactly as they are.  In those circumstances, it is calculated that 250,000 jobs will be created in this area in the United States rather than in Europe.</P>
      <P>As we lose diversity and our capacity for editorial plurality, we are being swamped by a message that is becoming more and more homogenised.  This becomes part of a general drift where we are passive consumers of other people's products, sending away the jobs that should be ours, a mix of public service and publishing jobs that should be created at home.  The answer, unfortunately, is that we must wait.  The generous thing for people to do, given that all Deputies said they found no flaw in principle in the Bill but only with the mechanism of its implementation, is to agree Second Stage and I will be open to any suggestions regarding implementation on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I thank all Deputies for the manner in which they contributed to this debate and I was very moved by some contributions because they reminded me in their very simple, honest way of a very old poem of Pablo Neruda about the United Fruit Company.  There are things that big conglomerates should not own and control and we should be free to communicate with each other.  It will be very sad if on the basis of Government partisanship this Bill is not allowed to pass Second Stage and it is killed without hearing a single case against it in principle over two weeks.  For those reasons, I appeal to Deputies, particularly Independents, to support the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Flood Tribunal Terms of Reference: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that the terms of reference contained in the resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on the 7th of October, 1997 and by Seanad Éireann on the 8th of October, 1997 under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979 be amended as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  By the deletion from paragraph A.5 of the words &ldquo;committed on or after the 20th June, 1985.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>2.  By the addition of the following paragraphs after paragraph D:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;E The Tribunal shall, in addition to the matters referred to in paragraphs A(1) to A(5) hereof, inquire urgently into and report to the Clerk of the Dáil and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit, in relation to the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    <P>1.  Whether any substantial payments were made or benefits provided, directly or indirectly, to Mr. Raphael Burke which may, in the opinion of the Sole Member of the Tribunal, amount to corruption or involve attempts to influence or compromise the disinterested performance of public duties or were made or provided in circumstances which may give rise to a reasonable inference that the motive for making or receiving such payments was improperly connected with any public office or position held by Mr. Raphael Burke, whether as Minister, Minister of State or elected representative;</P>
    <P>2.  Whether, in return for or in connection with such payments or benefits, Mr. Raphael Burke did any act or made any decision while holding any such public office or position which was intended to confer any benefit on any person or entity making a payment or provided a benefit referred to in paragraph 1 above, on any other person or entity, or procured or directed any other person to do such an act or make such a decision.</P>
    <P>And that the Tribunal be requested to conduct its Inquiries in the following manner to the extent that it may do so consistent with the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998:</P>
    <P>(i) To carry out such preliminary investigations in private as it thinks fit (using all the powers conferred on it under the Acts), in order to determine whether sufficient evidence exists in relation to any of the matters referred to in paragraphs E1 and E2 above to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry in relation to such matters;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> (ii) To inquire fully into all matters referred to in paragraphs E1 and E2 in relation to which such evidence may be found to exist;</P>
    <P>(iii) In relation to any matters where the Tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry, to report that fact to the Clerk of the Dáil and to report in such a manner as the Tribunal thinks appropriate on the steps taken by the Tribunal to determine what evidence, if any, existed and the Clerk of the Dáil shall thereupon communicate the Tribunal's report in full to the Dáil;</P>
    <P>(iv) To report on an interim basis to the Clerk of the Dáil on the following matters:</P>
    <P>the number of parties then represented before the Tribunal;</P>
    <P>the progress which has been made in the hearing and the work of the Tribunal;</P>
    <P>the likely duration (so far as that may be capable of being estimated at that time) of the Tribunal proceedings;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the initial part of my contribution I indicated to the House that in discussing these amended terms of reference we are doing something that the Government and two of its senior Ministers, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance, said could not be done.  It must be with some sense of embarrassment or at least some recognition of a wrong position that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government <Col N="1005" /> acknowledges that the position adopted by the Opposition, when the original debate took place, was correct.  Some of the sharpness with which the argument was put to downplay the Opposition's point of view must be seen now for what it was.</P>
      <P>Before the break I was turning to the details of the motion and had indicated that the Labour Party is broadly in agreement with the proposed amendments to the terms of reference.  There is a sense of vindication in the Labour Party that what we achieved in two legislative measures, namely, the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Electoral Act, which we steered through the last Dáil against some trenchant opposition, particularly from the parties in Government, was not only timely but necessary.</P>
      <P>The past couple of weeks have seen the two parties in Government desperately scrambling to catch up.  The Taoiseach has been to the fore in this unruly scramble.  Belatedly we welcome their coming on board.  I absolutely reject the comments made by some people in and about the time Mr. Burke resigned that he was being found guilty of breaches of a code of ethics then not in existence.  The actual statements put on the record by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have been re-read into the record this evening by Deputy Dukes.  There should be some acknowledgment that the position taken then was indefensible in the light of the facts we now know.</P>
      <P>The need for the two legislative measures introduced by the Labour Party has been more than apparent for some years and it was beholden on Government to ensure they were enacted, so that at least members of Government did not seek to take advantage of their absence.  At a late stage my party considered suggesting an amendment to the tribunal's terms of reference but ultimately chose not to do so because we felt the point was covered by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1997.  The need for that measure arose from the report of the McCracken tribunal when it emerged that, despite it being the tribunal's stated view that Mr. Charles Haughey had obstructed its work, there was no mechanism to allow it recoup some of the costs from him &mdash; the existing legislation only allowed individual parties to the tribunal to recover costs from one another.  On foot of that, Labour produced a Bill which was ultimately accepted by the Government, as a result of which it is now possible for a tribunal to recover costs from someone it has found to have obstructed or withheld information from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a pertinent point in light of the controversy which continues to surround payments to Mr. Ray Burke by Fitzwilton through Rennicks in 1989.  It is now established that Mr. Burke received money and the motion before us asks the Flood tribunal to establish whether there was any linkage between the receipt of this acknowledged payment and any other moneys, yet to be discovered, paid to Mr. Burke and any decision <Col N="1006" /> taken by him while a public representative, either as Minister, Deputy or county councillor.  This is right and proper, it is in the interest of the political system that this investigation take place, and it is my party's belief that the Flood tribunal is the appropriate forum for this inquiry and investigation to unfold.</P>
    <P>However, tribunals can only work effectively if they receive full co-operation from every individual and group with information which is of interest to them.  Judging by last weekend's newspapers, it appears still to be a source of dispute as to exactly which members of Fianna Fáil knew about the £30,000 payment to Mr. Burke.  This must also be a matter of investigation by the tribunal because it relates specifically to its capacity to perform its functions.  As a result of the 1997 Act, if any evidence of obstruction is unearthed on this occasion sanctions exist to deal with it.  I would welcome a comment from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, as he may be able to cast further light on the degree of knowledge available to officers of Fianna Fáil and when that knowledge became available to them.</P>
    <P>I will deviate slightly to make a further point about the misleading of this House last September by Mr. Burke.  The McCracken report referred to the House being misled by Deputy Lowry but despite that we as Members have put no procedures in place to deal with such matters. Unfortunately the Taoiseach does not seem to think it any of his business to correct the record of the House when information becomes available to him, so we as Members must do so ourselves.  We must look at the regulation of our affairs, a Cheann Comhairle, to ensure strict adherence to the long-held tradition of the veracity of any statement put on the record; and if anyone becomes aware that misleading or inaccurate information is put on the record, that the long-standing practice of correcting the record is strictly applied.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult period for all involved in politics.  Never before has our profession been subject to so much public suspicion and distrust, which has been magnified by the impression &mdash; an accurate one &mdash; that the Opposition has had to bully the Government into investigating this matter.  If the Minister wishes to dispute this point, I cite the Ansbacher accounts.  They should have been dealt with in the Moriarty tribunal and I put down an amendment to have the story behind them fully ventilated.  As of now, the true facts behind those accounts may never see the light of day and it is difficult to see how the Tánaiste's investigation of this issue will not encounter the same problems as her investigation into the NIB scandal.  This is entirely unsatisfactory and the veil of suspicion which currently extends over the body politic will not be lifted while the Government seeks to curtail full investigation of issues like the Ansbacher accounts.  I restate a challenge to the Minister to respond to this issue and to explain how it is to be fully ventilated.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently proposed new ethics <Col N="1007" /> legislation and the establishment of an ethics commission.  I welcome his party's conversion to the transparent regulation of politics.  Labour will support any positive and concrete measure put forward by the Government and will engage constructively with all parties in this House in refining such measures.  As a member of the Select Committee on Members' Interests I look forward to the Government's proposals in this regard, which will be looked on much more favourably than were our proposals by the Government parties when they were in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I hope that, sooner rather than later, we can put the scandals of recent years behind us.  The sitting tribunals and the motion before us are an integral part of that process but we have a long way to go before we restore public confidence in the conduct of our business.  That is the objective of this motion and for that reason Labour welcomes and supports it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no great purpose in this House debating the detail of the substantive issues in the motion, which are more appropriate to the tribunal of inquiry being presided over by Mr. Justice Flood.  Whether the taking of any substantial payment amounted to corruption is unlikely to be capable of being established in this House, so resort to the powers of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979, is regrettably necessary.  Similarly with the requirement to establish that such payments were an attempt to influence or compromise the disinterested performance of public duties.  In addition, paragraph 1 of today's motion is in response to Mr. Justice Flood's request that the date beyond which the investigation may not go &mdash; 20 June 1985 &mdash; be excised.</P>
      <P>However, there are two matters which cannot be left to the tribunal.  One concerns the import of the relevant conclusions of Mr. Justice McCracken in his report and the other the political implications of several fundamental questions which surround the Burke affair and its handling by the Taoiseach and his Government.  In his report, Mr. Justice McCracken concluded:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that there appears to have been no political impropriety involved, the Tribunal considers it quite unacceptable that Mr. Charles Haughey, or indeed any member of the Oireachtas, should receive personal gifts of this nature, particularly from prominent businessmen within the State.  It is even more unacceptable that Mr. Charles Haughey's whole lifestyle should be dependent upon such gifts, as would appear to be the case.  If such gifts were to be permissible, the potential for bribery and corruption would be enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If politicians are to give an effective service to all their constituents, or to all the citizens of the State, they must not be under a financial obligation to some constituents or some citizens <Col N="1008" /> only.  By allowing himself to be put in a position of dependency, Mr. Charles Haughey failed in his obligations to his constituents and to the citizens of this State, and indeed has devalued some of the undoubtedly valuable work which he did when in office.</P>
    <P>Paragraph No. 34 of the summary of conclusions states:</P>
    <P>It is quite unacceptable that a member of Dáil Éireann, and in particular a Cabinet Minister and Taoiseach, should be supported in his personal lifestyle by gifts made to him personally.  It is particularly unacceptable that such gifts should emanate from prominent businessmen within the State.  The possibility that political or financial favours could be sought in return for such gifts, or even be given without being sought, is very high, and if such gifts are permissible, they would inevitably lead in some cases to bribery and corruption.</P>
    <P>In other words, acceptance of substantial amounts of money by a Member of Dáil Éireann in these circumstances is wrong in itself and by definition exposes the recipient to being compromised.</P>
    <P>Many in this House will want to raise the distinction between substantial donations to a political party and similar donations to an individual politician.  However, in the Burke affair we do not know where the line is drawn between personal, political and party.  There is a view also represented in the House that it does not matter whether it is personal, political or party and that it is always improper.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the legislation we have enacted makes that argument redundant.  We now have a register requiring declaration of interests, caps on spending at election time and an obligation to declare financial contributions, either personally to the candidate or to the party, above specified limits.  These are as open and transparent arrangements as we are likely to be able to put in legislation.  That is not to say the law, in the passage of time and in the light of experience, will prove incapable of amendment.  For anyone determined to prove otherwise, it is impossible to absolutely protect against that situation in legislation.</P>
    <P>However, the problem as regards this motion is that this story has been characterised by contradictions and half-truths from the beginning.  We still do not know what moneys were intended for the Fianna Fáil Party, what moneys were intended for Mr. Burke and why.  Gradually, more information is extracted from a reluctant Government.  First, we were led to believe there was only one £30,000 donation, which involved £10,000 remitted to Fianna Fáil HQ and £7,000 to the local constituency.  This was the JMSE money, the existence of which was initially denied by the donor, according to that thorough investigator, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who, with the Taoiseach, forgot to ask the recipient if he had <Col N="1009" /> actually got the money.  Both Deputies Ahern then sat beside Mr. Burke as he led the Dáil to believe he remitted the above amounts to headquarters and constituency, respectively.</P>
    <P>However, we have since learned that whatever moneys were remitted, they were not from JMSE and that Mr. Burke's &ldquo;skills as a fundraiser&rdquo;, to quote the Taoiseach, were the subject of dispute in Fianna Fáil at that time.  Why did prominent Fianna Fáil officers confirm Mr. Burke's version of remitting £10,000 of the JMSE money to Fianna Fáil headquarters?  If there was pressure on Mr. Burke to hand over the Fitzwilton money in 1989, how could the Taoiseach not have uncovered the Fitzwilton-Rennicks money until the Fianna Fáil affidavit was being prepared for the tribunal in March this year?</P>
    <P>Who in Fianna Fáil authorised the issue of an invoice to Rennicks for £30,000 when only £10,000 was actually received by the party?  By now, the political story is so riven with contradictions and obfuscation that the handling of the Burke affair has become more important than Mr. Burke's own machinations.  It is now apparent why the Taoiseach got himself into hot water when the latest Burke story first broke.  He could not credibly answer obvious questions, because certain questions are not capable of being truthfully answered without the Taoiseach digging a hole for himself.</P>
    <P>The latest political actor to briefly show a leg from behind the arras is Deputy Fleming, the man who at all material times was the treasurer of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I expect Deputy Fleming will make a statement in the House tonight.  I hope he will be more forthcoming with the Dáil and with Mr. Justice Flood than he was with the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> when that newspaper put certain questions to him recently.  The issue of 21 June quoted the former Fianna Fáil fundraiser, Mr. Paul Kavanagh, as saying that Deputy Fleming, who issued the receipts for donations, was told of the £30,000 Fitzwilton-Rennicks payment to Mr. Burke.  The paper's account of its conversation with Deputy Fleming is as follows:</P>
    <P>When contacted, Fleming said the party discovered the details of the Rennicks' payment when served with an order for discovery by the Flood tribunal earlier this year.  When reminded that he was told of the payment in 1989 by Kavanagh, the Laois Offaly TD said that he would like a few hours to think about it.  He also declined to say whether he had informed any other senior party members in 1989 or later.</P>
    <P>He did not comment when asked whether Burke's statement in September last detailing a £30,000 payment from JMSE revived memories of the Rennicks contribution.  Fleming could not be reached on his mobile phone yesterday.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, so far, Deputy Fleming has only engaged in loud whispers off stage.  I do not know whether we can hope for a walk-on part in tonight's drama.  I wonder if the Taoiseach <Col N="1010" /> expects Deputy Fleming to act as a kind of <i>deus ex machina</i> to rescue him from a growing welter of contradictions.  Perhaps a statement from Deputy Fleming of what he knows will only dig the hole deeper for the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    <P>The most obvious question is why should the Taoiseach send an emissary to London to explore Mr. Burke's skills as a fundraiser and refuse to ask an adjacent colleague, Deputy Fleming, what he knew?  There was no need to go to London as Deputy Fleming could have told the Taoiseach whatever he wanted to know, assuming he wanted to know.  Even if the Taoiseach did not ask and did not know about the Rennicks money, why did Deputy Fleming sit on his hands when the Taoiseach was agonising about his Cabinet choices?</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming sat in this House while Mr. Burke led us to believe that the JMSE donation was exceptional.  In between, the Taoiseach gave dozens of interviews, comments and speeches about the rigorous investigations he had conducted into Mr. Burke's suitability for Cabinet.  Yet we are led to believe there was not one word from Deputy Fleming.  We may be doing Deputy Fleming an injustice.  He should come into the House and say if he remained silent.  Why did Deputy Fleming not contact the Taoiseach after any one of those interviews to remind him of the Rennicks money row?  How could an elected Fianna Fáil Deputy sit tight while his Taoiseach was struggling to explain rumours and allegations of financial chicanery in respect of his colleague, Mr. Burke?  If we are to believe Deputy Fleming held his silence during all this time, did the Taoiseach make contact with the Fianna Fáil backbencher since then and demand to have the gaps in his knowledge filled in?  After all the lengths to which the Taoiseach went in his investigations &mdash; being up every tree in North Dublin &mdash; would it not have been more convenient, more efficient and certainly more productive for him to have inquired from his colleague, Deputy Fleming? The Taoiseach should certainly have asked the recipient, Mr. Burke, about the matter.  Deputy Fleming could greatly reduce the tribunal's burden of work, and satisfy the demand for accountability from the electorate, by making a clear statement that would unravel the many contradictions, inaccuracies and inconsistencies we have heard to date from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Many good lines are written in the opening chapters of books, but one from the former Government press secretary, Mr. Seán Duignan &mdash; in One Spin on the Merry-go-round &mdash; is as good as one is likely to get.  From memory, it started and ended with the word &ldquo;Harry&rdquo;.  It is remarkable that the Government started and ended this political year with tribunals.  That must say something about the culture of the times in which we live or, as I and I am sure the Taoiseach would like to believe, the culture of the recent past, a legacy from which we are still cleaning up.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that so much time in this political <Col N="1011" /> year has been taken up on these questions. The political system is getting very little credit for the changes it has made in terms of legislative provisions which are extremely onerous compared with the duties in any other profession. While this kind of matter continues to seep out from under the door, we will not get credit for the changes we have made.  Deputies Dukes and Howlin correctly stated that when the Opposition tried to pre-empt some of this by calling for more open-ended terms of reference for the tribunal in the early days, the Government resisted it on the grounds that one could not change the terms of reference of a sitting tribunal.  As others have trawled that territory, I will not dwell on the matter except to say we have now established that is not the case.  I regret we were not a little more liberal in the change we made to the law a few weeks ago where, effectively, it must now be initiated by the Attorney General rather than this House because the tribunal is a creature of the House, established under the relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to drag over old sores, but one cannot but be struck by recent advertisements in the newspapers.  Every newspaper I read recently carries an extraordinary advertisement from Rennicks making it clear that it was no more than a conduit for the donation that is the subject of this motion and clearly exonerating itself.  It makes it as clear as possible to its majority shareholder that it had nothing to do with this and that it was merely a messenger boy in the matter.  That is interesting in the context of legitimate questions raised in the House some time ago.  I note there is also an advertisement in today's newspaper from the Irish Independent Group.  I am prepared to take the content of that advertisement at face value.  I have no reason to believe the chief executive, Mr. Liam Healy, is anything other than an honourable man.  I accept the position he sets out in that advertisement; if it is proven otherwise, we will deal with the matter then.</P>
    <P>However, the point cannot be missed that for a company that claims to want to give money to support the democratic process &mdash; it was stated that Fitzwilton wanted to support the democratic process, has done so continuously over the years and contributed to a number of parties &mdash; one cannot but be struck by the fact that in 1989 the only contribution was to one party in the House. One must also acknowledge that, at least from 15 May 1997, Waterford Glass &mdash; again a company that claims to contribute to a number of parties &mdash; contributed to only one party.  I mention this in the context of a front page story in last Sunday's <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> to the effect that this was a personal transfer of money from Tony O'Reilly to Fianna Fáil.  That should be recorded in the House and rebutted outside it, if that is possible.  The story in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> alleges that Mr. O'Reilly donated the money to Fianna Fáil through, on this occasion, Fitzwilton and, on the previous occasion, through Waterford Glass.  I merely put that on the record &mdash; I do <Col N="1012" /> not draw any conclusions from it.  However, I am waiting for evidence of support for the democratic process in the wider sense.  We also have evidence of a donation to support the candidature of the former President, Mrs. Mary Robinson, but that is still a rather restricted version of the democratic process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I might consider it, but I am raising a more important question which relates to the democratic process and the dominant position acquired by Dr. O'Reilly's newspaper group.  I note that on Question Time yesterday the Tánaiste committed herself to bringing forward legislation as soon as she receives the report from the mergers review group set up to consider this matter.  Members on all sides should pay attention to those conclusions.  The sun may be shining on the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and his party now, but that may not always be the case.  This is a legitimate question to raise in the House.</P>
      <P>Some of these questions will inevitably be the subject of inquiry at a tribunal.  It is not possible to establish them beyond doubt in this Chamber. It would be desirable if we could conduct some of these inquiries ourselves.  I do not know the extent to which we are progressing to being able to do that, but questions about another subsidiary company, Novum, availing of export credit insurance and a number of other matters that have come into the public domain in recent times should be inquired into.  They may, however, all be above board.</P>
      <P>The lesson that matters is the political one.  For whatever reason, the Taoiseach has been uncertain and unconvincing in his response to this crisis.  That is the note on which we are ending this political year.  The former leader of the Progressive Democrats, and somewhat less directly, the current leader and Tánaiste, have made it clear to Fianna Fáil that it is on its last chance. Those words send a shiver down the spines of all of us because of our rather insecure existence.  To say Fianna Fáil is on its last chance implies that the Progressive Democrats will do something if there is a recurrence of this matter.</P>
      <P>It is not a desirable departure from precedent that on this occasion the Government did not allow the Opposition any input into the terms of reference.  It is true that the Government Whip did show us an advance copy of the Government's version, but we really did not have any say in it.  Notwithstanding that, I accept that it seems a fair and honest effort to deal with the particular matter that has been raised.</P>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Howlin's remarks about the Ansbacher accounts because that is where we started the year.  The fact that we only permitted an inquiry into Ansbacher in so far as it relates to politicians is regrettable and what we have learned since about the banking institutions and tax evasion makes it doubly so.</P>

      <P>What we have here is another twist in a damage limitation exercise that has gone wrong.  It is disheartening to be back in the House on occasion after occasion, using up the time and resources of the Dáil, to explore yet another aspect of the operations of the largest political party in the State.  Fianna Fáil is not only the largest party, which is ultimately a matter for the electorate, but it is also in its private business the party which, uniquely for a generation, has operated an aggressive and proactive quasi-independent fundraising operation.</P>
      <P>The significance of this quasi-independent money raising machine is best appreciated by the information carried recently in a Sunday newspaper that the fundraising branch of Fianna Fáil is in a position to reward its chief executive to the tune of £70,000 per annum.  That £70,000 per annum salary for fundraising services, in what the Taoiseach in the debate in the House on 3 June referred to as &ldquo;our egalitarian democracy&rdquo;, gives us some inkling of the degree of interaction between Fianna Fáil and the various interests which do business with, or in, this State.</P>
      <P>I have spoken before in this House in fairly direct and forthright terms about the political culture that seems to have attached itself over the past generation to the largest political party in the State.  On 3 June, the Taoiseach himself referred to &ldquo;the unhealthy developments and controversies over party funding which have dogged the body politic for 30 years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach recently celebrated 21 years as a Member of this House and I congratulate him. It must be remarked, however, that the Taoiseach's political career has coincided with the worst of the 30 year period that he himself has identified and with two of the most prominent exponents of the art of &ldquo;embarrassingly good&rdquo; fundraising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us that he only became aware of the problems in late March 1998.  I, along with other Members of the House, find this very difficult to believe.  The Green Party was the only one to raise the question of the pick-me-up scheme.  There are so many contradictions here. When I spoke in the House on this issue I was interrupted by the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, who asked if I was not aware that churches, charities and sporting organisations all operated the pick-me-up scheme.  It would seem apparent to most, therefore, that the scheme was prevalent and used by everyone, but the Minister was trying to play it down.  That indicates that it has been in operation for such a long time that everyone knows about it.  Yet, the Taoiseach claims &mdash; and he repeated the Minister, Deputy McDaid's, line &mdash; that he only became aware of this in March 1998.  That is another inconsistency.  My colleague, Deputy <Col N="1014" /> Rabbitte, has highlighted others in that, apparently, Deputy Fleming was told by Mr. Kavanagh in 1989 of the Rennicks/Fitzwilton donation, yet the Taoiseach claims he was unaware of it.  We need to explore many areas in greater detail.</P>
    <P>I am not saying, nor have I said, that colleagues of mine in the House are necessarily corrupt because they belong to Fianna Fáil.  It would be regrettable if colleagues of mine in Fianna Fáil were to interpret my remarks in that way.  For 32 years the father of a colleague of mine in the Green Party was secretary of a local Fianna Fáil cumann.  That is the kind of person, a low profile individual committed to a particular value system, who has been most abused by what has been allowed to go on for so long in the upper echelons of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The rest of us have been tarnished in the process.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that to subscribe to the Fianna Fáil Party is to condone or participate in corruption.  What I am saying &mdash; and I base my remarks on impressions, experiences and observations during my time in public life, both at local and national level &mdash; is that a certain corrosive quality, which looks, smells and feels like corruption, appears to have come into being within the apparatus of the Fianna Fáil Party political machine over the past generation.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is the largest party in the land, although it is true to say that its popularity peaked over 20 years ago and it is now back at 1927 levels in terms of first preference votes. When something is amiss in the Fianna Fáil Party, the spillover in the perception of a great number of people affects everyone in public life.  Public representatives, including those who belong to that party, and the public itself deserve better than to have this unsettling cloud of the worst of Fianna Fáilism hanging over us.</P>
    <P>It is good that the Flood Tribunal was established at all, in spite of the opposition to it.  It would have been preferable to let McCracken take a root-and-branch approach, but be that as it may.  It is also good that the limits Fianna Fáil sought to place upon the Flood Tribunal will now to be lifted.  It seems apparent, if not obvious, that the Flood Tribunal has uncovered a volume of material worth investigating in the period before Mr. Burke's accession to the Chair of Dublin County Council for his unique double term of office.  Some of that is already in the public domain thanks to the efforts of one or two persistent journalists.</P>
    <P>It only stands to reason that the Garda Síochána would not have expended the resources it did in investigating the affairs of this one public representative had they not had real and substantive concerns.  I mean no disrespect to the Garda authorities when I say that &mdash; given the changed political climate in which we now live, relative to the early and mid-1970s &mdash; the same lines of inquiry in today's more open, questioning and sceptical environment might yield a more telling outcome.</P>
    <P>The era that the Flood Tribunal is now empowered to investigate, going back perhaps as far as <Col N="1015" /> 1973 or 1974, will never be regarded by historians as a high point in the continuing evolution of our political culture.  We have heard one tale of a building company that acquired a parcel of land from a patient in a mental hospital.  It built a substantial residence upon it, which came to be occupied by a person who was a local councillor, the son of a TD and who himself became a TD, a leading light in his party and a Minister.  The title deeds to the house were finally registered nearly 20 years after it was built.  In these circumstances, the remarkable thing &mdash; the dog that did not bark, as it were &mdash; may well be that at no stage in the process did money appear to change hands, but we do not know.  There are at least two versions of the story but the version we heard in this House, for all the drama of the telling, leaves many questions hanging in the air.  Perhaps the Flood Tribunal, if it sees fit and finds it relevant, may finally put that story to rest.  We shall see.</P>
    <P>The extension of the inquiry by dropping the essentially arbitrary date that Fianna Fáil sought to impose, with, of course, the acquiescence of the Progressive Democrats, will allow light to be shone into the darkness of an earlier era of golden circles and inside tracks where, before Greencore and JMB, there was Brennan &amp; McGowan and Oldpark Developments.</P>
    <P>As the sole member of the tribunal, Mr. Justice Flood is now to be charged with the responsibility and the resources to establish whether any decisions taken by this Government's first Minister for Foreign Affairs were prompted or distorted by payments he had received over a political career spanning almost a quarter of a century. The tribunal will investigate the &ldquo;ongoing controversies&rdquo;, of which the Taoiseach himself was aware at the time of his appointment to this Cabinet, which might connect the acceptance of financial donations by him with decisions on rezoning vast tracts of land in north County Dublin by Dublin County Council while Mr. Burke was in the Chair or was otherwise in a position to wield an influence in that assembly.</P>
    <P>It is not all about rezoning.  Let us recall that the issue on which Mr. Burke finally resigned from office and from this House concerned the sale of Irish passports in a scheme that is now discredited and which has been abolished.</P>
    <P>The background to this is the doubtful ethical base of much that occurred during various Fianna Fáil Administrations, of which Mr. Burke and the Taoiseach were part for over two decades.  On succeeding Mr. Haughey at the helm of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Albert Reynolds pledged to &ldquo;cleanse the Augean stables&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach has indicated a similar ambition.  I fear the job will be beyond the capacities of either of them, but perhaps Fianna Fáil has a Hercules poised and ready.</P>
    <P>On 3 June the Taoiseach told the House that &ldquo;all parties, including Fianna Fáil, operated the same system&rdquo;.  He suggested that &ldquo;none of them is entitled, without revealing the larger sums that they or their members accepted, to climb up on <Col N="1016" /> the high moral ground&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach was right when he said people should reveal where they got their money.  However, the Green Party, which has two Members in this House, two members in the European Parliament and 19 local councillors, is not one of the parties to which he referred.  We would be happy to reveal where we get our donations.  On behalf of those public representatives and on my own behalf, I publicly disentangle myself from the Taoiseach's attempted embrace in this regard.  We are not seeking to adopt the so-called high moral ground.  The moral ground may only appear high when the person is on his knees.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the way tribunals operate because there is a lot of cynicism among the public.  We are getting an overdose of tribunals and we are suffering from scandal fatigue.  However, we will not exorcise the demons unless people are seen to be punished.  It seems that people have got away scot-free.  We know, for example, that the conclusions of the McCracken Tribunal are on the DPP's desk, yet nothing has been done. We know tax evasion has taken place, yet no one has been convicted or imprisoned.  The public wants to see action on this matter.  I hope every party agrees that tribunals must complete their work and that people must be seen to be punished.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the terms of reference of the Flood Tribunal and I wish all involved in the work of the tribunal well.  There has been a sea change in Irish politics, although it is not political.  The work of the Flood and Moriarty Tribunals will come to be seen as significant benchmarks of that reality.  The Green Party supports the motion.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I thank Deputy Gormley for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>When it comes to this Government setting in train a comprehensive investigation into alleged corruption in the dealings between big business and politics in this State, getting it right is a painful process.  The Government has been dragged in here today by force of serious public revelations about large amounts of money being passed from business interests to a former senior Fianna Fáil politician.  Only when there was no other option did the Government yield and agree to investigate more broadly moneys paid to Mr. Ray Burke.  It did not want to do it.  The evidence of the past six or seven months shows that every addition to the terms of reference of various tribunals and every investigation into matters which should automatically be investigated had to be dragged out of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revelations of dubious dealings between politicians and business came to light for accidental reasons.  Collateral political damage was caused as a result of feuds between people who were collaborators but who decided to hang out one or two politicians to advance a particular interest.  It is fortuitous that these tribunals are examining these issues and that politician A's <Col N="1017" /> business dealings have come into the public domain, while politician B's business dealings have not.  Politicians B to Q are probably hoping that those who came to their door or office with cheques or brown envelopes do not fall out among themselves, thus spilling out more names. Further revelations may emerge involving new people and another tribunal.</P>
    <P>This matter could have been handled in a different way.  During the debates on the original tribunals, I called for a number of measures to be taken.  I called for all political parties in this House to be obliged to reveal donations of £500 or more received since 1985 from business interests or individuals.  The Opposition parties, with the exception of the Green Party, and the Government refused.  They could have made a clean breast of it and stated where they got their money and it would have cleared up this mess.  I also called for the publication of the names of all those who benefited from the tax amnesties of 1987 and 1994 and for an investigation into who had donated to political parties.  One of the most corrosive and corrupt things that happened legally in politics was granting tax amnesties to super wealthy tax dodgers.  If that information had been brought into the open, it would have cleared the air.  I also called for the Ansbacher accounts to be included in the original investigation.</P>
    <P>Not only have these measures not been supported, there have been new revelations about other devices used by politicians and political parties to milk more money from the corporate sector.  This is known as the &ldquo;pick me up&rdquo; system, which is an ingenious label that rhymes with buttercup and sounds harmless.  It could even be a type of tonic.  However, it is a nefarious practice by which big business seeks to influence politics and politicians seek to get funds from big business.  It is deplorable and it should also be publicised.</P>
    <P>Nobody believes that big business gives money to politicians or political parties for nothing. People believe there is a price to be paid and they are right.  Most of the time this can be done legally but there is no doubt that major parties, when they are in Government, are favourably disposed towards banks or other powerful interests which donate money to them.  By reducing tax by 1 or 2 per cent in the Finance Act, such institutions make a fortune.  Their investment in the political party concerned gets a good return.</P>
    <P>As long as we have an economic system, such as we have at present, which is based on powerful conglomerates and wealthy individuals who are greedy, we will have this system of payola.  If we had a truly democratic and socialist system of economic management where the people ran all aspects of society, there would be no incentive for people to try to influence or corrupt politicians or political parties.  We would have a truly democratic and transparent system in contrast to the mess in which we now find ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Government proposal <Col N="1018" /> to amend the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal.  I take this opportunity to deal with matters that were relevant in my capacity as a former financial director of the Fianna Fáil Party at national level.  I have not spoken on certain matters to date because I was employed in a professional capacity as an accountant by the Fianna Fáil organisation.  I was conscious of the duty of confidentiality binding on an accountant in a professional capacity.  For that reason I was unwilling to date to volunteer information about disputed events.  My resulting silence, stemming from a sense of professional obligation, has been misinterpreted.  My character and professional integrity have been impugned in written material. I have been left with no option but to state certain matters in this House.</P>
      <P>In 1989 I assisted in the administration of the activities of the Fianna Fáil fundraising committee.  I was not involved in the fundraising and I did not contact people in relation to their subscriptions.  That work was done by members of the fundraising committee.  On 8 June 1989 Fianna Fáil had a fundraising luncheon in the Westbury Hotel.  Mr. Paul Kavanagh, chief fundraiser for Fianna Fáil at that time, and I were in the entrance foyer of the hotel to meet the various people attending the luncheon.  I was aware since the previous evening that Fitzwilton was to make a large contribution to the Fianna Fáil Party through Mr. Ray Burke.  When he arrived we asked him for the cheque and he gave the envelope to Paul Kavanagh or myself.  On opening it we saw it contained a bank draft for £10,000 and a photocopy of a Rennicks compliment slip. I was not satisfied that £10,000 was the full amount of the contribution.  Both of us asked Mr. Ray Burke where was the balance.  He told us that £10,000 was the amount that was being given to party headquarters and the rest would be used for his constituency purposes.</P>
      <P>Immediately after that Mr. Paul Kavanagh and I spoke to the then party leader, Mr. Charles Haughey, who was at the luncheon.  We pointed out to him that we believed the party's national fundraising committee had been left short in respect of this donation.  Mr. Charles Haughey indicated that we should leave the matter with him.  I took the contribution back to head office on 8 June 1989.  It was receipted to Rennicks on 9 June 1989, lodged to our bank after the weekend and presented for payment to the Ulster Bank through the banking system in the normal manner.  I hope that explains the sequence of events in relation to the receiving, receipting and lodgment of the bank draft.</P>
      <P>Rennicks stated it has no recollection of having received the receipt.  However, I am quite satisfied a receipt was issued.  In early August 1989, the party leader issued &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; letters on Fianna Fáil head office note paper to the substantial contributors to the election fund.  I know Fitzwilton has acknowledged such a letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was elected a member of Dáil Éireann in June 1997.  For the rest of that year there was no fulltime <Col N="1019" /> financial controller in Fianna Fáil head office.  In July or August 1997 the party general secretary, Mr. Pat Farrell, contacted me and asked me whether Mr. Ray Burke had given £10,000 to Fianna Fáil head office in June 1989.  I visited party headquarters and checked the cash receipts book and was satisfied we had received £10,000 through Mr. Ray Burke during the June 1989 election campaign and that this contribution had been from Rennicks.  I informed the general secretary verbally of this matter and he was then able to confirm receipt of the £10,000.</P>
    <P>Mr. Des Richardson, the party's fundraiser, was in the room during some of this meeting.  I was out of the country on my holidays at the end of August and early September.  I returned on the Sunday before Mr. Ray Burke made his statement in the Dáil on Wednesday, 10 September. On my return I contacted the party general secretary.  As it transpired he was out of the country later that day and I was not able to contact him again.  Therefore, I telephoned Mr. Ray Burke directly.  He informed me he would read the text of a letter from his bank in the Dáil confirming the details of the £10,000 payment to Fianna Fáil head office in June 1989.  I did not discuss the matter with the Taoiseach.  In Fianna Fáil there is a longstanding practice and an unwritten rule that party officials and fundraisers do not discuss the details of individual donations with the party leader or other senior party members.</P>
    <P>I was employed by Fianna Fáil in a professional capacity as a chartered accountant.  In carrying out that role all information of which I was aware was treated by me in a strictly confidential manner.  I would have been in breach of professional ethics if I did not maintain that confidentiality.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year Fianna Fáil headquarters asked for my assistance as a former financial director to assist with the preparation of information for the affidavit of discovery for the Flood tribunal in respect of matters covering the period when I was an employee of the party.  I knew the Rennicks' donation would be disclosed and remembering the controversy surrounding the hand over of the payment I telephoned Paul Kavanagh in mid-March to discuss this matter.  He confirmed my recollection of the event and the discussion with Mr. Ray Burke in June 1989.  He did not refer to the possibility of an invoice being involved in the transaction.</P>
    <P>I have always observed proper standards in the practice of my profession as an accountant.  I issued receipts for moneys received, not bogus invoices.  It is untrue to suggest I was involved in adding £30,000 to the Fianna Fáil printing bill. The suggestion that I sorted out the party's books in a manner to hide the Burke payment is totally untrue.  That is damaging to my good name as a professional accountant and hurtful to me as an individual.</P>
    <P>These allegations relate to the performance of my duties when I was employed by Fianna Fáil as a private citizen.  These false statements have <Col N="1020" /> damaged my reputation for integrity and impugned my honesty.  I have taken legal advice on these and other matters and I am taking the appropriate legal action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not necessarily agree with some of things Members said, which I will address in a moment, but I thank them for their contributions which, by and large, were positive and to the point.  On behalf of the Chief Whip, I thank the Whips of the Opposition parties for their co-operation in getting this motion into the House before the summer recess.  I know that is something Members all sides want to have dealt with before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go into the detail of the various matters into which the tribunal will inquire once this motion is passed.  One of the problems that has arisen in the past is that some people want to run tribunals here as well as have them set up outside the House.  I do not intend to go down that route because it is unwise and unhelpful.  All those who are supposed to be involved in any illegal activities or any activities that are to be investigated by the tribunal should have their actions assessed by it.  It will assess and investigate them fully, but will also give them all an opportunity to put their side of the case in accordance with the principle of natural justice.  I have no intention of commenting on any of the matters that are to be the subject of the tribunal's inquiries.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies talked about the Government's changes of mind, legislation being brought forward and so forth.  The way Deputies presented those arguments painted the Government in the worst possible light.  Some of the statements I made here when the original tribunal was being set up have been quoted again.  I stand over everything I said when we set up that tribunal because of the information and knowledge I had at that time.  It transpires that my knowledge was much less than it is now.  Things have come to light since then which makes what I said incorrect.  If I had known then what I know now, I would not have said those things.  Nevertheless, I stand over what I said at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit foolish and imprudent. What is foolish and imprudent is people making statements on the basis of rumour and innuendo. If the Deputy looks at the speech as a whole, he cannot disagree with its content because what I hit out at is people hounding others and basing speeches on rumours and innuendo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, in the debate in this House on 28 May a great disservice, however well intentioned, was committed by reading into the record an anonymous letter and by imputing to people in business or otherwise, who, whether we agree or disagree with their point of view have contributed much to the development and establishment of this country and its image abroad, base motives for <Col N="1021" /> what they obviously meant to be a political donation.  It was wrong that the Fitzwilton or Rennicks donation was linked in the most negative way possible to the allocation of MMDS licences.  It is a matter for the tribunal to establish motives.  There is no evidence linking that payment and MMDS decisions.  In fact, in this contribution Deputy Rabbitte referred to the statement in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today.  In it, Independent Newspapers PLC:</P>
    <P>.wishes to take this opportunity to make it very clear that it at all times acted with the utmost propriety in the manner in which it applied for, and ultimately was awarded MMDS licences.</P>
    <P>Independent Newspapers believes that the Department of Communications followed its internal criteria when considering applications for MMDS licences, in addition to consulting with KPMG, independent expert advisors to the Department..</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte was gracious enough to state that he accepted Mr. Healy's word on it and would not query it until events proved otherwise. I make the point that, whether we talk about changes of heart, mind or anything else, at all times this Government and the Fianna Fáil Party have acted in good faith in relation to all these matters.  When further information became available, we acted on it and we will continue to act on it.  If &mdash; I hope it will not happen &mdash; we again need to amend terms of reference, we will not be afraid to do so in the interest of ensuring, as all Deputies in this House desire, that all the facts come out in relation to this and other matters into which the tribunal is inquiring.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes asked why the power of discovery, which exists in the original, is not repeated here.  The reason it is not repeated for this section of the amendment is that the Act includes that power of discovery generally and it was felt in this particular circumstances it was not necessary to repeat it, that the tribunals have that power.</P>

He then asked me and other members of Fianna Fáil in this House to accept that he was not really talking about us and that it was everybody else in Fianna Fáil.  Then he referred to his relative who happens to be a cumann secretary who is the real Fianna <Col N="1024" /> Fáil.  I remind Deputy Gormley that there are 50,000 members of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, paragraph <i>(c)</i>, to delete lines 34 to 37 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) An appointment to the office of Deputy Chief of Staff shall be made by the President.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It became clear in the course of the debate last night that comprehensive legislation is needed if reform of the Defence Forces is to proceed at the required pace given the challenges facing the forces.  This legislation, although part of that reform, is not comprehensive.</P>
      <P>This section provides for the amendment of section 12 of the 1954 Act to abolish the offices of Adjutant General and Quartermaster General and to replace them with two new appointments of Deputy Chief of Staff Operations and Deputy Chief of Staff Support.  It provides that the Chief of Staff shall remain an office holder appointed by the President and that he or she shall hold the office for the period specified in the instrument of appointment but that he or she shall be eligible for reappointment.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Deputy Chiefs of Staff, however, it is proposed that they no longer be office holders appointed by the President but that they be appointment holders appointed by the Government.  It is proposed that the holder of either of these appointments shall be appointed for a period not exceeding five years to be specified in the instrument of appointment and that he or she shall be eligible for reappointment on the expiration of that term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues arise from the proposed changes.  It is proposed that the Deputy Chiefs of Staff shall be appointment holders appointed by the Government whereas the Adjutant General and Quartermaster General were, like the Chief of Staff, office holders appointed by the President as supreme commander of the Defence Forces. There is concern within the Defence Forces that this marks a reduction in status of the two officers and that the unique relationship between the <Col N="1026" /> Defence Forces and the President is being diminished.  From a legal perspective, it may be the case that office holders enjoy different protections in employment than appointment holders.</P>
    <P>I appreciate fully that the intention of the legislation is to have better and more streamlined decision-making procedures and to make the position of Chief of Staff an executive one with more wide ranging powers which are clarified by the legislation so that he is seen to be the single military chief of the Defence Forces.  Some outstanding issues remain but the question could be asked whether the changes proposed could be achieved if the Deputy Chiefs of Staff were office holders appointed by the President.  Given the reduction in status and position it is appropriate that the Deputy Chiefs of Staff should continue to be appointed by the President.  Will the Minister outline the rationale for the change and what is to be gained from it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was slightly surprised when the Minister misinterpreted my comment last night about bringing the offices into the political arena. When an officer takes a commission he takes an oath under the Constitution of which the President is guardian.  It was a powerful symbol that the three offices were appointed by the President. The Minister has changed the status of all three but I cannot see the need for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 is one of the main sections of the Defence Act, 1954 requiring amendment arising from the reorganisation of the top level management structure of the Defence Forces.  The principal amendments to this section involve substituting the two new appointments of Deputy Chief of Staff for the appointments of Adjutant General and Quartermaster General and prescribing that appointments to these posts will be made by Government as against the present position where appointments to the posts of Adjutant General and Quartermaster General are made by the President.</P>
      <P>The fundamental difference between the new arrangements and the current situation is that under the new arrangements holders of the appointments of Deputy Chief of Staff shall report to the Chief of Staff whereas at present the Adjutant General and Quartermaster General report independently of each other and of the Chief of Staff to the Minister.  Under the new structure the Deputy Chiefs of Staff, as the title implies, will be subordinate to the Chief of Staff. They will be his deputies.  It is for this reason that it would be most inappropriate to prescribe in legislation that they should be appointed by the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appointments by the President are normally reserved for positions which are independent of the Government, for example, members of the Judiciary, the Ombudsman and the Governor of the Central Bank.  Secretaries general of Departments and the Garda Commissioner are <Col N="1027" /> appointed by the Government, not by the President.  It is, therefore, appropriate that appointments to Deputy Chief of Staff be made by the Government.  It could be reasonably argued that the Chief of Staff should also be appointed by the Government.  However, given the relationship between the Defence Forces and the President set down in the Constitution it is felt that, on balance, there is some merit in his appointment being made by the President.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Defence Act, 1954, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General are appointed to the principal military offices of Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General.  Under the Bill, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff will be appointed by Government.  They will not be appointed to the offices of the Deputy Chiefs of Staff because, under the new arrangement, all of their duties, functions and responsibilities will derive from the office of the Chief of Staff and as such they will not have independent functions.  It should be noted that in the strict legal sense members of the Defence Forces from lieutenant generals down to new recruits are officeholders.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, in the context of reorganisation, the provisions of the Bill are significantly different to those in the 1954 Act.  There will be a single office, as distinct from three separate offices, of which the Deputy Chiefs of Staff will be part.  It would be entirely inappropriate that these appointments should be made by the President.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable dialogue on the production of the legislation.  Perhaps one of the reasons for the delay in introducing the Bill lies in its technical and legal nature.  This gave rise to a need for exhaustive dialogue with the Office of the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman to ensure that safe and sound legislation was produced which takes account not only of the legal requirements but also of the cultural change its introduction would institute.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position of the Deputy Chiefs of Staff, their rank &mdash; major general &mdash; will remain the same, they will be officeholders and they will be appointed by the Government.  Taking account of these factors, it seems the proper course of action has been pursued.  Since there is no ready precedent of which I am aware requiring the President to make appointments to positions other than those involving officers of the highest rank, I ask the House to accept that the safest, preferred legal and best way of demonstrating the changes we are about to put in place is to accept the Bill as it stands.  For those reasons, I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation.  There is no legal reason to prevent the President from continuing to appoint Deputy Chiefs of Staff.  The Minister referred to other areas where the President does not appoint deputy officeholders.  However, in this area we <Col N="1028" /> are concerned with precedent, tradition and the unique role of the Defence Forces.  For that reason appointments should continue to be made by the President.  This matter involves reflecting the status, unique role and tradition of the Defence Forces.  It has meant a great deal to some that those appointments were made by the President in the past.  That is the reason I tabled the amendment.</P>
      <P>At a time when the morale of the Defence Forces has been shattered by the issue of hearing impairment claims and when the Chief of Staff has called for reform and stated that such reform is happening at too slow a pace, it is critical that we, as legislators, take this opportunity to recognise the special and unique role of the Defence Forces.  That should be reflected by the fact that the President should continue to appoint Deputy Chiefs of Staff.  These are good reasons to continue with established precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not disagree with the Minister in respect of the Bill's legal soundness. However, that is not the issue under discussion. The Minister compared the Defence Forces with the Garda Síochána but he was somewhat disingenuous in that regard because they are completely different.  In fairness, since taking office the Minister has shown great interest in his portfolio and has tried to advance the cause of the Defence Forces.  However, on this occasion, he has missed the boat.  He does not realise the seriousness of this issue and a time will come when he will recognise his mistake.  I reiterate my dissatisfaction with the approach he has taken. The Minister stated that he cannot accept the amendment but in the future he will realise that he went down the wrong road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is perhaps no one in this House who appreciates more than I many of the traditions established in the context of the development of the Defence Forces.  I and the people of Ireland are immensely proud of the style, discipline and professionalism they have displayed in their United Nations peacekeeping duties, humanitarian activities and provision of aid to the civil power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies are correct to state that we are discussing a critical period of change.  There is also a certain amount of pain associated with change.  I know Members have read the Price Waterhouse report which was quite damning in many respects about the way many of traditions &mdash; not those we are honouring or praising &mdash; in the Defence Forces developed.  It is a pity that the reorganisation process was so long delayed. There is no point in blaming a particular Administration and I have never dwelt on the historical aspects of this issue.  However, we must accept that the age profile, the lack of recruits and many of the tedious regulations which developed over a period were detrimental to the introduction of modern management practices in the Defence Forces in a changed international environment.  I <Col N="1029" /> have been extremely anxious to encourage progress in this area.</P>
    <P>As I indicated on Second Stage, we have moved into the third phase of the voluntary early retirement scheme and have reduced Defence Force personnel to 11,500 &mdash; a figure agreed by the then Government in 1996.  I was the first Minister for Defence to state that a White Paper would be necessary to provide a medium and long-term framework for the development of the Defence Forces.  No other political party made such a suggestion.  During the election campaign, Fianna Fáil made a commitment to introduce a White Paper and, in the interim, a considerable amount of work has been carried out in that regard.  We will invite submissions from the representatives in the near future.</P>
    <P>In terms of recruitment, refurbishment, the White Paper, advancing the final stages of the VER scheme and dealing with the major problems associated with deafness, we have advanced on all fronts.  There is no way this indicates anything other than the best possible support the Government can give to the Defence Forces.  At a time when considerable costs were associated with hearing impairment claims, we have ensured that the main thrust of developmental activities continued to proceed.  Those developments have not been impeded.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill which undermines the position of the Deputy Chiefs of Staff.  The significant difference which was pointed out in the Price Waterhouse report and which has been honoured by two successive Governments was the need for change in the Defence Forces headquarters, the need to have a single-minded leadership role for the Chief of Staff with two deputies.  That is a significant change in operations which is reflected in the legislation. However, it does not take away from the rank or the importance of the men or women who take up the posts of Deputy Chief of Staff.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with a nomination by a democratically elected Government.  There are many who would like to have their posts decided in such a way.  There are not too many&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am surprised the Minister has decided to give a lengthy recitation of his view of himself.  The tenor of the debate did not question his good faith, yet he felt it necessary to tell us about the wonderful actions he has taken.  It betrays certain defensiveness on his part which may suggest the amendments should be pursued further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the Defence Forces was undertaken <Col N="1030" /> at my initiative when I was Taoiseach.  I commissioned the Price Waterhouse inquiry.  It was an overdue exercise and I am glad it is taking place.  I am not convinced the Minister's initiative to have a White Paper on the matter is a positive step.  It may prove to be no more than a delaying tactic, although perhaps not deliberately so.  I have had the experience of having promised to produce White Papers and living to regret the promise.  I committed myself to produce a White Paper on Industrial Policy and it took far longer than had been envisaged.  The Minister may have made a mistake committing himself to a White Paper.  He would have been better to take the decisions needed on the basis of the Price Waterhouse report and gone on with the job.  He should not have become involved in the process of producing a White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having agreed with the Chair for intervening to bring the Minister back to the amendments, I ask the Deputy to confine his remarks to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his timely intervention.  I had completed the point in response to what the Minister said.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister's argument that it is necessary that the President should only appoint the Chief of Staff to establish the hierarchical nature of command within the Defence Forces.  There is a hierarchy in the courts between the Supreme Court and the High Court.  The President appoints the Judiciary, yet there is a hierarchy between the courts.  There is no need to dispense with the appointment by the President for other officers to establish that there is a hierarchy between the Chief of Staff and the generals in charge of the various commands.  There is no legal basis for that arrangement.</P>
      <P>The Judiciary and the Army are fundamental to the existence of the State.  If a situation is allowed to develop whereby in the case of the Judiciary the President is involved in many appointments but in the case of the Army the President is involved in only one appointment, it would suggest in an indirect sense that the Judiciary is more important than the Army.  That is an invidious comparison to make.  It ought not to be made nor should it be capable of being made.</P>
      <P>The arrangements which have existed to date have worked well.  On the basis of the presidential appointment of those ranks which will no longer be so appointed, nobody questioned their subordination to the Chief of Staff in important operational matters.  Why change the arrangements? There is a cliché which, like many clichés, contains a deal of truth which tells us &ldquo;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&rdquo;.  What is the Minister trying to fix?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the value of a discussion such as this is that it should influence the Minister and he should be more open to influence on this matter. There is nothing wrong with accepting an amendment <Col N="1031" /> at this point.  The Minister has not advanced persuasive arguments for the change he proposes to make.  The proposed change will not necessarily improve the relationship between the Department and the Defence Forces &mdash; it may do the opposite.  This is not a huge issue but it is an irritant for which there is no need.  It is little more than a gratuitous irritant.</P>
    <P>It is not usual for former Taoisigh to intervene in debates on defence matters.  I have been in political life for a long time.  I have not intervened in debates of this nature on line Department responsibilities since I ceased to be Taoiseach.  I hope the Minister and his advisers will take my intervention seriously.  The Minister is making a mistake and he should change his mind.  As Leader of the Opposition and a former Taoiseach, who has the greatest admiration for the Defence Forces and who served in a minor capacity in them, I ask him to change his mind on this matter.  Deputies Fitzgerald, Timmins and Wall have made valid contributions urging the Minister to change his mind and I join them in doing so.  It will not cost him anything to do so, except perhaps a modicum of pride.  He is not a proud man and I am sure he is not influenced by such considerations.  A change would be wise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton was right to accuse me of being defensive when I outlined some of the positive steps we are taking.  I return the compliment to him because he started by telling us he was responsible for the review of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind being accused of being defensive but it seems inappropriate that the Deputy would suggest that he instituted the Price Waterhouse report.  It did not take place during his term of Government.  He was in Government when the implementation plan was produced and his Government progressed it effectively.  It was a Fianna Fáil Administration which established the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have little to add to what I said.  This is not a question of pride or a gratuitous irritant for the Defence Forces.  I would go out of my way to remove any such irritant where it was possible for me to do so.  I do not believe there is widespread concern in the Defence Forces about this matter, but it is important to realise that we are facing a period of significant change.  We have moved ahead with many of the instruments in the implementation plan.  I would like to see the plan moving faster.  Management in the Defence Forces has been seeking this legislation for some time. There was considerable dialogue on every element of it, and a great number of meetings were held between the military, civil servants and the Office of the Attorney General to produce <Col N="1032" /> the best possible legislation.  All the advice from the drafts people was strongly in favour of making the change we are proposing.  For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little patience with Ministers who justify their position on the basis of &ldquo;advice&rdquo;.  Ministers are there to make decisions, advisers are there to advise.  Drafts people should not be cited as the source of arguments for any policy proposition being advanced in this House. Drafts people are there to draft; politicians are there to set policy.  The Minister has given very poor arguments in response to what I said, for adopting this course of action.  Relying on his drafts people, people who probably never stood on a parade ground in their lives, as the basis for this course of action is not impressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously change is needed in the Defence Forces.  There is no doubt about that. The Chief of Staff was calling for it yesterday and urging that the pace of reform should be hastened.  The Defence Forces themselves are keen to see changes put in place, both administratively and within their own structures.  They very much welcome the changes in this Bill, section 5 in particular relating to devolution of power.  It is also necessary that budget responsibility should go down the line much more than it does at present. There is huge concern about the centralisation of decision making within the Defence Forces and in the relationship with the Department.  It is accepted by all that there is need for change in this.</P>
      <P>The nomination of the two Deputy Chiefs of Staff is not the issue on which to pin change or to use as a symbol of change.  It was important for the Defence Forces that the Quartermaster and the Adjutant General were appointed by the President.  It is not necessary to change that in the new structure.  It does nothing symbolically to impress or support the need for change.  Politically it would be right to continue to allow these appointments to be made by the President.  From the point of view of the status of the Army, from the point of view of the status of the appointments, they should remain where they are.  The pace of change will not be driven, one way or another, by this decision.  In terms of its importance, it is a shame to change it at this moment when the Defence Forces are vulnerable following the very bad publicity and the severe pressures on everybody concerned in regard to deafness compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Bruton has gone because, not for the first time in this House, if he has not cast reflections, neither has he taken into account the technical and very hard work done in the Office of the Attorney General in the preparation and drafting of Bills.  I would not like to describe those individuals who work as hard as they do, long and late, as people who are not <Col N="1033" /> really concerned about producing the best possible legislation.</P>
      <P>I accept there are political decisions to be taken about a range of matters, and I have no hesitation in taking those, but I will base them on the best possible legal advice I can get.  I am sure that is exactly what Deputy Bruton would do in the same circumstances.  Here we are concerned not just with technical legal advice but with a culture of change which does not undermine the personnel in these positions or who will subsequently take up these positions.  They will still be nominated by the Government.  They will be officeholders whose sphere of duties and responsibilities will remain in one office under the new Chief of Staff.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 7 to 10 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Chief of Staff shall have responsibility for delivering the military outputs of the Defence Forces as determined by the Minister for Defence.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides for the replacement of the <Col N="1034" /> three military branches of the Department of Defence with a single military element to be known as &ldquo;Defence Forces Headquarters&rdquo;, the head of which will be the Chief of Staff.  The Chief of Staff will be responsible directly to the Minister for such duties in connection with the business of the Department of the Defence as the Minister may determine.  It also provides that the Minister may authorise the Chief of Staff to delegate to the Deputy Chiefs of Staff such duties as the Minister may determine.</P>
    <P>The duties of the Chief of Staff as outlined in the Bill are similar to those in the existing l954 Act, i.e., such duties in connection with the business of the Department of Defence as the Minister may determine.  These duties are specified in the sealed orders of the Chief of Staff.  However, the introduction of other legislation, notably, the Public Service Management Act, has led to concerns that there is considerable ambiguity about the respective roles of the Secretary General of the Department of Defence and the Chief of Staff.  That Act defines the Department of Defence for the purpose of the Act as including the principal military branches and charges the Secretary General with responsibility &ldquo;for delivering outputs as determined with the Minister or the Government having charge of the Department&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I understand it is the intention that the Chief of Staff would be responsible for delivering the military output of the Defence Forces but I tabled this amendment because it may be necessary for that to be explicitly stated in this legislation.  I would welcome the Minister's views in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the Price Waterhouse report on several occasions. When examining the various options in this respect the report stated that the optimum route to take was to appoint a Chief of Staff as military commander of the Army.  Many people are unaware of the structures of command in the Army.  Will the Minister clarify the position on that?  Is any military person overall commander of the Army?</P>
      <P>This is the last opportunity we will have to discuss Defence matters before the summer recess.

      <P>Section 13 of the Defence Act is the second of the two main sections of the 1954 Act needing amendment arising from the reorganisation of the top level structure of the Defence Forces.  Section 4 of the Bill, therefore, provides for the replacement in its entirety of section 13 of the Defence Act.</P>
      <P>The existing section of the Act establishes in the Department of Defence three principal military branches, the heads of which are the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General.  Under the terms of the Act the Minister has assigned to each of them specified duties relating to the business of the Department of Defence and each is directly responsible for and reports to the Minister on the performance of those duties.  In addition, a co-ordinating role in relation to the business of the principal military branches of the Department has been delegated to the Chief of Staff.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of this section provides that, in future, there will be a single military element in the Department of Defence, which will be known and referred to as Defence Forces Headquarters, and that the Chief of Staff will be the head of the military element of the Department.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of this section provides that there shall be assigned to the Chief of Staff responsibility for such duties in connection with the business of the Department as the Minister for Defence may from time to time decide.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) provides that the Chief of Staff will be directly responsible to the Minister for the performance of such duties as may be assigned to him.  Subsection (4) provides that the Chief of Staff may, with the approval of the Minister, delegate to the Deputy Chiefs of Staff duties that have been assigned to him.  Accordingly, the Deputy Chiefs of Staff will be responsible for and report to the Chief of Staff on the performance of such duties as may be delegated to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must emphasise again that the legislation before the House has been drafted in accordance with legal advice and that great care has been taken to ensure its technical accuracy.  In the drafting process, many alternatives have been considered and in drafting the Bill full regard has been had to the possible implications of other legislation.  In common with the other amendments proposed, the question of including &ldquo;outputs&rdquo;<Col N="1036" /> in the Defence (Amendment) Bill was considered at an early stage of the process, and during the term of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>As I indicated last night, this issue seems to have its origins in a misunderstanding.  The term &ldquo;outputs&rdquo; is used in the Public Service Management Act, 1997, and, in relation to a Government Department or Office, means the goods and services, including standards of service, that are a consequence of the activities of a Department or Office.  The Public Service Management Act prescribes that the Secretary General of a Department or the Head of an Office will have the authority, responsibility and accountability for, <i>inter alia</i>, delivering outputs as determined by the Minister in charge of that Department or Office.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some confusion about the nature and impact of this reference in the Public Service Management Act.  The position of the Chief of Staff relative to the Minister is completely unaffected by the Public Service Management Act and any changes which may be introduced in relation to Secretaries General.</P>
    <P>In any event, section 4 enables the Minister for Defence to assign to the Chief of Staff such duties in connection with the business of the Department of Defence as the Minister may from time to time determine.  There is, therefore, sufficient flexibility for the Minister to assign responsibility in a manner which takes account of future developments in the area of public service reform.</P>
    <P>Over recent years considerable effort has been put into ensuring that the Chief of Staff and the military authorities have greater autonomy.  More than 60 per cent of the non-pay element in the Defence Forces budget is now under the absolute control of the military.  Much work has been done to ensure greater efficiencies in this way and it is obvious that the ground work is being done to move towards giving as much local autonomy as possible to the military authorities in the non-pay area.  Deputies can be assured that will continue.</P>
    <P>Some areas remain on which considerable work must be done to create the efficiencies necessary in the times in which we live.  That work will continue between the civil servants in my Department and the military in a cohesive way. We are not talking about two areas of responsibility where there is divisiveness.  The aim is to create the greatest possible cohesion so that we can be more efficient, make savings and gradually eradicate some of the expensive regimes that have grown up around the Defence Forces in the past.  That must be done in concert with the representative associations and with the granting of greater autonomy as we proceed down the road of better efficiency.  It is important to emphasise that over 60 per cent of the non-pay area is totally in the hands of the administration of the military authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that clarification.  It is important because there was some concern about the reference in the report to delivering outputs.  The more clarity in relation <Col N="1037" /> to that, the better.  Is the Minister saying it is the intention that the Chief of Staff should be responsible for delivering the military output of the Defence Forces?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of demand was considered by Government in the context of the EAG report and the implementation plan.  The Government decided as a matter of policy to reject the proposal to make a single military officer overall commander in place of the Minister.  This position was accepted by the Deputies opposite during the term of the previous Government and nothing has happened in the meantime to warrant such a change.  The fact that command is delegated directly to GOCs from the Minister has no impact in practice.  The purpose of the Bill is to try to strike a sensible balance between political control and administrative efficiency.  I am sure when Deputy Fitzgerald is sitting in this seat and I am on the opposite side of the House, she will give the same explanation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some contradiction in what the Minister has just outlined in relation to his earlier point about moving towards delegation and a clear leader in relation to the Defence Forces.  The Price Waterhouse report, in recommending moving towards the single military commander, was developing the principle of devolution.  I accept the Minister's point that a political decision has not been made to move in that direction but I assume he is confirming that the Chief of Staff is responsible for delivering the military output via the Minister.  I tabled the amendment to get further clarity on this matter and I will not press it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for clarifying the position of the overall commander.  In regard to the non-pay budget, the Chief of Staff is probably responsible for in the region of 15 to 16 per cent of the total budget of the Defence Forces.  The Price Waterhouse report refers to training in management and accounting skills. The Minister should take that into consideration. Many military personnel are well trained and undertake command and staff courses, but there is need for training in accounting and devolved budgets.  Generally the military personnel are tasked only with control measures and are not responsible for budgets.  Barrack commanders who are given £2 million or £3 million should be able to operate within that amount.  Like officials in all Government Departments, military personnel do not turn off lights and water and leave cars running.  Individuals on the ground should be responsible for those matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much sense in the overall decision taken by the Government on the amount of money to be spent on the Defence Forces.  In so far as possible, military personnel should play an autonomous role in dispersing funds and we are working towards improving matters in that area.  It takes time to acquire skills and ensure greater efficiency.  It is unfair to say the chief of staff has responsibility for about 15 per cent of the total budget.  The Deputy is playing with figures and is excluding pay.  Each individual has responsibility for receiving the weekly cheque.</P>

The person who will display that character more than anyone else is the chief of staff.  I hope the present chief of staff, notwithstanding anything he might say late at night, on which I will not comment, will not become ill.  From time to time the chief of staff may be unavailable and he will appoint one of the deputy chiefs of staff to take over his responsibilities.

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the staff of the Department.  This has been a very demanding year for them, given the huge pressures in dealing with deafness compensation cases.  It is important to have another Bill on reform of the Defence Forces, but we need to speed up the pace of reform. There are a number of key decisions to be made and I hope the Minister will make them quickly. I also hope he will publish the Price Waterhouse report before the end of July so that the future of the Air Corps and the Naval Service as well as the Army can be discussed.  If we are to continue to be involved in effective peacekeeping, decisions will have to be taken by the Government on further participation by our forces and I would ask the Minister to have discussions on that matter also.</P>
      <P>As we approach the new millennium there is ambivalence in regard to the Defence Forces.  We need to disseminate information on the work of the Defence Forces.  Progress has been made in that regard this year, even though that was difficult given the problems that arose.  More debate is needed on the role of the Defence Forces in the momentously changing security landscape internationally.  There are key tasks to be carried out by the Defence Forces in the years ahead.  We discussed that matter last night and I do not need to refer to it again tonight.

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  Today a group from the San Jose area, including the city manager, the director of San Jose International Airport and the director of economic development in San Jose, met Aer Lingus about this issue.  They will also lobby Ministers and other influential people in Dublin over the next week regarding the matter.  Located a little more than 40 miles south of San Francisco and Oakland and approximately 390 miles north of Los Angeles, Santa Clara County is a key market of northern California.  It is the fourth largest county in California in terms of population.  San Jose is northern California's biggest city, the third largest city on the west coast and the eleventh largest city in the US.</P>
      <P>It is known as the capital of Silicon Valley and is among the top ten US cities for international business.  Santa Clara County demographics illustrate an educated and affluent community largely employed in professional and technical industries. The service area of San Jose International Airport encompasses almost one half of the San Francisco Bay area's population, creating the largest business travel market in the region.  A total of 1,500 of the nation's largest 2,500 firms are located in Santa Clara County.  Exports from there totalled $29.3 billion in 1996.  The San Jose metro area is the number one exporter in the US while almost half the Silicon Valley's workforce resides in San Jose.</P>
      <P>San Jose International Airport is the only major airport in Santa Clara County.  The county has the biggest portion of business related air travel of all the bay area counties.  Regarding air cargo, the bay area generates 11 per cent of US manufactured exports while Santa Clara County generates 60 per cent of the bay area's manufactured exports.  The airport ships approximately one half of Silicon Valley's air cargo, which is valued at $6.5 billion.  Cargo pounds shipped at the airport grew by 66 per cent between 1989 and 1996.  Its cost of operation is low, having declined substantially since the early 1990s.  Landing fees, and Terminal C rental rates especially, have dropped by between 40 per cent and 50 per cent since 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>San Jose is located at the heart of the largest and fastest growing high technology centre in the world.  San Jose International Airport serves a local market area with greater population and income than San Francisco or Oakland.  Its passenger traffic is more business oriented than that of San Francisco or Oakland, yet San Jose is closer to many tourist areas.  It captures an average of 29 per cent of the total bay area traffic in its non stop jet markets.  The airport's cost per passenger have declined considerably in the past <Col N="1041" /> four years as have landing fees and terminal rents.</P>
    <P>A number of airlines use the San Jose-London route while executives in Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Tricom, IBM and other companies from the Silicon Valley which have set up in Ireland use that route.  One small company spent $500,000 in air travel last year.  There is a major economic reason for Aer Lingus to fly this route.  The contribution of these major companies to our GDP is substantial and that is why we must facilitate them.  They do not want to travel to London and change or travel to another city in America to fly directly into Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important and that is why there is a delegation from San Jose in Dublin this week to lobby for direct flights.  Within Aer Lingus, there is a great deal of support for their case and I hope I receive a positive response from the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob) Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted Deputy Deenihan's remarks on this matter.  I wish to set out the access provisions under the Ireland-US Bilateral Air Services Agreement.  Under the agreement Irish airlines have access to four US points on scheduled services &mdash; New York, Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles.  US airlines can operate any number of services from any point in the US to Dublin and Shannon.  However, services to Dublin must be matched on a one for one basis with direct Shannon flights.</P>
      <P>The US has unlimited fifth freedom rights at Shannon, that is the right for US airlines to carry traffic between Ireland and third countries, and one fifth freedom point beyond Dublin outside the EU.  US and Irish airlines can operate charters between any point in the US and Dublin and Shannon subject to the Shannon matching requirement.  Charters can operate direct to Cork and Knock without any Shannon requirement. The bilateral agreement does not set any controls on the level of air fares or capacity in the market.</P>
      <P>Within this regulatory framework on access from the US it is a matter for US and Irish airlines to decide whether to operate air services between the US and Ireland based on their own commercial judgment of the market potential.  Of course, the Ministers for Public Enterprise, Tourism, Sport and Recreation and myself, as well as agencies such as Bord Fáilte and Aer Rianta, avail of every opportunity to encourage airlines to extend existing services and commence new services to Ireland.  Indeed, a priority in the joint programme for Government is opening up new air links with the US.  In this regard a very welcome development is the new service which Continental Airlines introduced last month from Newark to Shannon and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other existing services include Aer Lingus, which flies between Shannon, Dublin and Belfast to New York, Newark, Boston and Chicago. Delta Airlines operates from Shannon and Dublin to Atlanta.  Capacity on Aer Lingus services <Col N="1042" /> has increased significantly in recent years and in 1998 shows a 13 per cent increase over 1997.  For the first time ever Aer Lingus will provide more than one million seats on its transatlantic services this year.</P>
    <P>I understand from Aer Lingus that the airline has not yet completed its schedule plans for summer 1999 and has no plans at this stage to offer services to the United States west coast.  This position is kept under review by Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed in the past about the lack of direct scheduled services from the west or south west of the United States.  It should be recognised however, that growth in airline alliances and code-share agreements, the increasing concentration on hubbing operations &mdash; whereby airlines feed traffic from various points through major airports which have a large number of onward connections &mdash; and in particular increasing capacity through existing hubs, improves access to and from all US points.  Both Delta at Atlanta and Continental at Newark have extensive route networks in the United States while Aer Lingus services to Ireland also benefit from interline traffic at the hubs of other major US airlines.</P>
    <P>The Minister in consultation with her colleague the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, will continue to keep the situation under close review.</P>

      <P>I welcome the recent allocation by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, of £10 million for the Killarney-Mallow rail line, which will permit the upgrading of the remaining 25 miles to continuous welded track.  This upgrading will save ten minutes of journey time to Dublin.  However, I am bitterly disappointed she did not provide a similar sum for the Tralee-Killarney rail line, which has been the subject of previous representations by me and my colleagues in north Kerry in recent years.</P>
      <P>I raised this issue on 18 November 1997, following the derailment at Ballyhar, County Kerry, which was the second of its kind in recent months. I wish to highlight the pressing need for immediate action on this rail network.  A number of accidents have occurred on this line in recent years and unless recognition is given to existing problems and plans are put in place to address them there will be other accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are five provincial trains out of Tralee and one outgoing freight train daily.  There are six incoming passenger trains plus one incoming freight train daily.  The average number of passengers travelling daily into Tralee is between 450 and 550 and the number travelling out of Tralee daily averages between 370 and 450.  Approximately 150 students attending Tralee Regional College travel in and out of Tralee at weekends. Tralee Casement Station has a staff of approximately 30.  The number of people travelling in and <Col N="1043" /> out of Tralee on the trains has increased in recent years.</P>
    <P>The lines from Dublin-Belfast, Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Limerick and half way to Galway have continuous welded track while large sections of track on other lines are jointed.  The significance of this is highlighted by the fact that of the nine derailments in the past five years only one, which has occurred on welded track, was due to a fault in the carriage.  The trains which operate on the rest of the country's lines seems to be running on a wing and a prayer, and have led to what people call an accident waiting to happen.</P>
    <P>Given that £10 million has been provided for the Killarney-Mallow line, I am concerned about the Tralee-Killarney line.  Is it intended to close down the Tralee-Killarney line?  Tralee is a major tourism town.  Tremendous developments have taken place in the town during the past ten to 15 years including the development of new hotels, tourism infrastructures such as the Aquadome-Waterworld, Geraldine Experience, Blennerville windmill, steam train, sports complex and so on. A major regional college has been upgraded and in the next few months a new technology park development park will be under construction. Time does not permit me to refer further to the various developments in Tralee.  For this reason, an effective and efficient rail system out of Tralee is an integral part of the local infrastructure.</P>
    <P>While the significance of rail travel in Ireland may have declined in recent years, it still fulfils an important role in many aspects of Irish life. The opposite is the position in Tralee where passenger numbers have increased.  For this reason, rail travel still remains the mode of transport for some of our industries and the many tourists visiting Tralee and north Kerry.  In areas similar to County Kerry, where tourism is a major industry the provision of a rail network is important.  I appeal to the Minister of State to clarify the position regarding funding for the Tralee-Killarney line, to respond in a positive manner and thus secure the future of Tralee Casement station and its staff.</P>

      <P>In recent years there has been a renewed emphasis on the importance of the railways.  This is underlined by the substantial rail investment programme under way which is partly financed by the EU.  Total investment in the mainline rail network will amount to approximately £275 million under the 1994-99 programme agreed some time ago.  This investment is focused on track renewal, the installation of modern signalling systems and the purchase of rolling stock.  The investment will result in increased safety as well as substantial operating cost, and journey time, savings.  In future years there will be a need for continued investment in the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to significant under investment over the years, the capital requirements of the Irish railway network are very significant.  Córas Iompair <Col N="1044" /> Éireann recently submitted a review of mainline rail investment needs to the Department, amounting to some £460 million, in the context of securing EU or other funding in the post-1999 period.  The review identified a need for further evaluative work, particularly an economic and financial appraisal of the proposed investment and this work is in hand.  When this appraisal and the parallel review of railway safety are completed in the autumn the Minister intends to bring a comprehensive package of proposals to Government for consideration.  This can also take account of possible EU funding for the post-1999 period.</P>
    <P>When one speaks of rail investment needs the primary consideration has to be the safety of the railway.  Deputies will be aware that the A.D. Little rail safety study, undertaken for Iarnród Éireann, has drawn attention to infrastructural investment needs for the railway in this context. The conclusions of that report are being examined both in the Department and in Iarnród Éireann.  The Minister has asked the board of CIE to urgently prepare a safety investment plan and she intends to bring this to Government as soon as it is ready.</P>
    <P>In considering railway projects for inclusion in the existing EU programme the consultants, retained by the EU Commission, found that given the low rate of economic return on the Tralee-Mallow line, a greater concentration of track upgrading on the Mallow-Killarney section would improve the economic viability of the investment. Consequently it recommended co-financed investment for track improvement on the Mallow-Killarney section of the line.  While we might all wish otherwise, this decision is one we have had to live with.  However, I am happy that the available investment resources, including those of Iarnród Éireann, are being used to the best effect in terms of improved quality of service to all users of the railway.</P>
    <P>When it became evident that it would not be possible to utilise the EU funding allocated for Luas in the period up to end-1999 the Minister set out to ensure that as much of that funding as possible was reallocated for public transport projects.  In these circumstances there would be a range of competing demands for the available resources.  It would never be the case that the entire £114 million would be reallocated for public transport purposes and I consider it a very successful day's work that we managed to secure £70 million of this funding for bus and rail services.</P>
    <P>When the question of a reallocation of the EU assistance de-committed from the Luas project arose, the Department submitted a list of alternative projects to the Commission for consideration. This included the upgrading of trackwork on the Mallow-Killarney and Killarney-Tralee sections. The package agreed included the renewal works on the Mallow-Killarney section.  One of the key considerations in selecting projects for the reallocated aid was that the work would have to be contractually <Col N="1045" /> committed before end-1999 and completed before end-2000.</P>
    <P>Thus the additional mainline rail investment of £26 million, of which £12 million is from reallocated Luas funds, which the Minister announced last week will see the completion, by the end of the year 2000, of the upgrading of the Mullingar-Carrick-on-Shannon, Cherryville-Kilkenny and Mallow-Killarney sections of the rail network.</P>
    <P>The Mallow-Tralee line which is part of the inter-city network still has a large proportion of old jointed track.  The Mallow-Killarney section qualified for EU Cohesion Fund aid in 1996.  This section of track is 40 miles in length and with Cohesion Fund assistance, 15 miles will have been upgraded to continuous welded rail by end-1999. The proposed additional £10 million investment, including the reallocated EU assistance, will permit the upgrading of the remaining 25 miles with continuous welded rail.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very much aware of the importance of the railway to the people of Tralee and considerable progress is being made, particularly with the upgrading of the Mallow-Killarney section being completed by end-2000 and the replacement of the signalling system on the entire stretch of track.  In considering the overall investment needs of Iarnród Éireann in the post-1999 period, I assure the Deputy that the specific needs of the Tralee-Killarney section of the line will be fully taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for coming to the House at this late hour.  I draw his attention to a difficulty with post-leaving certificate courses in Portlaoise vocational school.  In the academic year 1997-98, the school had 117 PLC students following seven courses.  County Laois has no third level facility and it has the lowest level of third level participation in Ireland. The PLC courses have run successfully in recent years and have expanded and developed, so it is a pity the Minister has not allowed a further expansion this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the next academic year, the school applied and received departmental approval for 16 PLC courses, one of which was an interesting and exciting new course in tele-services which attracts substantial additional funding.  Some 295 students applied for places across the range of PLC courses.  This has a staffing and funding consequence and I remind the Minister that in 1996 the school successfully appealed its allocation and the number of places was allowed to be in accordance with the applications.  Extra staff is required, there is no great problem in finding space within the school, and almost 300 students have applied, so it is a pity the letter of approval from the Department to the chief executive officer of Laois VEC only approved 137 places.  This position must be improved and I hope the Minister will allow the school authorities to develop these courses in accordance with many of his public <Col N="1046" /> utterances since taking office, in which he stated his commitment to increasing PLC places. Although the Minister appears to have capped the numbers in Portlaoise he has allowed for new centres in County Laois, and it is a pity the courses have been spread over the county rather than concentrated in the centre of excellence that is Portlaoise vocational school.  I hope he will allow the school to continue to expand and give students a chance to remain in the rapidly developing county town rather than having to take courses elsewhere.  A commitment is needed urgently, given that planning for the forthcoming academic year is well under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue because it gives me a chance to set the record straight.  I reject the central charge in the Deputy's contribution and we may have to discuss the matter further because there appears to be mistakes in the figures he presented to the House.  I have approved 257 places on PLC courses in County Laois schools in 1998-99, of which 197 are in the VEC sector.  This reflects an 82 per cent increase over the enrolment level of 141 pupils for the county in 1997-98.  I have also approved five additional wholetime teaching staff for the VEC to enable four new courses to be put in place.</P>
      <P>Participation on the programme in the country overall was significantly increased last year &mdash; in 1996-97 some 18,712 people participated on PLC courses and for 1997-98 I approved 21,263 places, which was a substantial national increase.  Some 22,727 places on the programme have been approved for 1998-99, thereby providing for an increase of 4,015 places in the two school years since the Government took office, compared with an increase of 1,035 places in the preceding three years.  This is a significant expansion and has been accompanied by investment of £20 million for post-leaving certificate and apprenticeship places under the scientific and technology investment fund, which is the first time there has been a specific capital grant for PLC places.  It has also been accompanied by the introduction of maintenance grants for all pupils who enrol from September 1998, the provision of £1.5 million to date for equipment in the centres approved for tele-services courses in 1997, and the establishment of a new student support scheme towards the cost of placing tele-services students abroad &mdash; we did that last September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PLC sector has proved its capacity to respond rapidly to changing skill needs, and I have taken steps to ensure increases in approval level in 1998-99 are being targeted at strategic areas such as tele-services.  In that context the numbers on tele-services courses will increase from 435 in 1997-98 to 1,505 in 1998-99.  The number of centres is being increased by 15 to 35 and there will be investment of the order of £75,000 for equipment in each of the new centres.  Among the centres which will benefit from this is Portlaoise <Col N="1047" /> vocational school, and that is a significant investment in terms of this programme.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme for education in the years ahead will include considerable investment in tackling disadvantage, ensuring that support services are provided to enable young people at risk to maximise their participation in and benefit from schooling, ensuring that programmes are relevant to fulfil social and economic needs, and that second chance opportunities are provided for those who have missed out in their initial schooling.  Systematic investment in in-service training, certification and assessment and evaluation systems will also be provided to ensure a high quality, cost-effective system.</P>
    <P>I have already allowed for a substantial increase in PLC provision in County Laois for 1998-99.  If problems materialise when final decisions on course choices are made by students in September, my Department will re-examine the position.  Arrangements have been made for officials of my Department to meet Deputies for the area on Tuesday, 14 July to discuss the matter further.</P>

If one compares enrolments in Portlaoise, Abbeyleix and Mountrath, in 1997-98 there were 117 enrolments in Portlaoise alone and in 1998-99 there will be 137, which is a substantial increase.  In the FE centre in Abbeyleix, no places were provided in 1997-98 but for the next academic year we are providing 40 places.</P>
      <P>In St. Aonghus, Mountrath, we are providing 20 where none was provided in 1997-98.  In Heywood community school, there was six provided in 1997-98 and we are providing 40.  In Ballinakill, 18 were provided in 1997-98 and we are providing 20.  We are going from 141 to 257.  I do not see how it could be argued I have been less than generous in Portlaoise or County Laois &mdash; the opposite is the case.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a gabháil leis an Aire as ucht go bhfuil sé anseo.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh deascéal aige dom.  In reply to a parliamentary question which I tabled to the Minister for Education and Science on <Col N="1048" /> Wednesday, June 24 last, asking him the reason the educational psychological service for primary schools was not extended to Waterford and the proposals, if any, he had to make adequate provision, he outlined how his Department, in collaboration with Mary Immaculate College of Education in Limerick, had recently recruited 15 psychologists to work in the primary sector.</P>
      <P>He further stated that even after this increase in staffing, there remains a number of areas, including County Waterford, where it was not possible for his Department to provide a psychological service for primary schools.  He said the 15 psychologists had been appointed on merit after an open competition during which all candidates were interviewed.</P>
      <P>He then made an extraordinary statement which requires further clarification.  He said &ldquo;on this occasion however, none of the successful candidates was available to work in the Waterford area&rdquo;.  Will the Minister answer the following questions?  Were none of the successful candidates available to work in the Waterford area because the Minister so decided or because none of them was prepared to work there?  To what extent were candidates allowed dictate where they should be located?  Did any candidate or candidates apply who were willing to be located in Waterford?  Is it correct that as far as recruitment was concerned, the tail wagged the dog on this occasion?  How can the Minister justify a situation where only one part of the south eastern region, south Tipperary, has a primary school psychological service?</P>
      <P>Before the 15 new appointments, the post primary schools psychological service was as follows: one psychologist based in Drogheda serving primary schools designated as disadvantaged in Dublin 15 and serving post-primary schools in part of one county and throughout another; 19 psychologists located in Dublin serving primary schools designated as disadvantaged in Dublin city as well as post primary schools in approximately 12 areas; seven psychologists based in Cork serving primary schools designated as disadvantaged in Cork city, primary schools in Tipperary and post primary schools in six areas; one psychologist based in Limerick serving schools designated as disadvantaged in Limerick city; two psychologists on special projects and two psychologists on career breaks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 15 additional psychologists were allocated as follows: one psychologist in the north west serving Sligo town and its environs; two in the west serving Galway city, County Galway and County Mayo; two in the mid-west serving parts of Counties Clare, Limerick and Tipperary; two in the south serving north Kerry and east Cork; one in the south east serving south Tipperary, based in Clonmel; one in the midlands serving County Offaly, based in Tullamore; four in the east serving west County Dublin, north Kildare, south County Dublin and south County Meath, based in Dublin; two in the north east serving <Col N="1049" /> Louth, north County Dublin, east County Meath, based in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am pleased for all the areas which now have a psychological service.  However, the Minister stands accused of blatant discrimination against the constituency I represent.  I demand fair play for primary education in Waterford city and county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the allegation that I engaged in blatant discrimination against any area.  I accept the advice on this matter and we need to do more in the development of a national psychological service.  Deputy O'Shea was in Government for four years and for some reason Waterford still did not merit the appointment of a psychologist.  We hope to deal with that situation this year with the appointment of more psychologists.  The entire area will not be covered so we have to do it on a gradual basis.</P>
      <P>The Department first established a schools psychological service in the autumn of 1965.  Its main function at that time was to organise and support the introduction of guidance in second level schools.  All schools in this sector have a psychologist assigned to them.  Psychological advice to pupils, parents and teachers is provided as time and resources allow.</P>
      <P>With regard to primary schools, a pilot project to develop a psychological service in two areas began in September 1990.  The designated areas were west Tallaght, Clondalkin and south Tipperary.  The project involved the employment of four additional psychologists on temporary contracts.  The aim of the project was to gain experience of the development and provision of such a service.  This was necessary before an extension to primary schools in other areas could be considered.  The project completed its pilot phase in September 1993, was evaluated and was put on a permanent basis in the two areas in early 1994.</P>
      <P>A further ten psychologists were then appointed in 1995 to allow for the expansion of the psychological service in the primary sector. These psychologists were assigned, as a matter of priority, to primary schools serving disadvantaged areas in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick. ln addition, primary schools in the original pilot project in west Tallaght, Clondalkin and south Tipperary continue to have access to the psychological service.</P>
      <P>This means that from 1995, 402 primary schools were eligible to avail of the psychological service. While this reflected a gradual improvement on the previous situation, there still remained more than 350,000 pupils in almost 3,000 national schools who did not have access to a schools' psychological service.  My Department's psychologists are involved in casework with individual pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the current urgent need in the primary sector, I decided last year to initiate, in collaboration with Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick, a development project for the psychological service.  The college has <Col N="1050" /> recruited 15 educational psychologists on short-term contracts to meet some of the urgent needs in primary schools.  Their recent appointment has led to a noticeable improvement in provision in the sector.  However, it was always clear that there would still remain many schools and areas which would be disappointed in the short term in their wish for access to a schools' psychological service.</P>
    <P>It was important, therefore, that objective and transparent criteria should be used for the selection of the schools.  These criteria were recommended to me by officials of my Department and the chief inspector had a key role.  A general consideration was that this development project should provide further useful information on what kind of psychological service might be needed in typical clusters of schools throughout the country and how the needs might most effectively be met.  The evaluation report on the project will, therefore, inform the implementation phase of the national educational psychological service.</P>
    <P>The selection of schools was to allow some access to the psychological service for each region, including as many counties as possible. Account was taken of the need for a quality service.  What was felt to be a realistic number of schools per psychologist was, therefore, selected. In general, the psychologists were assigned areas based on centres of population.  This was to allow for a focused, local, accessible service with effective links with community resources.  Geographically compact areas were favoured as these allow for an efficient use of the psychologists' time.</P>
    <P>It was considered desirable for each area to include some designated disadvantaged and some non-disadvantaged schools.  This would allow for some of the disadvantaged children who are in schools not designated as such to have access to the psychological service for the first time.  A rural-urban mix was also considered to be desirable as, apart from south Tipperary, children from rural communities had not previously had access to the schools' psychological service.  I was anxious also for some Gaeltacht children to have access to the service.  Selection of areas also had to take account of the availability of the psychologists who had been appointed to work in them.</P>
    <P>Including the previously existing psychological service, something in the order of 725 primary schools, located in all eight regions and in 15 counties, now have access to help from 28 educational psychologists.  I am aware that there are inevitably still several significant centres of population, including some with considerable numbers of disadvantaged pupils, which have not yet been assigned to one of my Department's psychologists.  This is a product of years of neglect and cannot be dealt with overnight.  Their needs will be borne in mind in future.  It is not possible to meet the needs in all areas at the same time so a phased introduction of the service is necessary.</P>
    <P>One of the key priorities of the programme for Government, An Action Plan for the Millennium, <Col N="1051" /> is the establishment of a national educational psychological service.  I established a planning group last September to prepare proposals for this service.  This is in recognition of the need to adopt a consistent and well planned approach to the provision of such a service to students and schools.  The planning group is representative of agencies which currently provide psychological services as well as of the main client groups.  I expect to receive the report of the planning group in the very near future.  I understand its work is practically completed.</P>
    <P>I am confident we can look forward to the continued <Col N="1052" /> development of an educational psychological service on a planned basis.  The employment of the 15 additional psychologists this year is an interim measure to achieve an immediate expansion.  However, it is my intention that there will be an educational psychological service available to all schools.  This will be introduced in a phased way and I am sure the needs of schools in the Waterford area will not be overlooked in making this provision.  I will take on board the Deputy's concerns.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 to 18, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The NESC continues to play an important role in the development of public policy, especially in the context of social partnership.</P>
      <P>The planning stage of the benchmarking project under Partnership 2000 has been completed and discussed by the council.  The current phase is the undertaking of a broad benchmark analysis, complemented by studies in specific areas.</P>
      <P>The broad analysis is intended to benchmark Ireland's performance over time and relative to our EU and OECD partners in terms of social inclusion, employment and competitiveness.  The recently published work of the competitiveness council is particularly useful in this regard, as are several recent OECD and EU analyses.  The current phase is seeking, in particular, to resolve significant problems regarding the availability and comparability of data.</P>
      <P>In addition, a number of specific studies are in progress &mdash; on incomes, taxation, education and childcare.  These papers will be considered by the new council over the coming months.  Overall, the benchmarking project is a complex undertaking which will be a valuable resource in monitoring progress in the final stages of Partnership 2000 and in the preparation of a new partnership agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to NESC report 102 on population distribution and economic development, that report was referred to relevant Ministers and Departments for consideration.  The analysis and <Col N="1054" /> conclusions of the report are extremely useful in developing policy on regional and local development. They will be drawn on by the relevant Departments in their continuing work in these areas.  The report is also an important resource for the regional authorities in formulating their views in relation to the next national development plan.  It is particularly relevant for policy on rural development.</P>
    <P>The principal mechanism through which responses to the report are being gathered is through an interdepartmental committee which is currently preparing a White Paper on rural development, under the direction of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  A wide consultation process has started, involving regional seminars and the inviting of submissions.  The White Paper will be comprehensive and will reflect many of the issues covered by the NESC report.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to ask the NESC to report on the question of Objective I status in the context of the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>I have stated here on a number of occasions any change in the country's single region status would have to be approved by the Commission and that the overriding objective is to maximise Structural Fund transfers to Ireland as a whole under the next round.  The strategy to be pursued will be determined by the Government in the context of the negotiations on Agenda 2000 over coming months.</P>
    <P>Regarding the next budget, arrangements are being put in place for discussions with the social partners in the context of Partnership 2000.  The upcoming plenary meeting, which I will chair, will, as I have already told the House, focus on the themes of social inclusion and equality, and modernisation of the public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Strategic Plan for the development of the forestry sector set out targets of 20 per cent for broadleaf planting, 20 per cent for diverse conifer planting and 60 per cent for sitka spruce planting on a national level.  I feel that it is too early to revisit these targets which after all were set only in 1996.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting however that significant progress has already been achieved with broadleaves. The 20 per cent target is now being met and this compares favourably with the early years of this decade when broadleaf planting was only at 3 per cent to 4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard the current grant and premium schemes include: a new category called 20 per cent diverse which will result in all sites to be planted having at least 20 per cent of a second conifer species and a 10 per cent broadleaf content, site permitting; the elimination of the existing non-diverse category which effectively ends the practice of monoculture or single species planting sites; a supplement to the loss of income <Col N="1056" /> premium payable to farmers who plant a better quality land.  Moving to better quality land will improve the opportunities for the planting of more diverse conifer species and broadleaves and an emphasis on the traditional Irish-Continental model of broadleaf planting which entails a higher stocking of plants per hectare in order to improve timber quality.  The grant levels have been adjusted to reflect the higher costs which the modification entails.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise the need to promote greater diversity and in that context the bias towards the diverse planting of conifers and of broadleaves, including in the new grant aid premium rates, to which I have referred, is particularly relevant. However, quality of land is crucial in dictating the opportunity for diversity of species.  Many broadleaved species are very demanding of land quality while the conifer species are more productive on poorer type soils while also, of course, being necessary to meet the economic targets specified in the plan.</P>
    <P>An assessment of species will, of course, be included in any ongoing review of the strategic plan.</P>

      <P>Fish and shellfish, and in particular landings from the Irish Sea, are regularly sampled and tested by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  The results of their monitoring, which are regularly published, show that the consumption of fish or shellfish, including lobsters, does not give rise to any concerns which would be significant for public health in Ireland.  Nevertheless, we need to be constantly vigilant.  I can assure the House that the situation will continue to be monitored rigorously, and that there will be no relaxation in the efforts of this Government to monitor and bring about substantial improvements in the Irish Sea marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comprehensive package of conservation measures which I renewed for 1998 was put in place in 1997 on foot of the recommendations of the Salmon Management Task Force.  The task force confirmed the necessity for action to address the serious decline in salmon stocks and to secure the future for all legitimate salmon interests whether commercial or recreational.  I renewed the measures on the basis of the catch data and stock assessment advice and in line with the precautionary principle.  All of the advice available to me points to the need to maintain at minimum the present regime in its totality.  I am sure the Deputies concerned will understand and acknowledge the conservation imperative inherent in these measures.  The conservation measures contain gains as well as losses for both commercial and recreational fishermen including, as part of the overall package, the legalisation of <Col N="1058" /> monofilament nets which had long been sought by the driftnet fishermen.  The restriction on driftnetting for salmon to June and July only, which is a general restriction, should be seen in the context of the monofilament concession.  I might also clarify that the fishing season is 36 days, not 32 as suggested by the Deputy, and that nets have not been shortened under the new conservation regime.</P>
    <P>Initial reports on the salmon fishing season in the Kerry region and elsewhere suggest that it has been poor to date.  However, the season is only half way through and I understand that in most years in the region, a large percentage of the catch tends to be taken in July.</P>
    <P>These conservation measures are an intrinsic part of my salmon management strategy which includes the ongoing process of assessment and consultation on tagging and quota regimes, moving to the catchment management approach and improved scientific data on salmon stocks.  My strategies to address the overall conservation management and development needs of the salmon resource take full account of the Salmon Management Task Force and the CFB five year plan.  I will continue to build on the hard won consensus on salmon management which the task force achieved so admirably and in which the chairman of the Ballydavid Fishermen's Association played a critical and valuable role.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to meet the chairman and representatives of the association to hear their views at first hand.  I believe that all salmon fishermen including the Ballydavid association recognise the long-term critical importance of the measures now in place for the stocks on which they themselves depend.  I am also sure that I can rely on the support of the Deputies in giving priority to the conservation of our unique salmon resource and in asking for all concerned to comply and co-operate with those measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent action by the German Government in relation to shipments of nuclear waste and I share the concern that prompted their decision.  From an Irish point of view, I am concerned about the traffic in vessels carrying nuclear material around our coasts and in particular about the possible dangers to public <Col N="1059" /> health and the environment arising from any accident involving ships carrying such material, particularly collisions and sinkings.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been campaigning for some time for improvements to the conditions under which nuclear materials are transported around our coasts, and I would like to acknowledge the contribution that Deputy Gilmore made to that process during his time as Minister of State at the Department of the Marine.  As he will be aware, however, the question of a ban on the passage of ships carrying nuclear materials is fraught with difficulties, given the right of innocent passage enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Ireland has been successful in achieving major improvements to the International Maritime Organisation's Code for the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships, known as the INF Code. The code regulates the construction, equipment and operation of ships engaged in the carriage of INF materials.  Such ships must also comply with the IMO's Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS, Convention and the International Maritime Dangerous Goods, IMDG, Code.  The flasks used for the carriage of radioactive materials must comply with the International Atomic Energy Agency's regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials.</P>
      <P>Last November I travelled to London to address the 20th Assembly of the IMO on the subject of the INF Code and to press the assembly to agree that the code should be adopted as a mandatory binding code by all IMO member states.  As I reported to the House on 10 December last, agreement was reached at the IMO to make the code mandatory and the draft final document has been referred to the Maritime Safety Committee of the IMO for adoption.  I regard this as a very important step forward in improving the conditions under which nuclear materials are transported by sea, but I want to assure the House that I will be continuing my efforts to bring about further improvements in this area.</P>
      <P>Following the meeting of the IMO Assembly, the UK and French Governments indicated a willingness to enter into bilateral agreements concerning the notification of shipments of nuclear waste near our coasts.  Discussions are currently under way at official level.  I welcome this commitment by the two Governments, which ensures that the carriage near our coasts of materials which require special care can be closely monitored.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>Last year the UK authorities revealed that previously unreported instances of dumping had taken place in Beaufort's Dyke between Northern Ireland and Scotland in the 1950s.  Subsequent archival investigations revealed further instances of dumping at a number of other locations in the Irish Sea and around the UK during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  In addition to Beaufort's Dyke, dumping had taken place in the Holyhead Deep, the Firth of Forth, the North Sea, the Firth of Clyde and off the Isle of Arran.  The material dumped was solid packaged radioactive waste.  In addition, a number of instances were identified where liquid wastes containing small amounts of radioactivity were dumped at sea.  These instances occurred in the North Sea, the Firth of Forth, Liverpool Bay and, possibly, Morcambe Bay and the Humber Estuary.  None of the material came from Sellafield.</P>
      <P>On 27 May last I advised the House that the work of the task force on the dumping of radioactive materials in the maritime area, which was established in the wake of the UK revelations, was at an advanced stage and that I expected to receive its report in June.  It has not proved possible for the task force to complete its work within this timeframe.  Nevertheless, I am anxious to publish the report shortly.</P>

      <P>My key priority is to maximise the contribution of sea fisheries to the national economy and coastal regions.  I will continue, in close consultation with the industry, to pursue my specific objectives for the Irish fleet which are to modernise its structures, enhance quality, safety and efficiency and to maximise sustainable fishing opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> The grant aid package which I launched in Castletownbere last week, combined with the tax incentives which I secured in the 1998 Act, puts in place the first integrated programme for the renewal of the whitefish fleet.  This programme will support investment to deliver a safer, more competitive and efficient whitefish fleet.  The £40 million investment programme will provide capital grants of up to 45 per cent of the eligible cost of a new vessel up to 15 per cent of the eligible cost of a second hand vessel and 50 per cent of the cost of safety equipment.  I secured in this year's Finance Act two key capital allowances reliefs designed to attract capital into the whitefish sector and make it a competitive commercial option for investors.  I firmly believe that this unique package of measures will have a real impact in terms of safeguarding jobs and delivering quality and consistency of supply right across the whitefish sector with benefits for the fleet, the processing sector and the consumer market.</P>
    <P>There is significant scope for continuing development of fishing opportunities by the Irish fleet through sustainable exploitation of quota and non-quota species.  Some quotas remain under-utilised, in particular nephrops to the south and west of Ireland and cod off our northern and western coasts.  In addition, many stocks are not subject to quota including a number of valuable inshore stocks such as lobster, whelk and crabs which are giving a high value return to Irish fishermen at present.  Deepwater species and blue whiting offer further tangible opportunities.  Irish fishermen fished for blue whiting in Irish waters for the first time last year, landing around 30,000 tonnes.  Excellent catches are being achieved this year as well.</P>
    <P>I will continue to take every opportunity to advance Ireland's case for an equitable share of the EU fish quota and to ensure that EU fisheries management, conservation, enforcement and marketing strategies are geared to ensure a level playing field in the interests of the Irish fishing sector.</P>

      <P>The assessment of national wild salmon stocks is primarily the responsibility of the Marine Institute, in consultation with the Central Regional Fisheries Boards as well as the Salmon Research Agency.  Stock assessment is based on scientific tagging programmes and the collection of data from fish counters on a number of salmon <Col N="1062" /> rivers.  Preliminary data for 1998 confirms that the run of salmon this year has been slow.  I have requested a mid season update on the state of stocks from the Marine Institute, together with an assessment and report on the stocks by reference to all currently available data, including 1997 statistics and the conservation measures in place.</P>
      <P>I renewed the 1997 conservation measures for salmon for the 1998 season as part of my strategic objective to conserve and rebuild salmon stocks in the interest of all legitimate stakeholders in the salmon fishery.  There is a priority need to maintain the salmon conservation regime as a whole, while pressing ahead with initiatives on water quality and protection of the freshwater habitat at catchment management and salmon management strategies generally.</P>
      <P>As I advised in my replies of 27 May and 23 June last year, I have directed the Central Fisheries Board to give immediate and top priority to implementation of the six point water quality action plan.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the wide-ranging concerns that have been expressed by several organisations and by members of the general public in relation to the indiscriminate use of jet skis and fast power craft in certain inland and coastal waters.  Vessels known as personal water craft, together with speed boats, are the most commonly cited craft which have given rise to public concern.</P>
      <P>While the Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boat) Regulations, 1992, were introduced to prevent these craft operating in certain areas, the Deputy will be aware from my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 27 of 27 May 1998 of the difficulties concerning the implementation of these regulations.</P>
      <P>My overriding concern as Minister with responsibility for the prevention of loss of life at sea and the promotion of sustainable development of marine tourism and leisure is to ensure that such craft are operated in a safe and responsible manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> I have identified the need for action on a number of fronts.</P>
    <P>A Marine Safety Working Group, MSWG, operates under the chairmanship of the Director of the Irish Marine Emergency Service of my Department, with the aim of creating and communicating marine safety information and messages, to endeavour to reduce accidents and to prevent the loss of life in Irish waters.  The Marine Safety Working Group meets regularly and has produced a number of &ldquo;Safety on the Water&rdquo; booklets, leaflets and posters for widespread dissemination. I have asked this group to prepare urgently a safety code which will address the safe operation of jet skis and other fast recreational power craft in Ireland.  The purpose of the code will be to heighten awareness of the requirement to operate such craft in a safe manner with particular regard to the safety of other users of our water based leisure resource.  In drawing up the code, the group will draw on the existing Irish and international experience in this field; I have asked the group to produce an interim code for dissemination in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>I intend to ensure that this safety code is communicated to purchasers and users of jet skis and fast craft.  Suppliers of such craft will be asked to assist in disseminating such information, whether purchased or hired.  Local authorities will also be requested to post the code in areas where jet skis and fast craft are used.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Marine Institute, whose functions include the promotion of the sustainable development of the marine leisure resource, to immediately examine, with the benefit of independent expertise as necessary, the options for the management of the operation of such craft. I intend that the examination will, among other things, look at appropriate statutory and non-statutory models for management and promotion of the safe use of such craft and that the institute will liase closely with my Department in the matter. The institute will draw on management models at a number of locations in Ireland and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I intend to explore further with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the appropriate role for local authorities in the control of recreational power craft, with particular reference to local authorities' functions in the development and management of water based leisure in their own areas.  In any event, the Marine Institute's examination of the matter will involve assessing the most appropriate local authority input.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting the published coastal zone management report and discussion document, commissioned by the Departments of the Environment and Local Government; the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources; and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands which was prepared by Brady Shipman Martin.  The discussion document identified that, within the tourism and leisure area, policies of limitation and curtailment <Col N="1065" /> on tourism and leisure development and use are likely to be necessary to deal with the increasing pressures, possibly coupled with a greater emphasis on quality rather than quantity.  The proposals in the report and discussion document for zonation of coastal areas will clearly have to address the use of the coastal zone for marine leisure, including the operation of recreational fast power craft.  Accordingly, proposals for regulating such craft must take cognisance of the context in which wider proposals are being considered for coastal zone management.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that the control of recreational fast power craft must be addressed on a number of fronts.  My immediate concern is to ensure that progress is made as a matter of urgency in raising safety awareness among the users of such craft. The use of statutory mechanisms to regulate such craft is complex from both safety and legal perspectives but I am determined that, if statutory measures are identified as being necessary, the various public agencies will agree on a plan of action to implement them.</P>

      <P>There has been longstanding co-operation between the authorities North and South on matters of mutual interest in the inland fisheries area, with tangible benefits for the resource and the communities it supports.  In that context the work of the Foyle Fisheries Commission and the Joint Committee for the Protection of the Erne are worthy examples.  Current joint investment projects under the INTERREG and Peace and Reconciiiation programmes include a £2 million project to rehabilitate salmon and a £800,000 project to develop the eel resource in the Erne system.  The active promotion of joint projects under these programmes is continuing in the inland fisheries area.</P>

      <P>The salmon management task force recommended, inter alia, the introduction of a <Col N="1066" /> total allowable catch and quota regime to achieve realtime management of salmon stocks, predicated on the principle of equitable sharing of the resource between all legitimate interests.  The report offered a possible management model and criteria for setting the TAC initially and for percentage shares, while making it clear that quota apportionment and rebalancing would be a matter of policy.</P>
      <P>To take forward the practical work of assessment of the task force's proposals, I commissioned the Marine Institute to prepare a technical report on the devising, implementation, monitoring and enforcement of a TAC and quota based management system.  I published that report in order to inform and assist the consultative process with all players and organisations on the practical, legal and resource implications inherent in these proposals.  The consultation and feedback process has recently been augmented by a working party involving the Department, the CFB and the managers of the regional fisheries boards which is developing a collective analysis of the most practicable and cost efficient approach to the incremental translation of these concepts into reality.  Future directions will be critically informed by this constructive and practical exercise and feedback from all interested parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of targeted quality training programmes for the dry-hold herring fleet and herring processing sectors was one of a number of recommendations made by the task force on the managemement and marketing of herring, which I established in November 1997 with a wideranging mandate, and which reported to me in March this year.  As I have previously advised the House I have secured Government approval in pnnciple to the taking forward of this and the other recommendations of the task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality training programmes for the dry-hold herring fleet and herring processing sector will be implemented by my Department and BIM.  The objective is to improve standards and operational practices in the dry-hold herring fleet, where specific handling and discharging challenges exist, and in the herring processing sector with a view to maximising product quality and value.  The fleet programme will provide for intensive quality haisling for the skippers and crews of eligible vessels and for the implementaffon of on-board quality systems and practices <Col N="1067" /> while the programme for the processing sector will provide intensive quality training for key plant personnel and for the implementaffon of an in-plant quality programme.</P>
    <P>The programme for the dry-hold herring fleet provides for the payment of training grants to skippers/crews and to owners of eligible vessels in order to incentivise participation and to achieve real results.  Crews will receive a flat-rate grant of £750 while the maximum grant applicable to vessel owners will be £7,500.  A training grant of £10,000 will apply to plants participating in the quality training programme for the herring processing sector.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that the programme be introduced before the start of this year's autumn fishery.  Given that the programme for the herring processing sector will complement that for the dry-hold herring fleet it was considered that both programmes should proceed in tandem.  My Department and BIM are currently finalising the details of both programmes, including funding, with a view to their introduction before the autumn fishery.</P>

      <Quest>whether commercial oil or gas prospects have been found on or off shore; whether there have been any positive indications in relation to other formal mineral deposits; whether sufficient exploration is taking place to sufficiently advance the mineral exploration programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in regard to oil and gas, offshore gas is being produced from two fields located about 30 miles offshore Cork, in the Celtic Sea.  The Kinsale Head gas field was discovered by Marathon in 1971, declared commercial in 1973 and went into production in 1978.  The Ballycotton gas field was also discovered by Marathon in 1989 and production from there commenced in 1991.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently approved the issue of a petroleum lease to Providence Resources over the Helvick Oilfield in block 49/9 in the North Celtic Sea.  While this is a marginal field, a potential for commercial development has been established and it merited the granting of a petroleum lease.  Providence Resources now has two years to submit a field plan of development for my approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996 Enterprise Oil discovered gas in a well drilled in the Slyne Trough but despite their best efforts they were unable to test this discovery because of mechanical problems.  They are now about to start an appraisal well on this prospect and expect to remain on location for about two and a half months.  Since exploration offshore began in 1970 there have been many instances of <Col N="1068" /> oil and gas being produced from exploration wells on test but none of these have proved to be commercial.</P>
    <P>We now have a high number of petroleum exploration licences in place.  At present 26 licences are held and each carries a specific work programme appropriate to the area held under licence.  The high number of licences is a result of the revised licensing terms introduced in 1992, the consequent licensing rounds in 1994, 1995 and the most successful of all, the Rockall Trough licensing round last year, which gave rise to 11 new licences.</P>
    <P>In addition, an area covering 156 blocks in the South Porcupine Basin is now the subject of a licensing round, the closing date for which is 15 December this year.  I expect to be in a position to announce the results and award the licences early in the second quarter next year.  This will give successful applicants the opportunity to acquire seismic data during the suitable weather window period of 1999.</P>
    <P>Apart from licensing rounds held from time to time over specified areas, an open-door system is also in operation whereby applications may be made at any time to my Department for offshore acreage which is not closed or already held under any authorisation.</P>
    <P>Last year 25,874 line kilometres of 2D seismic and 470 square kilometres of 3D seismic were acquired and that was a record for seismic acquisition in Ireland.  Plans from seismic companies for 1998 indicate that it also will be a good year for seismic acquisition.</P>
    <P>In regard to the onshore, two licensing options are held over the North West Carboniferous Basin.  The licensees have undertaken a work programme over the area to assess the potential for gas accumulations in the area.</P>
    <P>In regard to the onshore minerals there is also an ongoing programme of exploration for non-petroleum minerals by holders of prospecting licences (PLs) under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995.  There are approximately 400 of these PLs current at present covering 30 per cent of the country and focused on a wide range of metallic, precious and industrial minerals. Where an economic deposit is identified it will normally result in an application for a State mining facility in parallel with the application for planning permission and integrated pollution control licence.  There are currently 16 such facilities being worked.  Explorationists for these minerals expend approximately £7 million per annum in this country and we have successfully maintained this level of investment in the face of huge worldwide competition for exploration funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The western lakes project has been receiving ongoing funding under the Tourism Angling Measure (TAM) since early 1995 with the important objective of rehabilitating the Corrib, Mask and Cara Lakes as prime brown trout fisheries for domestic and tourism angling.  The amount of funds allocated for each of the years of the project is: £1.035 million in 1995, £0.220 million in 1997 and £0.800 million in 1998.  This brings the total investment in the western lakes project to over £2 million and is nearly 12 per cent of the total funding available over the whole period under the Tourism Angling Measure.  The £800,000 provided in 1998 is over 30 per cent of the funding approved this year.  This was the amount recommended by the Tourism Angling Measure Management Committee for this project.</P>
      <P>The objective of the Tourism Angling Measure, which is a component of the Operational Programme for Tourism, is to develop the national angling product to best international standards and significantly increase the number of tourist anglers visiting the country.  Angling has tremendous benefits from the tourism perspective as a year round activity often in non-traditional tourism locations, delivering significant local economic return as well as contributing to the tourism sector overall.  The main flagship investments under this measure have been in the west.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 46 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>I have previously outlined the circumstances in which I secured in the face of overwhelming opposition a four year stay on the ban on driftnet fishing for tuna at last months Fisheries Council. I also won assurances on the availability of research funding from the Commission to develop alternative techniques, experimental fishing programmes and technology transfer with the objective of assisting Irish tuna fishermen to convert to other means of fishing for the species over the four year period.  It also provides a further window of opportunity to pursue additional financial support measures to help existing players in the fishery in the transition from driftnets.</P>
      <P>The Council also decided, as part of the compromise to postpone the introduction of the ban for four years, that the number of authorised driftnet participants from 1998 shall not exceed 60 per cent of those with a track record in the fishery in the period 1995-1997.  The practical implications of that limitation are being assessed by the Department in consultation with the industry by reference to patterns of participation in the fishery in recent years, opportunities this season for vessels to begin to diversify into other unrestricted fishing techniques and a possible level of demand for first time access to the driftnet fishery this year by fishermen without any previous involvement.  My immediate priority is to ensure that traditional participants in the driftnet fishery are, within the new parameters, accommodated during the four seasons remaining before the ban while working with them to achieve conversion to other economically viable techniques which will ensure their continued participation beyond 2002.</P>

      <P>Port Oriel Pier, Clogherhead is owned by Louth County Council and responsibility for its repair and maintenance rests with the local authority.  Accordingly, it is a matter for the local authority in the first instance to determine what works may be required at Clogherhead.</P>
      <P>In 1996 and 1997 my Department provided grant aid of £298,996 to Louth County Council towards development works at Clogherhead.  I understand that a technical study of further infrastructural needs at the pier is in progress and will be submitted to my Department when completed. Any development proposals arising from the study will be considered in the context of the present limited funding available for the development of fishery harbours.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for overseeing the allocation of EU funding under seaports' measures for the Operational Programme for Transport, the Ireland Wales Maritime INTERREG Community Initiative and the Cohesion Fund for the period to 1999, as approved by the relevant monitoring committees for each programme.</P>
      <P>Over the period 1994-99 some £160 million will have been invested in Irish commercial seaports which includes EU co-financing of approximately £80 million.  Port authorities or other project sponsors raise the matching co-financing from their own resources or through commercial bank borrowings.</P>
      <P>Examples of typical projects, which are provided for under the eligibility criteria of the relevant programmes from which co-financing is allocated, include handling equipment; berthage facilities; ferry terminal facilities; improvements in port access; capital dredging and repair of structural faults.</P>
      <P>The following is an indicative listing of EU aid to projects at commercial seaports for the 1994-1999 period:</P>

    <P>My Department's Vote makes provision of £2.965 million in connection with the upgrading and development of infrastructure and facilities at fishery harbours during 1998.  The locations in respect of which works are proposed this year are as follows: Ardgroom, County Cork, Burtonport, County Donegal, Carlingford, County Louth, Castletownbere, County Cork, Cromane, County Kerry, Crosshaven, County Cork, Dingle, County Kerry, Dunmore East, County Waterford, Howth, County Dublin, Killybegs, County Donegal, Portmagee, County Kerry and Rossaveal, County Galway.  I am considering also the provision of funding for further works at Kilmore <Col N="1073" /> Quay, County Wexford, and expect to finalise the matter shortly.</P>
    <P>A further sum of £300,000 is available for development works at smaller harbours.  A portion of this funding has been committed to development projects at Cleggan and Rossadilisk in County Galway.  I am critically reviewing, at present, proposals for utilisation of the remaining funding.</P>

      <P>A recent application was made under the Tourism Angling Measure TAM, to fund the setting aside of commercial licences for six years in a particular catchment was not successful on the basis of EU Commission advice that such proposals are not eligible under the present scheme.

      <P>My Department has commissioned a study to be carried out in two phases by economic consultants. This independent study will assist the working group in producing as comprehensive and robust a consideration of the subject as possible. The overall purpose of the study is to consider and evaluate the economic, social, budgetary and administrative impact of the introduction of a basic income system.</P>
      <P>The first phase, which examines the costs and distributional analysis of a basic income, is currently under way.  The second phase, which is presently under tender, will consider the dynamic effects of such a system from a broad economic and social perspective and will draw on the findings of phase I. It is expected the overall study will be completed by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Once the findings of the independent study are available, the question of a basic income will be considered in detail by the Government and a Green Paper will be published as per An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <P>The Human Resources Development Operational Programme 1994-99 is the primary channel through which EU Structural Funds support is directed to Irelands vocational education and training measures.  One of the actions supported in the operational programme is a local enterprise measure, implemented by FÁS.  The measure, which is aimed at providing support for the development of employment through a locally based approach, includes, as one component, the activities of the Co-Operative Development Council.  The local enterprise measure was included in the human resources development operational programme in recognition of the fact that the establishment of small businesses, through local development, can play an important part in job-creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council was set up in 1988 under the terms of the Programme for National Recovery.  Its terms of reference are: to stimulate greater <Col N="1077" /> awareness about co-operatives and their potential for development and employment; to identify the needs of co-operatives and worker co-operatives in particular; to identify and seek to correct gaps in current provisions; and to monitor the work programme of the co-operative development unit of FÁS.</P>
    <P>The following members were appointed to the council by the FÁS board in 1988: Mr. Bill Attley, (Chairman); Mr. Cathal Ó Finneadha, a nominee of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Mrs. Anne Forde, representing the Irish League of Credit Unions; Mr. Stephen McCarthy, representing ICTU; Mr. Tom Redmond, representing the Irish Federation of Workers Co-Operatives; Mr. Patrick Pearse, representing the FUE (subsequently IBEC); Mr. Gregory Tierney, representing the Irish Co-Operative Organisations Society Ltd.  The original members are still serving, with the exception of Mr. Patrick Pearse who was replaced by Mr. Patrick Cambell of IBEC.</P>
    <P>The council reports to the FÁS board.  It is not incorporated with limited liability.</P>
    <P>Given the council's reporting structure and the fact that it was established under the terms of the Programme for National Recovery, any issue concerning the change of membership, objectives, operations or resources of the council would be a matter for the board of FÁS, in consultation with the social partners.</P>

      <P>To obtain financial assistance towards the establishment of a worker co-operative, the promoters of the enterprise must first supply sufficient information to the CDU to allow it to make a judgment on the potential commercial viability of the proposed project.  Should the project have the potential for commercial viability in the opinion of the CDU, financial assistance towards the preparation of a feasibility study may be sought.  In order to be eligible for feasibility study funding, the promoters would have to meet the following criteria: the enterprise must consist of at least three persons and where there are only three people involved, the three persons concerned must not be related (in order to preserve the democratic nature of the enterprise); the promoters must have a commercially viable business idea; the promoters must have the balance of the funding needed to complete the feasibility study; and the promoters must have the necessary skills to run the enterprise.</P>
      <P>Once the feasibility study indicates that the project is viable, it is submitted to a grant approval committee which is a sub-committee of the Co-Operative Development Council.  This committee decides, on the basis of normal commercial criteria, whether or not financial assistance should be provided, the level of such assistance and the conditions, standard and special, which will have to be met before the funding may be drawn down.</P>

      <Col N="1079" /> The retention of records on feasibility study grants is an operational matter for FÁS and I do not have the detailed information on these grants sought by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938, governs the opening hours of retail establishments.  The Act provides for a ban on Sunday trading for most shops but gives the Minister power, by order, to add to the list of exempted businesses or to exempt specified regions from the provisions of the Act.  An order made later that year exempted the entire country from the provisions of the Act and effectively removed all restrictions on Sunday trading.  This remains the position.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that concerns expressed about the growth of Sunday trading in recent years might be addressed by reintroducing controls under the 1938 Act.  However, legal advice was obtained to the effect that distinctions between shops for the purposes of Sunday trading on the basis of type or size would be vulnerable to constitutional challenge.  For this reason the view was taken to include certain provisions in the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, to deal with any difficulties arising from the increase in Sunday trading as a conditions of employment issue.  This Act implemented the EU working time directive.</P>
      <P>In this respect I have facilitated, since early this year, a discussion process between IBEC and trade union interests, including the unions primarily involved, SIPTU and MANDATE, under an agreed independent chairman, in order to resolve this issue on the basis of a common and voluntary approach.  I have received the report of the independent chairman and have requested the Labour Relations Commission, pursuant to Section 35(2) of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, to prepare a code of practice on Sunday working in the retail trade.  I am confident that this proposed code will provide a satisfactory basis for the development of future Sunday working arrangements that will be to the mutual advantage of employers and employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's question regarding the numbers involved in Sunday trading, these statistics come from the last available &ldquo;Census of Services, Retail Trade&rdquo; which the Central Statistics Office completed for 1988.  This census showed <Col N="1080" /> that 52 per cent of the total of 32,000 retail establishments traditionally opened on a Sunday.  The share of employees engaged in Sunday trading was 31 per cent out of the total of 89,680 employed in the retail sector.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to be precise in regard to the potential for a new commercial development in our offshore as it would depend on specific aspects of the field such as the amount of oil or gas recoverable, the duration of production, the distance to land, water depth at the location, costs and market price of the product.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I recently approved the issue of a petroleum lease to Providence Resources over the Helvick oilfield in block 49/9 in the north Celtic Sea.  While this is a marginal field, a potential for commercial development has been established and it merited the granting of a petroleum lease.  Providence Resources now has two years to submit a field plan of development for my approval.</P>
      <P>In l996 Enterprise Oil discovered gas in a well drilled in the Slyne Trough but despite its best efforts it was unable to test this discovery because of mechanical problems.  It is now about to start an appraisal well on this prospect and expects to remain on location for about two and a half months.</P>
      <P>Since exploration offshore began in l970 there have been many instances of oil and gas being produced from exploration wells on test but none of these has proved to be commercial.</P>

      <P>While a number of limited evaluations of the national forest estate have been carried out in the past these have been somewhat ineffective particularly in respect of identification of privately owned forests and woodland.</P>
      <P>My Department is developing a forest inventory and planning system, FIPS, which is based on a geographical information system, GIS and will provide information on the location and classification of Ireland's forest resource.  The system will also provide data on current growing stock as well as forecasting future volume production. This data will provide valuable information which will assist in developing existing and future mainstream forest industry as well as high value niche industries.  The planning component of FIPS will be capable of guiding the location and characteristics of future afforestation, by taking into account environmental and aesthetic considerations.</P>

      <P>The acting chairperson of Ballyshannon Harbour Commissioners has formally notified me that the commissioners have taken a unanimous decision to resign their positions and have requested that their responsibilities be transferred to Donegal County Council.</P>
      <P>Section 88 of the Harbours Act, 1996, provides for the transfer of harbours to local county councils. This would require the consent of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the making of a ministerial order under the Harbours Act, 1996.  The transfer would encompass all properties, rights and liabilities.</P>
      <P>I am advised that as a commercial seaport Ballyshannon is non-operational.  There has been no sea-going commercial activity since the 1950s and there is only the occasional leisure boat or fishing boat using the facility.</P>
      <P>While funding of some £50,000 has been sought to mark the channel there is no provision in the Department's Vote for such expenditure.</P>
      <P>Under An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to transferring small harbours to local control to develop marine leisure activities.  My Department has written to Donegal County Council concerning the possible transfer of both Ballyshannon and Buncrana harbours to its control.

      <P>Mr. Patrick Walshe, Assistant Secretary in charge of the Council of Europe section at the Department of Foreign Affairs, is accredited to the Council of Europe on a non-resident basis. Assistant Secretary Walshe assumed his functions as permanent representative on 4 June 1997.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the increased role and importance of the Parliamentary Assembly in the work of the Council of Europe following its enlargement, the Council of Europe section of the Department has endeavoured to ensure that it follows more closely the debates, resolutions and recommendation of the Assembly, monitors the progress of its committees, and establishes closer liaison with the Irish parliamentarians during the part-sessions.  However, the fact that Ireland does not have permanent representation in Strasbourg and the limited resources available place certain limitations on the degree to which the Department can service the part-sessions of the Assembly.</P>
      <P>The permanent representative has met members of the Irish Parliamentary Delegation in Strasbourg, most recently during the visit by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, to the Assembly on 24 June 1998.  The permanent representative and the Council of Europe section of the Department are happy to meet with the Irish parliamentary delegation or individual members should they have any particular concerns or matters which they wish to raise with the Department concerning the Council of Europe.  Arrangements are now being made for a meeting between the Irish delegation and Mr. Walshe.</P>

      <P>I am greatly concerned at the plight of political prisoners from East Timor, and have availed of every opportunity to press for their immediate release.  On 27 May I issued a statement calling for the release of the jailed East Timor resistance leader, Xanana Gusmao, and all other political prisoners in Indonesia.  Shortly afterwards, the British Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Derek Fatchett, travelled to Jakarta on behalf of the EU Presidency and succeeded in securing a meeting with the prisoner himself.  The matter has also been raised by Ireland at the EU Council of Ministers and at the European Council meeting in Cardiff on 15/16 June.  The European Council called on Indonesia to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and sought the release of all political prisoners including Xanana Gusmao and others from East Timor.  I will continue to raise the matter on all appropriate occasions until Mr Gusmao is released.</P>

      <P>Ireland has long been a supporter of the establishment of a permanent international criminal court and is participating actively at the United Nations Diplomatic Conference on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court which is being held in Rome from 15 June to 17 July 1998. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, addressed the conference during the opening week and underlined the importance to Ireland of a successful outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earth Action raises the issue of which crimes will come within the jurisdiction of the future court.  Negotiations on this issue are still ongoing. There would seem to be broad support for the inclusion of the crime of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  I can confirm that Ireland supports the future court having jurisdiction over those crimes.  States have expressed differing views on whether the crime of aggression should be included.  The inclusion of aggression will depend very much on agreement being reached with regard to an appropriate definition of the crime and the role of the United Nations Security Council in relation to this matter. <Col N="1086" /> Ireland supports the inclusion of aggression. A number of states oppose the court having jurisdiction over war crimes committed in non-international armed conflict.  Ireland is firmly of the view that the court should have jurisdiction over war crimes committed in both international armed conflict and non-international armed conflict. Ireland supports the inclusion of rape as a war crime coming within the jurisdiction of the court.</P>
    <P>Earth Action raises a number of issues in relation to the independence of the court.  One of the issues raised is the type of state consent regime which may apply before the court can exercise its jurisdiction.  Again negotiations are ongoing in relation to this and many states have differing views as to how this should be dealt with in any future statute setting up the court.  Ireland believes that in becoming a party to such a statute, state parties should accept the jurisdiction of the court over the above mentioned crimes. Given the serious nature of those crimes, Ireland would not favour some sort of opt-in/opt-out regime or a regime whereby there are overly onerous requirements of state consent before the court can exercise its jurisdiction.  Furthermore, Ireland supports the prosecutor of the future court having the power to investigate and prosecute persons suspected of such crimes on the basis of information received from various sources, and not only in the case of referrals by states or the security council.  However, there are a number of states who are opposed to the prosecutor having such a power.</P>
    <P>Finally, Ireland will be represented throughout the conference and will continue to work towards the establishment of an international criminal court which will be truly independent and effective.</P>

      <P>The conflict between the Angolan armed forces and the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda &mdash; FLEC &mdash; needs to be viewed in the context of the process of peace-building and national reconciliation which is under way in Angola.  This process is strongly supported by Ireland and our EU partners.  In the wider international community, Ireland has supported UN Security Council Resolutions which aim primarily <Col N="1087" /> at encouraging UNITA &mdash; Uniâo Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola &mdash; to meet its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol, which sets out steps for the implementation of the peace agreement of 1994 concluded between UNITA and the Government of Angola.  The Security Council has also urged the Government of Angola to avoid taking any action which might undermine the peace process and stressed the importance of strengthening the rule of law throughout the national territory.</P>
      <P>The Angolan Government has indicated its wish to engage in dialogue with Cabinda separatists, with a view to making progress on the political and military situation in the enclave.  It is to be hoped that a stabilisation of the overall situation in Angola would create the conditions which would permit such a dialogue to begin.</P>
      <P>With regard to refugees from Cabinda who may seek political asylum, the Government is concerned that such cases should be handled in a fair and equitable manner.  I would however note that primary responsibility for refugee policy in Ireland rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Finally, I must avail of this opportunity to express the Government's deep regret at the death of the UN Secretary General's special representative in Angola, Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye, who died with five of his colleagues and two pilots in a plane crash last week.  The international community owes Maitre Beye a great debt for his unremitting work for peace in Angola.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as the sectors under the aegis of my Department are concerned, EU aid of £14.8 million is being provided from the Joint INTERREG Programme for Northern Ireland and Ireland, 1994 &mdash; 1999 and £1.32 million from the Ireland &mdash; Wales Maritime INTERREG Programme, 1994 &mdash; 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> Under the Ireland &mdash; Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme, the total investment programme in the transport, energy and telecommunications sectors approved for grant assistance to date amounts to £26.78 million involving EU aid of £12.8 million approximately.  Details of these investments are as follows: 1.  upgrading of telecommunications networks at a cost of £11.6 million of which £5.8 million is EU aid; 2.  upgrading of electricity networks involving total investment of £12.38 million of which £6 million is EU aid; 3.  promotion of energy efficiency and use of indigenous energy sources estimated at £1 million of which £500,000 is EU aid; and 4.  upgrading of bus stations involving an estimated investment of £1.8 million of which £500,000 is EU aid.</P>
    <P>The outstanding aid provision of £2 million in the allocation is to be used for infrastructure projects to assist the development of the information society along the Border area.  The extent of EU aid for individual projects may vary slightly due to changes in the ECU/IR£ exchange rate.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Ireland &mdash; Wales Maritime INTERREG Programme, is concerned, sub-programme I, measure 1 provides for an investment of £3.15 million of which £1.32 million is EU aid on the upgrading of transport facilities.  The investments under the measure, which were completed earlier in 1998 are as follows: 1.  upgrading of Dún Laoghaire Dart Station involving a total investment of £1.45 million of which £725,000 is EU aid; and 2.  provision of a rail connection from North Wall to Dublin Port involving a total investment of £1.7 million of which £595,000 is EU aid.</P>
    <P>Apart from the EU-backed investment programme, Telecom Éireann will spend, as part of its ongoing capital investment programme, an additional £2.6 million on the development of telecommunications infrastructure in the financial years 1997-98 and 1998-99.</P>

      <P>Before it approved assistance in respect of the mainline rail investment programme in July 1996, the EU Commission retained independent consultants to undertake a socio-economic evaluation of the proposals.

The EU Commission subsequently approved assistance in line with that recommendation.</P>

Although the person named sold his milk <Col N="1093" /> quota in May 1997 since it was in his name on the reference date of 1 April 1997 it must be taken into account in the overall calculation.

      <P>In administering the scheme of early retirement from farming, my Department must ensure that proper conveyance practices are followed. It is a statutory requirement under the 1990 Finance Act that deeds of transfer must be stamped by the Revenue Commissioners. Further, Land Registry will not accept a deed of transfer for registration where that deed is not correctly stamped by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Therefore, where property is being released by means of a deed of transfer, an applicant under the scheme of early retirement from farming, as part of an application, must submit a certified copy of the correctly stamped deed of transfer together with the relevant Land Registry dealing number.  However, to facilitate applicants who do not have a certified copy of the correctly stamped deed of transfer the Department will accept an unstamped certified copy of the deed of transfer provided the applicant supplies the Land Registry dealing number together with a letter of confirmation from the Land Registry that the deed of transfer lodged for registration is a correctly stamped deed of transfer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that VAT returns are not submitted to the Revenue Commissioners on a basis which would enable an estimate to be made of the VAT paid on hospital equipment.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EU VAT law, which governs Irish VAT law, the rate applying to hospital equipment is, in general, the standard rate, which in Ireland is 21 per cent.</P>
      <P>Under EU rules, hospitals and similar institutions are deemed to be exempt bodies.  This means that they do not charge VAT on the goods and services they provide, but, as a necessary corollary, they are not entitled to recover the VAT expended on the goods and services which they purchase in the course of their activities.  At this stage, it is not open to me to provide recovery rights in relation to items purchased by hospitals, even if financed by voluntary endeavour.  In general, only VAT-registered businesses can recover the VAT on their inputs.</P>
      <P>However, I am glad to be able to advise the Deputy that, for a number of years, a special refund scheme has been in operation whereby new medical equipment, excluding means of transport, purchased by voluntary contributions and donated to a hospital may qualify for a full refund of the relevant VAT.  The cost of that equipment must be £20,000 or more exclusive of the tax.  Details of the scheme can be obtained from the Revenue Commissioners, VAT Refunds (Unregistered) Section, Government Buildings, Kilrush Road, Ennis, Co. Clare, Telephone 1890-202033 (local call).</P>

      <P>I am not aware of reports by any reputable economic forecasting bodies along the lines set out in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the strong consensus among international and governmental organisations and independent economic agencies is that relatively strong growth in global output can be sustained over the medium term providing that problems in Asia and particularly those in the Japanese economy are contained.</P>
      <P>Low inflation and macroeconomic stability generally have played a major role in supporting Ireland's economic transformation over the last decade.  Budgetary policy in 1999 will continue to be consistent with the maintenance of low inflation in the economy, in accordance with the commitment in the communiqué issued at the time of the revaluation of the Irish pound in March last.  This policy will also be pursued over the medium term.</P>

      <P>The basic income proposal of the Conference of Religious in Ireland is currently being examined by a Partnership 2000 working group chaired by the Taoiseach's Department.  As part of this process, a consultancy study is being carried out in two phases &mdash; the first phase will prepare a costing of the proposal, and the second phase will provide an assessment of the dynamic impact of the introduction of a basic income.  Consultants have been appointed to carry out the first phase of this study, and the tendering process for the second phase is currently under way.  This study will address all issues of relevance, including the level of wages and prices.  On completion of these consultancy studies, the P2000 working group will be in a position to complete its own deliberations on the issue.  Preparation of the Government's Green paper will await the outcome of the P2000 study, which will be given careful consideration by the Government.  My Department is represented on the P2000 working group and participates fully in its work.</P>

      <P>The tax relief for corporate donations to eligible charities, which was introduced in this year's Finance Act, was due in large part to the campaign over a number of years by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group, a campaign which had the support of many Deputies in this House, across all of the parties.  As I said in my budget speech, the tax relief was in recognition of the major contribution charities make to Irish life.  The tax relief for charities only applies to money donations; indirect payments in kind are not covered.</P>
      <P>There was no question of extending the relief to include donations to political parties, and I have no plans to introduce such a relief.</P>

      <P>Special conditions must apply, for road safety reasons, to the issue of licences to older people under the terms of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations.

      <Quest>the regulations in relation to the need for private companies to have tax clearance certificates in order to do business with State agencies; if implementation of the regulation is necessary while the Revenue Commissioners are not unhappy with tax returns; if the regulations are being universally or equally enforced by all agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the production of a current tax clearance certificate is a requirement for the issue of certain licences, the payment of certain grants and the award of contracts.  The Deputy's question is taken to refer to the operation of tax clearance in relation to contracts with State agencies or other public bodies.</P>
      <P>Tax clearance for public sector contracts is governed by Finance Circular F49/29/84 issued in July 1995.  This provides that a person seeking public sector contracts valued at £5,000, inclusive of VAT, or more in any 12 month period must produce a current tax clearance certificate or C2 certificate as appropriate and must be in possession of a current tax clearance certificate at all times during the contract period.  The conditions relating to the issue of tax clearance certificates for this purpose are set out in section 1095 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  For C2 certificates, which relate to subcontractors carrying out work in construction, forestry or meat processing operations, the legal definitions and provisions are in sections 530 and 531 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax clearance certificates are issued by the Office of the Collector-General, Sarsfield House, Limerick.  Intending contractors who have not previously held a tax clearance certificate must apply on a form provided by the public body awarding the contract.  Contractors who have received a certificate entitled &ldquo;General Tax <Col N="1102" /> Clearance Certificate&rdquo; or a C2 certificate, obtainable from the contractor's inspector of taxes, may use that certificate for contracts with any number of public bodies.  General Tax clearance certificates are renewed automatically by the Office of the Collector-General provided that the tax affairs of the contractor continue to be in order.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for an alternative to tax clearance for the purpose of public sector contracts. Even where the contractor is aware that his/her tax affairs are in order, and that Revenue is satisfied in respect of returns and payments due, it is still necessary to obtain a certificate, as public bodies have no other means of confirming tax compliance.  Normally, a certificate can be obtained within six working days.</P>
    <P>The requirement to obtain tax clearance applies to the entire public sector, and is applied by all bodies according to the same rules.  For the purposes of Circular F49/29/84, the &ldquo;public sector&rdquo; includes all Government Departments and offices, local authorities, health boards and other health agencies, educational bodies and all semi-State bodies whether commercial or non-commercial. For convenience, the word &ldquo;contract&rdquo; is used, but this is interpreted to cover situations where public authorities are buying, hiring or leasing goods, services or property or generally expending public moneys.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following tables, by hospital and by speciality, for the period ending 31 March 1998.</P>
      <P>Waiting list figures tend to increase in the first quarter of each year, due to the particular pressures placed on hospitals during the winter period. While the waiting list figures for March 1998 reflect an increase over December 1997, they show the second lowest rise in the December-March quarter since the waiting list initiative began in 1993.  Increases in other years have been as high as 15.6 per cent (March 1995) and 12.0 per cent (March 1997).  The increase this year was held to 5.1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main causes of the increase in waiting list figures in the March quarter for 1998 were: the traditional increase in medical admissions that <Col N="1103" /> occurs in the winter months, and a shortage in the availability of blood which resulted in the postponement of some surgical procedures.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the increase in the numbers on waiting lists in the March quarter was limited to the greatest extent possible, and I am confident that the 50 per cent increase in funding for the waiting list initiative in 1998, from £8 million to £12 million, will continue to address the situation as the year proceeds.  The funding for 1998 was notified to agencies in December 1997.  This was much earlier than in previous years, and will enable hospitals to plan their activity more fully throughout the year.</P>
    <P>I established a review group in April to advise on how best to maximise the effectiveness of the waiting list initiative.  I expect to receive the review group's report very shortly.  I understand that it will contain a series of short-term, medium-term and long-term recommendations, which I will examine without delay.</P>

      <P>The North Western Health Board is currently renting two houses in Dungloe which cater for the residential needs of psychiatric patients in that area.  However, as this accommodation is quite limited and will not meet longer term needs, the board is examining a number of options for alternative psychiatric residential accommodation.

      <P>As part of budget 1996 the then Government announced that &ldquo;persons who have been unemployed for at least one year shall retain their medical cards after entering employment.&rdquo; Persons on the live register for at least one year, who take up paid insurable employment, were deemed to meet the criteria for retaining their medical cards for three years.  The provision also covers participants on approved schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed, including back to work allowance (BTWA), community employment, Jobstart, Job Initiative, Partnership and Community Group Initiative and development courses such as Workplace and vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS).  The purpose of the budget provision was to remove disincentives to labour force participation by long-term unemployed persons.</P>
      <P>In addition to this, the Minister for Finance announced in December 1997 a budget tax initiative to help the long-term unemployed.  Essentially the initiative, known as Job Assist, offers tax incentives to employers to employ persons who are long-term unemployed and to the latter to take up qualifying employment.  Participants are entitled to retain their medical cards for three years after entering a qualifying employment.</P>
      <P>The implementation of these provisions is a matter for health board chief executive officers, who have statutory responsibility for the administration of the medical card scheme.  I, as Minister for Health and Children, do not have a function in the issue of medical cards to individuals. However, as the issue relating to the individual concerned is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board I have asked him to have the matter investigated and to reply directly to you.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A combined drain is defined as a drainage pipe <Col N="1109" /> or system of pipes that is not vested in or controlled by a sanitary authority and is used to convey trade effluent or other matter, other than storm water, from two or more premises to any waters or a sewer.  Section 22 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Act, 1990, gives a sanitary authority power to declare a combined drain to be a sewer for the purposes of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990.  Exercise of this power is a matter for each sanitary authority, and while authorities have been encouraged to avail of section 22 as appropriate, comprehensive statistics in this regard are not available in my Department.</P>

      <P>A total of 1.432 million motor vehicles were currently licensed at the end of 1997; of these, 1.134 million were private cars.  Work carried out as part of the technical assistance programme of the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99 indicates that the total number of private cars in the country could be in the region of 1.6 million by 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Policy responses to growth in road traffic volumes must be based on an integrated approach to transport requirements.  This involves increased investment in road infrastructure, but also improvement of public transport, management of road transport demand, promotion of alternative transport modes and better co-ordination of transport and land use planning.  These matters are being addressed through the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99, in <Col N="1110" /> urban transport initiatives such as the DTI, and in the preparation of proposals for investment in transport infrastructure under the national development plan for the post-1999 period.</P>

      <P>I am seriously concerned about the continuing, widespread incidence of litter pollution and am determined that local authorities rigorously enforce the provisions of the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, to deal with the problem. Under that Act, local authorities are responsible, among other things, for ensuring that, as far as practicable, public roads are kept free of litter. On 8 June 1998, I announced a series of measures as part of an anti-litter programme to support strengthened local authority action on litter this year.  Details of these measures are set out in the reply to Questions Nos. 17 and 61 of 11 June 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141, 143, 144 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>The 1998 budget provided for significant social welfare increases.  A special increase of £5 in the maximum personal rates of payments has been provided for some 270,000 pensioners aged 66 and over, with pro-rata increases for a further 54,000 pensioners on reduced rate contributory pensions.  The £5 increase represents an increase ranging between 6.4 per cent and 7.4 per cent. Indeed, these are the largest percentage increases which have been provided for the elderly since the early 1980s.</P>
      <P>This year's budget also provided for a general increase of £3 for 560,000 social welfare recipients aged under 66 years, with pro-rata increases for a further 6,000 people on reduced rate contributory payments.  The £3 increase represents an increase ranging between 4.2 per cent and 4.6 per cent.  In addition, the increases provided in the budget took effect from the first week in June.  This means that this year's increases are being paid for 31 weeks &mdash; an additional two weeks on previous years.</P>
      <P>This year's social welfare increases also mean that the rates for all but two categories, representing some 832,100 recipients (94 per cent) are now at or above the recommended minimum rate set by the Commission on Social Welfare. The rates for short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, representing 57,000 recipients (6 per cent), have been increased from 95 per cent to 98 per cent of the target rate.  Accordingly, substantial progress has been made in meeting the commitment in Partnership 2000 to achieve the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare for all payments before the end of the partnership, 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consumer price index measures the monthly changes in the cost of purchasing a representative basket of consumer goods and services. The quantity of each item in this basket is proportional to the average amount purchased by all households in the country, as determined by the latest household budget survey.  While the cost of some of the items in the basket might increase, these can be offset by reductions in the cost of other items.  For instance, the May CPI figures indicate that the year on year increase in food was 4.9 per cent while fuel and light increased by 0.9 per cent.  However, these increases were counterbalanced by a decrease of 6 per cent in the cost of clothing and footwear <Col N="1116" /> during the same period.  The overall CPI is designed to take account of these different indices, by measuring the change in the average level of prices.</P>
    <P>While a projected inflation of 2 per cent for 1998 was assumed at budget time, present indications are that inflation will average somewhat higher than 2 per cent this year.  The latest information published by the Central Statistics Office for May 1998 highlights that average consumer price inflation for the year to May 1998 is of the order of 1.3 per cent while the year on year rate is 2.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, because of the significant level of this year's social welfare increases as set out above, a small increase in the expected inflation will still mean that social welfare recipients will have received real increases this year and, therefore, their real income position has been protected and enhanced.</P>
    <P>The question of further increases in social welfare rates, including the question of bringing those rates currently below the minimum Commission on Social Welfare recommended rate up to the target rate, will be examined in the context of formulating proposals for the 1999 budget.</P>
    <P>The most recent information available on the extent and nature of poverty in Ireland dates from a household survey conducted in 1994.  This survey found that in the period from 1987, when the last such survey was carried out, the proportion of the population living below incomes set at 50 per cent and 60 per cent of average disposable income had increased.  However, the overall trend indicated an improvement as regards the level of poverty.  The depth of poverty, for example, as measured by the average gap between actual incomes and the 50 per cent and 60 per cent lines, fell considerably.</P>
    <P>In the period since the 1994 survey was undertaken the economy has performed strongly with the numbers at work increasing by 150,000 to 1,338,000 and the rate of unemployment decreasing from 14.1 per cent to 9.3 per cent.  These developments, together with other measures being taken by the Government, such as the substantial social welfare increases outlined above, will have a positive impact on the level of poverty.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>the regulations, if any, there are in relation to unemployed persons retaining secondary benefits on return to work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In general, the social welfare secondary benefits of the Christmas bonus, butter vouchers and free fuel are payable only to recipients of long-term social welfare payments. Other benefits, such as rent allowance or mortgage supplements and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance available under the supplementary <Col N="1117" /> welfare allowance scheme, medical cards and differential rents, are generally income-related.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary course of events, an unemployed person who makes the transition to full-time employment does not retain automatic entitlement to secondary benefits since they are no longer in receipt of the appropriate qualifying payment.</P>
      <P>In the case of the long-term unemployed &mdash; i.e. people who have been signing on the live register for at least one year &mdash; special arrangements have been put in place to provide them with an incentive to re-enter the active labour force.  For instance, since 1996, such people are entitled to retain the medical card for a period of three years when they take up paid insurable employment.</P>
      <P>In the case of certain employment programmes, including, for example, the community employment scheme, the back to work allowance scheme, and the area enterprise allowance, participants are generally enabled to retain their secondary benefits at the level prior to participation in the programme, provided that the gross household income does not exceed £250 per week.  In addition to this income limit, it should be noted that the maximum rent or mortgage supplement payable in such circumstances is £250 per month.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the regulations for the granting of free schemes to those on State or semi-State occupational pensions; the income limit applicable; if he will consider a sizeable increase in the next budget; the number of pensioners who qualify; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Free electricity-gas allowance, free television licence and free telephone rental allowance have always been available to persons in receipt of social welfare pensions, including contributory pensioners, without the need for an additional means test.  Persons in receipt of occupational pensions could qualify for these schemes provided they were also in receipt of a social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>It is possible for a person to be in receipt of an occupational pension but not be entitled to a social welfare pension.  This can happen where they were in State or semi-State employment and not insured for retirement or old age (contributory) pension and where the level of their occupational pension is such as to preclude them from entitlement to old age (non-contributory) pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996 entitlement to free schemes was extended to pensioners not in receipt of a social welfare pension, provided their income does not exceed the maximum personal rate of old age (contributory) pension, currently £83 per week, plus increases for dependants, where appropriate, plus £30.  The means test used to determine the <Col N="1118" /> level of income in individual cases is similar to that used for non-contributory pension purposes.</P>
    <P>There are currently 207 people in receipt of free electricity allowance, and 178 people in receipt of free telephone rental allowance, who are not in receipt of a standard qualifying pension for free scheme purposes and who have satisfied a means test instead.</P>
    <P>Any further improvement to the free schemes which would have a cost implication, such as that proposed by the Deputy, would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

    <P>In relation to the corncrake, Dúchas has given funding for a Corncrake grant scheme amounting to £269,000 in the period 1992 to 1997, with a further £64,000 committed to the scheme this year.  This scheme, operated by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy, IWC, and jointly funded by Dúchas and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, pays grants to farmers in corncrake habitats for farming in a corncrake friendly way.  In addition to this scheme, I have made funds available for the purchase of suitable corncrake habitat and to assist in a countrywide census for the species.  A grey partridge research project, based at Boora, County Offaly and jointly funded by Dúchas with Bord an Móna, is studying the existing population with a view to developing a long-term conservation strategy for the species.  The roseate tern is catered for under an EU INTERREG project which is operated jointly by Dúchas and the IWC. <Col N="1119" /> This project provides wardening protection at prime breeding sites at Rockabill Island and Our Lady's Island for the breeding populations.  A hen harrier census has been undertaken this year by Dúchas and the IWC.  Dúchas is planning to address the conservation of nightjars and is attempting to determine the status of the corn bunting.</P>
    <P>In addition to the specific schemes outlined, the designation and protection of special protection areas and special areas of conservation will contribute significantly to the maintenance of suitable habitats for these and other species of wild birds.  This, together with the environmental benefits from improved farm practices under the rural environmental protection scheme, will represent a significant benefit for the protection of our wildlife, including birds.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, when brought into force, will outlaw discrimination on grounds of age, and eight other grounds, in relation to access to employment, conditions of employment, equal pay for work of equal value, training, work experience and promotion, subject to certain limited exceptions. These exceptions allow age limits to be set: where there is clear actuarial or other evidence that significantly increased costs would arise if the age limits were not imposed, to take account of any cost or period of time involved in training a recruit to a standard at which the recruit will be effective in the job, or to take account of the need for there to be a reasonable period of time prior to retirement age during which the recruit will be effective in that job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recruitment in the public service is not a matter for my Department.  However, I understand from my colleague the Minister for Finance that recruitment policy in respect of the Civil Service has been aligned with the terms of the Act.  All recruitment to general service grades in the Civil Service will now proceed without upper age limits, apart from 65 years.  However the Act's exceptional provisions may have some relevance to the professional and Departmental streams within the Civil Service, and I understand that the <Col N="1122" /> Department of Finance is consulting with line Departments so as to identify any Departmental or professional recruitment grades in which an upper age limit would be necessary in accordance with the Act.</P>
    <P>As far as local authorities and health boards are concerned, age limits are a normal feature of recruitment at present.  I understand from my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that the question of age limits is being reviewed at the moment in the context of the Act.  My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has informed me that his Department will be making any necessary changes to current practice in health board recruitment in light of the legislation.</P>

      <P>The Department does not maintain records in such a way as to give the figures requested by the Deputy.  In general a Garda report of convictions of an asylum seeker is not taken into consideration when deciding on the applicant's claim for refugee status, unless the crime is of such a severe nature to warrant consideration of the cessation clauses of the UN Convention of 1951.</P>
      <P>A conviction for a criminal offence would be a factor when the Minister was deciding on the granting of temporary leave to remain to an applicant who was refused refugee status.</P>

      <P>Neither I nor my Department have any funding mechanism available in respect of water-based tourism activities.  Development plans and related funding for this important sector are provided for under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, and delivered through the relevant State agencies.  In relation to product development and marketing, grant decisions are made by independent management boards on individual grant applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operational programme also includes, under measure three of its product development sub-programme, assistance for angling development <Col N="1125" /> to ensure that our coarse and sea angling is upgraded to the best international standards.  This measure is administered by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  Measure four of the sub-programme includes assistance for the purchase of angling boats, the provision of good mooring facilities, the development of yacht chartering operations, sail training and other marine tourism facilities, enabling visitors to be provided with sailing vessels on their arrival in Ireland, and the development of a number of new cruising bases.</P>
    <P>Aside from tourism the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of sport and recreational facilities in Ireland.  Clubs and organisations engaged in water leisure activities are eligible for funding under the programme.  All available funds were allocated to projects in April last and a review of the programme is currently being undertaken. Following this review, I will be in a position to publicise details of the new schemes.</P>

    <P>As I have previously indicated to this House, most recently on 24 June last, overall responsibility for the international marketing of Irish tourism lies with Bord Fáilte Éireann, which is funded under my Department's Vote.  Included in its marketing activity is the promotion of tourism angling, water sports and many other products, together with the implementation of specific marketing programmes in targeted EU and non-EU member states.  Funding is also provided by my Department to the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative Limited, the all-Ireland, industry led, joint commercial venture between the public and private sectors, and to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, which operates <Col N="1126" /> marketing programmes specific to the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>Reports are produced annually by the boards of Bord Fáilte, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, and the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative Limited, and by the marketing management board set up under the Operational Programme for Tourism to decide on European Regional Development Fund tourism marketing grants.  These reports are duly laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that there are many competing demands for increased funding in all sectors of education.  These demands are considered within the overall budgetary constraints.  I can assure the Deputy that it is my intention to continue to improve the staffing position in second level schools as resources permit.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the fifth teaching post at the school will be lost from the end of the current school year because the enrolment at the school declined from 162 pupils in September 1996 to 154 pupils in September 1997.  The retention figure for the fifth teaching post is 155.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the school also has the services of a shared remedial teacher and a concessionary post due to the school's designation as a disadvantaged school.</P>
      <P>In light of the enrolment decline at the school and the overall staffing levels, I regret that I cannot authorise the retention of the fifth teaching post at the school.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 192 together.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the remedial area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>In the case of remedial teachers, I have already indicated my intention to ensure that a remedial resource is available to every primary school in the country within the next two years.</P>
      <P>As a first step in this process, I intend to allocate additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools for the forthcoming school year.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on the precise number of posts and the schools involved in the near future.  The needs of schools in County Donegal will be considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which are undertaken.</P>

    <P>Details of the 76 primary schools in County <Col N="1134" /> Donegal which are currently without a remedial service are set out as follows:</P>

      <P>Physical education facilities encompass indoor PE halls, outdoor hard play areas such as basketball and tennis courts and playing fields.  Virtually all schools have at least one element of these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide PE halls as part of the schedule of accommodation for all new post primary schools, including community schools.  PE halls are also provided when a major extension to a school which does not have such a facility is being built.  Applications for the provision of PE halls are dealt with on an individual basis and these applications are <Col N="1136" /> constantly reviewed in the light of available funding and competing priorities.</P>

      <P>Arising from the earlier parliamentary question concerning the family mentioned, a member of my Department's psychological service met the parents towards the end of May 1998.  The purpose of the meeting was to establish whether psychological help was required by their daughter and, if so, if it should be provided by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>It seems their daughter is making good progress in her present school and that she does not appear at present to need psychological intervention of an educational nature.  It has been made clear to the parents that, if such help should be needed, my Department will provide it.  Her school is one of those which has been allocated to one of the recently appointed educational psychologists, who will keep the situation under review.</P>
      <P>In respect of certain other concerns the parents had, they were given information about how to make a referral to the health board services, and were given assistance in this matter.</P>

      <P>Scoil Phapain Naofa is an all-Irish primary school established in September 1993 with temporary recognition from my Department. This status was subsequently extended to the end of the 1997-98 school year.  The purpose of temporary recognition is to enable a school to demonstrate over a period time that it has a viable future and that it is being conducted in accordance with the Rules of National Schools.</P>
      <P>On 19 June 1998, there were 25 pupils in the school, showing a drop of nine when compared to the 34 pupils enrolled at the beginning of the school year.  The intake of junior infants has not exceeded four in any of the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future of the school was recently reviewed in the planning section of my Department.  This review concluded that the school did not have the solid intake base at infant level necessary for development, that the school had failed to demonstrate <Col N="1138" /> viability and was unlikely to do so in the future.  Accordingly, the school was notified by letter on 29 May last that it was intended to withdraw recognition and grants from the school with effect from the end of the current school year. The principal teacher at the school was advised to approach the patrons of the three main panels which operate in the Dublin area with a view to having her name placed on an appropriate panel for redeployment.  The first assistant teacher at the school was employed in a temporary capacity. This teacher's contract has now expired.</P>

      <P>As explained in Parliamentary Question No. 209 on 29 April 1998, the children to whom the Deputy refers are not attending their nearest national school.  They are attending and availing of school transport to a school further away.</P>
      <P>The families in question were granted free transport under the scheme on the understanding that they were attending their nearest suitable school.  However, it came to the attention of Bus Éireann and my Department that these pupils reside nearer to another school.  That transport facilities have been held by children contrary to the terms of the school transport scheme in no way confers a continuing right to these facilities. Accordingly, the relevant families were advised in March 1998 that free transport could not be offered beyond the Easter term, 1998.</P>
      <P>Having re-examined the matter, I regret that my Department is not in a position to allow free transport in this instance.  However, it is open to the families in question to apply for concessionary fare-paying transport, at a cost of £19 per pupil, per term.</P>

      <P>The Gaelscoil referred to by the Deputy was established in September 1996 with temporary recognition from my Department.  Normally, the granting of permanent recognition does not arise for a school of this type until it has been in operation for a number of years.  This is to enable the school to demonstrate over a period of time that it has a viable future and that it is being conducted in accordance with the Rules of National Schools.</P>
      <P>The question of permanent recognition for this school will be finalised by the planning section of my Department as soon as the new enrolments become available at the beginning of the next school year.  The school authorities will be notified of the outcome at the earliest possible opportunity thereafter.</P>
