      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  On promised amendments to the Constitution in respect of Articles 2 and 3 in the context of an overall agreement in the talks process, is there any truth in the suggestions in today's newspapers that there is an agreement, the content of which is unknown to the House, between the Taoiseach and a Member in regard to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order to ask about the content of an agreement.  The Deputy can only ask about the timing of the agreement on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will rephrase my question in a way which will be of assistance to the Ceann Comhairle.  Is the timing of the legislation likely to be influenced in any way by a written agreement which it is alleged exists between the Taoiseach and an individual Member of the House, if such an agreement exists?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Tánaiste made aware of this written agreement?  Was the British Government made aware that apparently there are limits to the options the Taoiseach has in relation to amendments of Articles 2 and 3?  Will the Minister arrange to have laid before the House a copy of the alleged agreement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies opposite will agree that everyone is concerned about the situation in Northern Ireland and the talks which are ongoing.  On talks with Independent Deputies, the Taoiseach has answered questions in the House and set out his position.  He made it clear that no deals have been done.  He clarified his position for Independent Deputies and the House in general.  Deputies would be better served by concentrating on the package everyone is striving to achieve and see what can be done with it at that stage.  This is the line being taken by the Leader of the Opposition and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies cannot discuss the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I agree it is important that we should concentrate on the overall picture.  My concern is to establish whether this is affected by a written letter which it is suggested an individual Deputy has in regard to the content or timing of a constitutional amendment which would be part of the package. As the House must be free to make a decision on any matter which comes before it and as it does its business in public rather than in private, it is important to know if its discretion has been prejudiced by private arrangements which might have been made between the Taoiseach and an individual Member.  I will not press the Minister unduly as he is not directly involved, but will he let us know if such a letter has been written to Deputy Blaney?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of depending on an Independent Deputy, the Government should seek the consensus of the main parties in the House on this legislative matter.  I pledge the support of my party for an agreement on which there is consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Government parties recognise there is consensus in the House on the need to achieve an overall agreement and that Deputy Blaney will not be able to exercise a veto over this issue.  Clearly what is afoot here is that Deputy Blaney is threatening to withdraw his support for the Government on everything as a way of exercising his veto.  It is important that the agreement between the Government and Deputy Blaney is placed before the House so that we know precisely with what we are dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is seeking consensus in Northern Ireland and on this part of the island.  That position also pertains in so far as the Opposition is concerned.  On discussions with Independent Deputies, in reply to a parliamentary question tabled two weeks ago the Taoiseach dealt thoroughly with the matters raised by the Opposition.  This question, which may have been tabled by the Leader of the Opposition, related to the arrangements with Independent Deputies. Those arrangements still stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

I want to clarify whether the Government has now <Col N="1109" /> decided to amend the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal of inquiry.  My understanding is that it has not so agreed and I want confirmation of that.</P>

      <P>For the second time in a couple of weeks a Minister has withheld, indeed concealed, important information from this House.  I refer to the Private Members' Bill which I moved. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a speech in which he concealed the fact &mdash; which we have now discovered in newspaper reports today &mdash; that the Government has embarked on the wholesale deportation of asylum seekers.  Will he make a statement to the House as to how it was that he could conceal such important information in a democratic debate on a difficult issue?  Does he accept that he has engendered more prejudice in one speech than Áine Ní Chonaill and her gang have managed to do in six months?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; There will be an acceptance on all sides of the House that this Bill will bring about the most fundamental and radical reform of the administration of our courts since the foundation of the State.  It is a measure to which I have given priority as part of the extensive programme of <Col N="1111" /> law reform I have undertaken since my appointment as Minister.</P>
      <P>There has been a recognition for some time that, no matter how well we had been served by our courts in the past, the administrative infrastructure was in need of extensive restructuring so that it would be well placed to cope with the ever changing demands being made upon it which in turn reflected changes in society generally.  This Bill will lead to the changes that are necessary to bring about a forward looking courts service which will be as responsive as possible to the needs of its customers as we head into the new millennium.</P>
      <P>It is particularly appropriate in a week that has seen the passing of one of our finest jurists, the late Mr. Justice Brian Walsh, that I take this opportunity to place on the record our appreciation of how well our Judiciary and the staff who have supported it through the years have served us.  In this respect, I extend my deepest sympathy to the family of the late Mr. Justice Brian Walsh. He was blessed with a clear mind, a tremendous jurist, a great servant of this country and a patriot in the true sense.</P>
      <P>On my appointment as Minister one of the features I found most welcome was the high level of enthusiasm on the part of the Judiciary and its staff for establishing the new modern courts service to which this Bill will lead.  This level of commitment augurs well for the successful operation of the new agency.</P>
      <P>It is right to recognise that significant improvements have taken place in recent times in the operation of our courts.  These have resulted to a significant degree from the appointment of additional judges and support staff who have brought about dramatic decreases in delays which for too long were a regrettable feature of courts administration.  That success serves to underline the need for providing an appropriate infrastructure for the courts to respond efficiently to the ever increasing and changing demands being made upon them.</P>
      <P>The Government recognised at an early stage that parties involved directly with the courts and the general public are entitled to receive a quality service from the courts.  This was the reason the Government gave the undertaking in its Action Programme for the Millennium to set up an independent courts service to manage the courts system more efficiently.  I am pleased to bring before the House the legislation required to give effect to the undertaking in the action plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of an independent body which will be known as An tSeirbhís Chúirteanna or, in English, the Courts Service and which will generally assume my current functions in relation to the administration of the courts.  The policy of the service will be determined by the board of the service and day to day management will be the responsibility of a chief executive who will be appointed by the board.  The Bill, therefore, represents <Col N="1112" /> a significant move from the existing courts administrative structure.  To ensure that the new measures are implemented as quickly as possible, provision has also been made for the establishment of a transitional board and the appointment of a chief executive designate with a view to preparing for the full establishment of the service.</P>
    <P>I want to briefly remind the Deputies of the background to the development of these measures.  At the end of 1995 the Working Group on a Courts Commission, chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, was established to review the operation and financing of the courts system and, in particular, to consider the matter of the establishment of a Commission on the Management of the Courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy. The group's third report entitled &ldquo;Towards the Courts Service&rdquo; provided an outline of a legislative scheme to establish a courts service and this has served as the framework for the Courts Service Bill.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity in the Seanad, and wish to do so again here today, to pay tribute to Mrs. Justice Denham and the members of the working group who have invested, and continue to invest, a considerable amount of time and energy examining and reporting on the operation of key elements of the courts system.  Their valuable work has provided a firm foundation for the legislative framework for the new Courts Service and I am sure the House will join me in giving due credit to Mrs. Justice Denham and the working group.</P>
    <P>A further development I would like to mention with reference to the measures contained in the Bill concerns the changes which are taking place in the organisational structure of my Department. As Members will be aware, there is a significant ongoing programme of organisational change in the area for which I am responsible.  Under the Strategic Management Initiative in my Department, the role of the Department is shifting decisively from the day to day provision of support services in various areas and concentrating on its core policy functions.  This Bill is just one of the measures that arises against that background.</P>
    <P>Fundamental to the development of these new services will be the retention by me of political accountability to the Oireachtas for the discharge by the new bodies of their functions.  At the same time a key feature in the delivery of these services will be conferring full responsibility on the new agencies for the management of their respective services, including the achievement of agreed objectives, service levels and financial performance. This approach to political accountability and management responsibility is reflected in the provisions of the Courts Service Bill.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the main provisions of the Bill. Section 4 is the pivotal provision as it brings an tSeirbhís Chúirteanna into existence on &ldquo;the establishment day&rdquo;.  That day will be appointed by order of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under section 3.  However, section 1 <Col N="1113" /> and Part VIII provide for the establishment of the Courts Service Transitional Board one month after the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 11 establishes the board of the Courts Service and provides for its membership in accordance with the recommendations of the working group on a Courts Commission.  The board will have 17 members and will be widely representative, particularly of bodies or interests, having a direct functional relationship with the courts.  This level of representation is appropriate and, indeed, necessary in a body which will be located at the top of the courts service structure and which will have responsibility for formulating the policy of the service.  It is right that the Judiciary, staff of the service, practitioners and users of the courts, who have a very real interest in the future of the courts system, should be represented at the decision making level.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice and the Presidents of the High, Circuit and District Courts will be members of the board or will nominate another judge for that purpose.  An ordinary judge of each of those courts will also be elected to the board by his or her judicial colleagues.  A judge will also be nominated by the Chief Justice in respect of his or her expertise in a specific area.  The other members of the board will be the chief executive, a practising barrister nominated by the Chairman of the Bar Council, a practising solicitor nominated by the President of the Law Society, a member of the staff of the Courts Service, an officer of the Minister, a person nominated by the Minister to represent consumers of the services provided by the courts, a person nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and a person nominated by the Minister with knowledge and experience of commerce, finance or administration after consultation with bodies representative of such interests.</P>
    <P>The board will be chaired by the Chief Justice or his or her nominated replacement.  Elected or nominated members will serve for a term of three years which will be renewable on re-election or renomination under section 12.  The Minister will be entitled to remove, for stated reasons, a member of the board nominated by the Minister.  The Minister must first consult the nominating person or body concerned in connection with the removal, for stated reasons, of members nominated by the President of the Law Society, the Chairman of the Bar Council or the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>Under section 14, the board must meet at least once every three months and that section provides in a standard form for the procedures of the board.  As regards the workings of the board, section 15 empowers it to establish committees which may comprise persons who are not members of the board but who have expertise relevant to the work of a committee.  This flexibility would allow the board to examine in a specialised way particular aspects of court operations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> I stated earlier that the essential purpose of the Bill is to transfer the current functions of the Minister which relate to the courts to the Courts Service.  This is reflected in section 5 of the Bill which draws out the broad parameters of the service's functions.  The section provides for a general mandate to manage the courts, but it also provides that the service shall provide services for the judges, information and facilities to the public and courtroom accommodation.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight briefly the service's function of providing facilities for those who use the courts.  The interface between our system of justice and the public is in the physical setting of courthouse facilities and conditions.  These are of vital concern to members of the public such as victims of crime and family law litigants who come into contact with the courts.  Considerable improvements have been made in this area, such as the opening last week of the new courthouse in Tallaght which I was especially pleased to perform, but it is essential that the process of the modernisation of courthouses be kept up to pace. I am confident the service will be fully aware of the need to target resources towards the provision of modern accommodation to meet the requirements of all court users.</P>
    <P>Section 29 transfers functions from the Minister to the courts service with effect from the establishment day by adaptation of existing statutes which are set out in Schedule 2.  The section provides that the Schedule can be augmented by way of an order made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The section also provides that any other statutory function relevant to the work of the service may be conferred on the service by a Government order.  A significant series of provisions encompassed by Schedule 2 relates to powers to appoint certain officers or deputy officers of the courts and their direction in relation to matters of administration which the Bill confers on the service.  The existing arrangements whereby the Government appoints the Master of the High Court, the taxing masters and the county registrars remain unaffected.</P>
    <P>Section 6 confers powers generally on the service to enable it to perform its functions under the Act and certain powers are specifically mentioned, including the power to hold land and to enter into contracts and arrangements.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that the new service will have the capacity to carry out its functions as effectively and efficiently as possible and I am satisfied that aspect is properly covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 20 deal respectively with the board's functions and those of the chief executive and they point up a key relationship within the overall framework of management of the courts service.  Under section 13, the board will be responsible for the policy of the service and for overseeing the implementation by the chief executive of the board's policy.  Section 20 provides that the chief executive's function will primarily be to manage and control on a day-to-day <Col N="1115" /> basis the business, administration and staff of the service.  By virtue of section 20(2), the chief executive will be accountable to the board in the implementation by him or her of the board's policies and the performance generally of his or her functions, including all functions conferred on him or her under the Bill or by the board.</P>
    <P>A central feature of the measures contained in the Bill is the establishment of clear lines of accountability and responsibility in the statutory framework for the courts service.  Under the Bill full responsibility for the management of the courts system will be conferred on the courts service while political accountability for the activities of the service will continue to rest with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In this context, however, I should make it clear that there could be no question of such accountability arising in relation to judicial decisions which are, of course, made completely independently under the Constitution, a fact which is underlined in section 9 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 requires the service to submit an annual report to the Minister of its activities and the Minister will lay that report before each House of the Oireachtas.  The Minister will be in a position to direct that additional information be included in the annual report.  The section also imposes a general requirement on the service, acting through the chief executive, to provide information to the Minister about the policy and activities of the service.  It is vitally important to ensure the Minister and Government of the day as well as the Oireachtas have a clear insight into the way the service is operating.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides additional steps to underpin the policy of ensuring the optimum level of accountability.  Section 7 requires the service to submit three year strategic plans to the Minister for his or her approval following which the Minister is required to lay the plans before each House of the Oireachtas, with or without amendment. This requirement is based on corresponding provisions contained in the Public Service Management (No. 2) Act, 1997, and arises from the same policy objectives, that of enhancing the management and effectiveness of public services, in this case, in the area of the courts.  The underlying principle of strategic management is to promote the provision of an excellent service to the public which ensures that resources are used in an effective and efficient way.  I am satisfied those principles will be reflected in the operation of the service as a result of the obligation placed on it under section 7 to plan ahead strategically, not least due to the specific requirement that the strategic plans have regard to the need for the best use of the resources of the service.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the provisions of section 7(2)(d) of the Bill which provides that the strategic plan of the courts service shall have regard to Government policy on promoting bilingualism.  It requires in particular that regard be had to the need to <Col N="1116" /> ensure that an adequate number of staff of the service are competent to provide service in Irish as well as English.  I explained to Senators that the purpose of the provision is to ensure that the board of the service will have the effective delivery of services through Irish on its agenda.  The provision is a very significant and practical one which, I am satisfied, conveys the importance which I attach to the courts service being in a position to deal appropriately and effectively with people who wish to transact their business in Irish.</P>
    <P>Supporting the efficiency and effectiveness criteria is section 13(2) of the Bill which, in the context of the discharge by the board of its functions, requires the board to have regard to the best use of the resources of the service, and any Government or ministerial policy or objective relating to the functions of the service.  This section also enables the Minister to inform the board of any such policy or objective.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for lines of direct accountability for the service to the Oireachtas. Under section 19, the chief executive of the service will be the accounting officer for the service and as such will appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  A wider general obligation on the chief executive to attend before an Oireachtas committee when so required by a committee to account for the general administration of the courts service, including its strategic plan, is contained in section 21.  This section is based on the corresponding provisions of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges, and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>The Working Group's Fourth Report, The Chief Executive of the Courts Service, was published last year.  That report provided a comprehensive framework for the role of the service's chief executive which is reflected in the provisions of the Bill.  Section 17 provides that the chief executive will be appointed by the board and the appointee will, as I mentioned earlier, be the chief executive designate who will have been appointed by the transitional board.  The terms of appointment of the chief executive will be fixed by contract, which will be renewable, on terms and conditions determined by the board and approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The effect of section 18 is that the chief executive will not be subject to the provisions of the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, and will not, therefore, be appointed as a civil servant.</P>
    <P>The chief executive's role in the management of the service will be critically important.  Perhaps the key component of this task will be the management by the chief executive of several hundred staff members who will become part of the Courts Service.  To achieve this task, it is essential that the existing courts system, which is dispersed between several court offices and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is brought together into a single cohesive structure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> The existing system which served us well in days gone by was not designed to meet the demands arising from the large volume and complexity of much of the business that is now coming before the courts.  In that context, section 22 which declares that the service shall have a unified organisation and structure, is a critical reference point for the form the new service will take.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that the board may appoint staff and determine their grades with the approval of the Minister and the consent of the Minister for Finance and staff of the service will have the status of civil servants of the State.  That Civil Service designation is consistent with the role of the service which will be a statutory agency of the State, independent of the Government.</P>
    <P>There are two main groups of Civil Service staff currently involved in the work of the courts. The first group &mdash; the vast majority of such staff &mdash; is located within the courts and it includes registrars, court clerks, clerical and many more grades of staff.  Section 24 provides that such staff, who are specified in Schedule 1 to the Bill, will transfer to the Courts Service on the establishment day.  The second group of relevant staff &mdash; staff of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform engaged in functions relating to the administration of the courts &mdash; will transfer to the service by way of designation by order of the Minister.  Designation of such staff will take place after consultation with organisations representing staff interests.</P>
    <P>For all staff transferring to the Courts Service, section 25 provides that a lesser scale of pay or less beneficial terms and conditions of service than those applied prior to the transfer will not be imposed unless this is done in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with recognised staff representatives.  The procedure for varying scales of pay and terms and conditions of staff by the service will be by agreement of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance, following consultation with a recognised trade union or staff association concerned.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all court staff who have given such an excellent service over many years under the existing courts organisational structure.  I know I can look forward to the continuation of that excellent service to the State under the new arrangements on which we are embarking.  I also pay tribute to the role played by staff associations in the consultations which have taken place on the establishment of the service.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides that county registrars will be part of the Courts Service, but only in so far as their functions relating to the administration of their court offices are concerned.  To this extent, county registrars will be responsible to the chief executive under the provisions of section 20(1). Deputies will be aware that county registrars also exercise a wide range of quasi-judicial functions which are expressly excluded from the effect of <Col N="1118" /> section 31 as this section is subject to the provisions of section 9.  Section 9 protects the independence of judges in the exercise of judicial business and persons, such as the Master of the High Court or county registrars, exercising quasi-judicial functions from interference by the service, the board or the chief executive.  Section 41 makes similar provision in respect of the transitional arrangements under the Bill.  The Bill does not affect the non-court related functions of county registrars such as their duties as returning officers.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are currently responsible for the provision of courthouses throughout the country in accordance with the provisions of the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, with the exception of the Four Courts complex and a number of other venues in the Dublin area which are the responsibility of the Commissioners of Public Works.  However, my Department took over financial responsibility for courthouses from local authorities in 1990.  Consistent with the function of providing, managing and maintaining court buildings which the Bill confers on the service, section 26 provides for the vesting in the service of land which includes court buildings which are currently vested in or leased by local authorities or the commissioners.  Under-pinning these provisions is a procedure for consultation with the local authority or the commissioners before the transfer of land to the service.  Where a building is in mixed use, for instance, a county council office which also houses a courtroom, it will be necessary for the local authority to give written consent before the building may be transferred.  While I have mentioned the Four Courts, I should make it clear that, exceptionally, I do not envisage the transfer of the Four Courts to the service under the vesting arrangements provided for under section 26. Given the unique history of the Four Courts and the significant place it holds in our heritage and culture, it would be appropriate that the service should lease these premises from the Commissioners of Public Works in an arrangement similar to the one in place with An Post in respect of the GPO.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the transfer from the Minister, the commissioners or a local authority to the service of property other than land used for court purposes.  Section 28 provides for the transfer from the Minister to the service of all rights and liabilities under a contract or commitment relating to court functions.</P>
    <P>Part VII makes provision for miscellaneous matters which require attention with a view to the establishment of the Courts Service.  In line with a recommendation of the Mrs. Justice Denham working group, section 30 provides that the chief executive shall be a member of the court rules committees and this section provides for the delegation of his or her membership to a member of staff of the service.</P>
    <P>Section 32 is a standard type provision disqualifying members of the board or of the staff of the <Col N="1119" /> service from serving as such once they become nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, or elected as Members of either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>In addition, steps have been taken under section 33 to maintain the exemption for courthouses from planning permission requirements under the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>Part VIII is concerned with the arrangements to be made in respect of the transitional board and the chief executive designate.  The composition of the transitional board will, under section 38, be identical to that of the board of the service under section 11 with necessary modifications to enable a court staff representative and the chief executive designate to be members of the transitional board.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a chief executive designate by the transitional board is dealt with in section 40.  The transitional board will also, under section 39, have the broader function of preparing generally for the service taking on its court management functions.  Section 43 provides for the dissolution of the transitional board on the establishment day.</P>
    <P>A key purpose of the transitional arrangements is to provide a mechanism for putting a chief executive in place as quickly as possible in advance of the start-up of the service.  The chief executive designate, who will be the first chief executive of the service, will work in partnership with the transitional board within the remit of its power to prepare the way generally in the run-up to the establishment of the service.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the establishment of the Courts Service on the lines proposed in this Bill is the best way forward to ensuring that the administration of the courts is carried out with the greatest efficiency consistent with the provision of a quality service to the public.</P>
    <P>I am happy to have had the opportunity to shape and advance the statutory framework for the establishment of the Courts Service.  This Bill represents a landmark development for the administration of justice through the courts system in this State.  I look forward to the debate on the Bill in this House.  Deputies will no doubt recognise the very significant move forward for the courts system which the Bill represents and I am sure that they will want to contribute in relation to these far-reaching reforms.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I join the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in paying well deserved tribute to the memory of the late Mr. Justice Brian Walsh, who was elevated to the bench to undertake a lustrous judicial career in the wake of a very spectacular, albeit short, career at the Bar.  His passing represents a landmark in respect of achievement on the bench.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> On behalf of Fine Gael I welcome the introduction of this legislation, the foundations of which were firmly established by the previous Government. It had been clear for many years that the courts were operating under an antiquated structure whereby decisions of an organisational and administrative nature were made by the courts section of the Department of Justice.  Everyone bemoaned the fact that delays were commonplace.</P>
    <P>While we paid lip service to the underlying principle that justice delayed was justice denied, little happened in terms of reorganising the courts or appointing additional judges to ensure that justice would be done at the earliest opportunity. For example, civil cases were often delayed for nine to ten years until judgment was passed. However, thanks to the major allocation of resources by the previous Minister, Deputy Owen, court delays have been considerably reduced and diminished.  Delays are now measured in weeks rather than months or years. Childrens' courts should enjoy a special place in the judicial system but there were also long, unexplained and unavoidable delays in these courts because resources were not allocated.  However, they have now been given special emphasis and additional resources.</P>
    <P>No tangible moves were made to address this situation until Deputy Owen, as Minister for Justice, established a Working Group on a Courts Commission under the chair of Mrs Justice Denham.  I join with the Minister, as other Members will do, in paying tribute to Mrs. Justice Denhan and the other members of this group for their outstanding work.  There can have been few other committees or working groups in the history of the State that accomplished so much in such an important area in so short a time.  They approached their task in a highly structured and professional manner and produced several reports on the management of the courts system. The net result of their work is being debated today.</P>
    <P>In its third report, the group set out the heads of a Bill which the Government has clearly found useful in drafting the legislation.  However, it should also be stated that one of the major problems identified by the working group when it was first instituted was the long-standing problem of delay in the main courts.  It is a tribute to the previous Government and its Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, that it confronted this problem head-on and made many additional and badly needed judicial appointments to all of the courts. As stated earlier, the problem of delay has now been greatly alleviated and the steps taken to solve this problem allow us to approach the current legislation in a much more constructive and positive way than would otherwise have been the case.</P>
    <P>The courts perform a vitally important role in society and it is crucially important that they be properly funded, serviced and organised.  Among the more striking facts which emerged from the <Col N="1121" /> working group's first report is how much revenue &mdash; approximately £11 million &mdash; the courts generate annually and how relatively little they cost the Government to operate.  Net expenditure on the courts for 1996 was estimated at £40 million which represents approximately 0.28 per cent of total Government expenditure.  If the new courts service is given reasonable latitude in setting court fees for various kinds of cases, it should be possible for the courts to generate further income and become more cost effective.</P>
    <P>In the past, many people, including judges, have remarked on the high level of court fees which can often impose considerable hardship on litigants.  Often it is those people in most need of the protection of the courts who find it most difficult to afford the fees.  Hopefully, one matter which the new service will examine as a matter of urgency is the feasibility of having a differential scale of fees for different kinds of litigation.  A complex of fees for different kinds of litigation deserves closer scrutiny and examination.  A complex commercial which is likely to occupy a good deal of court time should be the subject of higher fees than a family law case or a judicial review application on a pressing matter of considerable personal importance to the applicant.</P>
    <P>From the draft legislation, I note that initiative and final decision on the setting of fees are retained by the Minister.  I shall return to this on Committee Stage.  However, in the interim, I ask the Minister to consider if some changes might be made in the proposed wording of section 6(2)(e). We are about to establish a new service consisting of highly specialised and experienced people. Now is the time to carry out such an examination and set down guidelines.  Why should these people have to wait for a request from the Minister to recommend appropriate scales of court fees and charges?</P>
    <P>I understand that there may be reasons for leaving the final decision on fees to the Minister who is an elected representative and a member of the Government which is responsible to the Dáil.  However, I cannot understand why the initiative must come solely from him.  There is nothing to be lost and much to be gained by allowing the courts service board, in addition to the Minister, to take the initiative in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in keeping with the recommendations of the Denham committee, provides for the establishment of a courts service.  More specifically, it provides for the establishment of a board to take responsibility for the operation of the service and for a chief executive who will be responsible to the board.  It safeguards the independence of the Judiciary which is a vital hallmark of our judicial system.  Section 11 sets out the membership of the courts service board which will operate under the chairmanship of the chief justice, or his or her nominee, and will consist mainly of judges, lawyers and a number of other individuals.  It is vitally important that the court system should be seen to cater for all sectors of our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> The courts are the great bulwark of protection for the individual against the unwarranted use of public or private power.  For many people, the courts are the only available refuge from violence, abuse or injustice.  In the past 20 years the family jurisdiction of the courts has increased enormously and continues to do so, particularly with the introduction of legislation to deal with marriage breakdown.  Many people who are obliged to invoke this jurisdiction do so at a time when they are at their most sensitive and vulnerable and in most need of support.  However, we have been repeatedly informed about the poor facilities in many courthouses where cases are being heard and where people are trying to engage in a process of consultation in respect of family litigation.</P>
    <P>A number of courthouses have undergone considerable improvements in recent years. However, the conditions in many of them still leave much to be desired.  There are many courthouse buildings in which people involved in cases, particularly those involving family law which are quite sensitive, are left waiting in cold, windswept corridors without any privacy or access to basic facilities.  It is incredible that while we boast about the Celtic tiger and our progression as a modern democracy which has developed a highly sophisticated economy that is recognised as one of the prime manifestations of what a small economy can do in a relatively short time, consultations are still carried out on corridors and in corners.  People with injuries have to show them to their legal advisers in full public view.</P>
    <P>There is visible intimidation when witnesses are confronted by the people about whom they are about to give testimony in situations where they are literally within arm's length of each other and people have to speak in hushed tones because they do not have the dignity or right to physical accommodation in which to have adequate consultation.  It is time we addressed this as a matter of urgency and put more resources into basic facilities in courthouses.  It is crucial that we remove the &ldquo;Houston City cattle mart&rdquo; atmosphere prevalent in so many courthouses.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the composition of the board, as set out in section 11, the key section of this Bill, does not make provision for the inclusion of a person who would be in a position to offer special advice on the experience and the needs of persons involved in family law cases.  I accept that paragraph (o) of section 11(1) provides for the appointment of &ldquo;a person nominated by the Minister to represent consumers of the services provided by the courts&rdquo;.  This could be a person who has a special knowledge of family law courts.  However, as the section is written, he or she is not required to have such knowledge. The person could be someone familiar with commercial law, personal injuries law or criminal law. It would be a good thing to have a person on the board with experience in personal injuries litigation because this area, like others I have mentioned, <Col N="1123" /> is of great importance.  It could also be helpful to the board to have a perspective from the insurance industry which picks up much of the tab for litigation.  It seems strange, however, that, in a country governed by a Constitution which claims in Article 41 to provide such strong protection for the family, the Courts Service should make no special provision for a direct input from those who are at the receiving end of family court services.  I am not talking here just about family law in the conventional sense, namely, cases involving marriage breakdown and child custody, though these alone are sufficiently important to justify the point I am making.  What I am talking about is family law in cases involving physical and sexual abuse perpetrated within families, and similar matters.  Most of the victims, and most of those worst affected by such violence and abuse, are women and children.  However, there is no provision in this legislation to give either women or children any direct voice on the Courts Service board.  I find this thoroughly surprising. The Courts Service board could end up with an entirely male membership presiding over a system that has such a profound impact on the lives and welfare of women and children.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will have a statutory right to nominate a member to the Courts Service board.  I have no objection to this.  It is a good thing that workers should have representation, thus ensuring that those affected by the family law jurisdiction of the courts are guaranteed a seat at the table through an appropriately chosen representative.</P>
    <P>I would go further and recommend also that a person to speak specifically on the experience of children going through courts, especially the Criminal Courts, should be on the board.  This is sufficiently important to warrant special attention. It is accepted that boards and committees of this kind should not be overloaded with members.  One of the points made in the Upper House was that 17 would be sufficient.  Some limit should apply, but nobody could argue that one or two additions would make it unwieldy or over-burden the membership.  The lack of proportion between the number of judges and lawyers on the one hand and lay members on the other should be sufficient justification for the Minister to review the membership provisions of section 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which the Minister should seriously consider between now and Committee Stage.  One of these is the question of information on the operation of the court system. Section 8 provides for the submission of an annual report by the board.  I welcome this, just as I welcomed the opportunity to have full accountability from the Office of the Ombudsman. The annual report of the Office of the Ombudsman is one of the highlights of the perusal of the entire Civil Service and bureaucracy system and has given rise to quite a number of <Col N="1124" /> valuable recommendations.  Above all, it has given an opportunity to Members of this forum to have an input and give their observations on the efficacy and bureaucracy of the Civil Service and the administration of schemes within the State.</P>
    <P>In the context of section 8, a golden opportunity is being lost to deal with one of the greatest deficiencies in our legal system, namely, the lack of hard information.  This is particularly evident in the criminal justice system, where statistical information is scattered, chaotic and incomplete and where there is a marked lack of coherence and hard evidence.  How on earth can any Minister for Justice purport to formulate policies on matters such as sentencing, imprisonment etc., when there are such yawning gaps in our information system?  How can there be a reasoned and informed public debate, which is so crucial in these matters, when publicly available information is scanty, unco-ordinated and outdated?</P>
    <P>The same is true in our civil justice system.  To give one example, we often hear complaints about the level of awards made in courts in personal injury claims.  How justified these criticisms are I cannot say, but one would be hard put to find relevant, reliable information on this, as on so many other matters connected with our judicial system.</P>
    <P>It has been patently obvious for years that what we really need is a proper annual set of judicial statistics.  Advantage should now be taken of the establishment of the Courts Service to create a research and statistical unit within it.  This would involve additional cost, but only a relatively small cost that would bear rich dividends in terms of providing hard information which is indispensable for the formulation of sound policies in relation to civil and criminal justice.  It must be borne in mind also that compared with, say, England which spends tens of millions of pounds on such research each year, Ireland is a relatively small country.  By international standards the volume of cases passing through our courts is very low.  Therefore, the kind of research unit I am talking about would be quite small and cost very little compared with similar units in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the unsatisfactory physical state of many of our courthouses.  I am at a loss to see where this legislation places any express obligation on either the Courts Service or the Minister to ensure that courthouses are maintained and improved.  What alarms me is the provision tucked away towards the end of section 26 of this Bill which repeals the Courthouses (Maintenance and Provision) Act, 1935, which was very important legislation.  It imposed a statutory duty on county councils and borough councils to provide and maintain courthouse accommodation. It dealt with the appointment of caretakers and gave judges power to deal with caretakers who failed to perform their functions. Furthermore, it allowed the Minister to apply for <Col N="1125" /> a High Court order to compel councils to fulfil the duties imposed on them under the Act.</P>
    <P>The present Bill provides for the vesting of the relevant property in the new Courts Service.  It may be that the very general language used in Part IV of this Bill is intended to impose the same duties on the service as were heretofore placed on councils.  The maintenance and development of courthouse facilities is too important to be left in this uncertain twilight zone.  The Bill should spell out the duties being imposed on the new service and, equally important, the steps that may be taken, by means of judicial review or otherwise, to ensure that these obligations are fully and properly discharged.  In the past, members of the legal profession had to seek a High Court order to enforce the State's obligation to keep the local courthouses in a satisfactory state of repair.  They were successful in some cases.  Waterford courthouse, which is now a fine building, bears testimony to that.  As we approach the end of the 20th century and look forward to the new millennium, this should not have to be the case.  We should be able to rely on responsible State bodies to discharge this function and there should be a clear statutory direction as to where the duty rests.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and will not oppose it in principle.  However, I have serious reservations about the glaring omissions I have outlined. Other matters will require more detailed discussion on Committee Stage.  These include the conditions attaching to the position of chief executive and the relationship between the board and the executive, which will be appointed initially on a designated basis, and their permanent successors.  Is there a reason for not fixing a date for the coming into operation of the permanent bodies?  Why are we adopting a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach?  I urge the Minister to consider these matters carefully before Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the tributes paid by the Minister and Deputy Higgins to the late Mr. Justice Brian Walsh.  By any standards, he made a wonderful contribution not only to Irish law but to Irish society.  Go ndéanfaidh Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It marks an important step in developing and modernising the courts service, some aspects of which are in urgent need of modernisation and improvement.  Some courthouses are in a dreadful condition and totally inappropriate to the dying days of the 20th century.  In some areas there are inadequate numbers of courthouses. In places where the population is increasing rapidly, for example some suburbs of Dublin, there is an urgent need for more courthouses. The number of courthouses in some areas of south Dublin is grossly inadequate.  The current service is unable to properly meet the growing demand for such facilities.  The new courthouse in Tallaght, which the Minister opened last week, will make life much easier for people who need to use that facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> In other areas of the country it is difficult to justify the continued maintenance of certain courthouses.  Many of these courthouses are used very infrequently and the buildings are in a state of disrepair.  One can understand the frustration of district justices and others who use these premises, who from time to time have sought to highlight the dreadful conditions under which they and others are forced to work.  I hope these inadequacies will be dealt with rapidly when the new agency is established.  The administration of the courts will be the responsibility of a separate organisation which will be managed and administered in accordance with the most important concepts and practices of management.  I hope the anomaly that exists in relation to inadequate availability of courthouses in areas of growing population is addressed urgently.  If that happens, the service will be in accord with what one would expect in a modern European country.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also welcome because of the effect it will have on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It will enable the staff of the Department to concentrate on their core activities.  In the past they tended to engage in fire brigade action.  They were preoccupied with the day to day exigencies of their functions and had little time to think strategically; they stumbled from one crisis to another.  While that is understandable, given the sensitive nature of the functions of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it is unfortunate that staff did not have an opportunity to think strategically.  The shedding of the courts section from the Department will provide the staff with an opportunity to plan strategically and to think in the long term rather than dealing with crises on a daily basis.  It will also allow the Department to contribute, in a much more useful manner, to the debate on justice policy.  It is unfortunate that for many years it has been engaged in the dialogue of the profoundly deaf with other agencies and interests on justice matters.  As the Department has a considerable body of wisdom it is a pity it did not engage in a more useful and proactive manner in the debate on such issues.  I am pleased that is changing and a number of useful documents have been produced by officials in the Department who had the wisdom and good sense to commission other interesting and valuable reports. That is a welcome change.  The courts Bill will facilitate the development of those welcome initiatives.</P>
    <P>In speaking on the Bill in the Seanad, the Minister referred to the increased degree to which people have recourse to the courts.  There is no doubt we are becoming a society which is increasingly given to litigation.  It is unfortunate that there appears to be an anxiety to resort to law as a first rather than a last option to solve problems. I have no doubt the much criticised compensation culture has grown out of this tendency.  This process has been a profitable phenomenon for certain elements of Irish life, in particular for the element of the legal profession which had <Col N="1127" /> adopted an aggressive manner to promote and sell their services.  Those people have stimulated and exploited a latent demand which has given rise to a compensation culture, and the public has to pick up the tab.  It has also shown up the legal profession in an unfortunate light.  For many years that profession was looked up to in awe by the majority of the public.  There is a much different perception of it now because of the unfortunate lapses in its behaviour.  Some elements of the profession have aggressively sought to develop a market for their products.</P>
    <P>I join other speakers who paid tribute to the work of Mrs Justice Denham and her group in producing this report.  I welcome the Minister's decision to retain overall responsibility for the functioning of the new service.  It is important that the buck stops on the Minister's desk rather than attributing mistakes to some unfortunate official.  The Minister must not be disengaged from the process.  It is essential that responsibility for technical or relatively small mistakes should rest with the political process rather than with an administrator.</P>
    <P>I agree with the views of Deputy Higgins on the composition of the board.  I am sure this matter was discussed at great length in certain circles and that a large number of representations were made about the matter.  By any standards, the legal profession is very well represented on a board of 19 members.  It comprises eight judges, the President of the Law Society and the Chairman of the Bar Counsel.  There is also a potential for other lawyers to fill some of the remaining slots on the board.  That is not desirable.  In effect there is gross representation of those who provide the service with little consideration for those who use it.  It is fundamental that we change our thinking process.  It is essential that the interests of the customers who have to do their business in unsatisfactory circumstances, are fully taken into account.  Have the consumer groups been consulted and their views taken into account in the same way as the concerns of the Judiciary and the legal profession were taken into account?  I am not suggesting the Judiciary or the legal profession should not have their concerns taken into account but there is a question of balance and it is clear it has been struck in a manner that is inappropriate and grossly distorted in favour of those who provide the service rather than those who use it.  In a modern European country which wants to provide relevant services it is important to change that emphasis.</P>
    <P>Who are the consumers of the courts?  Are they the defendants in criminal cases, those who give evidence against those defendants, those seeking compensation or those defending compensation claims?  To what extent were the various groups consulted and their views taken into account in formulating the board?  The Minister faces a daunting challenge as he seeks one individual to represent the various consumer interests while all grades in the legal profession are catered for: the <Col N="1128" /> Judiciary, the Presidents of the Four Courts and the judges of the various courts.  The representation appears to be inordinately biased in favour of the legal end of the service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the need to collect information on what is happening in the courts and suggested a small research unit be established. I could not agree more.  There is a huge deficit in information on what is happening in the courts.  Scarcely a week goes by when I do not table questions to the Minister.  Invariably the answer I get is that it is impossible to collect the data since it would involve an inordinate amount of work on the part of his staff.  I accept there are some questions which would involve an inordinate amount of work and that the Minister has to manage his Department in a coherent way. However there is a long-term problem and it is essential that we become coherent in regard to the manner in which we collect data.</P>
    <P>In the modern world it is impossible to manage a system effectively without knowing what is going on.  The management information does not exist and it is high time we put in place the facility to collect that information.  One cannot formulate a sentencing policy without that information. Given the deficit of information, we are groping in the dark wondering which is the best way to turn.  That is highly undesirable and calls for rectification.</P>
    <P>The absence of data allows every incoherent bore to tout round his nostrum for the best way to solve the problem.  They include the &ldquo;lock them up and throw the key away forever&rdquo; brigade and those who take the attitude &ldquo;talk softly, be sympathetic, open up the doors and there will never again be a problem&rdquo;.  There are realities between those extreme positions, but it is impossible to formulate a proper policy without collecting the information.  What happens to people who are sentenced?  What is their age and who are they?  From what economic group and region do they come?  Are there regional differences in sentencing?  It is impossible to form a coherent policy without knowing exactly what is going on.  I sincerely hope the Minister will act on that issue.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister whose Department has begun to spend some money on research.  I understand this year spending in this area is in the order of £40 million and I hope it will be more next year.  Without collecting the data it will not be possible to put together a coherent policy.  This absence of information has plagued the whole criminal system and has allowed incoherence to prevail.  There are methods which are effective and can be used.  These vary from time to time according to circumstances and from one country to another.  Unless we know what is working and can measure the effect of the different strategies, the different sentencing policies, the policies which do not involve sentencing, the costs etc.  we will continue to waste an inordinate amount of taxpayer's money in the criminal justice system and to throw good money after bad.  We do not know the effect of various preventative strategies <Col N="1129" /> or whether we would be better off investing at a preventative level to a greater extent than in punitive measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in continuing to retain ownership of the Four Courts with the Office of Public Works.  It is an immensely historic building. I hope in the longer term the Courts Service will be provided there in perhaps a more modern setting.  From the point of view of a modern Courts Service the building at present is not the most ideal.  I hope that some of the services there might be provided in a more modern setting or, alternatively, that the buildings be modernised to allow for the provision of better facilities for those who provide the services and those who use them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I will make many points similar to those raised by Deputies Higgins and Upton, we have not swapped scripts.  However I agree with Deputy Upton on the composition of the board.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome and long overdue.  It is designed to bring a breath of fresh air into an out-moded and out-dated system.  It is intended to bring the Courts Service from the l9th century to the 21st century in terms of its procedures, accountability and customer services.  It has been welcomed by the professional bodies.</P>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of a separate Courts Service outside the control of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This is not a criticism of that Department.  Its resources are already over stretched.  It has a multiplicity of responsibilities with regard to, for example, extradition, prisons, gardaí, legislative changes etc. The new separate management structure should improve the administration of the courts system and the dispensation of justice.  It will help to ensure the efficient and speedy administration of justice.  It will streamline and make more efficient the day to day running of the courts.  It will allow for monitoring the maintenance of court buildings. It will guarantee the provision of facilities and information for the users of the courts.  This will apply to judges, their staff and other court users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a layman I believe the changes are not only necessary but are long overdue.  The present set-up is inefficient and demoralising. Any person who has to go to court for a basic matter, such as a summons for a parking fine, will know what I mean when I say that the delays involved in court appearances are &mdash; if I might use the term &mdash; criminal.  There is no justification for this or for the condition of many courtrooms.  With ever increasing litigation, it has become obvious the courts cannot take the strain.  They must be made user-friendly and people who use them should have full access to information and believe the courts are there to serve them.  The public demand a level of efficiency and speed of action that is sadly lacking.  Justice must not only be seen to be done but must be seen to be done in an <Col N="1130" /> efficient manner.  This should be reflected in the new administrative structures.</P>
    <P>On management of the courts, no one could make a more significant input to the changes than those who regularly use them.  Seventeen people will be nominated to the board, including the chief executive, 11 members of the Judiciary, a staff member, a representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, a representative of consumers, a representative of the Minister and a person nominated by the Minister with experience in commerce, finance or administration.</P>
    <P>It is important that the board should have a definite established line of communication with the Garda Síochána.  At times judges do not appreciate the fact that gardaí put much time into preparation for court appearances.  They have been offhand with members of the force who must be demoralised by this.  There should be an established consultative mechanism to ensure gardaí can voice their views and make suggestions to ensure the efficient use of Garda input and time.  We must enable them to make a positive contribution to the new system.  As one of the main groups of court users, their views are of vital importance.</P>
    <P>On the provision of support services for judges, the volume of cases has increased dramatically in recent years and it does not look like diminishing. Although extra judges have been appointed, there is still a huge backlog.  This is an area in which the Courts Service Board could have a major input.</P>
    <P>The reduction of queues should be looked at under a number of headings, including the relocation of court venues.  Ballincollig District Court is situated in Midleton, 30 miles away.  Would it be more sensible to relocate courts in satellite towns to a city location?  This matter should be reviewed as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>There should be supplementary travelling or relief judges in busy areas.  Although there are extra sittings, there is still a major backlog.  This problem has been addressed in the family law court in Cork where cases are allocated a particular time, morning or evening.  This has been welcomed by the Judiciary, staff members and the public.  It is an area in which the Courts Service Board must make an impact.</P>
    <P>There are other contributory factors.  Judges can be too soft and, at times, too accommodating in allowing adjournments.  Solicitors set down cases for hearing before they are ready for processing. This necessitates adjournments.  There should be positive and active liaison between judges and solicitors in the preparation of trial lists.  Proper list management was a major contributory factor in eliminating the backlog in Dublin.  It is an area in which we can help solve a problem by making efficient use of existing resources.</P>
    <P>On the provision of information on the courts system to the public, people do not enter a courthouse unless they have to.  People &mdash; guilty or innocent, witness or supporter &mdash; fear the <Col N="1131" /> unknown.  What do they experience when they enter a courthouse?  There is no information desk or indication as to where they should go.  There should be a manned service in each courthouse and an information display, at least, in smaller courthouses.  The foyers of larger courthouses are full of busy people wearing wigs and gowns.  They are, unintentionally, intimidating.  At smaller, particularly rural, courthouses people gather around the front door.</P>
    <P>The current system is not only inadequate it is impersonal.  People are upset even before they enter the courtroom.  Courthouses must be modernised, made brighter and more functional.  It is welcome that the board will have total control and responsibility.  In this way we can gain proper and accountable management and ensure proper maintenance and management of court buildings.</P>
    <P>I am glad staff will not lose out in transferring to the board.  This will mean a new and invigorating start for them and can only enhance their career opportunities.  I anticipate the appointment of additional staff who should be specifically selected and trained for the new system.  The promotion of staff from other Departments without prior court experience has not always proved to be an ideal method in staffing such a demanding area.  We must ensure new practices are introduced by the current experienced staff with the help of young enthusiastic new staff who will have no preconceived ideas about the new set up.</P>
    <P>Is it the intention that the Garda Síochána will continue to ensure order in the courts in the new system or will this be a function of the board? This is not specifically mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Proper facilities in all courts are essential. There must be separate accommodation for lawyers to meet their clients without the risk that they may be overheard by people who may be hostile.  This would prevent intimidation of witnesses. Ancillary facilities such as tea and coffee making facilities, air conditioning in summer and heating in winter are essential.</P>
    <P>Separate court buildings should be provided for hearing family law cases.  Currently such cases are heard in the same court buildings as criminal and civil cases.  This ever increasing and sensitive area of litigation needs to be handled with care, especially where children are concerned.  The break up of marriages and all that this entails requires delicate handling.  The hearing of family law cases in camera should always be at the discretion of the sitting judge.  I would not like to see us go down the same road as America with trials on television.  I am opposed to this.  We have all been dismayed by certain aspects of the Louise Woodward case.  Media pressure should not be allowed to have a bearing on any case.</P>
    <P>I am glad the chief executive will not have the right to interfere with the judicial process.  He or she will not be answerable to the Oireachtas. Decisions made by the courts will not have to be justified here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> I am delighted that, at the request of the Minister, the board will be able to recommend appropriate scales of court fees and charges.  This will be welcomed by the general public.  The board is weighted in favour of the legal profession, particularly judges who will have an inbuilt majority.  I take issue with Deputy Upton who mentioned that the Judiciary is over represented.  This is right.  They have to make the final decisions which impact on those who appear before them. They carry a heavy responsibility and the buck stops with them.</P>
    <P>Clients of the service are under-represented. Will the Minister consider offering organisations such as Victim Support a seat on the board to ensure the views of witnesses are taken fully into consideration?  The jury is often the forgotten element in the justice system.  A reference setting out the goal of achieving standards of best practice in relation to the treatment of jurors should be incorporated.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires the board to produce a beneficial, effective and efficient courts system.  It should also be economical and strive to achieve the value for money criteria being established under the SMI in the public service.  It should focus in particular on clients of the service &mdash; the public.  Those who must attend court for whatever reason should be put at ease, made welcome and reassured they have an important role to play.</P>
    <P>The Bill is intended to update and modernise court services based on the recommendations of the working group established to consider the establishment of a courts commission.  The use of information technology is almost negligible.  The Bill does not refer directly to a planned and structured upgrading of administrative procedures and records.  The most modern methods of information storage and retrieval must be employed if we are to achieve our aims.  The technology available, if properly used, can be a significant tool in the elimination of avoidable time delays.  We must gear up for the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Section 5 refers to the functions of the service which are to manage the courts and court buildings and to provide support services for judges. No cognisance, however, is taken of the need to review the location of some courts throughout the country or the question of whether the number of courts should be expanded in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the issue of a High Court in the Munster region.  At present, litigants in Cork, Kerry, Donegal and Mayo, for examples, must file originating documents in Dublin.  All preliminary issues must be heard in the capital city.  If there was a full-time High Court in Cork, all documents could be served locally and all the pretrial issues now heard in Dublin could be heard in the local High Court.  The time is opportune to introduce a permanent High Court sitting to Munster.  I cannot claim full credit for this proposition because is not a new concept.  It was aired by barristers in Cork as far back as the 1970s and 1980s.  Believe it or not, their motivation was to <Col N="1133" /> reduce the excessive legal costs incurred in Dublin hearings, a laudable aspiration.</P>
    <P>The siting of a full-time High Court in Cork makes sense.  It should have a full-time quota of judges.  There should always be one judge sitting full-time in Cork, although it does not have to be the same judge at all times.  The sitting should serve Waterford, Limerick, Tipperary, Kerry and Cork.  This would cover the work currently done by the several sittings of the High Court in Munster throughout the legal year.  It would also provide for additional High Court work being administered locally in Munster.</P>
    <P>The Central Criminal Court should also have sittings in Cork.  It is costing the State a fortune to bring witnesses, gardaí and others involved to hearings in Dublin.  I have heard it said that a criminal jury trial costs the state up to £25,000 a day.  Therefore, a ten day trial would cost £250,000 with an additional cost of another £250,000 if the case has to go to retrial.  There appears to be no system to assess the annual costings of trials.  From the figures I have been quoted, it would appear that there is a big black hole down which public moneys are disappearing without accountability and this must be addressed.</P>
    <P>As matters stand, the High Court sits in Cork for personal injuries cases for nine weeks a year, in Limerick for four weeks, Ennis for two weeks and in Waterford for four weeks.  In all, the sittings add up to 19 weeks per annum.  There are additional sittings.  The High Court on circuit sits in Cork, Limerick, Kerry, Clare and Waterford &mdash; that is the Munster region &mdash; for six weeks per annum.  Notwithstanding the latter availability of the High Court in Munster, serious delays occur. Bringing High Court personal injuries cases to trial in the southern region can be a long drawn out affair.  In the current climate of making the courts system more efficient granting a permanent High Court sitting in Munster would add efficiency to the delivery of the administration of justice by the High Court in the region.</P>
    <P>With regard to criminal cases there is good reason for a High Court sitting in Munster &mdash; rotating between Cork, Ennis, Waterford and Limerick &mdash; to deal with criminal cases.  I refer to that part of the criminal business of the Central Criminal Court which deals with serious criminal offences committed in the Munster region.  The present system constitutes a significant waste of time, including valuable Garda time, and moneys because the most serious criminal cases in Munster must be dealt with in the Central Criminal Court in Dublin.  This involves considerable extra cost in sending high numbers of witnesses, civilian and Garda, to Dublin.</P>
    <P>At present a litigant from west Cork or deep in the heart of south Kerry can only have his High Court personal injuries case dealt with in Munster. A High Court could be provided to sit in the Munster region permanently to deal with all High Court business.  This would give readier access to the High Court at less expense and more convenience <Col N="1134" /> to litigants who must have matters legally determined in the High Court jurisdiction. We have the infrastructure in Munster, the courthouses and the accommodation.  Munster has had a visiting High Court in personal injuries cases for a long time.  This has proved so satisfactory it demonstrates that an expansion of the latter service would be of benefit to the region.  A comparative example is the practice that obtains in England.  There are permanent sittings of the English High Court outside London in cities such as Liverpool.</P>
    <P>The Four Courts, where the High Court sits permanently, is grossly overloaded with work and stretched for accommodation.  There is ample accommodation in courthouses in the major centres of Munster to share this load.  Having to litigate a case in Dublin is more expensive for a litigant from Munster than if the case could be litigated in one of the cities of Munster.  Some expert witnesses, in particular, find it greatly inconvenient and disruptive to travel to Dublin for High Court cases.  Litigants are sometimes deprived of the most appropriate expert witness which could, in theory, lead to litigants experiencing difficulty having their cases presented to their best advantage.</P>
    <P>We must consider setting up a system to deal with the Army deafness cases.  These cases, which I understand to be of the order of up to 10,000, occupy an increasing amount of the time of the High Court personal injuries list.  Army deafness cases should be referred to a Circuit Court that would sit in a central provincial courthouse, such as Athlone.  The courthouse could be used at a time when it is not in use by its Circuit Court. Separate lists should be prepared and those cases that are ready could be put to trial.  This disciplined method of compiling the preparation of the lists would ensure that cases would be dealt with in a speedy manner.  One or two judges should be assigned exclusively to the central venue for at least one year.  The use of the same judges would ensure a similarity of approach and consistency in the judgments.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a potent weapon that will further advance the fight against crime.  The Government has a zero tolerance policy towards crime.  Its effectiveness is manifest and we have seen a drop in crime levels.  Major drug hauls have received wide publicity in the past few months.  The Garda has played a major role in reversing what was an upwardly spiralling trend and it is to be complimented. I congratulate the Minister for being the driving force in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>I hope my contribution will be of some help in promoting discussion.  Deputies' contributions will be inspired by the knowledge that we must work together to ensure the smooth passage of the Bill.  It is fundamental to the continuing fight against crime.  I thank the Minister for presenting the House with an opportunity to update the courts services.  He has my full support and I hope he will take on board the issues I raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usual for an Opposition spokesperson to be critical of a Bill being presented by the Government but in this case I welcome the Bill warmly and unequivocally.  I congratulate the Minister on its presentation. There are certain issues I wish to raise on Committee Stage.  However, this is an excellent Bill, its genesis was under the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, and she is entitled to credit for the foresight in establishing the working group on the courts service.  The appointment of Ms Justice Denham to chair the group was particularly inspired because her leadership, flair and appetite for hard work has driven the project from the start.  The mission was to transform the courts in a way that was so innovative and far-reaching that it is not generally appreciated fully. The lack of Members in the House and media attention indicates that the message that this is a significant step forward which will transform the courts service has not been received.</P>
      <P>When the working group produced its first report in April 1996 it described the problems facing the management of the courts.  These included the lack of a clear reporting structure, adequate performance measurements and objectives; minimum planning; poor use of information technology; fragmentation of administration systems between each of the courts; apparent remoteness of the administration system from the Judiciary; a lack of statistical or financial information and no strategic plan.  The majority of these issues are addressed in the Bill and I expect it will lead to major changes in dealing with them.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a courts service will ensure the courts will be modernised and managed in a way appropriate to the 21st century.  In particular, the establishment of a board comprising representation of a wide range of interests, including the users of the courts, gives the structure a character which is ahead of courts services in many other countries.  In effect, Ireland is leading the way.  I understand that visitors from other jurisdictions are visiting Ireland to learn more about the proposed structure and its effects.  I welcome that the commission's work was expedited so swiftly.  We owe a debt of gratitude to its chairperson and members who committed so much time and effort to its resolution.  Their work would have come to naught were it not for the prompt response to their efforts by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I acknowledge that.  That was a very different response from the one given to the Whitaker report on prison reform, which was shelved and more than 12 years on remains unimplemented.  I was disappointed when the Taoiseach indicated that the prison service Bill, which, I hope, will provide for a transformation of our prisons similar to the transformation this Bill will provide for our courts, will not be ready until next year.  If ever speed was of the essence, it is in the area of prison reform, but that is a debate for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> While some judges may not agree with me I believe the change being brought about is so fundamental that it will alter how our judicial system will operate, not in terms of diluting the independence of the Judiciary &mdash; that independence is fully and rightly protected &mdash; but in how it is perceived and presented to the public.  In effect, justice like health or education, will become a public service.  At present the courts are anything but a service to the public.  They are intimidating and often alien places run on the basis of élitism and mystification populated mainly by men wearing very strange and archaic garb.  Another point worth making, which Deputy Higgins made in relation to the board, is where are women in our judicial system?  There are at low levels in it.  They seem to spend a good deal of time carrying the boxes of files, but at senior counsel and judge level they are still missing.  Mrs. Justice Susan Denham is a shining model of the importance of ensuring we have women at all levels of our judicial system.</P>
    <P>That system often operates in dilapidated and uncomfortable surroundings.  The structure being established will have the capability to address those failings and to transform the nature of how justice is delivered to the public.  It has been described as a breath of fresh air and that is a good description, but it raises issues in related areas.  I disagree with the last speaker in that I believe there is an argument for televising court hearings.  Newspaper coverage of cases, other than those held in camera, has been permitted for a long time and is an indication of a fundamental principle, people's right of access to information on how our courts operate.  I accept there would be difficulties in televising coverage of cases and it will not happen quickly, but it is an argument or debate that will not go away, particularly given that form of information transmission is increasingly becoming part of our lives.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to examine television coverage in respect of one aspect.  If he is setting these new standards for the courts, he needs to apply them in other areas of activity in relation to the Department.  He should urge the Government to provide for the televising of tribunals of inquiry set up under the direction of this House which represents the public.  The Flood and Moriarty tribunals are of considerable public interest and people would be in a much better position to be informed and to form their own judgments if television access was granted to them.  I understand there is no legal reason those tribunals should not be televised or broadcast.  The Minister for Arts, Gaeltacht, Heritage and the Islands has a role in this, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a central role in ensuring justice is not only done but seen to be done.</P>
    <P>I was extremely disappointed when I raised the matter this morning of providing information and making it accessible that the Minister chose to withhold information pertinent to the debate over the last two nights on the deportation of people seeking asylum here.  It tarnishes what we <Col N="1137" /> are debating today if there is still the mindset that only certain information will be revealed as it suits the Government, Minister or Department and other information pertinent to the workings of this House will be withheld and, in effect, concealed. That does not serve this House well nor the thinking and principles laid out in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The seven year plan outlined for the courts service is an acknowledgement that many of our courthouses are in very poor condition and operate in an inappropriate manner to meet the needs of the public.  There was a good deal of publicity surrounding the opening of the Tallaght courthouse, which is welcome, but its standard does not reflect the overall standard of courthouses. There is a fine courthouse in Bray that is appropriate to the needs of the public.  It is a vast improvement on the one operating there before it, but the courthouse accommodation in Wicklow town is not of an appropriate standard.  In Blessington the court operates from the rear of a room used for dances and in Dunlavin the court operates in fairly small accommodation.  However, the courthouse in Baltinglass is unbelievably neglected and needs to be dealt with, even on the basis of meeting required standards for fire regulations, comfort and sanitary facilities.  How much assessment of the standard of our courthouses has been carried out?</P>
    <P>During my time as Minister with responsibility for housing I was aware of the importance of those buildings in terms of architectural quality. They are often the single most significant building, particularly in smaller towns, but due to the high cost of maintenance they have not been looked after in the way they should have been. That means not only are we not serving the public well, we are also not looking after the architectural fabric of those towns in the way they deserve.  I am concerned that in certain instances, where renovation works have been done to modernise the interiors of those buildings, the work has not been done in a way that is respectful of the quality of those buildings.  In certain towns, other than the Church, the courthouse is the most important building and often work to modernise the interiors of courthouses has not been up to scratch.  That needs to be addressed in terms of the workings of the courts service.  People have made this point in regard to the services provided for the public.</P>
    <P>Adequate provision is not always made for juries. Jury service is a public one and is extremely time consuming when many people are busy and work seems to be extending rather than shrinking on a daily basis.  I do not know what has happened to the leisure society that was predicted, but we have not seen much of it here.  People give up their time to do jury duty and they deserve to be properly looked after.</P>
    <P>I welcome the emphasis on the education of judges.  Judges do not like to use the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;, but I welcome the judicial studies for judges.  That is an important part of the work of any management of our courts.  It is important <Col N="1138" /> there is a flow of information to judges to keep them up-to-date with the changes in society generally and that have specific relevance to their work.  Judges have been criticised in the past for being out of touch in certain circumstances. Others are well aware they need to keep up with what is a rapidly changing society.  It is important that the service provides for the need for judges to keep themselves informed.  Changes are already occurring in relation to the specialisation of judges and the way various levels in the courts operate and the presidents of the various courts must be congratulated on that.  The flexibility judges have in making judgments and their independence needs to be protected.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the Minister's commitment to introduce mandatory sentencing in the area of drug dealing although harsh penalties must be enforced.  There should always be an element of judgment in individual cases.  If that element of judgment is taken away from a judge, it will make the problem worse in certain cases.  I am sure that is not the Minister's intention but that he made that commitment when he was under pressure.  He had to produce something to show he had not totally abandoned zero tolerance but this provision is not good law and I urge him to reconsider it.  I would certainly support him if he decided to quietly drop it.</P>
    <P>The Bill has set the Courts Service a considerable job of work and the specifications set out will require considerable funding.  We all appreciate that it will take seven years to ensure that all the planned work will be carried out.  Irrespective of what Government is in power, political commitment will be required to make funds available to carry out various works, particularly in regard to courthouse buildings.  The Office of the Ombudsman set a very sorry precedent when it was effectively starved of funding at one point owing to political decisions which were made on very poor grounds.</P>
    <P>We have not yet sufficiently provided for information technology or availed of its benefits in all areas of Government.  However, we are making some progress in this area.  Where the courts are concerned, that type of technology is vital in terms of gathering statistical information which can be of use.  As I understand it, as things currently stand, if a person is in prison, there is no correlation between statistics held on him or her by the courts, the Department or the prison and it is impossible to cross-reference information in any way.  That is quite extraordinary in this day and age.</P>
    <P>I have already paid tribute to the staff of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I also pay tribute to the staff of the courts who have worked conscientiously, very often in very difficult conditions, to bring about this transformation in management.  It is difficult for any group of people to cope with change if they are accustomed to working in a particular way.  To be presented with a challenge, such as the one posed by this Bill, will effect an enormous <Col N="1139" /> change in people's working lives.  The courts staff have generally welcomed this change and have been willing to work towards it and I understand that something in the region of 40 seminars have already been held.  The general view is that the courts staff are inspired and invigorated by the proposed changes and that is very much to their credit.</P>
    <P>Many of us find it difficult to adjust to change. It is not easy to find our route mapped out in an unexpected way.  The Bill demands a huge change in work culture and methods.  That there is a willingness and desire to get motoring on this is very encouraging.  Some people complained that the Bill was not published before Christmas but it is certainly timely now.  The goodwill of the staff guarantees the Courts Service will operate effectively and achieve its objectives.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat what others have said about costs but they pose the next big challenge. Improved management, accessibility and so on constitute a major step forward but we must ensure that we also deal with court costs and legal fees as these have gone completely out of control. It is impossible to defend a system where, in the case of one hepatitis C victim, for example, the incomprehensible sums of money paid to lawyers were way out of proportion to the sum awarded to the victim.  That is indefensible and inexcusable. I presume constitutional change will be required to address this issue but it must be addressed if the fundamental principle of equality before the law is to be protected and ensured.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Bille um Sheirbhís Chúirteanna (Uimh.  2), 1997 mar is dóigh liom gur Bille stairiúil atá i gceist a thabharfaidh na seirbhísí cúirteanna suas, ní amháin don am atá ann i láthair, ach go dtí an todhchaí.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an historic move because the establishment of an independent Courts Service is something which was perhaps overlooked in the early 1920s when the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann and the legislative structure of Government was altered.  At that time, the courts administrative infrastructure was vested mainly in the Department of Justice and I do not expect any serious analysis was carried out.  Given Ireland's independence, our courts system ended up being closer in structure to the US system than the one we inherited from Britain.  This system was restated in Bunreacht na hÉireann, 1937 and the development of a judicial arm of Government continued to be more in keeping with the American system than the British one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the establishment of a courts commission, it is useful to consider the systems which operate in other jurisdictions.  This was done by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham and her working group which produced some superb reports which laid the ground for the Courts Services (No. 2) Bill.  In Northern Ireland, the courts <Col N="1140" /> services developed as late as 1979 and the service modernised the structure of the courts, unified their roles and completed a major building programme. The service there certainly has much to recommend it although it is not one we can fully model ourselves on because of the position of the Lord Chancellor.  Japan followed a system quite similar to our own which, again, is based on the American model and follows the principle of the separation of powers contained in our Constitution. Mrs. Justice Susan Denham pointed to the model of South Australia, adopted there in 1993, as a very useful one but it is even more limited than the farseeing service proposed in the Bill. The Irish Courts Service represents progress towards a modern structure and a dynamic system and that is something which we welcome.  It reflects the best of other countries but is created within the context of the Constitution and meets the needs of an Irish community.</P>
    <P>The current system evolved from a leisurely era embodied in the writings of Somerville and Ross when justice was administered by Major Yates, the Irish RM.  Today, the increase in the number of cases and the pressures of space and time reflect a need for professional organisation and management.  A quick glance at the legal diary for any day shows hundreds of cases listed.  The list of criminal cases, which constitute only one aspect of the legal system, can include cases for mention, trial, probation report, sentencing and review.</P>
    <P>This new service will manage the courts and provide support and services for the judges and as such, fáiltím roimhe.  However, it needs to be backed by the total modernisation of the administrative structures of the courts and a full computerised system using the best of advanced technology.</P>
    <P>Another function of the service is to provide information to the public on the courts system.  It is the essence of an open democratic society that there be adequate channels of information between the organs of Government and the people from whom they derive their authority. Justice, with few exceptions, is administered in public, where the public have right of access to the courts.  This right of access is enshrined in Article 34.1 which states:</P>
    <P>Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution, and, save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public.</P>
    <P>Most court cases are open to the public, except for those held <i>in camera.</i>  People can see justice being administered, an opportunity taken every day by people all over the country.  I have often brought school groups to the courts to witness the administration of justice and what an important part of our society it is.  However, not everyone can do that.  The reality is that most people get their information about the courts from the media.  It is important we have channels or systems <Col N="1141" /> which enable the communication of information from the courts to the public and the media.</P>
    <P>We also need user-friendly courts, for visitors, witnesses, jurors, the legal profession, offenders, Garda and the press.  The Four Courts is a wonderful building to visit but very daunting if one is there on business.  It is difficult to find the location of courts and the times of the various cases.  There is a need for a visible information office to enable users to feel comfortable, if one can feel comfortable in court surroundings.</P>
    <P>One of the most interesting aspects of this Bill is that it will provide facilities for users of the courts.  There are no public consulting rooms in the Four Courts.  The Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, in which all serious crime cases in the Dublin area, except murder or rape, are dealt with has no public consulting rooms for lawyers and their clients.  There is no room available for the use of victims who must stand shoulder to shoulder in the corridors with the accused. Amplification is extraordinarily poor.  It is difficult to hear the questions being asked and the sentence being imposed.  Families involved in family law cases need consulting rooms for privacy. However, these are not available in most courts.</P>
    <P>It is a penance rather than a civic duty to be called to serve on a jury.  Four hundred people can be called at any one time.  Until recently, all those people were crammed into one court awaiting their call to serve.  Now they are forced to go to the basement where they are connected by closed circuit television to the judge who calls their names.  This is not satisfactory.  If the court was a factory, it would be closed down.  I hope this Bill will redress the problem.</P>
    <P>Jurors receive no compensation for service. Those who are unemployed do not even receive their bus fare to and from the court for up to 14 days before they are called to serve on a case. Jurors on a criminal case are given their lunch while those serving on civil cases are told to leave the court at lunchtime and to buy their own lunch.  These are the reasons people opt out of jury service where possible rather than seeing it as a way of helping the justice system.</P>
    <P>Many of the conditions are worse throughout the country.  Judges have refused to serve because of conditions and some courts are still meeting in dancehalls.  There is a need for courthouses in newly built up areas, particularly in the city of Dublin and its suburbs.  The new courthouse in Dún Laoghaire is a shining example.  The new courthouse in Tallaght, which has been welcomed by Judge Delap, offenders and victims is also a model which ought to be followed.  I welcome the aspect of the Bill which will provide facilities for the use of courts.</P>
    <P>It is proper that we should have a system to enable us to deal effectively with the services and management of courts, which will enable the more efficient movement of cases.  However, why are there are so many cases in the late 20th century? <Col N="1142" /> One of the answers to this could be lawyers. Lawyers advertise on the back of most buses, in magazines and newspapers.  Hoardings which were once the preserve of Cadbury's and Guinness are now invaded by lawyers promising to cure ills people do not even realise they have suffered. When Deputy O'Malley, as Minister, abandoned the restriction on advertising for solicitors, I do not think he intended it to work out as it did. Now is the time to introduce restrictions again.</P>
    <P>The second cause of the increase in the case-load of the courts is the concept of negligence. The explosion of negligence claims in the past decade should give rise to a reappraisal of the concept of negligence at the end of the 20th century. When the case of Donoghue <i>v.</i> Stevenson (1932), which gave rise to the modern concept of negligence, was decided, the welfare state was virtually unknown.  The process whereby a snail in a ginger beer bottle would, with time and the applied efforts of lawyers, give rise to claims by thousands of soldiers grounded on the noise made by their rifles was difficult to foresee.</P>
    <P>The concept of negligence was unknown to Roman law.  Hannibal did not have to muffle his elephants as he crossed the Alps for fear of deafening his legions.  Brehon law did not recognise the concept of negligence.  A modern day Fionn MacCumhaill running through the woods would be more likely to sue the local authority for twigs sticking in his feet rather than picking them up with his toes.  The law of negligence is out of control and needs to be corralled before we are completely fleeced.</P>
    <P>The courts are there to right wrongs.  It is desirable they should be able to do so in as efficient and effective a manner as possible.  Expertise in list management and the management of the courts is not synonymous with expertise in jurisprudence. It is proper that as a modern nation we have a modern, well-equipped courts service. Tugann an Bille an deis seo chun sin a dhéanamh agus failtím roimhe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I was amused when someone spoke of rewriting history.  We should remind ourselves of some of the affairs which led to the introduction of this Bill and the chaotic circumstances surrounding Justice Lynch and the extraordinary Cromien report.  The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, reinterpreted the concept of ministerial responsibility and defined in extraordinarily juristic terms the difference between ministerial accountability and ministerial responsibility.</P>
      <P>The reality is that there has been a serious problem for a number of years, not specifically during the life of any individual Minister or Government.  It is fitting that this Bill should be introduced to bring courts services up to date.  I compliment the Minister and all those in the previous Administration who made this possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seem to be the only Member of this House with a problem about the Bill.  The courts are not accountable to anyone.  I tabled three parliamentary <Col N="1143" /> questions last week, not in order to interfere with the courts in any way.  Their independence is guaranteed in the Constitution and I do not wish to suggest that should be changed.  I was looking for basic, fundamental statistical information on delays in the administration of justice. I will explain the background to this.</P>
    <P>We do not have a great regard for the British judicial system.  I have been involved in a number of cases in Britain over the years and I have been highly critical of the system.  However, last week or the week before in the United Kingdom a High Court judge was forced by his peers to take early retirement because of disgraceful and scandalous delays in handing down judgments and eccentric behaviour.  I may be wrong &mdash; and if I am no doubt someone will correct me &mdash; but I do not recall any indication of concern within our courts about eccentric behaviour or delays in delivering judgments.  There are several fundamental problems in our courts, some of which have been addressed.  Like Deputy McManus, I welcome the Bill but also agree that this and future Governments must make major funding commitments to bring the courts system up to date.  This is not a party political matter and all parties should support it.</P>
    <P>I sat in the Supreme Court this week to hear the judgment in the case of Doran and Another <i>v.</i> Delaney and Others.  This case illustrates some of the problems in the court system.  The case was originally sent to the High Court in October 1993 where it was adjourned until October 1994 because the presiding judge was involved in a tribunal and had to prepare a report for presentation to it.  The judgment was delivered in September 1995.  The plaintiffs in the case, Mr. and Mrs. Doran, had lost their home and had sought justice in the courts.  However, it took them two years to get a judgment from the High Court.  The action was a three cornered one against the vendor of the property, their solicitor and the vendor's solicitor.  They were successful in their action against the vendor and their solicitor.</P>
    <P>The case was appealed to the Supreme Court in 1995.  As the House will appreciate, one must have an extraordinary belief in the justice of one's case and extraordinary confidence in the system to take a case against solicitors and law societies. Unfortunately, there was another delay in the Supreme Court from October 1996 to October 1997, until the trial judge produced the report of the Supreme Court on the 16 points at issue in the note of evidence at the High Court stage.  It is extraordinary that one judge could delay a case for three years.  There is an adage that justice delayed is justice denied.  In this case there was a one year adjournment, for which there was no apology, it took one year to give a judgment and it took a further year to produce a report.  This is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>There may be a perfectly logical explanation for these delays but there is no procedure whereby an explanation for them can be ventilated. <Col N="1144" /> We cannot table parliamentary questions on these delays as they will be ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  It is fundamentally wrong in a democracy that an organ of the State or an organ of governance, including the one which has the task of delivering justice, is not required to explain the stewardship of its responsibilities to the public.  The only sovereign authority in this nation is the public and they are entitled to know what precisely is going on in the courts.</P>
    <P>In case I am portrayed as being negative to the courts, some of which are very fine, I will show the other side of the case.  In the Supreme Court, Justices Keane, Barrington and Barnes delivered a crystal clear judgment on all the points at issue within five weeks.  The Supreme Court in this case was conscious that the law it made would stay on the books and would define into the future the third party responsibility of solicitors.  They reviewed the entire case, which involved an extraordinary amount of documentation, and issued a complex judgment within five weeks.  Yet this case had been delayed for three years.  During this time this young couple suffered much stress and self-doubt and incurred horrific expense.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I have a number of questions. Section 8 refers to reporting.  What precisely does this mean?  Will we be able in future to get an indication of the average and most extreme delays in the courts and the quickest time within which judgments can be given?  If not, there will be a major gap in public knowledge about the operation of the courts which should concern us all.  The provision of this information does not impede in any way the constitutional independence of the Judiciary in the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are talking about strategic management initiatives throughout the public service, a charter of citizens rights, freedom of information legislation and major and fundamental changes in State institutions, it is not unreasonable for the Bill to provide that some statistical information must be given on how long a case will take.  Section 8(2) gives the Minister the right to direct the chief executive on what should be in the report.  I hope the chief executive will be requested to supply the Oireachtas and, more importantly, the public with basic information about the courts and their administration.</P>
    <P>This is not the only case in which there has been a delay.  Every Member could give examples of similar cases.  Last week a judge referred to the failure of solicitors to push cases ahead.  To the extent that this happens, it is in everyone's interests, not least those of the litigants, plaintiffs and defendants, to know the precise reasons for the delay.  There must always be accountability to the public.  The courts are not always the best judges of their own performance.  As Deputy McManus said, they are often perceived as remote and removed from the public, who are afraid to ask questions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> This creates a gulf between the public and the courts.  I am not suggesting that courts should be places of common entertainment but it is of profound importance that they are highly regarded by the public.  After all, it is judges, particularly those in the higher courts, who are charged with the task of ensuring that we, as legislators, and the Government, as the Executive arm of the State, behave properly and appropriately and that the rights of citizens are vindicated.  It is of critical importance that they are seen to play this key role in an efficient manner.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the Children's Court and particular cases brought under the Children's Act.  While it is not directly related to anything in the Bill, it is, however, a matter of general concern which was reflected by two other speakers.  There is a need to support judges in these courts and to back up the issue of professional assessment. Members will be aware that cases in the Children's Court are always traumatic and harrowing, particularly when they involve taking a child from the custody of its parents.  The courts are all too dependent on professional support from health boards.  Health boards themselves, however, are in a difficult position because they are litigants who initiate actions in the first place.  As such, they can hardly be regarded as completely independent or dispassionate in the manner in which they handle these cases.</P>
    <P>There is a procedure whereby somebody is appointed in the court to adjudicate on behalf of the child and to represent the child's interests, but &mdash; having been aware of a particular case in recent times &mdash; the reality is that there is a problem. My sympathy goes to the judges who are in a horrific position.  They must interpret points of law on highly technical detailed issues relating to children.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i> process which is in place is not sufficient to do justice to all sides.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the condition of courthouses. A new courthouse was built in Bray.  It is a fine structure which seems to be more than capable of dealing with the needs of a modern court but, before it was built judges, court staff and citizens had to operate in the most difficult circumstances. The situation in Wicklow courthouse is very poor.  There is a certain irony in the fact that the local authority has invested a huge amount of money, which is welcome, in upgrading the adjacent historic courthouse in Wicklow.  It is due to be opened later this year.  There is, however, a need to examine that court building and to invest heavily in it.  In its present condition is it not fair to the judges, staff and citizens who visit the court as defendants, plaintiffs or in other capacities.</P>
    <P>The situation in Blessington is abysmal and there is an urgent need for investment in the local courthouse.  In Baltinglass the tardiness of the State is in juxtaposition to the manner in which the local community has invested a huge amount of time, effort and money in improving the court and its surroundings, yet the State has been lethargic, to say the least.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> If the full rigour of the law was to be applied to Wicklow, Blessington and Baltinglass courthouses it is doubtful whether those buildings would meet all the legal requirements.</P>
    <P>I have waited for some time for this Bill to come before the House because I wanted to place on record my long standing concern about delays in the judicial system.  I am referring to delays which occur because of judges.  The courts can and should handle other delays.  I welcome the fact that excessive delays by parties involved in cases have been rightly and properly criticised publicly in recent times by judges.  It would be in the public interest, as well as being in the interest of judges who do exemplary work, to know if there are undue delays on the Bench.  Such delays occur from time to time, although they are fairly rare.  When they occur, however, they cause huge hardship and give rise to unnecessary doubts about the judicial system.</P>
    <P>As another Deputy said earlier, courts are regarded as alien and intimidating places.  The stresses and strains of litigation are more than sufficient for an ordinary member of the public to bear.  People should not have to put up with delays, visit their local TD or contact the court registrar to try to progress a case.  It should never happen because, to repeat the old adage, justice delayed is justice denied.  The court system is not just about interpreting the law, it is about delivering justice also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for contributing to the debate and welcoming the Bill.  It has been rightly acknowledged that the Bill represents a significant advance for the system of courts administration. The Bill provides a strong framework for the development of a fully modern courts system responsive to the demands placed upon it and providing a quality service to the people.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the strong support in the House for this measure.  We are anxious to progress this important legislation and, with that in mind, the Bill makes provision for the establishment, one month after its enactment, of a transitional board with power to appoint a chief executive designate and to prepare generally for the start up of the service on the establishment day.</P>
      <P>In their contributions Deputies raised a number of points with which I would now like to deal. We will have an opportunity of dealing with these again on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus accused the Minister of withholding information in the Private Members' debate on immigration matters earlier this week. Any fair minded observer would agree that the Minister made a comprehensive contribution to that debate.  Obviously, no attempt was made to withhold information.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins referred specifically to section 6(2)(b) of the Bill which provides for the service, at the request of the Minister, to recommend appropriate scales of court fees and charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> Deputy Higgins suggested that the service should be able to do this on its own initiative rather than having to wait for a request from the Minister. We will have this matter examined in detail.  I know the Deputy will be raising it again on Committee Stage but we will look at it between now and then for the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputies Higgins and Upton referred to the composition of the board of the service.  Deputy Higgins acknowledged the board is already a large one and that there are limits to what groups can or cannot be represented on it.  Some of the concerns in this area may be met by the fact that section 15 of the Bill allows the board to establish committees in relation to particular matters.  The board may appoint to a committee persons who are not members of the board but who have special knowledge or experience.</P>
    <P>The position regarding court accommodation was raised by Deputies, Higgins, Upton, McManus and others.  The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, mentioned that he had recently officially opened the new Tallaght courthouse which was provided at a cost of approximately £1 million.  The courthouse in Abbeyfeale was recently fully refurbished and was opened this week by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
    <P>Major courthouse refurbishments are also under way at Cork Circuit Court, Portlaoise, Waterford, Roscrea, Rathdowney and Ennis. Work will also commence this year on the refurbishment of a number of other courthouses.  We accept that there are concerns with regard to the conditions of courthouses throughout the country. However, we have provided over £12 million this year for their refurbishment.  This is the highest amount that has been allocated since the Department took over financial responsibility for courthouses from local authorities in 1990.</P>
    <P>Deputies Higgins, Upton and McManus expressed concern that provision should be made for a statistics unit to compile and publish statistical data on court proceedings.  Section 5 of the Bill sets out the proposed functions of the court service.  The first is to manage the courts and this includes the function of establishing a statistics unit, to compile statistical data on court proceedings. We do not believe it would be a helpful approach to the Bill to try to prescribe in every detail how the courts service should be managed. Indeed, it might defeat the very purpose of establishing a court service if we were to state in the Bill that a statistics unit is to be established, but not state that a finance, technology or personnel unit should be established.  That is not to say that we do not recognise the need for comprehensive and up to date court statistics, which has been mentioned by a number of speakers.  However, we believe that function is clearly comprehended by the function of managing the courts which is already enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> Deputy O'Flynn also welcomed the Bill and set out many of the issues which we believe the new courts service will be well placed to address.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin emphasised the need for information on our courts to be available.  The Bill recognises the importance of this where, at section 5(c), the service is given the specific function to provide information on the courts system to the public.  Deputy Hanafin also spoke about difficulties that have arisen in relation to solicitors advertising for business.  The Minister intends to introduce legislation addressing this matter in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche raised the question of accountability of the Judiciary.  Obviously I cannot comment on particular court cases.  The Constitution provides that all judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  As to section 8, which the Deputy mentioned, the Minister may direct particular information to be included in the Courts Service annual report.  This could encompass information in relation to the general timescale in which cases are dealt with.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies for the broad welcome given to the Bill.  I am sure we all look forward to Committee Stage where we can address the issues raised in greater detail.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; I am pleased to have the opportunity to open the debate on the Second Stage of this Bill.  Its purpose is to make the necessary changes in Irish law to enable Ireland ratify the two protocols which were concluded at Geneva on 10 June 1977, and which are additional to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949.  Protocol I is concerned with the protection of victims of international armed conflicts while Protocol II relates to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts.  They are the most recent efforts at a multilateral level to augment and reinforce the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Deputies will be given an opportunity to express their views on the manner in which Ireland is implementing the obligations laid down in Additional Protocols I and II.</P>
      <P>The community of states has made many attempts to prohibit the use of force as a means to solve international disputes.  It has tried to eliminate it from the scope of legally admissible conduct of states.  It should be noted that there has been some success in regulating the circumstances in which the use of force may be resorted to.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, we cannot deny that the community of states has failed in the attempt to exclude completely the use of force from international relations.  Unfortunately, states have resorted time and again to this method of solving their conflicts.  This regrettable fact led to the elaboration of rules governing the means and methods of warfare as well as the protection of the victims of armed conflicts.  These rules are variously called &ldquo;the laws and customs of war&rdquo; or &ldquo;the law of armed conflict&rdquo; or &ldquo;international humanitarian law&rdquo;.  The Geneva Conventions of 1949, which have found almost universal acceptance, and the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, are of fundamental importance in this respect.  It is the unenviable task of these laws to promote the welfare of humanity in the most inhumane and appalling circumstances. In the absence of these rules and standards, the barbarism and brutality of armed conflicts would be unmitigated.</P>
      <P>It is highly desirable that Ireland should be seen by other states to be adding to the momentum required for the universal respect of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. As a State that is firmly committed to the equitable treatment of all human beings the ratification of Additional Protocols I and II is a logical and necessary step in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Protocols I and II follow a long line in Geneva Conventions to which, for the most part, this State has adhered.  In 1949, four Geneva Conventions were concluded.  These conventions dealt with the amelioration of the condition of the <Col N="1150" /> wounded and sick in armed forces in the field; the amelioration of the condition of wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea; the treatment of prisoners of war; and the protection of civilian persons in time of war.</P>
    <P>The State is a party to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and effect was given to them in Irish law in 1954 when we enacted the Red Cross Act, and similarly in 1956 and 1962 with the enactment of the Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act, and the Geneva Conventions Act.  To enable effect to be given to Additional Protocols I and II, it is now necessary to amend the Principal Act.  It is also necessary to amend the legislation dealing with other related areas.  These include the Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act, 1956, and the Red Cross Act, 1954.  The Bill amends or extends existing sections of these Acts to give effect to certain articles of the First Additional Protocol 1977.  As an illustration, the Bill will extend the category of &ldquo;grave breach&rdquo; under the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962 &mdash; the Principal Act &mdash; to include &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo; of Additional Protocol 1.  In addition, the Bill will regulate the use of certain symbols and signals used for identification purposes by civil defence and medical units and transports.  Thus the Bill is only the latest in the line of legislation necessary to enable Ireland become a party to the update of the four Geneva Conventions, namely, the two Additional Protocols of 1977.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our Constitution of 1937 commits us to the ideal of peaceful and friendly co-operation among nations founded on international justice and morality.  We are dedicated to the principle of pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination. The policy of such a position argues for neutrality and non-belligerency in the case of war and armed conflict.  Such issues and their attendant rights especially arise in time of armed conflict between other states.  Put simply it requires that the state adopt impartiality towards the participants of the conflict.</P>
    <P>Neutrality should, however, never be equated with neglect or ambivalence regarding the suffering and devastating effects of armed conflict. Armed conflicts have yet to show themselves capable of affecting only those directly participating in them.  Unfortunately, innocent people are affected.  By way of a long-term and overall commitment to peace and security it is incumbent upon all states to attempt to limit the brutality of armed conflict.  The Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols of 1977 and their observance and respect are an indispensable mechanism in achieving this goal.</P>
    <P>Customs of war have existed as far back as the Middle Ages.  It is since the 19th century that these customs have been transformed into treaties. The conclusion of the first Geneva Convention <Col N="1151" /> in 1864 marked the beginning of an important process of development and strengthening of international humanitarian law.  Further conventions were concluded in 1906 and 1929. The conclusion of four conventions in 1949 significantly reshaped and updated international humanitarian law in the light of the experiences of World War II.  The original Geneva Convention agreed in 1864 sought to improve the plight of wounded soldiers on the battlefield.  Since then, the Geneva Convention has been extended to other categories of war victims &mdash; the shipwrecked, prisoners of war and civilians.  Perhaps the most important innovation of the four conventions concluded in 1949 was the inclusion of civilians in Geneva Convention IV, which attempted to deal comprehensively for the first time with the treatment to be afforded to civilians in cases of war.  Undoubtedly, the fourth Geneva Convention was motivated by the experience of the civilian population in World War II.</P>
    <P>The main principles laid down in the 1864 Convention have been maintained in all subsequent Geneva Conventions.  They are, first, relief to the wounded without distinction as to nationality; second, the inviolability of medical personnel and medical establishments and units; and third, the distinctive sign of the red cross on a white background, known universally as the Red Cross emblem, to be used as a symbol of protection and neutrality.</P>
    <P>I shall briefly explain the two Additional Protocols whose texts are set out in the Schedule to this Bill.  Although humanitarian law had been developed and adapted to the needs of the time in 1949, the Geneva Conventions did not cover all aspects of human suffering in armed conflict. By the early 1970s these conventions were already a quarter of a century old and that there were gaps and imperfections in the regime which they established.  In addition, the law of the Hague, which is concerned with developing rules on hostilities and the use of weapons, had not undergone any significant revision since 1907. Consequently, two subjects arising from the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land were placed on the agenda for future development, the conduct of combatants and, even more important, the protection of the civilian population from the effects of hostilities.  These concerns, combined with the various technological developments in armed conflict since 1949, contributed to the impetus for the convening of a diplomatic conference and the subsequent adoption by the conference of Protocols I and II.  Other motivating factors ranged from the non-application of the Geneva Conventions by some parties to the difficulty of whether &lsquo;wars of liberation&rsquo; ought to be treated as proper subjects of international humanitarian law.  The aim of the diplomatic conference was described as &ldquo;reaffirming and developing humanitarian law&rdquo;.  There is no doubt, however, that on certain <Col N="1152" /> points the 1977 instruments modify previous law and even introduce fairly bold innovations.</P>
    <P>Protocol I, additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, concerns the protection of victims of international armed conflicts.  It contains 102 articles in total and attempts to deal with a wide range of issues.  Protocol I is divided up into various parts, each dealing with a different area.  I do not intend to discuss the merits of each part of the Protocol.  I would, however, like to emphasise certain parts which represent advances in the whole area of international humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>Part IV of Protocol I contains the majority of provisions relating to the protection of civilians. It is divided into three sections.  The first section contains 19 articles &mdash; 48-67 &mdash; and is divided into six separate chapters.  Article 48 lays down the basic rule of protection and distinction concerning the civilian population.  It is the foundation on which the codification of the laws and customs of war rests.  The civilian population and civilian objects must be respected and protected in armed conflict, and for this purpose must be distinguished from combatants and military objectives. In the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, like the Geneva Conventions of 1929 and 1949, the principle of protection is deemed to be a developing rule of law, though at that time it was not considered necessary to formulate it word for word in the texts themselves.  Due to the development of weaponry during and after World War II it was considered necessary to explicitly confirm this concept in a treaty.</P>
    <P>Article 51 is perhaps one of the most important articles in Protocol I. It explicitly confirms the customary rule that innocent civilians must be kept outside hostilities as far as possible and enjoy general protection against danger from hostilities. The importance attached to this article is reflected in the fact that violation of several of its provisions is qualified as a grave breach of the Protocol.  Paragraph 4 is of particular significance in the context of the development of international humanitarian law.  This provision contains a general prohibition on indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population and also defines three types of attack covered by the general expression of &ldquo;indiscriminate attacks&rdquo;.  It confirms the unlawful character of certain regrettable practices of World War II and subsequent armed conflicts.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 relates to the issue of reprisals.  It is also founded upon the experiences of World War II where countless civilian lives were lost when parties to the conflict, on the pretext that their own population had been hit, went so far, by way of reprisals, as to wage war almost indiscriminately against civilians.  The prohibition contained in Article 51 on the taking of armed reprisals is not subject to conditions.  It, therefore, has a peremptory character; in particular it leaves out the possibility of derogating from this rule by invoking military necessity.</P>
    <P>Providing supplies for the civilian population in times of armed conflict is a basic problem as <Col N="1153" /> events have cruelly shown.  The Fourth Geneva Convention, 1949, contains numerous articles relating to the obligations of an occupying power with respect to the population of the occupied territory.  In comparison to the conventions, section II of Part IV relating to relief actions in favour of starving civilians is characterised by numerous improvements such as enlarging the range of supplies deemed essential to the civilian population of the occupied territory, an extension of the benefit of this relief to the whole of the civilian population, and provisions relating to the personnel participating in relief actions, who had been hitherto ignored.</P>
    <P>The law of war, specifically that part of the law which relates to methods and means of warfare, merits particular attention.  Part III of Protocol I outlines the rules relating to the methods and means of warfare and the status of combatants and prisoners of war.  These rules of warfare are basically those contained in Articles 22 and 23 of the Hague regulations.  In addition to the general principle by which the right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited, they contain two types of fundamental rules &mdash; on the one hand humanitarian rules and on the other hand rules on good faith.  The first section of Part III &mdash; Methods and Means of Warfare &mdash; is concerned with the reaffirmation of these principles.  This implies accepting the principle of limited warfare, as opposed to total warfare which discards all rules.  It has a key function in relation to other provisions of the Protocol, since non-respect for the rules of combat entails non-respect for all other rules.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this section is not only to reaffirm the Law of the Hague but also to update and supplement the existing rules.  Three completely new provisions which have no equivalent in the above mentioned articles of the Hague regulations have been introduced.  These are concerned with the protection of the environment &mdash; Article 35: Basic rules, paragraph 3 &mdash; with the responsibilities at the national level relating to the introduction of new weapons &mdash; Article 36: New Weapons &mdash; and with the protection of airmen in distress &mdash; Article 42: Occupants of aircraft.</P>
    <P>One of the more remarkable additions of Protocol I is the mechanism expressly designed to promote the application of international humanitarian law, that is the International Fact-Finding Commission instituted under Article 90 of Protocol I. This provision is closely related to Article 1 common to the Conventions and Article 1 of the Protocol which enjoins the contracting parties to respect and to ensure respect for the conventions and the Protocol in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Commission's competence, in principle it is only concerned with facts and essentially has no competence to proceed to a legal assessment of the facts that have been established. The allegation which is submitted to the Commission must relate to a &ldquo;grave breach&rdquo; or <Col N="1154" />&ldquo;serious violation&rdquo; of the conventions or the Protocols. It should also be emphasised that the primary task of the Commission is not only that of fact-finding, but also to facilitate, through its good offices, the restoration of an attitude of respect with regard to a &ldquo;grave breach&rdquo; of particular provisions and for the Geneva Conventions and Protocols in general.  Under Article 90 a chamber of inquiry is to be established consisting of seven members with the purpose of producing a report containing the findings of the Commission and containing &ldquo;such recommendations as it may think proper for the amicable solution of the dispute&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Article 90(1)(b) of Protocol I requires the agreement of not less then 20 parties to accept the competence of the Commission before it can come into being.  This occurred in 1991.  In 1992 the Commission adopted its rules.  By the end of 1995 the number of states accepting the jurisdiction of the Commission had risen to 46.  It almost doubled in the five years and includes approximately one third of the parties to Protocol I. The Commission is made up of &ldquo;fifteen members of high moral standing and acknowledged impartiality.&rdquo; It is also required that there must be an &ldquo;equitable geographical distribution&rdquo; among the members of the Commission and that its members serve in their personal capacity. Elections are to take place every five years after the convening of the first meeting.</P>
    <P>The seat of the Commission is in Berne, Switzerland. The administrative facilities for the performance of the functions of the Commission are to be provided by the Swiss Government.  The expenses are met by contributions from the states which have made declarations under the Protocol and by voluntary contributions.  The regulations adopted by the states' parties are largely similar to the proportions adopted by the United Nations.  The party or parties to the conflict requesting an inquiry are obliged to advance the necessary funds for the expenses incurred by a chamber and are to be reimbursed by the party or parties against which allegations are made to the extent of 50 per cent of the costs of the chamber.</P>
    <P>To date it would appear that the Commission has concerned itself with matters of a practical nature.  These have included a number of issues ranging from the availability of equipment for inquiries <i>in loco</i> to increasing awareness among the international community of the existence of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The setting up of an independent fact-finding Commission to assist in respect and compliance for international humanitarian law is a most welcome development.  For the first time in the law of armed conflict this Article institutes a permanent non-political and impartial international Commission of inquiry to which the parties to the conflict can resort at any time.  This point must be noted, earlier attempts in 1949 had failed due to the lack of consent of the parties concerned.  The task of the Commission is not to judge on the <Col N="1155" /> case but to assist states in achieving a situation in which basic principles of humanity are respected. In light of its restricted task and of its independence this Commission is an effective and valuable mechanism in the context of ensuring respect for international humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>It is a great achievement of present humanitarian law that it does not only cover international conflicts, but also extends to conflicts of a non-international character.  Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which sought to regulate &ldquo;the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties&rdquo; has often been referred to as a &ldquo;mini-convention&rdquo;. Undoubtedly, it has been a keystone in such matters. Prior to 1949, doctrine was opposed to any positive law interference into what was essentially considered to be a matter of sovereignty.  Some of these difficulties were overcome by means of legal construction, that is the recognition of belligerency. However, Protocol II constitutes the first real legal instrument for the protection of victims of non-international armed conflict.  The importance of Protocol II lies in its ability to develop, amplify and support Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions.  Despite this laudable attempt to extend the operation of the Conventions, there were deficiencies.  Among these was the sparse to non-existent protection to be afforded to medical personnel and a lack of rules on the conduct of hostilities aimed at sparing the civilian population.</P>
    <P>The need for such a set of rules of conduct cannot be overstated.  We are currently confronted with an increasing use of force in conflicts which fall short of the level required to include them under the heading of &ldquo;international&rdquo;.  Basic humanitarian considerations require that also in such non-international conflicts fundamental standards of humanity are respected.  The very existence of such a set of rules, being representative of a desire on the part of the international community, is a welcome development, of which Ireland should be seen to be a part.</P>
    <P>Protocol II, additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, in its title, declares itself to be directly concerned with non-international armed conflicts.  Protocol II is shorter than Protocol I containing only 28 articles.  It deals with areas of humane treatment in Part II, wounded, sick and shipwrecked in Part III, and the civilian population in Part IV.  Article 4(2) contains a list of acts which remain prohibited at any time and place.  It establishes fundamental guarantees for all persons who do not take a direct part in hostilities, bans attacks on the civilian population and forbids the forced displacement of civilians.</P>
    <P>Protocol II lays down provisions in relation to the care of the wounded and sick.  Of primary importance in this regard is the protection given in Article 12 to the distinctive emblem.  Such provisions can only assist medical personnel in their attempts to administer to the sick and wounded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> Overall, Protocol II is silent on the issue of enforcement.  Acts which violate the Protocol are breaches of the treaty.  This fact alone does not give any other state standing to bring an action. However, events like setting up the two tribunals for the prosecution of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda stand testament to the commitment of the international community not to let gross violations of international humanitarian law go unpunished.</P>
    <P>The State signed the additional Protocols on 12 December 1977, subject to ratification.  Since then 146 states have become parties to Protocol I and 138 to Protocol II.  Despite a considerable lapse in time, this Government has indicated for some time its willingness to begin the process of ratification. A statement was made on behalf of the State at the XXV International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in December 1995 underlining the Government's intention to ratify the 1977 additional Protocols.  On 10 July 1996, the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mr. Cornelio Sommaruga, at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, raised the issue of Ireland's non-ratification of Protocols I and II and emphasised his hope that Ireland would ratify these as soon as possible.  The chairman of the joint committee assured Mr. Sommaruga that all appropriate action would be taken on this issue.  Ratification of these Protocols will help complete the task of the International Committee of the Red Cross in achieving universal recognition of the 1977 Protocols, and could also be influential in encouraging the few remaining countries which are not yet parties to the Protocols to become so.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the various sections of the Bill and, in doing so, I will concentrate on a number of specific measures.  Section 1 of the Bill defines the Principal Act as the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill replaces section 2 of the Principal Act of 1962 with a completely new section in regard to the interpretation of certain phrases.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill, amending section 3 of the Principal Act, extends the category of &ldquo;grave breach&rdquo; under the Principal Act to include &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo; as defined in paragraph 4 of Article 11 and paragraphs 2, 3, or 4 of Article 85 of Protocol I and sets out maximum sentences applicable in respect of &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo; which involve wilful killing and other grave breaches.  In the former the sentence is to be life imprisonment or any less term and for the latter the punishment shall not exceed 14 years.</P>
    <P>Section 4 relates to minor breaches of the Conventions and Protocol 1 by (i) adding references to the appropriate Protocol or to both Protocols where reference is made in the Principal Act to &ldquo;the Scheduled Conventions&rdquo;, that is the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and (ii) updating the level of certain fines provided for in the Principal Act from £50 to £1,500 and £300 to £5,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> Section 5 facilitates the proof of application of any of the Conventions or Protocol I in court proceedings by way of a certificate from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the insertion of the additional Protocols into the Principal Act as the Fifth and Sixth Schedules.</P>
    <P>Section 7 enables the Minister for Foreign Affairs to publish in a statutory instrument any reservations or declarations made by the State in relation to either of the additional Protocols.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 regulate the use of certain symbols and signals used for identification purposes by Civil Defence and medical units and transports and also make their use subject to the consent of the Minister for Defence.  Furthermore, they enable the Minister for Defence to make regulations in accordance with the relevant convention or protocol in respect of miscellaneous identifying objects and identity cards and they create offences punishable by fine where such regulations or consent requirements are infringed either by individual persons or bodies corporate.</P>
    <P>Section 10 increases the fine for offences committed under the Red Cross Act, 1938, one such offence being the unlawful use by any person of the heraldic emblem of the Red Cross from £10 to £1,500.</P>
    <P>Section 11 extends the scope of section 1 of the Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act, 1956, which provides the definition of persons as prisoners of war and enemy aliens.  It is principally designed to extend and accommodate the categories of persons covered by the relevant provisions of Protocol l in regard to the classification of persons as prisoners of war.  Section 12 provides for the short Title and also enables the Minister to make an order to bring the Bill into operation.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Bill a number of problems, mainly of a technical and grammatical nature, have been brought to my attention which I will address by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  It is believed that the minor amendments on Committee Stage will improve the Bill's overall texture and content.</P>
    <P>As noted earlier, it is the task of such laws to promote humanity in the most inhumane circumstances. In this regard alone their objective is truly onerous and difficult.  The values of humane treatment and restraint, of making a distinction between civilians and military so that the former are not attacked, as contained in both protocols, merit reaffirmation.  It is my opinion that the two protocols represent a sincere commitment on the part of the international community to mitigate the brutality and suffering of armed conflicts throughout the world.  It is regrettable that some parties to conflicts seem to recognise such conventions and protocols only in the breach.  This fact cannot be used to undermine the utility of humanitarian law, rather it must strengthen the resolve of states to ensure universal respect for such laws.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael supports the general thrust of the Bill which means that we can finally meet some of our international commitments. However, there are a number of technical provisions in the Bill, including a number of protocols, in respect of which I am receiving advice.  I will reserve my position on amendments to the Bill until Committee Stage.  However, we support the Bill's general thrust.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed to note that it has taken 21 years for the Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Bill to be introduced in the Dáil.  The Bill was presented by the previous Government but the conventions to which it refers have their origins in 1977.  That is an unsatisfactory way for us to conduct our business.  Since 1977 different parties have held power but that is not the point.  In Government, we must ensure that there are sufficient resources available so that these conventions can be updated and introduced in a more timely fashion.  When replying, will the Minister of State indicate the number of other international agreements or conventions which are outstanding and the timescale for their implementation? This is not a satisfactory way to conduct international relations.</P>
      <P>Section lll, Article 32, of the Bill deals with missing and dead persons and the right of families to know the fate of their relatives.  Article 33.3 allows for a role in this regard for the Red Cross. I take this opportunity to appeal to the leadership of Sinn Féin to prevail on the IRA to use the good offices of the Red Cross to provide information to families in continuing anguish over the fate of 14 missing persons in Northern Ireland.  In any civilised society these conventions must be upheld.  We are in the process of trying to bring about an agreed Ireland.  Such a gesture would help bring about healing, allow families the peace of mind they deserve regarding their loved ones and restore to the victims the right of Christian burial.  This information could be supplied to the Red Cross, anonymously if necessary.</P>
      <P>The Bill gets to the heart of the need to treat people with humanity.  Since we are negotiating for an agreed Ireland and given the fact that there are 14 missing persons presumed dead, the whereabouts of whom are known to the IRA, that organisation has a duty and responsibility in the interests of humanity to inform the families. The Bill states that certain decent standards must be observed in conflict.  If the members of the IRA have a shred of decency, Sinn Féin should use its influence with them to ensure that this information becomes known.  I am not naive enough to believe that IRA representatives will call to the houses of the relatives of the missing people.  However, they can inform them of their loved ones' whereabouts through the Red Cross which is part of the machinery allowed for in respect of international conflicts.  That machinery should be availed of because it would make a major contribution to the healing process.</P>

      <Col N="1159" /> South Africa has a commission on truth and reconciliation.  In time we are going to have to address how the people living on this island can be reconciled, not merely in terms of the institutional arrangements being negotiated internally on a North-South basis but also in terms of people being reconciled to each other.  This is an important step which could be taken towards that reconciliation.  In the event that people believe I am not being even-handed, if there are others within the security forces or so-called loyalist terrorist organisations who fall into a similar category, I call on them to supply whatever information they have in their possession so that people can discover what happened to their loved ones.</P>
    <P>We cannot begin to contemplate what it must be like for a person whose loved one has disappeared, has never been heard from since and whose whereabouts are unknown.  That is a terrible cross for someone to bear for the remainder of their life.  Something can be done about this.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a number of penalties which I will deal with shortly.  It seems that the legislation is short on machinery for enforcement. What happens if people do not meet the standards they agree to meet by signing these conventions? The provision of a permanent international criminal court is being considered separately.  As things stand, that court, if established, would not have the independence to take up cases in its own right and would, presumably, only deal with cases referred to it by the UN Security Council or some such body.  What mechanism will be put in place to ensure the enforcement of the provisions of the conventions?  Will the international criminal court, which is currently under consideration and being negotiated upon, have sufficient powers of enforcement to ensure compliance with those provisions?</P>
    <P>With regard to the 21 years it has taken to bring these conventions before the House, I wish to place on record my concern and amazement at the fact that the Department of Equality and Law Reform was abolished and its function merged with that of the Department of Justice.  If the Department of Equality and Law Reform had run its course, which is doubtful, in respect of domestic legislation on equality and law reform, surely it would have been possible to use the Department to work on the conventions and bring forward other outstanding international conventions so that we will not be obliged to wait a further 21 years for their introduction in the House.  I note that the purpose of the four Geneva Red Cross conventions is to afford protection to victims of international armed conflicts, and that they were adopted on 12 August 1949. Two additional protocols to extend the scope of the conventions were concluded at Geneva on 10 June 1977.  The purpose of this Bill is to make the necessary changes in law to enable Ireland to ratify these two protocols.  What happened in 1977 was outstanding business from 1949, and in 1998, <Col N="1160" /> we are only now getting down to dealing with this Bill.  Protocol I concerns itself with the protection of victims of international armed conflict, and Protocol II relates to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflict.  I wonder who will do the protecting.  Certainly Ireland is not doing very much protecting.  We in this House have failed in our duty to debate in a sensible, reasoned and fair manner what should be Ireland's role in participation in peacemaking as distinct from peacekeeping.  We have a distinguished role in peacekeeping.  Our armed forces have distinguished themselves in peacekeeping, as have the Garda Síochána in more recent times in an international peacekeeping role.  We cannot just forever issue all sorts of concerned statements when the former Yugoslavia falls apart and people are literally being cut to pieces and having their eyes gouged out in a horrific genocide.  We are now presented with the potential for this to happen again on our doorstep in Kosovo.  We know what is going on in Algeria. The situation in Albania is very shaky.  I note that in the Amsterdam Treaty there are provisions to transfer from the Western European Union to the European Union St. Petersberg Task type commitments, including humanitarian aid, search and rescue, environmental protection, peacekeeping and peacemaking.  I presume in those circumstances, when the European Union has that capacity on the passing of the Amsterdam Treaty, which I hope will be passed, that we will be prepared to play our role in peacemaking.  We cannot send humanitarian aid, we cannot ensure that Protocols I and II of these conventions are applied if, internationally, there is not some means of enforcing the requirements of these protocols.  Humanitarian aid cannot be provided where law and order does not exist.  We recognised this in the past when the House approved sending Irish troops to Somalia in a peace enforcement type role.  We have to address this question.  We cannot ignore it.  I say to the hypocrites who constantly make outrageous allegations about Irish neutrality and the fact that we are abandoning our neutrality by passing various European Union treaties, that they cannot have it both ways.  These are the same people who whinge and cry, and moan and plead when the conflicts I mentioned take place.  We cannot simply be part of a European Union which issues statements and <i>démarches.</i> We must be part of a European Union which is part of the solution, particularly in relation to conflict on our doorstep in Europe.  It is time we had a mature debate on this whole issue.  I welcome the moves by Deputy Desmond O'Malley, chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, to try to bring about a clearer, more reasoned debate on these issues within that committee.  I certainly intend, on behalf of Fine Gael, to play a constructive role in that debate.</P>
    <P>In relation to international humanitarian law, this Bill requires that states which have resorted to armed conflict from time to time as a method <Col N="1161" /> of solving their disputes must behave in a certain way.  It is regrettable that these international conflicts take place.  It has led to the elaboration of rules governing the means and methods of warfare as well as rules for the protection of victims of armed conflict.  These rules are variously described as the law of war, the law of armed conflict, or international humanitarian law.  It is regrettable that we have to set down rules and laws to govern this whole area but, nonetheless, it is important.  For example, the Bill addresses the treatment of people who are <i>hors de combat</i>, or who are spies, or who are not spies, and how they should be treated.  It addresses questions in relation to the civilian populations and civilian targets.  The Minister specifically referred to Article 51 which he said is perhaps one of the most important articles in Protocol I. The Minister said: &ldquo;It explicitly confirms the customary rule that innocent civilians must be kept outside hostilities as far as possible and enjoy general protection against danger from hostilities&rdquo;.  I notice from the Bill that there are provisions in relation to civilian targets in Chapter III; Article 52 refers to general protection of civilian objects; Article 53 refers to protection of cultural objects and places of worship; Article 55 refers to protection of the natural environment and Article 56 refers to protection of works and installations containing dangerous forces.  These are examples of what are specified in the Bill for protection, but how can we say in the legislation that where there is a military target near a civilian population, or a series of military targets spread around where there is a civilian population, aerial bombing in that regard would or could be an offence under this Bill?  The proposal is welcome in theory, but where does this leave atomic warfare? Surely the atomic bomb cannot be dropped on a military target, no matter how removed it is from the civilian population.  Why then do these protocols not specifically prohibit atomic warfare? One could not meet the requirements of those sections I have read and engage in atomic warfare at the same time.  Yet the Bill does not outlaw atomic warfare.  It should.  This is an international convention on warfare, the rules of war. How could atomic warfare be conducted while meeting the provisions of this Bill as I have outlined here?  If some state, whether a signatory to this or not, does become involved in atomic warfare, does that mean that, irrespective of who they are, they will be prosecuted and there will be a mechanism for enforcement under this legislation? If not, these protocols are bogus.  I ask the Minister to address that question.  How can a state conduct atomic warfare aimed at military targets, avoiding the destruction of civilian populations and meeting the requirements of these sections?  I do not see how that can be done.</P>
    <P>The four Geneva conventions of 1949 were almost universally accepted.  Their purpose is to mitigate the barbarism and brutality of armed conflict.  The first convention relates to the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick <Col N="1162" /> in armed forces in the field.  The second relates to the amelioration of the condition of wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of the armed forces at sea.  The third relates to the treatment of prisoners of war and the fourth concerns the protection of civilian persons in time of war.  I am not a military expert, but in terms of conventional war those conventions have served us well.  Protocol I and II update those conventions to take account of modern conflicts and warfare, but I do not know how that can be done without including a strong provision outlawing the use of atomic warfare.</P>
    <P>The Geneva Conventions Act, 1962, enabled effect to be given in domestic law to those four conventions and I understand it is necessary to amend that Act and associated legislation to enable Ireland to become a party to the two additional protocols.  Broadly speaking, the Bill amends or extends existing sections of the current legislation to give effect to certain articles of the protocol.  It will extend, for example, the category of &ldquo;grave breach&rdquo; to include &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo;.  The Bill will also regulate the use of certain symbols and signals for identification purposes by civil defence, medical units and transports.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain why the fines specified in the Bill are so small?  I presume soldiers, navel personnel or a members of the armed forces found guilty of an offence under these provisions will have their fines paid by the State.  Will any State shake in its boots at fines of £1,500 or £5,000.  I accept the fine has been increased from £50, but a fine of £1,500 or £5,000 is petty cash for States prepared to invest large amounts in superior armaments.  I accept these fines are for minor breaches of the convention, but nobody would bat an eyelid if, say, the British, Irish or French Governments were fined £1,500.  What is the thinking behind that level of fine?  It has little relevance to the penalty that should apply for breaches of the convention, however minor.  We are talking about the sick and wounded or clergy who are not involved in combat, but may wear a uniform.  We should impose relevant fines or not include them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I deals with the general provisions of the Bill.  Paragraph 4 on page nine states:</P>
    <P>The situations referred to in the preceding paragraph include armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes in the exercise of their right of self-determination, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I already referred to the IRA giving information to the Red Cross on the 14 persons who have disappeared and are presumed dead in Northern Ireland.  What implications will this <Col N="1163" /> section have for people who claim to be freedom fighters but do not have a mandate, where it is clear that the mandate runs for democratic constitutional parties and not for self-appointed swaggering public house republicans or so-called loyalists? Who will determine if a person, persons or organisation qualifies under that section?  That matter needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he will make a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage, most of which will be of a typographical or grammatical nature.  Will he submit those to the Opposition as soon as possible so that we have an opportunity to consider them?</P>
    <P>Chapter VI deals with civil defence.  Consideration should be given to reinvigorating the civil defence movement, which has served us well down through the years.  I may be wrong, but I suspect very few new recruits are joining the civil defence.  There is a tendency for us to become more selfish as we become more materialistic. There has been a great tradition of voluntarism in Ireland, whether through the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Simon Community or other such organisations.  Many people have also given their time voluntarily to political parties and fulfilled a useful public service in so doing.  However, while large numbers of people will attend meetings of political parties at election time and at other interesting times, they have become bored with the regular meetings.  They can get any information they require on television rather than from their local TDs.  Consequently, there is a fall-off in the tradition of voluntarism.</P>
    <P>We should examine the possibility of promoting voluntary participation by young people in civil defence.  We are living in a society where people are well aware of their rights, but few are aware of their obligations.  We must endeavour to make young people aware of their obligations as well as their rights.  It is not an exaggeration to say that in biblical terms we may be going through a seven year feast, but we may have seven years of famine at some time in the future. Will the present generation which is materially better off than any previous generation be able to cope when the other day comes?  They would be prepared to cope if they were made aware of the need to devote some of their time and effort to the less privileged and to serve the community in a more general way through, perhaps, a youth corps in the Civil Defence.  That is only one way of dealing with it but the general principle could be applied.</P>
    <P>If we are to make provisions for civil defence we should look at our own Civil Defence organisation and assess whether it is adequately resourced, if the relevant Minister devotes sufficient time to considering its needs and if it is marketed as a desirable project for young people in which to become involved.  There is little point in making provisions regarding civil defence if we do not have an adequate Civil Defence.  While I appreciate its members, some of whom live in my <Col N="1164" /> constituency, are committed and hard working we should examine its role and decide whether it needs to be boosted and whether there should be a youth corps.</P>
    <P>In his reply or on Committee Stage will the Minister address the question of fundamental guarantees &mdash; in Article 75.2 which states:</P>
    <P>The following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever, whether committed by civilian or by military agents:</P>
    <P>(a) violence to the life, health, or physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular:</P>
    <P>(i) murder;</P>
    <P>(ii) torture of all kinds, whether physical or mental;</P>
    <P>(iii) corporal punishment; and</P>
    <P>(iv) mutilation;</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs I was appalled to learn of some of the outrageous sexual abuses which took place in the former Yugoslavia.  Will the Minister consider making sexual abuse of prisoners, of the civilian population and of anybody in the context of warfare, an offence specified in the legislation?</P>
    <P>I welcome Article 90 which deals with the International Fact-Finding Commission.  If we could get the agreement of the Algerian Government to send an international fact-finding mission to Algeria we would be in a position to know whether the claim that more than 80,000 are dead, or the claim by the Algerian Government that the figure is nearer to 27,000, is correct and we could determine, independently, what action the international community needs to take.  It appears to public representatives here that if the Algerian Government has nothing to hide, it should allow in the rapporteurs, as suggested by the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, or some acceptable international fact-finding team.  In the event of this legislation being passed and this international fact-finding commission being established, what will be the scope of application for, say, Algeria and other states? Will it apply only to the states which have signed the agreement or has it implications for others?</P>
    <P>This is technical legislation and it may be unique.  It is the first legislation I can recall that has symbols and designs as well as words.  I realise this is necessary if warfare is to be conducted within certain rules.  None of us want warfare but where it takes place some basic rules must apply. We welcome this legislation and support it overall but will seek to improve it.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister join me in calling on Sinn Féin to persuade the IRA to let the Red Cross know the whereabouts of the 14 missing persons in order that their families can be informed.  That would help bring about an agreed Ireland and peace and reconciliation on this island.  This is what the spirit of this legislation is about.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for taking part in the debate and I am grateful for his contribution.  The purpose of this Bill is to make the necessary change in Irish law to enable Ireland to ratify the two protocols which were concluded at Geneva on 10 June 1977, and which are additional to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949.  There is general agreement on this matter.</P>
      <P>On the issue of enforcement it is important to note that this is a question of the consent of states to agree the appropriate enforcement measures. It should not be forgotten that the UN Charter and in particular the Security Council can take the necessary steps in this regard.  In regard to the establishment of the international tribunal for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda for the trial of persons who have committed serious offences, enforcement steps have been taken at international level.  It will only be a matter of time before other measures develop at international level.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the number of international treaties awaiting consideration.  Ireland has a good track record in incorporating into domestic law the provisions and obligations and duties arising from and contained in international treaties.  We will continue to ensure we do not fall behind in this process.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked why atomic and other weapons have not been prohibited by these protocols. The purpose of these protocols is humanitarian. They are aimed at injured and wounded soldiers, seamen, airmen and civilians.  They are not concerned with weapons and their use.  The issue is for another forum.</P>
      <P>The fines set out show significant increases in the amounts prescribed in legislation passed by this House less than 40 years ago.</P>
      <P>On the question of the IRA, I draw the Deputy's attention to Part I of the Protocol which deals with the scope of Protocol II.  It is clear from that part of Protocol II that the Deputy's suggestion does not apply to Northern Ireland.  It does not apply to internal disturbance and tensions.  I hope that clarifies the position.</P>
      <P>In regard to the International Humanitarian and Funding Commission, the Commission is competent to inquire into certain allegations of breaching the conventions and protocols.  It must be noted that the Commission has competence if the state parties to the proceedings have deposited a declaration accepting its competence.</P>
      <P>I sincerely thank Deputy Mitchell for contributing to this most interesting debate.  I am pleased the Bill has been brought forward.  It is an important Bill which reaffirms the principles of humane treatment and restraint as contained in both Protocols.  I thank the Deputy for his help and co-operation.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: The Minister is being less than frank.  One would imagine after the debacle of the release of the five detainees in the controversial Tallaght case, arising from the extension of the warrants by a District Court judge who had not been nominated properly for the purposes of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, that the Minister would be up-front and accept responsibility.  Is it not the case that Paul Dillon was arrested in Limerick on 6 November 1997?  The Garda had the power to hold him for questioning for 48 hours.  Was he not arrested on a charge of having £150,000 worth of cannabis?  Is it not the case that the initial detention was granted by Judge Michael O'Reilly, one of the 22 judges nominated for the purposes of the Act mentioned, but that the second 72 hours authorisation was given by Judge John O'Neill who was not one of the 22 judges nominated?</P>

      <P>I object to the Deputy's accusation that I am being less than frank.  He knows that, as I have stated in the past, the appointment of District Court judges for the purposes of the 1996 Act is a matter for the President of the District Court, not for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Despite this having been repeatedly made clear, the Opposition continues to complain as if the appointment procedure were a matter for me.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific case the Deputy raised, I understand it is before the courts.  It would be wrong of me to speak in detail on it. The Deputy has touched on what I would describe as a very fine point of law.  The powers of a permanently assigned judge are assigned under the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961.  The Deputy's question is whether Judge O'Neill had sufficient powers to enable him to make the detention order pursuant to the 1996 Act.  I cannot go into that matter because it is a fine point of law.</P>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that Judge O'Neill did not have the powers contained in the 1996 Act and that the 1961 Act does not apply to an appointment pursuant to the 1996 Act?  I will not engage in an argument on that point because it is such a fine point of law.  I will let the courts decide it.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: On 16 December 1997 the Minister told the House that 22 judges outside the Dublin metropolitan area were assigned to carry out the functions under the 1996 Act.  Judge O'Neill is not one of them.  The Minister knows the likelihood is that there will be a repeat of the Tallaght case and that this individual to whom I referred will go free.  We should not blame the Judiciary, although there was an administrative cock-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 2 December 1997 I asked the Minister if he was satisfied that 33 cases of extended detention under section 2 of the 1996 Act were granted by judges assigned by the President of the District Court.  In a written reply he indicated that he did <Col N="1168" /> not consider the question appropriate and went on at length in that vein.  Before the Adjournment Debate that evening the Minister sneaked into the House and said:</P>
    <P>In a statement to this House last Tuesday concerning the release of persons who appeared in court in connection with drug trafficking offences, I stated that the President of the District Court had nominated 22 District Court judges assigned to provincial District Court areas and one District Court judge assigned to the Dublin Area for the purpose of extending periods of detention under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996. This information was supplied to my Department by the President of the District Court. However, I received confirmation this evening that another district justice in Dublin, Judge Kirby, was also nominated by the President of the District Court under the Act.  I regret that I inadvertently gave incorrect information, which did not emanate from me, to the House.</P>
    <P>This was an apology for withholding information.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to apologise because he knew on that date that there was another case pending, the case to which I referred.  He said it privately.  When the Minister gave us that information he knew there was another such case in November.  This case was on 2 December.  A judge, not properly assigned, gave an extension of a detention warrant.  I ask the Minister to apologise to the House for withholding that information which he knew about.</P>

In the Dublin Metropolitan area, there is the President, Judge Smithwick, and Judge Thelma King.  The Minister told us in the controversial circumstances of this House that two judges were assigned by the President, the President of the District Court, Judge Smithwick and Judge King. The Minister sneaked in just before the Adjournment when the Gallery and the House were empty and apologised for withholding information that there was another judge in the Dublin area, Judge Kirby.  The Minister told the House on 16 December that there were only 22 judges assigned for the purposes of the Act outside the Dublin metropolitan area and he gave their names.  Judge O'Neill was not on that list and the Minister knew he was not on it.  When the Minister told us Judge Kirby was an additional appointee in Dublin he knew about this case in the country which is still pending before the courts.  I am not talking about that case, but the Minister's treatment of this House and the contempt he has shown for it.  He knowingly withheld information from this House which we were <Col N="1169" /> entitled to know.  The Minister knew about it and I ask him to apologise to the House.</P>

There are cameras all around me and radio equipment.  There are journalists here and the general public are entitled to come into the House.</P>
      <P>The Chief Whip of Fine Gael was in the House that night and, if my memory serves me correctly, Deputy Higgins, the Fine Gael spokesperson for Justice, was sitting opposite me when I made that statement about Judge Kirby.  I spoke in English, not in Swahili.  I do not understand how anybody could get the impression that I was less than frank, or sneaky, with regard to the allegation that I withheld information.  I suppose it is true I did not have the information on 25 November which was available to me on 2 December to the extent that I did not know the position in relation to Judge Kirby.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how Deputy Higgins could even dare suggest that I knowingly withheld the information.  The facts of the matter are that on 25 November I dealt with the release by the Dublin Metropolitan District Court of five persons and in that statement I gave the House the information that was available to me, including the fact that the President of the District Court had nominated Judge Thelma King to hear the applications. On 2 December when I became aware the President had also nominated Judge Kirby to hear cases in Dublin, I corrected the information at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the other matter, I was asked about other cases and replied I would like to help the Deputy but said that some of those matters were before the courts and I did not have the statistics available to me nor did I anticipate that I would be asked for them.  In so far as this case is concerned, I explain, for the second time, Judge O'Neill is a moveable judge of the District Court or was at that time.  He was assigned by the President of the District Court to the Limerick District Court area and, as such, under section 4 (2) of the Sixth Schedule of the Courts (Supplementary Provisions) Act, l961, he had the powers of the permanently assigned district judge and arising from that Judge O'Neill would have considered he had sufficient powers to exercise those functions under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, l996.  The point Deputy Higgins put to me is a very fine point of law.  The question is <i>sub judice.</i>  I will not interpret the law or prejudice this case.  I reject Deputy Higgins's allegation that I came in here and deliberately misled the House.  It is clear from any interpretation of the <Col N="1170" /> events that I outlined the judges who were permanently assigned.  I listed them in the House on Tuesday, 16 December l997.  Judge O'Neill's name does not appear on that list because he is not or was not a permanently assigned judge at that time.</P>

That is a matter for the courts.  It is ludicrous in the extreme for Deputy Higgins to come into the House and make these wild allegations on a very fine point of law in regard to a matter which may well be decided by the courts, depending on the course of events.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>A key priority in the Government's Action Programme for the New Millennium is the enactment of comprehensive juvenile justice legislation, and to that end the Government approved the restoration of the Children Bill, 1996, to the Dáil Order Paper at Committee Stage.  At present, the Bill is being examined with a view to bringing forward Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will totally <Col N="1171" /> repeal the Children Act, 1908, and replace it with a modern statute.  The main aim of the Bill is to provide an up-to-date legislative framework within which a new juvenile justice system can be formulated.</P>
      <P>The juvenile justice aspects of the Bill span arrangements for dealing with children from the point where they are detected committing offences to their release from detention and beyond.  The primary objectives of the juvenile justice aspects of the legislation are (1) to divert first time and non-serious child offenders, where feasible, from the criminal justice system; (2) to deal with children whose offences are of such a serious nature, or are of such persistence, that they have to be brought before a court, through the imposition by the court of community sanctions; and (3) to work for the reintegration of child offenders back into the community in every case where a court considers it has no option but to order the detention of such a child.</P>
      <P>Those objectives are in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UN standard minimum rules for the administration of juvenile justice, &ldquo;the Beijing rules&rdquo;, the UN guidelines for the prevention of juvenile delinquency, &ldquo;the Riyadh guidelines&rdquo;, as well as the UN rules for the protection of juveniles deprived of their liberty, &ldquo;Havana rules&rdquo;.  It would be wrong to view the Bill in isolation from crime preventive measures provided for in the Child Care Act, 1991, and in the plans for legislation of the Department of Education and Science aimed at tackling the problem of truancy.</P>
      <P>Juvenile offenders who meet certain conditions may also be dealt with under the Garda juvenile diversion programme as an alternative to prosecution. The programme commenced in 1963 and, following a review by a working party, a number of procedural changes were introduced in 1991 and the National Juvenile Office was established. The primary aim of the programme is crime prevention.</P>
      <P>The Children Bill, 1996, proposes placing the Garda juvenile diversion programme on a statutory footing.  The Bill also includes provision for holding family conferences as part of the programme to be held in a Garda station convenient to the persons attending or in the offender's home or, in exceptional circumstances, in some other place.  My Department is currently funding 13 community-based youth diversion projects located in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Dundalk.  Proposals for a further three projects, two in Dublin and one in Tralee, are currently under consideration.  A lengthy reply is available to Deputy Upton's excellent question but I can see he is becoming impatient to ask some specific questions.  In deference to requests that the replies be kept short, I will yield to Deputy Upton's questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for allowing me to intervene at this stage.  Is an assessment <Col N="1172" /> being carried out on the various measures to divert young people from crime which the Minister is considering?  Would he agree with me that it is possible to identify, with a good degree of certainty, children at birth, and certainly by the age of 8 years, who will become involved in a life of crime?  Will the Minister consider taking special measures directed at that cohort of children in order to divert them from what seems, in many cases, to be their inevitable fate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is true that there are certain situations in which it is likely that young people will embark upon a life of crime.  I assure the Deputy that the Government is taking action on a broad range of fronts to advance social inclusion.  The Cabinet sub-committee dealing with this matter is addressing a range of issues which deal with poverty and social exclusion and a number of strategic areas are being targeted.</P>
      <P>I take it that Deputy Upton is referring to the whole question of poverty and local development in places where drug abuse is rampant and there is a need for pilot programmes for children at risk.  Such programmes are being advanced.  In addition, the Probation and Welfare Service of my Department runs a number of community-based projects which cater for young offenders at risk of continuing in crime.  The Department is also funding the Copping On crime awareness programme which is delivered through Youthreach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that a number of these children present a special problem for their parents who are unable to cope with them?  Would the Minister be prepared to introduce some special support measures for parents unable to cope with children who are out of control? Would he consider introducing control measures to deal with parents who, in effect, renege on their responsibilities to look after their children properly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is again referring to the whole question of social exclusion and the desirability of social inclusion.  I have indicated to him the steps which the Government is currently taking to address that problem.  The Government is very conscious of the need to ensure maximum co-ordination of services at community level.  For this reason, new procedures to achieve this objective are being developed by the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, in the context of four pilot areas selected by the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, the whole issue of social inclusion would, of necessity, have to address parents, poverty, availability of drugs and so on.  The Government is very concerned about the matters to which the Deputy has referred and is, through a variety of programmes, seeking to address them. In January, the Taoiseach announced a programme <Col N="1173" /> for young people at risk, the centrepiece of which was the availability of £30 million in funding which is to be provided over the next three years.  The funding will support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider introducing a pilot project in conjunction with other Departments and agencies specially designed to assist parents who freely acknowledge that their children are out of control and they are unable to cope with them?  A number of recent newspaper articles have been published on the problems encountered by people in such circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <P>There are a number of youth diversion projects already in operation.  There are 13 projects in all, six of which are based in Dublin in Ronanstown, Killinarden, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Cherry Orchard, Priorswood, Darndale and the north inner city.  Three projects are based in Cork in Knocknaheeny, Mahon and the Glen and two are based in Limerick at Moyross and Southill.  One project is based in Ballybeg in Waterford.  The total cost of these projects to date is in the region of £700,000.  Those projects are already in operation and the Department is currently considering proposals for projects in the south inner city, Finglas and Hardwicke Street and in Tralee.  I hope to be in a position to make a decision on these projects shortly.</P>

      <Quest>if he will expand the number of drugs detoxification places in prisons so that drug-dependent prisoners can be offered an exit from the cycle of drugs and crime.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said on many occasions in the past, I believe the most effective strategy in dealing with drug addicted offenders is a combination of appropriate treatment, education and rehabilitation.  To this end, as the Deputy will be aware, there are specially designed information programmes which address the risks associated with the misuse of drugs in all our prisons.  Not all of our penal institutions have a significant drug problem.  The majority of offenders with such problems are located in institutions in the Dublin area, in particular in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
      <P>A detoxification programme has been in operation in Mountjoy Prison's health care unit for some time.  This programme is operated by the medical personnel in the prison and is aimed at weaning addicts off drugs by means of gradually reducing dosages of substitutes such as methadone. The programme is modelled on similar hospital-based units in the community.  In addition to those inmates admitted to the health care unit, methadone may be prescribed by the medical officer for offenders who are accommodated in the general prison population in Mountjoy Prison and in any of the other institutions.</P>
      <P>I accept that the number of places available in dedicated drug treatment facilities in our prisons is insufficient.  It is my intention to have a medical treatment programme and a secure drug-free unit in every closed institution, where it is considered necessary, as soon as possible.  However, the progress which can be made in this area is hampered to some extent by the severe overcrowding problem in some of our prisons.  The Deputy will be aware I am addressing the overcrowding problem at present.</P>
      <P>The medical treatment of drug addicts, in common with the provision of all medical services in the prison system, is co-ordinated by the Director of Prison Medical Services who liaises regularly with the health boards to try to ensure a level of primary health care for prisoners equivalent to that available in the community.  Developments in medical services for drug addicts in the community are closely monitored with a view to their application in prisons where practicable.  In this regard, I am pleased to note there has been an ongoing high degree of co-operation between the Eastern Health Board, including the agencies under its aegis, and my Department.  I trust this co-operation will continue and, where feasible, expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board's consultant psychiatrists with responsibility for drug misuse, who provide sessions in Mountjoy, have been in discussion with officials in my Department, including the Director of Prison Medical Services and the Governor of Mountjoy Prison, with a view <Col N="1175" /> to extending and improving the drug treatment services provided to prisoners including, where appropriate, methadone maintenance.  Similar developments are envisaged in regard to tackling the drug problem in other prisons where the need is established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister expect a proper service to be provided to deal with drug addicts in prisons?  There is a huge heroin addiction problem in some jails, particularly Mountjoy. Does he agree it is perverse and outrageous that a state of the art drug treatment facility is not available in prisons?  Prison seems to be the easiest place to encounter drug addicts.  It is amazing there is no proper service and that this has been allowed continue for a long period.</P>

It is my intention to have a medical treatment programme, if necessary, and a secure drug-free unit in every closed institution.  I cannot give the precise date of when this will occur other than to say it will be as soon as possible.  It is hampered by the problem of overcrowding, which we are taking vigorous steps to end.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept it might be a better arrangement for the prison health services to be organised through the health boards and the Department of Health and Children? Are men and women on methadone treatment able to avail of it when in prison, particularly Mountjoy?  Can the Minister guarantee they can continue that treatment if they have been convicted while on methadone?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The drugs treatment unit in Mountjoy is working relatively well.  However, the provision of such services is hampered by overcrowding.  Counselling is provided by the probation and welfare service, not the health board and there is input from a number of community agencies.  I accept that efforts should be complemented by a dedicated addiction counselling service.  I asked the prisons division of the Department and the director of the prison medical services to address this issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope a suitable arrangement can be entered into with the Eastern Health Board to address the need for a dedicated addiction counselling service in the near future.  The Eastern Health Board's consultant psychiatrists, with responsibility for drug misuse, provide sessions in Mountjoy and have been in discussion with officials of my Department, including the director of prison medical services and the governor of Mountjoy, with a view to extending and improving the drug treatment services provided to prisoners, including, where appropriate, methadone maintenance. Similar developments are envisaged in relation to <Col N="1176" /> tackling the drug problem in other prisons where necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear whether the Minister answered my question.  Is the Minister saying that if someone is on methadone treatment before they go to prison, they must go through counselling and the psychiatrist determines whether that treatment should continue?  Does this mean that people on methadone are no longer given the opportunity to continue treatment which is vital to any chance of recovery?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I answered the question.  In addition to inmates admitted to the healthcare unit, methadone may be prescribed to offenders who are accommodated in the general prison population.  That is the position in Mountjoy and any other institution.  Methadone may be prescribed by the medical officer.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Mountjoy prison is riddled with drugs and we acknowledge this is a difficult problem.  On detoxification and treatment, what is being done in the area of follow-up care for prisoners released back into society and into the type of environment which initially led them into jail?  When they are released, they fall prey, almost immediately, to the pimps, managers of crime and drug pushers.  What is being done in the area of hospital accommodation, particularly for female prisoners who seem to be particularly vulnerable in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a health matter and the Eastern Health Board has, in recent years, provided additional places.  It is anticipated that treatment will be extended to 25 other locations. Over the last two years there has been a considerable improvement in the treatment of people who are addicted to illegal drugs.</P>
      <P>The other point raised by Deputy Higgins is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as regards the return of hardened addicts to crime.  I recently received the report of Mrs. Justice Denham who I requested, with the Courts Commission to look into the question of drugs courts.  The report recommended a planning programme be established to devise the measures needed to set up a drugs court, initially in the District Court.  The report also recommended that drugs courts should only be used in circumstances where the offence is a relatively minor one of possession and where it is non-violent.</P>
      <P>I hope to bring this important report before Government shortly.  It will be a radical new departure if implemented.  Such a programme has been successful in the United Stages.  On the one hand, it vindicates the addict's right to bodily integrity and on the other helps to assist society in the fight against criminality.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: The body of John Corcoran, an epileptic married man with eight children was found on Saturday, 23 March 1985.  He had been shot in the head.  Is the Minister aware that Seán O'Callaghan, a self-confessed IRA killer and informer, has admitted to this murder and given graphic details about the manner in which he arrested John Corcoran, questioned him and shot him with a Beretta gun?  Is he also aware that he has given graphic details of raids carried out in the Minister's constituency?  Why has this gentleman not been arrested?</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the information sought is not readily available and could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the school attendance service is provided by school attendance committees in certain parts of Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Cork and Waterford under the responsibility of the local authorities.  In the remainder of the country, the service is provided by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>As regards school attendance issues generally, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, is currently engaged in the preparation of draft legislation to deal with the complex issues involved in school attendance.  His objective is to bring heads of proposed legislation to Government in the autumn in order to be in a position to publish draft legislation before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that the number of prosecutions taken against parents of school children who play truant should not necessarily be taken as a measure of the efforts made by Garda in this area.  If school attendance can be encouraged by other means then that is the right way to proceed.  The prosecution of parents, in certain circumstances, would not necessarily be the right or fair course to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science recently announced an important initiative which will be targeted at eight to 15 year olds who have dropped out, or who are in danger of dropping out of the school system.  Suitable projects for funding will be identified by inviting applications <Col N="1180" /> for supports from consortia of youth and community organisations in area based partnerships working in collaboration with schools.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is outrageous that this type of information is not available, given the seriousness of the issue we are discussing? Would the Minister further agree that truancy is one of the first important signs which clearly indicates that children are at risk and likely to move on into a life of crime?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to take any specific measures to substitute for this system which, I accept, is rather outdated?  Something should replace it so that emphasis is placed on the importance of children remaining in school.  Parents should be left in no doubt about the significance of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I often complained in great frustration about the absence of information when I was in Opposition.  One would table certain questions but the information was not readily available.  The technology which is being made available to the Garda Síochána at a cost of over £40 million over the coming years, will mean that questions such as Deputy Upton's will receive the answers they deserve.  I regret, as much as he does, that I do not have the statistical data which he seeks.</P>
      <P>The Government has shown a considerable amount of commitment to children at risk through the establishment of a range of initiatives. A £30 million programme for young people at risk was announced by the Taoiseach on 21 January.  The centrepiece of that programme is a young people and service facilities fund to provide £30 million over the next three years for a variety of capital and non-capital projects in disadvantaged areas.  This is a significant development which illustrates the Government's commitment in this area.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet subcommittee has addressed this matter in an integrated and comprehensive manner. As a result, initiatives are now being taken to address different aspects of these needs.  To underline the importance of a co-ordinated approach, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has been appointed both to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>More is being done now than previously to address the matters which Deputy Upton raised.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> The Minister talked about the range of initiatives which are very welcome. We can talk until the cows come home about early intervention and prevention being better than cure.  However, although children are legally bound to attend school from the ages of 6 to 15, we do not seem to have any proper follow-up in relation to the number of convictions for nonattendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The earlier debate on courts service revealed a manifest lack of hard data on a series of areas in <Col N="1181" /> the criminal justice system.  Will the Minister ensure that these statistics are obtained, tabulated and made available at the earliest possible date? They go to the heart of dealing with the problem. We must introduce early intervention which is crucial to prevent young people from developing into Fagins.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have the statistics for the rest of the country because, while the school attendance officer regime only operates in Dublin and a few selected areas outside the capital, the Garda Síochána are supposed to establish who is not at school and take follow up measures to ensure prosecution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, even though we are approaching the end of the millennium, it would require a manual search of all Garda stations to provide the reply to Deputy Upton's question.  It is a matter of great frustration to me that I cannot provide him with such a reply.  It was also a matter of great frustration to me in</P>
      <P>Opposition that when I tabled questions I could not elicit a reply from the then Minister.  I am hopeful, however, that situation will change with the introduction of modern technology for the Garda Síochána in the coming years.</P>
      <P>I accept it is important to make the information available.  I know that Deputy Higgins is an educationalist and has more expertise in this area than I do, but I do not accept that simply appointing more school attendance officers and prosecuting more people will solve this problem.  The solution to the problems of absenteeism and poor school attendance involves the examination of a range of issues both in primary and secondary schools.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Martin, acknowledged in the House some time ago the need for a fundamental review of the approach taken to this extremely important issue. I subscribe to that view.</P>
      <P>I am beginning to stray outside my area of responsibility in discussing those matters, but I agree with Deputy Higgins that it is of considerable importance that children should attend school.  It is a cause of the gravest concern to see children walking the streets of towns and cities when they should be at school.  I hope that a fundamental review will lead to greater school attendance by those who attend infrequently and by others who remain absent.</P>

      <P>The Minister may well be right in what he says but he may also be wrong.  There is no base line information in relation to making these decisions.  That is the difficulty in relation to any policy development regarding truancy.  The information is there, it is just a matter of accessing it.  Does the Minister recognise that if there is a lack of information in this regard, the great policy development he refers to will not be fully based on accurate information?  Prosecuting parents may work effectively for all we know, but we do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> Will the Minister undertake to provide information about the policy initiative that has been undertaken by the Department of Education? While he cannot do so in terms of this parliamentary question, will he undertake not to leave it to some future wonderful world where information technology will solve all the problems?  He should explore ways and means of acquiring this information to ensure that policy development will be based on something real rather than on opinions alone.</P>

There has been an increase in recent years in the amount of money obtained from the court poor box, but while I am aware of Deputy Higgins's tenacity in relation to this matter, it is not something I wish to deal with without consideration, review and detailed legal advice.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that this whole process is rather odd and is like something from the days of Charles Dickens?  If we are to continue with this system, would it be advisable to have a list of approved charities?  The question arises as to what is a charity in the context of these types of donations but it is an unusual way of doing business at this stage of development.</P>

      <P>I questioned the former Minister, Deputy Owen, about this matter when I was in Opposition.  She told me she did not have any intention of changing the practice at that time.  My concern is not based on the fact that charities gain benefit from the system &mdash; I am sure that is not the concern of Deputy Upton or Deputy Higgins &mdash; but that there should be a degree of order and consistency in the system.  I am reflecting public concern and that of the Deputies when I say that this matter has to be examined.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any list.  The designation of the charities is a matter for the presiding judge but I understand payments are made to a wide variety of charities.  It appears that money which is paid into the poor box is recorded separately in the general cash account in the District Court offices and moneys are paid out, in the main to local charities, on foot of a direction from a District Court judge.  The accounts are audited by my Department's internal audit unit and are open to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>Each individual court office maintains records of the moneys received and paid out under the system so there are no central records other than the total amounts received in each office.  That is the reason I am unable to list the charities or specify where the money goes.  It is important to have cohesion and consistency in the system. When the review has been completed I will report back to the Deputies in relation to this matter.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I appreciate the Minister's concern about this matter and I hope it is brought <Col N="1186" /> to a speedy conclusion.  Is the Minister aware the practice of using the court poor box still persists and that there is a two tier system of justice where those who can pay a substantial amount by way of a one to one agreement with the judge walk scot-free with no record, no conviction and no endorsement while those who cannot pay are penalised?  Is he aware that since we discussed this matter, in Kells District Court, for example, a gentleman who was stopped while travelling at 102 miles per hour, for which there is no excuse, reached an agreement with the judge and the only penalty was that he had to pay £1,000 into the court poor box.  In the case of a gentleman from County Tyrone, there was no conviction and the summons was wiped out.  His contribution of £750 was given to a garda in court who intended to do a marathon, admittedly for a good cause, the hospice movement.  At the same court a person from Drogheda was fined £150 and had his licence endorsed, a person from Navan who had not displayed tax was fined £30 and a person was fined £200 and had his licence endorsed for uninsured driving.</P>

      <P>I will not accuse the Judiciary of operating golden circles.  Decisions reached and penalties imposed in any court case are entirely a matter for the presiding judge.  As I pointed out on more than one occasion, the Judiciary is entirely independent under the Constitution in the exercise of its functions.  I share the concerns about the operation of the court poor box in some courts and I sought the advice of the Attorney General with regard to the statutory basis for the court poor box.  The poor box system is used by most district justices to some degree, but the vast majority of judges use it only in a very limited number of cases.  The court poor box system may be used in lieu of a fine or in addition to a fine.  I am not in a position to comment further on that.  When I have the Attorney General's advice, that will become part of the full review and we will then consider the entire position and decide where we will go from there.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that operation lifesaver has been in operation in the Louth-Meath division since 14 July 1997.  It was extended on a phased basis to all Garda divisions during August 1997.  This special Garda campaign is intended to produce high visibility patrolling to raise public awareness of Garda enforcement activity and of the serious issues involved in road safety.  The operation was designed specifically to increase the enforcement capacity of the Garda Síochána in relation to the detection of four key offences which impact directly on road fatalities: speeding, not wearing seat belts, drink driving and dangerous driving.</P>
      <P>The Garda has the most up-to-date sophisticated offence detection equipment.  It includes radar guns, tripod mounted laser guns and in-car video cameras.  In addition, it has the GATSO unit, a system built into an unmarked vehicle which can monitor a large number of vehicles at any one time and provide rapid computerised readouts of those exceeding the speed limit.  It can be deployed to different Garda divisions as required.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that an additional GATSO unit, which was approved by my Department in late 1997, will be acquired shortly.  In addition, proposals by the Garda authorities for the provision of additional mobile cameras and automated speed detection fixed cameras are being examined.</P>
      <P>There is in each Garda division a traffic corps whose primary responsibility is the enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts.  In addition, uniformed gardaí throughout the country are involved in road traffic enforcement activity as required.  I have been assured by the Garda authorities that operation lifesaver is monitored on a continuous basis and that the need for additional resources and equipment will be kept under review.  No effort will be spared by the Garda authorities to ensure the continuing success of operation lifesaver and I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will see that the Garda is provided with the resources necessary to facilitate this.</P>

In the second half of 1997 there were, however, five fewer deaths than in the comparative period of 1996.  Although the overall number of fatalities increased in 1997, the rate of increase slowed down.  This was due in part to the Garda operation lifesaver action plan.  The level of road <Col N="1188" /> deaths and injuries is still unacceptably high.  The Garda avail of every opportunity to warn the general public of the position and at the end of the day it is up to the public, particularly the motoring public, to ensure they exercise the degree of care that is required.</P>

      <P>The statistics demonstrate the effectiveness of the Garda in prosecuting offences.  In 1993 there were 35,912 prosecutions and 29,590 convictions; in 1994 there 37,478 prosecutions and 32,293 convictions; in 1995 there were 36,719 prosecutions and 30,805 convictions; in 1996 there were 35,841 prosecutions and 33,387 convictions.  The Garda, using the most modern equipment, are doing everything possible to help in this matter.  Every opportunity is availed of to educate the public.  Modern technology is used and further equipment for the Garda Síochána will be approved in the very near future.  At the end of the day if a certain segment of the general public ignores the traffic rules, they do so at their peril.  That contributes significantly to the number of accidents and deaths on the roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources this morning's gross act of attempted piracy by three Spanish steel-hulled super fishing vessels operating under a flag of convenience and registered in Britain on four Irish fishing vessels 40 miles off Mizen Head.  I understand that those four Irish fishing vessels were seriously threatened and that attempts were made by the marauding Spanish fleet to seriously endanger the lives of the personnel aboard those Irish trawlers.</P>
      <P>I am told that two of those Spanish vessels are registered under a flag of convenience at Milfordhaven docks and the other Spanish vessel is registered under a flag of convenience in Aberdeen.  I am led to believe that one of the Milfordhaven registered vessels is the <i>Sliebech II</i> and that the Scottish registered vessel is the <i>Glen-Elg.</i></P>
      <P>The situation was so tense that the Irish fishing vessels had to quickly haul up their nets and withdraw from the fishing area concerned.  This incident, I understand, was transmitted to the Irish naval patrol boat which was anchored in the safe waters of Bere Haven Sound.  It is alleged the naval patrol boat did not go to the assistance to the Irish fishing vessels which were being seriously threatened by the Spanish vessels.  I understand the excuse given by the fishery patrol vessel was that it did not know the exact area where the incident occurred, but I have now received information that the fishery patrol vessel received the exact co-ordinates with the message which was relayed to it by the stricken Irish fishing vessels concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> What action has the Minister taken on the matter? Has he protested to the Spanish Government, through its Ambassador in Dublin?  Will he outline the reason the Irish naval patrol vessel did not go to the assistance of the Irish trawlers in their hour of need?</P>
    <P>This is not the first time such incidents involving the Spanish fishing fleet have occurred on the high seas.  I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister that those Spanish fishing vessels flying flags of convenience are registered in the same office in Milfordhaven docks as the <i>Sea Horse</i>, the Spanish trawler registered under a flag of convenience which was responsible for the fatal tragedy with the <i>Danny Boy</i> almost 12 weeks ago to the day.</P>
    <P>We must treat this matter seriously and protest in the strongest possible manner against the outrageous incidents which are being provoked by the bully-boy tactics of the Spanish fishing vessels against the Irish fleet.  The lives of Irish fishermen are at risk if such action is allowed continue, and I call on the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, to take immediate steps to stop these bully-boy tactics by the Spanish fishing fleet.  If it is necessary to take a case to the European Court of Human Rights, the Minister ought to do so to ensure that the lives of Irish fishermen are protected and that Irish fishermen are given the right to fish in the waters where their forefathers fished since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern.  It goes without saying that the legitimate fishing activities of Irish boats or, indeed, any fishing boats must not be unlawfully impeded or their safety threatened.  The alleged incident this morning most certainly gives rise to serious concerns.</P>
      <P>I have been informed of an incident involving three Irish fishing vessels and two vessels registered in the UK which occurred this morning some 40 miles off Mizen Head.  The information currently available to me is that the Irish fishermen concerned are alleging harassment, and interference with their gear, by the UK registered vessels.  I have directed the Department to investigate the incident urgently and comprehensively in consultation with the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>I understand that, as the incident was happening, a crew member of one of the Irish vessels contacted a family member in Castletownbere. This person made contact with the naval vessel <i>LE Emer</i> which was anchored near Castletownbere. The <i>LE Emer</i> relayed this report of the incident to the naval authorities, who then dispatched the <i>LE Ashling</i> to investigate the incident.</P>
      <P>While I am not in a position to comment on naval operational matters, which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Defence, I understand that the <i>LE Emer</i> had been tasked to other duties and could not therefore have been sent to the scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> My Department became aware of the incident through a family member of the skipper of one of the Irish vessels who advised the Department's sea fisheries officer in Castletownbere this morning. The sea fisheries officer immediately contacted the Naval Service, which was already aware of the matter through the earlier contacts made with the <i>LE Emer.</i></P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that I share Deputy Sheehan's serious concern about incidents of this nature and deplore them.  Fishermen must be able to go about their business without being subjected to interference, harassment or intimidation, and all possible steps must be taken to ensure that such behaviour, which poses a clear threat both to lives and livelihoods, does not occur.  Those who work at sea are exposed to enough risks without having to endure the strong arm tactics of those who apparently act without any concern or consideration for their fellow fishermen.</P>
    <P>I reiterate, that I am fully committed to ensuring the most effective possible surveillance and control of the activities of all fishing vessels in these waters.  My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Defence and the Naval Service on sea fisheries protection, and will review in conjunction with colleagues the implications and lessons from today's alleged incident. The first priority is to establish quickly the full details of what happened.  As the vessels which are alleged to have interfered with the Irish vessels are registered in the UK, my Department has made official contact at high level with the relevant UK authorities to convey my serious concerns. As soon as I receive a full and comprehensive report on the alleged incident, I will take the matter up in strong terms with my UK counterpart. I will press for his active co-operation in preventing any recurrence of totally unacceptable incidents of this nature.</P>
    <P>There have also been recent reports of clashes between Irish and French vessels off the south-east coast.  I am also having these investigated and the Department is meeting the French authorities shortly to review the scope for codes of practice and other practical measures to prevent unwelcome incidents As I previously stated in the House, there are particular enforcement difficulties associated with the activities of flagships in Irish waters.  Other member states must shoulder their legal responsibilities in this regard.  I will continue to push the UK Presidency and the Commission to quickly deliver tangible improvements in terms of co-operation on enforcement and tougher control measures.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that this incident will be fully investigated as a matter of priority.  I will seek to ensure that those responsible for any wrongdoing face the full consequences of their actions. <Col N="1192" /></P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this matter.  I take this opportunity to wish Coca Cola and the people of Ballina, County Mayo, every future success in the proposed development of the £100 million facility there.  I congratulate Forbairt for attracting the project to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The context in which I raise this issue is that for approximately the past 20 years Wexford County Council has owned a large 90 acre site on the banks of the River Slaney at Edermine, which is situated south of Enniscorthy on the Wexford road.  I understand that discussions took place at the initiative of Coca Cola in respect of its interest in this site.  This developed to the extent that a new access bridge to the site, a price for the site and an all-in package were negotiated. The company considered three sites: Drina, Wexford; Edermine, Enniscorthy and Ballina.  The people in Wexford who negotiated with Coca Cola believed that every need had been met in terms of the company's requirements.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with the procedures followed in such cases because the food division and Forbairt's responsibility in that area falls under the control of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  As the previous Minister, I had knowledge of the type of cases that came through the pipeline which are unusual.  Unlike the IDA, which deals with two to three dozen such cases per year, this is a rare case and a prized, prestigious jewel to obtain.  Everyone is aware that cases involving grants of over £1 million to £2 million must go before Cabinet.  It seems that priority was given to Ballina at the highest political level.  I understand the reasons for this, particularly in light of the closure of the Asahi plant.  Unfortunately, however, Wexford lost out.</P>
      <P>Enniscorthy is in the process of rejuvenation with £30 million of investment arising out of urban renewal and other State and private sector investment.  The people of the town are disappointed and they feel let down on the basis that a low proportion of the local workforce is employed in the manufacturing industry.  That proportion is one of the lowest in the country. However, because there has not been a high profile factory closure in the county it is losing out in priority.  There is also a belief that the Government parties have two safe seats in the Wexford constituency and would neither lose nor gain in an election.  Therefore, no priority is attached to the constituency.</P>
      <P>Enniscorthy has ideal facilities in terms of heavy water utilisation on the River Slaney and, in the current atmosphere of escalating property prices, a cheap site.  Unfortunately, however, there are no parties interested in locating in the town.  I raise this issue to seek a commitment from Forbairt and the Government that location of the next suitable project of this kind at Edermine will be given favourable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot overemphasise what 1,000 construction jobs, 150 full-time jobs at the Coca Cola <Col N="1193" /> plant and 150 full-time ancillary jobs would mean to the regeneration of County Wexford.  In light of the decentralisation programme, I am aware that the officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food are supportive of the county in every way.  I cannot understand how they would have allowed the plant to be situated in another part of the country.</P>
    <P>I call for full clarification of the political pressure exerted regarding the choice of location in this case.  I understand the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, is claiming credit in Ballina for his great works and deeds in ensuring that the Tánaiste and he delivered this project.  I understand Deputy Cooper-Flynn is also in the queue claiming credit on local radio for this.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  Deputy Browne in Enniscorthy is left with nothing but a vacant site and howls of complaint from his constituents regarding how they were left high and dry.  I will not belabour the issue but, given that this horse has bolted, I hope the Minister of State can give a commitment that the next suitable project of this kind will be located at Edermine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  It must be stated that the decision of the world's largest beverage company, Coca Cola, to select Ireland as the location for its concentrate plant is to be universally welcomed.  It is a compliment to Ireland's green, clean image and our reputation as a country with a highly skilled and dedicated workforce and the infrastructure to accommodate and attract multinationals.  It would be a pity if those attributes were tarnished by political feuding over the particular part of Ireland chosen by Coca Cola for its plant.  Having said that, I understand the Deputy's disappointment that his native county, Wexford, was not selected on this occasion.  However, given that his party has three seats in County Mayo, it is hard to understand why he is opposed to the location of this clean industry in that county.</P>
      <P>In accordance with normal procedure, the negotiations in this case were conducted by Forbairt. The Coca Cola company was provided with information by Forbairt on individual sites in locations throughout Ireland, including two in County Wexford.  The company carried out an exhaustive evaluation of the three site options and used a number of highly reputable international consultants in the process.  Following this analysis, the company chose to locate its facility in Ballina.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that in selecting Ballina the company took the following factors into account: the availability of a large greenfield site; a conveniently accessible water and waste treatment facility and the availability of a convenient rail facility.</P>

      <P>The need for this scheme arises mainly from the development of the Carysfort lands which were the subject of considerable controversy for other reasons in this House in the past, and other lands in the general Blackrock-Stillorgan area.  In 1991, before the Carysfort development commenced, the Borough engineer of Dún Laoghaire Corporation at the time, Mr. Larry Brassill, prepared a report in which he stated:</P>
      <P>It is anticipated that development of the Carysfort Lands will commence in the relatively near future, resulting in a substantial addition to flows to the present surface water system within these lands, and downstream of them.  An investigation has been carried out on the capacity of this entire surface water system, as far as the sea at Maretimo.  It is known that there are substantial inadequacies in the present surface water system throughout the greater water area, as confirmed, by occasional and severe flooding in the past.  In the absence of alleviating measures, this situation would further worsen substantially in the future from the appreciable additional run-off from the proposed development of the Carysfort Lands. It is essential, therefore, that the entire surface water system be augmented and improved to cater for all normal future surface water contributions.</P>
      <P>The borough engineer stated that the developments in the upper reaches of the catchment above Sandyford would also add to the problem. He went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire open stream channel [which] flows downstream as far as the Blackrock Bypass will have to be augmented by a new <Col N="1195" /> major parallel surface water culvert, varying in size between 1200 mm and 1650mm.  The existing hydraulic channel controls downstream of the pond in Carysfort Lands have been identified as an area of major inadequacy and these will require replacement and/or improvement.</P>
    <P>At the end of his report he proposes the scheme to be submitted for approval for funding from the Department of the Environment.  He states: &ldquo;The scheme has a considerable urgency, as it is vital that the enhanced surface water capacity be available before the development of the Carysfort Lands should proceed to any substantial extent.&rdquo; That was in 1991.  The scheme was submitted to the Department of the Environment.  The Carysfort lands have since been developed.  The St. Augustine's lands have been developed.  There has been considerable development in the Stillorgan and Sandyford areas.  The result of all that is that the predictions made by the borough engineer in 1991 have now come true because last Christmas there was considerable flooding of households and businesses in this area.  I have here a sheaf of letters that I received from constituents who are angry at the fact that, although their local council submitted a scheme to the Department of the Environment all of seven years ago, in advance of the major developments in the area, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has still not approved the scheme.  One of the letters from the managing director of Dublin Crystal, a well known business in the area stated that many homes and businesses are now threatened by flash flooding.  He says that they have already had to replace timber floors in part of their factory as a result of water penetration from flooding and that the same area was again damaged in December.  This is a problem of flooding which was anticipated back in 1991.  The local council submitted a scheme for drainage to the Department of the Environment, and we are still waiting for approval of this very urgent, very important scheme which, if not funded, will result in considerable flooding of businesses and of dwellings in the Blackrock area of my constituency.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for raising this matter.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond to this item and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The Minister is conscious of the need for adequate sewerage facilities in Carysfort. However, before dealing with Carysfort itself, I will outline the wider picture in relation to the provision of water and waste water facilities for the country at large and for the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, announced the largest ever national investment programme for water and sewage treatment services. <Col N="1196" /> Investment this year will amount to a massive £185 million, and this represents an increase of just over 13 per cent on the 1997 figure, and a 50 per cent increase on the 1996 figure.  The unprecedented level of investment in the water and sewerage services clearly underlines, in the most positive way, that this Government is totally committed to the improvement of the country's environmental infrastructure which is needed to meet the existing and projected needs arising from residential, commercial and other development. In 1998, a further 61 major public schemes will be starting construction, on top of the same number of schemes already under construction.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council benefits from this substantial level of investment. Schemes under way in this local authority area account for an investment of over £12 million. These include phase 2 of the Dún Laoghaire water supply improvement scheme and the Dún Laoghaire main drainage scheme, as well as the Ballyboden to Stillorgan pipeline.</P>
    <P>Apart from these, the 1998 investment programme will allow for planning to be advanced on the Shanganagh sewerage scheme and the Sandyford high level water supply scheme.  These two schemes have a completion value of over £47 million.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the specific matter raised by the Deputy.  The estimated cost of the Carysfort Maretimo scheme is £1.75 million.  Unfortunately, it has not been possible to identify a source of funding for this scheme.  Given the high level of demand under the water and sewerage services investment programme, it is not possible to say when this scheme may be advanced. However, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Carysfort Maretimo scheme will be considered under the 1999 investment programme later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to raise an important issue for many of my constituents.  Among local people, there is a view that west Wicklow is ignored when it comes to the provision of services and resources.  It is a deeply held view which has many examples to support it.  Nowhere is this inequity more acute than in the area of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the primary schools in west Wicklow are small two and three teacher schools.  Standards of teaching are high but inevitably, the fact that many classes are mixed with different years combined in the same classroom, creates particular <Col N="1197" /> demands on staff.  Inevitably too, there are children in these schools, as there are in all schools, who require the special attention that only a remedial teacher can provide.</P>
    <P>Six schools in west Wicklow are in the position that they cannot provide remedial teaching for their children in need of it.  They are Stratford on Slaney national school, Grangecon national school, Stratford Lodge national school, Donoughmore national school, Kiltegan national school and Bigstone national school.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the management and staff of these schools for their initiative in coming together to address this key need.  They have co-operated closely to put the best possible case on behalf of their children.  All these schools were represented at a meeting held recently to lobby public representatives of the county.  It was attended by Deputy Timmins and myself.  The position was outlined, and it was perfectly clear that the numbers of children in need of remedial teaching would justify at least two such teachers. Sharing remedial teachers between schools does require an amount of travelling time which has to be factored into the provision for the numbers of children whose needs are to be met.</P>
    <P>The schools have prepared the ground, not only in terms of making the case, but also in providing space in the schools for a remedial teacher. All that is left to be done is for the Minister for Education to allocate the teachers.  To put it into context, I have been told that nationally 95 per cent of national schools have access to remedial teaching if they need it.  There are 14 national schools in west Wicklow.  Out of that number, six are without a remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>There are 81 national schools in County Wicklow, 69 of which have the services of a remedial teacher.  Of the 12 who do not have that service, half are located in a particular part of west Wicklow. This is unjust to those local rural communities who are entitled to the services and standards that urban communities take for granted.  More importantly, it is unjust to the children, some of whom have severe problems that need to be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>At a time when our economy is booming and school enrolments are decreasing, it is intolerable that the system is failing these people.  Learning problems must be attended to at a young age, otherwise they will have a permanent effect.  The Minister and his Department are failing these children badly.  The inequality being experienced by these people and the six west Wicklow national schools must be put right immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus for sharing time with me.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has been wheeled in once again to deal with the problem of remedial teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot over emphasise the importance of putting resources into primary education.  It is the foundation of our education system.  Irrespective of the amount of money put into the system at a later stage, it is worthless if we do not get the <Col N="1198" /> basics right.  Teachers do not have the time to deal with pupils' remedial needs within the scope of the normal teaching service.  Remedial teaching should be viewed as a basic requirement rather than an additional resource.</P>
    <P>In his election manifesto, the Minister for Education and Science gave a commitment to provide remedial teachers, but he is now trying to hide behind the decision of his predecessor.  It is not satisfactory to deal with the needs of the schools in west Wicklow in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations that may be undertaken. The appointments should be made now. The best investment this Government can make in Wicklow is to supply these teachers immediately.</P>

      <P>As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers. The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.  However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of underachievement in primary schools.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the next school year, which ends on 30 June, with the Irish National Teachers Organisation. These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-8 school year.</P>
      <P>A total of 54 remedial teachers have been allocated for the 1997-8 school year, bringing the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,242.  Of the 3,227 ordinary national schools throughout the country, 2,459 have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or on a shared basis.  Of the 81 ordinary national schools in County Wicklow, 69 have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  This means that approximately 96 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Wicklow currently enjoy a remedial service.  It is estimated that 90 per cent of the total number of primary school pupils have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Government colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, must consider demands for improved services across a wide range of special needs.  Unfortunately, these demands cannot always be met.  The Minister has to decide priorities and try to allocate available resources to best effect.  A review of the provision across the special needs area is currently being carried out, including current responses to <Col N="1199" /> remedial needs, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools in the area to which they referred will be fully considered in the context of any additional <Col N="1200" /> remedial teacher allocations which may be undertaken by the Minister on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. Tuesday, 24 March l998. <Col N="1201" /></P>

      <P>The Bail Act, 1997, was passed into law by the Oireachtas in May last year. Section 13 of the Act provides that the Act, or any particular provision or provisions of it, will come into operation by order to be made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have informed the House in response to previous questions that the provisions of the Act have not been brought into force because existing prison accommodation would not be able to deal with the additional demand.  I am sure that all Members agree that we need to avoid a situation where convicted persons would have to be released to make space for additional remand prisoners.</P>
      <P>I have also indicated to the House that I was keeping the matter under continuous review in the context of the major prison building programme which I have under way at present which includes a new remand prison for 400 beside Wheatfield.</P>
      <P>It remains the case that prison accommodation is not yet adequate to bring the provisions of the Bail Act generally into force at this stage. However, I can inform the House that, in the light of the continuous review which I have mentioned, I will shortly sign an order bringing section 10 of the Act into force.  That section amends section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, with the aim of strengthening its provisions in relation to the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.</P>
      <P>I will be in a position to make that order shortly in view of the fact that in so far as additional consecutive penalties arising under that section have to be served these will not generally impinge immediately on demand on prison accommodation and by the time they would be expected to come into effect sufficient additional prison accommodation would be available to cope with this.</P>
      <P>I will continue to keep the matter under review with a view to bringing other provisions of the Act into operation as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 87 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>Pensioners who retired before 1 January 1993, did not benefit from a 1994 restructuring deal done under PESP with the relevant Garda Representative Associations for two reasons.  The first was that the commencement date was agreed at 1 January 1993.  The second was that traditional arrangements under which pensioners can benefit from increases in pay for serving staff did not arise as the deal involved the future pensionability of unsocial hours allowances in return for flexibility and change within the Garda Síochána and did not involve a pay increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To deal with this and similar situations, last year the Government decided that public servants who retired before the commencement dates for restructuring pay agreements under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> should benefit from those deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum of 3 per cent in their pensions.  The minimum adjustment of 3 per cent was calculated as if pay scales had increased by that percentage with effect from 1 September 1995.  This percentage increase has now been applied to pensioners formerly of garda, sergeant and inspector rank who retired before 1 January 1993.  In respect of those public servants who had received an advance payment of 1 per cent of basic pay under a specific provision of the PCW programme, a minimum adjustment of 2 per cent in pensions was made and was calculated as if the <Col N="1205" /> pay scales in question had increaesd by that percentage with effect from 1 May 1995.</P>
    <P>Superintendents and chief superintendents concluded a PESP-PCW deal last December.  The deal involved special pay increases.  In almost all cases the application of the minimum increases of 2 per cent or 3 per cent in pensions, based on notional pay increases, did not arise as parity with serving members in those ranks, who had received the benefit of special pay increases, meant that the minimum pension increase was above the 2 per cent or 3 per cent minimum.</P>
    <P>Concerning the garda pension scheme generally, the Deputies may be aware that in February 1996 a commission on public service pensions was established to examine and report on the pension terms of public servants, including members of the Garda Síochána.  The commission issued its interim report earlier this year and will issue its final report to Government later this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 61, 100, 112 and 120 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 10 March 1998 there was a total of 549 prisoners on temporary release and 1,148 offenders who were classed as being unlawfully at large.  I should explain that persons classed as being <Col N="1206" />&ldquo;unlawfully at large&rdquo; consist, for the most part, of people on temporary release from prison who have failed to comply with one of their release conditions.</P>
    <P>The number of prisoners under supervision by the probation and welfare service while on temporary release can vary from day to day.  I am not, therefore, in a position to give a current figure. However, in December 1997, the latest month for which figures are available, there were 85 offenders on supervised temporary release.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware the granting of temporary release is a statutory function of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  Temporary release may be granted for various reasons to prisoners serving sentences of imprisonment. Short-term releases may be granted for different periods of time ranging from a few hours to one or two days and for a variety of reasons, including compassionate reasons, such as the illness of a near relative, a bereavement, christening or first communion of a child.  Temporary release may also be granted for longer periods up to and including final release.  Weekly renewable temporary release is used, for instance, to allow offenders to attend training and other courses or to obtain employment.  Full temporary release &mdash; in other words final release &mdash; is normally granted only in cases where the offender is nearing the end of his or her sentence.  Temporary release may also be granted for resocialisation programmes in the case of longer term offenders. Each application for temporary release is considered carefully and in most cases the views of the Garda are taken into account.</P>
    <P>In every case granting temporary release is subject to the condition that the person released must be of good behaviour.  Various other conditions may also apply.  For example, as referred to above, the individual concerned may be subject to supervision by the probation and welfare service, he or she may be required to report at regular intervals to a Garda station, or to reside at a particular location and so on.  If any of the conditions is breached the individual concerned can be immediately returned to custody without the need for fresh proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is being pursued in the context of multiparty talks in Northern Ireland and the provisions made in the Decommissioning Act, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1997 Act, as the Deputy will be aware, was intended to enable effect to be given to the <Col N="1207" /> recommendations of the International Body chaired by Senator George Mitchell on the decommissioning of illegally held arms.  To that end it makes provision, in accordance with the recommendations of the International Body, for an amnesty and a prohibition on forensic testing in relation to decommissioned arms.</P>
    <P>The Act also made provision for a commission to be established pursuant to agreement between the Government and the British Government. The establishment of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning by the Government and the British Government in September last was in keeping with the Act and with decisions taken in the context of the Northern Ireland talks.  The commission, whose members are General John de Chastelain of Canada, Brigadier Tauno Niemenen of Finland and Ambassador Donald C. Johnson of the United States, have taken forward the mandate set out in the agreement providing for its establishment and have made considerable progress in the period since September.</P>
    <P>The commission, pursuant to that mandate, presented proposals to the Governments earlier this year for decommissioning schemes on the basis of consultations they had with the Governments and other participants in the Northern Ireland Talks.  Those proposals have formed the basis for the preparation of regulations, which will be made under the Decommissioning Act 1997, to provide for the decommissioning of illegally held arms held by or on behalf of paramilitary organisations.  The Government has, in accordance with the terms of reference of the Talks Liaison Sub-Committee on Decommissioning, made those regulations available to the participants in the Northern Ireland Talks in draft form.  The British Government has similarly made available the draft schemes which it proposes to make in accordance with the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Act, 1997, to the talks participants.  I have also arranged for a copy of the draft regulations to be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The Government, as the Deputy will be aware, sees a resolution of the decommissioning issue as an indispensable part of the current process of negotiations within the framework of the multiparty talks in Northern Ireland.  I believe that the considerable progress made to date can and will facilitiate that outcome.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 26, 29, 53, 84, 111, 118 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>Last December, I met a delegation comprising representatives of the Missing Persons Helpline, with two Members of the Oireachtas, in relation to their request for financial assistance from the State.  It was explained to me that the helpline provides advice and support to families who have lost touch with a family member and tries to help and encourage these people to establish contact with their families.</P>
      <P>While this is a worthy social service, as its primary aim is to put family members in contact with each other it does not come within my Department's functional remit and I was not in a position, therefore, to consider any request for funding. However, I did undertake to write to my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, to ascertain whether his Department was in a position to consider the request for funding and I subsequently did so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister replied stating that an application for funding under the 1997 scheme of grants to voluntary organisations had been received from this group in respect of the cost of the purchase of equipment and the running of a publicity campaign on missing persons.  However, he indicated <Col N="1211" /> that policy for a project of this nature does not come within the remit of any of the grant schemes operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and that this decision was conveyed to the helpline.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department recently met with police officers from the United Kingdom to discuss, in general terms, a new investigative initiative which has been introduced in the UK and which involves the analysis of data using sophisticated computer software.  The meeting took place in Dublin prior to the UK officers taking part in a conference.</P>
      <P>Following on from this meeting, officials of my Department and Garda Síochána representatives have been invited to travel to the United Kingdom later this month in order that they can fully assess and evaluate the initiative.  As I have stated in the House before, I am concerned to ensure that effective arrangements are in place to trace missing persons.  If the initiative shows sufficient promise, I will consider its adoption in this country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 32, 52, 72, 76, 79, 93, 121, 132, 166 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>A large number of police forces in the UK, continental Europe and the USA have found mounted police to be particularly effective in crowd control situations, high visibility policing and in community relations.  The Garda authorities have looked at this issue in some depth and have strongly recommended the establishment of a mounted unit.</P>
      <P>This question has been considered on a number of occasions previously.  Establishing a full scale mounted unit could be costly and would take one to two years before it would be operational.  For this reason, as this form of policing has not been tested within the State, there has been a reluctance in the past to proceed.</P>
      <P>However, I have now decided to establish a small unit on a trial basis to establish if a mounted unit can make a cost effective contribution to policing in Irish conditions.  To this end, negotiations have been entered into to purchase 4-7 trained police horses and the associated equipment for a pilot unit.</P>
      <P>These negotiations have not yet been finalised so it is not possible to provide full costings. However, I can say that the purchase price of the police horses and equipment will be in the region of £20,000 to £30,000.</P>
      <P>It will be at least one or two months before the new mounted unit is fully established, the riders trained in police tactics and the unit made operational. It will be deployed as a national unit and will undertake regular police patrolling, along with specialist functions pertinent to a police mounted unit.</P>
      <P>The new unit will be assessed over a trial period and if successful it is envisaged that a full scale unit would be established and equipped with Irish horses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 54, 59, 98, 99 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>The Bail Act, 1997 was passed into law by the Oireachtas in May of last year.  Section 13 of the Act provides that the Act, or any particular provision or provisions of it, will come into operation by order to be made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have informed the House in response to previous questions that the provisions of the Act have not been brought into force because existing prison accommodation would not be able to deal with the additional demand.  I am sure that all Members of the House would agree that we need to avoid a situation where convicted persons would have to be released to make space for additional remand prisoners.</P>
      <P>I have also indicated to the House that I was keeping the matter under continuous review in the context of the major prison building programme which I have under way at present which includes a new remand prison for 400 beside Wheatfield.</P>
      <P>It remains the case that prison accommodation is not yet adequate to bring the provisions of the Bail Act generally into force at this stage. However, I can inform the House that, in the light of the continuous review which I have mentioned, I will shortly be signing an order bringing section 10 of the Act into force.  That section amends section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 with the aim of strengthening its provisions in relation to the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be in a position to make that order shortly in view of the fact that in so far as additional consecutive penalties arising under that section have to be served these will not generally impinge immediately on demand on prison accommodation and by the time they would be expected to come into effect sufficient additional <Col N="1216" /> prison accommodation would be available to cope with this.</P>
    <P>As to other provisions of the Act, I will continue to keep the matter under review with a view to bringing them into operation as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>In order to ensure that the detailed requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 are met with effect from 21 April 1998, my Department has undertaken a wide range of preparatory measures.  I will set out, for the information of the Deputy, the principal steps being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 of the Act oblige every Government Department and agency covered by the Act to publish details of their functions, types of records held, the procedures and any rules-guidelines or precedents used in decision making. My officials are preparing manuals to meet the statutory responsibilities of the Department and <Col N="1217" /> associated offices and agencies which are covered by the Act.  When published, it is intended that the manuals will be available in the Department's offices, associated offices, Garda stations, court offices and in public libraries etc.</P>
    <P>In addition, in order to be in a position to meet any requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997 my Department is taking specific steps to improve our records managment processes and will also be putting in place a computerised correspondence tracking system by tailoring an existing correspondence tracking system for this purpose.  Procedures to deal with freedom of information requests and appeals against decisions taken are also being devised.</P>
    <P>Finally, the staff of my Department have been receiving training in relation to the implications of the freedom of information legislation.  Most staff have by now received initial training and advanced courses are being organised for key staff in divisions expected to receive a sizeable number of requests under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 44, 57, 74, 78, 82, 105 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>Independent living is defined in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities as the ability to decide and to choose what a person wants, where to live and how, what to do and how to set about doing it.  It also involves establishing and taking control of the total management of a person's everyday life and affairs.  The philosophy behind it is generally defined as living like everyone else, having the rights to self-determination, to exert control over one's life, to have opportunities to make decisions, to take responsibility and to pursue activities of one's own choosing, regardless of disability.</P>
      <P>The development of a personal assistance service was examined by the Advisory Group on Personal Assistance which was established by the Minister for Health and Children and which recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that funding of a personal assistance service should be considered in the context of the development of support services generally for people with disabilities.  In the meantime, the Deputies will be pleased to note that the Government has allocated £8.4 million in 1998 to improve services specifically for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  This includes funding for new services, including provision for the development of independent living-home support services, including personal assistance services.  It is intended to continue, resources permitting, to develop these services in the coming years.  The priorities for spending these funds will be determined by the health boards' in consultation with the local voluntary organisations, through the new co-ordinating committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities made a series of recommendations to support independent living for people with disabilities.  The recommendations, which embrace a broad spectrum of public services, are being considered in tandem with the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.  This latter report also includes proposals <Col N="1219" /> for the development of personal assistance services. The recommendations of both reports are being considered by the interdepartmental task force which was established to draft a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, following publication of the commission's report.</P>
    <P>The plan of action is expected to be ready for submission to Government in May 1998.  I look forward to receiving its recommendation with regard to the issue of personal assistance and independent living and, in that context, to giving appropriate consideration to what may be required for the development of the concept of independent living.</P>

      <P>The second is an intensive offence focused group work programme which is available only in Arbour Hill Prison at the moment.  The dedicated treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison can cater for up to ten offenders at one time and takes ten to 11 months to complete.  The emphasis is on accepting personal responsibility for the offence and developing effective relapse prevention strategies for each offender.  All convicted sex offenders who are in custody are invited to apply to participate in the programme.  Those who apply are considered by the treatment team but not all are deemed suitable.  Where more than ten offenders who have applied are deemed suitable, the places on the programme are allocated to those nearest the end of their sentence.  The others are offered a place on a subsequent programme.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that both forms of treatment are voluntary; offenders are encouraged to avail of these services but they are neither compelled to attend, nor do they receive any extra concessions for attending.</P>
      <P>I am keen to expand treatment programmes for sex offenders and my Department is actively examining the possibility of increasing the number of group treatment places available by locating a further group treatment programme for ten sex offenders at the Curragh.  In view of the specialised skills necessary to set up and run such a programme, however, it will take some time to put a new programme in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped to introduce a new non-theraputic skills programme for offenders in Cork and Arbour Hill prisons later this year.  The thinking skills training programme for offenders is designed to target a range of offenders and those convicted of sex offences will be invited to participate. The programme will be run by multidisciplinary teams, including prison officers.  Such structured interpersonal work with offenders represents a significant development of the role of the prison officer and a new and challenging development within the Irish prison service. <Col N="1222" /></P>

      <P>I will decide on whether it would be desirable to ask the all-party Committee on the Constitution to bring forward proposals for a disability equality amendment to the Constitution when the Government response is to hand in relation to a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities based on the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and detailed proposals for the establishment of a national disability authority and a disability support service, both of which are in the course of preparation, and when the employment equality and equal status legislation have been enacted.</P>
      <P>Until such time as the planned legislative, institutional and services provision improvements for people with disabilities are in place it would be difficult to arrive at a decision in relation to the need to bring forward proposals for a disability equality amendment to the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Clearway, which came into effect on 5 January 1998, focuses on the main arterial routes into Dublin city.  In addition to these routes, the monitoring of identified traffic black spots is provided for through the allocation of additional mobile and foot patrols throughout the city.</P>
      <P>The decision as to the particular areas and routes which the gardaí focus on is a Garda operational matter.  The gardaí have to maintain a degree of flexibility in regard to the choice of routes to meet particular difficulties as they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that, although no arrests have been made to date, 7,500 varied offences were detected during Operation Clearway from 5 January 1998 to 1 March 1998.  These were dealt with by way of fines on the spot, caution and summons.  In <Col N="1224" /> addition, 1,178 illegally parked vehicles were towed to the carpound.</P>
    <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that, while there are no immediate plans to increase Garda resources over and above those allocated to Operation Clearway, the operation will continue to be subject to ongoing review.  The continuing campaign has recently been reinforced by changes at chief superintendent level to ensure that it has the necessary top level focus and direction.</P>

      <P>The precise information requested by the Deputy is not available.  Not every person who has served a prison sentence and been arrested for another offence is committed to prison.  For those who are concerned the manual records in Mountjoy Prison are not maintained in a fashion which would allow the information to be readily extracted.  I can, however, advise the Deputy that approximately 1,650 prisoners received the standard 14 day detoxification programme in the prison during 1997 but I cannot say how many of these offenders were released from custody and subsequently arrested for another offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently received the report referred to and a considered response will be made to the matters raised in the report, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs through the appropriate diplomatic channels.</P>
      <P>Following is the progress made to date in relation to individual points raised: the Government's current prison building programme will provide over 1,000 additional places within the first two years of this Government.  I am committed to the provision of a total of 2,000 additional places over the life of this Government, the following sets out the progress made regarding the programme for the provision of additional places: Limerick &lsquo;D&rsquo; Block &mdash; 60 places &mdash; construction completed and being brought into use at present; Castlerea main prison &mdash; 152 places &mdash; construction is complete and the prison is being fitted out for early occupancy; the new remand prison beside Wheatfield, in Dublin &mdash; 400 places &mdash; construction work to be completed late this year; the new women's prison at Mountjoy &mdash; 80 places &mdash; construction work to be completed late this year.  The planning for the provision of a new prison at Portlaoise is well under way.  Competitive tenders for the provision of this new 400 prisoner facility, by means of a private sector design, build and finance package, have been received and are being evaluated at present.  Construction is to be completed within 15 months from the date of commencement, i.e. by mid-1999.</P>
      <P>All these projects will provide well over 1,000 new prison places.  My Department is now commencing planning for the remaining places that are to be provided during the life of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no details of the number of complaints made by prisoners about alleged mistreatment in 1997 but I understand that the figure would be small.  In any event, there was no case of disciplinary procedures being invoked against any officer arising from such a complaint.  There is a well established procedure in the Prison Service for the investigation of complaints &mdash; prisoners may make a complaint to the Governor or the Visiting Committee which has a statutory role to visit prisons, hear complaints etc.  and they may also write in confidence to the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Governor may call in the Garda Síochána to investigate if an allegation appears to be sufficiently serious.  Furthermore, staff are reminded, as opportunity arises, that mistreatment of those in custody is intolerable and that <Col N="1229" /> the provisions of the code of discipline will be fully used in relation to such complaints.</P>
    <P>With regard to alleged instances of abuse by police, referred to in the report, a statutory board, the Garda Complaints Board, whose function is to investigate complaints against the Garda Síochána is in place.  It is also open to any person who feels they have been mistreated by the Garda to take a civil action through the courts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the State's respect for human rights generally is properly acknowledged in the report.  I acknowledge equally that the protection of human rights here and elsewhere depends on constant vigilance and respect for the highest standards in which relevant non-governmental organisations and international organisations, and other states all have a potentially valuable role to play.  The matters raised by the report will be examined by the Department to the extent which is appropriate and I am committed to the highest standards in terms of observance of human rights and respect for our obligations in this field.  In this regard I would like to advise the Deputy that the law governing powers of arrest and detention and the need for the Special Criminal Court is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>The report refers to inequalities persisting regarding pay and promotion in both the public and the private sectors in relation to women.</P>
    <P>I can inform the Deputy that the Irish legislative code for gender employment equality, equal pay and maternity leave fully complies with EU directives in each of the three instances mentioned above.</P>
    <P>Irish equality law has been in place for more than 20 years and reflects Article 119 of the EU Treaty, the terms of the Equal Pay and Equal Treatment Directives and European Court of Justice case law.</P>
    <P>Nationally there is a readily accessible system of redress for employees or prospective employees who consider that they may have been discriminated against in relation to access to employment, equal pay for work of equal value, conditions of employment, training, work experience or promotion.</P>
    <P>My Department is working to develop a framework which pursues the full integration of women, as well as other marginalised groups, into Irish society, using a number of mechanisms including legislation.  A revised and updated Employment Equality Bill which will give Ireland one of the most modern equality codes in Europe is currently under consideration by the Oireachtas.  Among the other measures being implemented are the commissioning of a study on male-female wage differentials, the development of a concerted strategy for equality, including gender proofing and mainstreaming of equal opportunities policies and the publication of a quantitative report on progress towards equal opportunities in the State-sponsored sector.</P>
    <P>There has been statutory provision for maternity leave in this country for ten years prior to that enactment.  The Maternity (Protection of <Col N="1230" /> Employees) Act, 1984 provided a minimum of 14 consecutive weeks maternity leave for pregnant employees and provided a right of return to work at the end of the leave period.  The legislation was revised, updated and expanded by enactment of the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>In relation to child-care, my Department has secured Government approval for the development of an equal opportunity child-care programme. The programme will build on a pilot child-care initiative which the Department initiated in 1994 as an equal opportunity measure in order to assist women and men in disadvantaged areas to avail of work, training and education opportunities and will involve expenditure of £2.615 million in 1998.  This measure will help in assisting parents, particularly women, in reconciling work and family responsibilities and is the first positive action measure of its kind in Ireland. An expert working group on child-care is meeting at present and is considering the issue of child-care from every angle.  It is expected to report by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The report refers to the Supreme Court's finding that the Equal Status Bill, 1997 was unconstitutional but is silent on the development of revised legislation.</P>
    <P>The actual position is that revised equal status legislation is being developed following the Supreme Court's decision that the Equal Status Bill, 1997 was unconstitutional.  The legislation will prohibit discrimination on nine distinct grounds &mdash; gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.  It will apply to non-workplace areas, such as provision of goods and services, accommodation and education.  The revised Bill is expected to be published later this year.</P>
    <P>While the report refers only to the Employment Equality Bill under the heading of &ldquo;People with Disabilities&rdquo;, the Equal Status Bill will also apply to discrimination on the grounds of disability.</P>
    <P>The report is silent on the Task Force on the Travelling Community, which reported in 1995 on various aspects of travellers' lives, including education, work, accommodation, health and discrimination. A monitoring committee, comprising all relevant interests both inside and outside Government, will shortly be established to oversee implementation of the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to be able to inform the Deputy of the progress to date in relation to the commitments made in the programme for Government referred to.</P>
      <P>The Government's current prison building programme will provide over 1,000 additional places within the first two years of this Government.  I am committed to the provision of a total of 2,000 additional places over the life of this Government.</P>
      <P>The following is the up-to-date position regarding the programme for the provision of additional places: Limerick &lsquo;D&rsquo; Block &mdash; 60 places &mdash; construction completed and being brought into use at present; Castlerea main prison &mdash; 152 places &mdash; construction was completed at the end of February 1998 and the prison is currently being fitted out for early occupancy; the new remand prison beside Wheatfield, in Dublin &mdash; 400 places &mdash; construction work to be completed late this year and the new women's prison at Mountjoy &mdash; 80 places &mdash; construction work to be completed late this year.</P>
      <P>The planning for the provision of a new prison at Portlaoise is well under way.  Competitive tenders for the provision of this new 400 prisoner facility, by means of a private sector design, build and finance package, have been received and are being evaluated at present.  Construction is to be completed within 15 months from the date of commencement, i.e. by mid-1999.</P>
      <P>All of these projects will provide well over 1,000 new prison places.  My Department is now commencing planning for the remaining places that are to be provided during the life of this Government.</P>
      <P>The current strength of the prison service is 2,560.  A recruitment campaign is under way to ensure sufficient staff for the new prison places which the Government is committed to providing.</P>
      <P>In addition to the range of educational programmes for all prisoners, special treatment programmes are in place for sex offenders, operated by the psychology and probation and welfare services. Individual counselling is available in all institutions with the temporary exception of the Curragh Place of Detention.  A dedicated intensive programme is well established in Arbour Hill prison.  It is hoped to introduce a similar programme in the Curragh.  Plans are at an advanced stage for the introduction of a different type of programme &mdash; thinking skills training programme &mdash; in Cork Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most prisons are relatively drug free.  The biggest problem is in the Dublin committal institutions. The operation of the Mountjoy drug treatment facility and the drug free unit at the training unit are currently under review.  It is intended to have a medical treatment programme, <Col N="1232" /> if required, and a secure drug free unit in every closed institution as soon as possible. The progress that can be made in this area is limited, however, until additional prison accommodation becomes available.</P>
    <P>The Working Group on a Courts Commission recently submitted to me its report on drugs courts.  This report recommended that a pilot scheme of such courts should be implemented.  I am considering its report and I will be putting proposals to Cabinet in this regard shortly.</P>
    <P>The commitment in the programme for Government requires the recruitment of 2,200 Garda trainees over the period 1998 to 2001, inclusive, to bring the strength of the force to 12,000 by the year 2002.  The additional recruitment necessary commenced in January.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently undertaking a major courts building programme which will both upgrade existing facilities and provide new facilities where required.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that a new courthouse has just opened in Tallaght at a cost of £1 million to replace the facility in Rathfarnham which was in poor condition and that the courthouses in Portarlington and Abbeyfeale were recently refurbished.  A new holding cell area with separate access for prisoners and a new jury call-over area have also been provided for the courts at Chancery Place in the Four Courts to overcome safety problems and more importantly, to provide suitable additional accommodation for persons attending court for jury duty service.</P>
    <P>Refurbishment projects are also under-way in Portlaoise, Ennis, Roscrea, Cork and Edenderry. The programme is ongoing and I will be approving further projects as the year progresses.</P>

      <P>Since the launch of the Garda air support unit on 1 September 1997, and up to 8 March 1998, the helicopter has flown 867 missions.  This has resulted in 104 direct and indirect arrests, the recovery of 61 vehicles and the location of six missing persons.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government has already established the National Committee on Violence against Women which is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy M. Wallace. The decision to establish the committee is in accordance with the report of the Task Force on Violence agaist Women.  The national steering committee includes representatives from the key Departments, together with the Garda Síochána and representatives of non-governmental organisations. The remit of the committee includes: co-ordination and advice in the distribution of resources and in the ongoing development of policies, including those concerning perpetrators, criminal justice interventions, services and supports; ensuring that regional and local structures are established to determine strategies at a local level and to provide a community-based approach to the provision of sevices; and promoting training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The civil aspects of the law in relation to the protection of persons from violence in the home <Col N="1236" /> were the subject of major reform in the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.  The Act extends the availability of the barring order remedy, which had previously been confined to cases of interspousal conflict, to cases of conflict between certain persons who have lived together as husband and wife, and to parents against adult children.  The Act also introduced a new type safety order remedy which can be availed of in cases of conflict between household members, subject to certain conditions.  Health boards were also given powers to apply to the courts on behalf of victims who, through fear or trauma, were unable to apply on their own behalf.  The Act took into account recommendations made by the Second Commission on the Status of Women, the Kilkenny incest investigation team, the Law Reform Commission in its report on child sexual abuse, as well as those made by a variety of voluntary organisations operating in the field.</P>
    <P>The Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996 extended further the classes of persons covered to include ex-spouses whose divorce decree was granted by the Irish courts or whose divorce decree is entitled to recognition in the State.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will also be interested to know that Women's Aid is to receive £10,000 from my Department to monitor the effectiveness of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mountjoy male prison has a capacity of 507 places at present.  This does not include the 40 spaces in the reception area.  The highest number in custody on any one night during 1997 was 700 and the average was 653. Mountjoy female prison has a capacity of 73 places at present but not all of these are in use. The highest number in custody there on any one night during 1997 was 67 and the average was 51. These peaks in both the male and female sections of Mountjoy were on different nights during December and both have been exceeded since then.  With regard to the Prison Service Bill a general scheme is being considered in my Department in light of the report of the expert group. The date of publication of the Bill will be announced in due course and in the usual way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have consistently acknowledged the need to address the problem of overcrowding in our prison system in general and in particular in Mountjoy Prison.  I have put in place a substantial programme of prison refurbishment and construction which is under way at present.  Construction of the new remand prison at Wheatfield is progressing well.  This facility will provide an additional 400 spaces and will act as a centre for the classification and assessment of most of the State's remand prisoners.  Building of the new women's prison at Mountjoy, which will accommodate <Col N="1238" /> 80 offenders, is also progressing well and is on target for completion in October or November of this year.  Construction of &lsquo;D&rsquo; Block of Limerick has been completed, 60 new places are available there and are now in the process of being occupied.  The construction of 152 places at the Castlerea main prison has just been finished and these will come into operation in the next couple of months.  The planning for the provision of a new prison at Portlaoise is well under way. Competitive tenders for the provision of this new 400 prisoner facility, by means of a private sector design, build and finance package, have been received and are currently being examined.  It is expected that construction will be completed within 15 months from the date of commencement, that is, by summer-autumn 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing some 1,090 additional prison spaces by mid to late 1999 I am fully committed to the development of community sanctions and measures as alternatives to custody and as a means of combating crime.  My Department's Probation and Welfare Service has a significant role to play in this regard.  A number of alternatives to custody are already in place.  In this regard approximately 1,042 offenders are placed on probation orders each year.  Another alternative to custody which has proven successful is community service with approximately 1,600 offenders being required by the courts to perform community service each year.</P>
    <P>A more recent development in the area of alternatives to imprisonment is intensive probation supervision.  This is a special community based programme for serious or persistent offenders requiring a more intensive form of supervision.  Participants may be referred to this scheme by courts as an alternative to a substantial sentence &mdash; two years or more.  Furthermore, offenders in custody for similar sentences may be released early from custody towards the end of their sentence under intensive supervision.</P>
    <P>It is my Department's policy to develop probation as a viable alternative to imprisonment.  To this end, funding is provided to over 40 hostels, day centres and workshops.</P>
    <P>I again stress my commitment to community sanctions and measures as viable alternatives to custody.  I recently established a group to examine the Probation and Welfare Service, its role, needs and organisational structure, and to make recommendations on how the service should develop into the next millennium.  I also secured funding for a much needed new IT system for the service which will be developed in 1998.  I also secured additional money for three new probation centres for 1998.  In total, I increased funding to the Probation and Welfare Service in 1998 by 27 per cent over last year's allocation.</P>
    <P>The measures I have outlined will, in time, alleviate the problem of overcrowding in Mountjoy Prison and the other prisons and places of detention. <Col N="1239" /></P>

      <P>There is no objective research, in this jurisdiction, on the rates of recidivism for sex offenders generally or for paedophiles in particular.  The experience of the professional services in the prison system, however, is that, to date, very few convicted sex offenders who have completed prison sentences are subsequently committed to prison to serve further sentences for sex offences.  It is important to bear in mind that I am referring to reconviction rates only.  International research on this issue shows that recidivism rates for child molesters generally are lower than for offenders convicted for non-sex-related offences.  Indeed, it would appear that recidivism rates for sex offenders are much lower than would be suggested by the general public perception of the risk such offenders pose upon release on completion of their sentences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107, 165 and 167 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently making funding available for six community based projects, in Dublin, which are aimed at diverting juveniles from crime.  The projects are located in Ronanstown, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Cherry Orchard, Priorswood-Darndale and more recently in the <Col N="1240" /> north inner city.  The advisory committees running each of these projects are multi-agency in nature.  Usually they involve gardaí, Probation and Welfare Service personnel, voluntary youth organisations, clergy and, most importantly, representatives of the local communities.</P>
    <P>Through a combination of intervention and prevention programmes which involve, for example, school projects, sports, club facilities and other, mainly recreational and developmental activities, the special projects focus on juveniles who are already involved in crime or who are likely to drop out of the education system prematurely, together with those in need of emotional and developmental support due to family circumstances. The projects are also directed towards those who are unable to participate in other youth activities due to behavioural difficulties.</P>
    <P>The concept of the special projects has its origins in the increased awareness and acceptance that, whatever the relative significance, factors such as unemployment, lack of educational opportunity and various other social disadvantages contribute towards criminal activity and disorderly behaviour.  International experience suggests that this is the approach most likely to bear fruit.</P>
    <P>Special projects are established in communities where a specific need has been identified.  The initiative generally comes from the ground up, usually from An Garda Síochána or from a statutory or voluntary agency working in the community, or from residents themselves.  While the projects do not all conform to the same structure, as they are tailor made to address the specific needs and problems in each area, they do have the same common theme running through them. For this reason, it is of little benefit to adopt a quantitative approach to measuring their throughput although, of course, it is important to keep the direction and focus of each project under review.</P>
    <P>The projects are aimed at young people in the ten to 17 age group.  I am satisfied that this particular age group is the one that can benefit most. These projects appear to be an effective and economical method of dealing with young people who are at risk.  However, the question of a possible formal evaluation of their effectiveness and impact is being considered in the context of my Department's research proposals for 1998.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Probation and Welfare Service is involved in, and runs, a number of community based projects which cater for young offenders at risk of continuing in crime.  These projects include workshops and day centres where offenders are provided with training in a number of skills.  The purpose is to address offending behaviour, reduce recidivism and assist such persons in obtaining gainful employment.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that projects directed at young people at risk which come under the <Col N="1241" /> aegis of agencies for which I have responsibility are but a part of the Government's overall programme to tackle social exclusion and drugs.</P>
    <P>In this regard £10 million has been approved by Government to support the implementation of service development plans which have been prepared by each local drugs task force detailing specific projects which they propose to implement.  The plans were evaluated by the National Drugs Strategy team and recommendations were made to the Cabinet Subcommittee on Drugs and Social Inclusion.</P>
    <P>In addition, as part of the Government's programme for young people at risk, £30 million will be provided over the next three years to fund the young people's facilities and services fund.  The initial allocation of £1.25 million for this year has been increased to £7.5 million.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be interested to know that juvenile crime will be discussed at the National Crime Forum on Thursday, 19 March 1998.</P>

      <P>The question of the value of a centralised Garda national missing persons unit is being kept under review.  In this regard, officials of my Department, together with members of the Garda Síochána, will be travelling to the UK later this month to assess the potential value of a new initiative there, involving analysis of data using sophisticated computer software, as an aid to investigations.

      <P>The Schengen Agreement, 1985 and Implementing Convention, 1990 contain provisions for the gradual abolition of checks at the common borders of the Schengen member states.  Those arrangements have developed outside of the EU legal framework.  Any member state of the EU may become a party to the Schengen Convention, but there is no formal status less than full accession to the Convention. Ireland has not joined the Schengen arrangements to date.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam provides for the incorporation of the Schengen arrangements into the framework of the EC and EU Treaties.  The necessary preparatory work to deal with all aspects of the incorporation of the Schengen Acquis into the EU framework is ongoing in the EU Council.  This includes the distribution of the elements of the Schengen provisions between the EC and EU Treaties.</P>
      <P>The relevant Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty confirms the position of Ireland as a non-party to the Schengen arrangements, but contains a provision that would enable Ireland to request to take part in some or all of the Schengen provisions, after the Treaty comes into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of possible opt-in by Ireland to some of the Schengen arrangements will arise at that stage and will take account of the decisions of the EU Council determining the legal basis for the individual elements of the Schengen provisions, <Col N="1245" /> for the purpose of the incorporation into the EU framework.</P>
    <P>Any question of Ireland opting into particular provisions of the Schengen arrangements will also take account of the need to maintain the existing common travel area with the United Kingdom, which is also non-party to the Schengen Convention.</P>

    <P>It is a requirement of the scheme that the juvenile admits the offence and that the parents or guardians agree to co-operate with the Garda in the implementation of the diversion programme.</P>
    <P>The concern of the Garda juvenile liaison officer is to look behind the offence and attempt to see why the juvenile in question has offended. The juvenile liaison officer, according to the Garda authorities, will look at the offender as an individual, as a member of a family and a member of the community.  This will naturally involve the JLO calling and meeting the offender and his-her parents at their home and if the JLO identifies a problem which he-she cannot solve the individual and-or family will be referred to the appropriate statutory or voluntary organisation with expertise in the matter.</P>

      <P>Where a bovine animal loses a brass ear-tag, it is necessary for disease control purposes to test the animal in order to establish the health status of what in effect is an unidentified animal. Under the plastic tagging system, each bovine animal is tagged with two eartags each bearing the same identity number thus providing for the secure maintenance of the original identification of the animal.  If one of these tags is lost, the herdowner is required to purchase and insert a <Col N="1248" /> replacement tag matching the tag number of the tag remaining in the animal.  In general, animals born prior to mid-1996 are identified under the single brass tag arrangement.  Animals born since this date are identified under the plastic tagging arrangement.</P>

      <P>An area aid application was received from the person concerned in 1994 with a declared forage area of 17.71 hectares.  Applications were received in respect of five suckler cows and ten special beef male cattle in 1994, i.e. in respect of 11 livestock units.  The milk quota held on 1 April 1994 of 12,241 gallons was the equivalent of a further 14.50 livestock units.

It should be noted that no VAT accrues from sales of oral medicine, which attracts VAT at the zero rate. <Col N="1251" /></P>

      <P>Special savings accounts, SSAs, were introduced in 1993 with a low rate of deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, i.e. 10 per cent to help prevent outflows of funds from the State following the liberalisation of exchange controls.  The rate was increased to 15 per cent in 1995.</P>
      <P>I announced in the Budget Statement in December 1997 that I would increase the 15 per cent rate of DIRT on SSAs to 20 per cent with effect from 6 April 1998.  The Government is aiming for a 20 per cent standard rate of income tax and, accordingly, it seemed fitting to move the rate of DIRT on SSAs to this rate at this stage.  I also considered that a 20 per cent rate would redress the imbalance between the tax treatment of such deposit interest and other income.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information regarding the numbers and levels of SSAs held by persons of any age is not available to them.  However, data on SSA deposits, published in the Central Bank of Ireland monthly statistics, indicates that as of 30 January 1998 IR£4,533 million was on deposit in SSAs held by Irish residents.  Given the maximum amount that can be held is £50,000 per person, then at least 90,000 people hold SSAs.  I have no proposals to remove the initial three month and subsequent one month notice requirements for withdrawals from such accounts.</P>

      <P>There are no hard data on the percentage of young people who have availed of illegal drugs. The Health Research Board report on treated drug misuse in Ireland for 1996 noted that the total number of contacts receiving treatment for drug misuse during that year was 4,865, of whom almost two thirds were under 25 years of age.  It must be emphasised that this is the number of people who received treatment, so the total number of people misusing drugs would be considerably in excess of this figure.  All health boards are <Col N="1252" /> establishing databases in order to give improved data on the nature and extent of drug misuse.  The main drugs of misuse in all health boards are ecstasy and cannabis, while the abuse of heroin is mainly confined to the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The health boards, in conjunction with my Department, are engaged in a range of activities aimed at preventing young people turning to drugs in the first instance and providing appropriate counselling or treatment and rehabilitation whenever required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 157 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> The price to wholesalers, wholesale price, of drugs and medicines prescribable and reimbursable under the general medical services, GMS, scheme and the community drug schemes is determined in accordance with the agreements between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Irish Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.  These agreements provide that the price to the wholesaler of any new item of medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreements shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted United Kingdom wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower.  This is the position in the case of new medicinal products or modified versions of existing products.  Accordingly, the Department has no function in determining the component elements within the price of a product as applied by pharmaceutical companies in respect of production costs, margin to cover research costs or recurring branding marketing.</P>
    <P>Regarding the fees for licensing, the position is that a product must be the subject of a product authorisation before it can be placed on the market. The fees for granting such an authorisation are set down under the Irish Medicines Board (Fees) Regulations, 1996.  These fees can vary depending on the nature of the application concerned. In the case of an application for an established drug which would not be considered complex and consists of a single dosage form, the fee would be £3,000.  In the case of an application in <Col N="1254" /> respect of a medicinal product containing a new drug substance and which consists of a single dosage form the fee would be £6,000.  Additional fees would be applicable if further dosage forms and strengths were involved in the application.</P>
    <P>There is no retail mark-up in respect of medicines dispensed under the general medical services scheme.  Pharmacies are reimbursed the trade price of the product plus a dispensing fee of £1.69. In the case of medicines dispensed under the other community drug schemes, pharmacies are reimbursed the trade price of the medicines plus a 50 per cent mark-up, plus a standard fee of £1.53. The Department has no function in determining the retail mark-up or the dispensing fee in respect of the private dispensing of medicines, as these were established on the basis of tradition and practice.  Generally, these are the same as under the community drug schemes.</P>
    <P>There are three versions of aspirin 75mg on the Irish market.  There is a non-proprietary form and two proprietary forms of the product available. The three products in question are identical in that they contain the same active ingredient and all are intended for the management of cardio-vascular disease.  The price differential arose when two companies introduced proprietary versions of the product to the Irish market.  The pricing of each of these products complies fully with the terms of the agreements in place with the industry.</P>
    <P>The following table sets out the current prices for the products concerned and shows the differential in price between the various versions:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The new hospital in Tallaght when opened on 21 June this year will incorporate the services currently being provided at the Adelaide Hospital, the Meath Hospital and the National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street.  In addition, acute psychiatric services currently being provided at St. Loman's Hospital will also transfer to Tallaght.</P>
      <P>The Meath Hospital, the Adelaide Hospital and the National Children's Hospital are voluntary hospitals and as such, the hospitals or their successor bodies have full ownership of their sites.  When the services transfer to Tallaght, I understand the hospital sites will be sold as the premises will no longer function as acute hospitals.  Since agreement was reached on the development of the new hospital &mdash; the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital &mdash; it has always been understood that the three constituent hospitals would close as acute hospitals once the new hospital is opened.  I understand none of the hospitals has been disposed of to date.  However, such disposal is a matter for the owners of the sites as are any negotiations in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Eastern Health Board's working group on the south inner city primary care needs assessment identified the problems likely to arise following the relocation <Col N="1255" /> of existing services to Tallaght and it recommended the establishment of a primary care centre and the enhancement of general practice and community services in the south inner city, with the primary care centre acting as a central focus for the organisation and delivery of services encompassing the full range of health care and administrative needs for primary care services in the area.  The possibility of acquiring the Meath Hospital campus for these purposes is being examined by the Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a steady increase in the number of cases coming before An Bord Pleanála, due mainly to the growth in the economy.  In 1997, 3,927 new cases were received compared to 3,424 in 1996 and 2,874 in 1995 &mdash; a 37 per cent increase over a two year period.  My Department has taken a number of measures to assist the board in dealing with the growth in the number of cases, including additional staffing.  In the latter half of 1997, it became clear that the statutory limit of six on the membership of the board was proving a particular difficulty in terms of increasing the number of decisions.  Accordingly, I introduced a short Bill last December to enable additional board members to be appointed.  At present, this Bill is on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  Assuming the early enactment of the Bill and appointment of two additional board members and taking account of the other measures taken, the board estimates that the percentage of cases determined within four months will be back up to about 90 per cent by the first quarter of 1999 and will later increase to 95 per cent with the full year benefit of the extra board members and staff.  For more information on the matter, I refer the Deputy to my Second Reading speech on the Bill referred to in cols.  44 to 48 of the Official Report of 28 January 1998.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a wide range of measures to combat fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.  These measures include checks on the entitlements of those receiving payments and inspections to ensure that employers are meeting their obligations under the Social Welfare Acts.  A total of 6,745 inspections of employers were made last year of which close to 2,000 were joint inspections by officers of Revenue and of my Department who operate in special units.  My Department has some 600 staff engaged full time on anti-fraud and abuse measures.  In addition, checks are made at various stages from the receipt of a claim to the decision and later during the currency of payment to ensure that the various conditions attaching to the payment are fulfilled.  The development of computerisation has been of considerable assistance in this work in recent years. Savings of £158 million were achieved in 1997. Prosecutions are considered in all cases in which the evidence indicates fraud.</P>
      <P>In certain specified sectors employers are required by law to notify my Department when they take on new employees or subcontractors. The sectors involved are security, construction, forestry, contract cleaning, road haulage, private road transport, catering, the licensed bar trade and meat processing.  Each notification is cross-checked against the Department's central records database to identify possible instances of working and claiming and non-compliance with PRSI obligations and any irregularities discovered are followed up.  To make employers aware of their responsibilities, &ldquo;fact packs&rdquo; of leaflets outlining employers' social welfare and PRSI responsibilities are regularly sent to employers in these specified categories.  I am keeping the effectiveness of anti-fraud and anti-abuse measures, including the registration of employees in ceretain sectors, under review and whatever changes or additional measures as appear appropriate in the light of experience will be made.</P>

      <P>A wide range of controls designed to tackle the problem of under age drinking are included in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  The primary purpose of those statutory controls is to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years of age to lawfully purchase alcohol, to be in possession of it or to consume it other than in a private residence.  With a view to making the existing controls on under age drinking even more effective, officials in my Department have been examining, at my request, matters relating to the introduction of a national voluntary age card scheme under the regulation-making provisions in section 40 of the 1988 Act.</P>
      <P>Measures aimed at curbing the supply of alcohol to young people cannot on their own be expected to solve the underage drinking problem. Measures are also required which deal with the demand for alcohol among those under 18.  The Garda plays a prominant role in this regard in participating in school programmes which deal with the abuse of alcohol by young persons.  The Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children are also very involved in measures that address the demand side of the problem.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that most terms of imprisonment are subject to remission as provided for in the 1947 rules for the government of prisons.  Remission of sentence does not apply, however, in the case of persons convicted of murder or capital murder.  The standard remission rate is 25 per cent of the total sentence which in practice means that a person who is sentenced, say, to four years imprisonment is, generally speaking, liable to serve a maximum of three years.  This standard remission rate is known to sentencing judges and has always been considered necessary as an incentive to good behaviour in prison &mdash; remission can be lost in whole or in part where a prisoner fails to behave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The governor of a prison or place of detention may hold a person in custody only if there is a valid committal warrant in being.  In this regard the Deputy will appreciate that sentenced offenders may be released by the courts before the expiry of a sentence for a number of reasons, for example, as a result of a review, on bail pending the hearing of an appeal or on appeal.  In addition to the obligation to release prisoners on completion of sentence or on foot of a court order, I as Minister have the statutory power to grant temporary release to prisoners under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  Temporary release may be granted for a range of periods up to final <Col N="1259" /> release and for a variety of reasons, for example, for resocialisation or for humanitarian purposes. There is, however, no obligation to grant early or temporary release and a prisoner may be, and many are, kept in custody until the last day of his or her sentence.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that considerable progress has been made in this area recently.  Eleven republican prisoners have been transferred to Ireland from the UK since 3 December 1997 under the provisions of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This brought the total number of republican prisoners transferred to date from the United Kingdom to Ireland under the provisions of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons to 17.</P>
      <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that there are currently 13 convicted republican prisoners in the United Kingdom.  Of these, 11 have requested a transfer to this jurisdiction, one has requested a transfer to Northern Ireland, and another has not yet made an application.</P>
      <P>Of the applications for transfer to this jurisdiction, I recently have consented to the transfers of five more prisoners and the necessary documentation as required under the Convention has been returned to the UK authorities for their further consideration.  The consent of the Home Secretary, and the formal consent of the prisoners is now awaited &mdash; there must be three-way prior consent from the sentenced person and from the authorities of both States for a transfer to take place.  On receipt of same, arrangements will be made to apply to the High Court for the necessary warrants authorising their transfers into this jurisdiction and their continued detention here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the remaining six cases who have applied <Col N="1260" /> for transfer here, two applications are under consideration in my Department at present.  There are three recently convicted prisoners in the UK whose applications have yet to be formally transmitted for our consideration by the UK authorities and one application is currently on hold pending the resolution of the applicant's appeal.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that it has been established Government policy in line with the humanitarian provisions of the Convention that, whenever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families.  I assure the Deputy that representations will continue to be made on behalf of those imprisoned in the UK who have applied for transfer here, and that every effort will continue to be made to process these applications as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>The issue of asylum seekers and refugees is regularly discussed at both ministerial and working party level in the EU.  Various initiatives in this area involving co-operation at an EU level, for example, a resolution for minimum guarantees for asylum procedures, means of proof in the framework of the Dublin Convention, have taken place over the years.  Consultations take place regularly with colleagues in Europe on asylum and refugee matters and Ireland continues to co-operate with her partners in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 175 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>I am committed to a policy of zero tolerance towards crime, particularly, but not exclusively, towards drug trafficking.  The Criminal Justice Bill, 1997, is clear evidence of this policy.  Under the main provisions of this Bill, persons trafficking in drugs to the value of £10,000 or more will face minimum sentences of ten years.  The Bill also allows trials to take place more quickly through the abolition of preliminary examinations. Courts will also have the power to initiate an inquiry into the assets of people convicted of drug trafficking offences with a view to confiscating those assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an aggressive policy has and is being pursued by An Garda Síochána in obtaining evidence to bring drug traffickers before the courts.  Major drug trafficking organisations have been disrupted, <Col N="1262" /> large quantities of drugs seized and significant drug trafficking criminals have been charged before the courts.</P>
    <P>Various Garda operations, including Operation Dóchas, Operation Main Street and Operation Clean Street, are also proving very effective and a number of persons are currently before the courts charged with drug offences arising from these operations.  The anti-drugs policy also extends to the prisons system where offenders convicted of drug supply are serving their sentences in full. The continued effectiveness of the Criminal Assets Bureau and other legislation such as the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, are also major weapons in the fight against the scourge of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse is also being tackled by the 13 local drugs task forces which have been set up in the areas most severely affected by the heroin problem. To date, the Government has approved £10 million to implement the action plans prepared by the task forces to tackle the drugs problem in their areas.  The process of implementing these plans has commenced.</P>
    <P>In addition, the young people's facilities and services fund has been established by the Government this year with a budget of £30 million to be spent over three years.  The initial allocation of £1.25 million for this year has been increased to £7.5 million.  The fund will support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in disadvantaged areas, particularly those affected by the heroin problem.  Detailed arrangements for the operation of the fund are currently being finalised and will be submitted to Government for approval as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On an international level, Ireland actively supports the EU's determination to fight organised crime, including drug trafficking, which is reflected in the many joint actions which have been adopted, or are under discussion.  These joint actions, when fully implemented, will greatly facilitate the fight against organised crime.</P>

      <P>The student referred to by the Deputy wishes to pursue an evening degree course in the National University of Ireland, Dublin.  Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years' duration, at approved colleges.  The free fees initiative does not extend to students pursuing part-time or evening courses.</P>
      <P>The latest available figures in relation to part-time students are those in respect of the 1995-6 academic year when there were some 22,000 part-time students at third level.  Any proposal to extend the free fees initiative to these students would need to have regard to the availability of resources and other competing needs in the education sector.</P>
      <P>In its report, the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education referred to the profile of part-time students and noted that almost 90 per cent were in employment. In this context, I would point out that tax relief is available, at the standard rate under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996, for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses.</P>

The outline sketch scheme was requested from County Dublin <Col N="1266" /> VEC's design team on 4 April 1996 and it was received in the building unit on 18 September 1996.

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes.  Under the scheme for employment of caretakers which was introduced in 1979, my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI.  However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and the replacement of shared caretaker posts has never been allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP, a second scheme has been in operation since 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary <Col N="1267" /> schools towards the cost of caretaking and clerical services.  Scoil Treasa currently has a shared caretaker post with another primary school in Firhouse. My Department has been informed that the caretaker may retire in May 1998.  Unfortunately, as the post in question is shared between the two schools, it will not be possible to sanction the appointment of a full-time replacement caretaker to Scoil Treasa.  However, should the caretaker resign, my Department will provide both schools with a grant of £15 per pupil per annum, subject to a maximum grant of £7,500 to each school, towards the cost of caretaking services, in accordance with the current terms of the PESP scheme.</P>

      <P>The constitution of UNESCO provides that each member state should make its own administrative arrangements in relation to the work of UNESCO.  For many countries this takes the form of a national commission involving Government ministries and other interests involved in the areas that come within UNESCO's competence.  Between 1987 and 1991 matters relating to UNESCO were administered by the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Foreign Affairs in consultation with other Government Departments as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To provide for wider consultation on UNESCO issues, the Minister for Education and Science in 1991 invited other relevant Government Departments to participate in an interdepartmental <Col N="1268" /> committee known as the Irish National Committee for UNESCO.  The members of the committee who represent their Departments are not appointed, but assume their position on the committee by virtue of the responsibility assigned to them for UNESCO matters in their respective Departments.</P>
    <P>The current membership of the committee and their dates of appointments are as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. John Dennehy, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science, is an <i>ex officio</i> Chairman of the National Committee for UNESCO, (15/1/98),</P>
    <P>Mr. Sé Goulding, Department of Education and Science, (20/2/97),</P>
    <P>Ms Eilish Bergin, Department of Education and Science, (10/11/97),</P>
    <P>Mr. Fearghas de Stok, Department of Education and Science, (3/5/94),</P>

    <P>Mr. Conor O'Malley, Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, (7/9/95),</P>
    <P>Mr. Eugene Keane, Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, (1/6/91),</P>
    <P>Ms Veronica Healy, Department of the Environment and Local Government (7/9/95),</P>
    <P>Mr. Michael Pender, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, (3/9/93).</P>
    <P>One plenary meeting of the Irish National Committee was held in the years 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995 and 1997.  There were no plenary meetings in the years 1994 and 1996.  Members of the committee represent Ireland at the UNESCO General Conference which is held in Paris once every two years.  The committee represented Ireland at the 1991, 1993, 1995 and 1997 general conferences. The Departments of Education and Science and Foreign Affairs represented Ireland jointly at the 1987 and 1989 general conferences. In addition, the committee was represented at the European Regional Conference, Lisbon, in 1993. While it is not envisaged at present that other Government Departments will be required to assign an official to the committee, it is open to them to do so if considered appropriate.</P>
