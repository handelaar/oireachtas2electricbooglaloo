    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I visited Finland and Estonia on 26 and 27 April last and held discussions with Prime Minister Lipponen of Finland, President Meri, Prime Minister Siimann and Foreign Minister Ilves of Estonia.</P>
      <P>My discussions with Prime Minister Lipponen centred on European Union issues including economic and monetary union, Agenda 2000, institutional reform and priorities for the forthcoming Finnish Presidency, including Finland's proposal for a northern dimension to the Union.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity to brief Prime Minister Lipponen on the Northern Ireland Agreement and I expressed my appreciation for the role played for former Prime Minister Holkeri at the talks process, and for Finland's continued support for the peace process.</P>
      <P>I also met with the President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Estonia in Tallinn. Estonia is among the first wave of applicant countries with which the EU recently commenced accession negotiations.  My visit, the first by a Taoiseach, sought to strengthen bilateral economic, political and other relations with a future member state of the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expressed support for Estonian membership of the Union, complimented the Estonian leaders <Col N="786" /> for their strong efforts to transform their economy and took the opportunity to outline Ireland's experience as a member of the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I too join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to Harri Holkeri, the former Prime Minister of Finland, who played an important role as one of the three chairpersons at the Northern Ireland talks.  Given that the Finnish Prime Minister is on record as having said that he thinks the duty free sales issue will be reopened at European level, did the Taoiseach raise that issue with him and seek support for the Irish stand on reversing the decision that was taken in l991-92 to abolish duty free sales?  If the Taoiseach did not raise the matter, why did he not do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision made in l991-92 related to getting a seven-year period during which to phase it out.  I discussed it on this and on many other occasions.  Mr. Holkeri supports our stand, but many others do not.  It will be on the agenda for the next ECOFIN meeting.  I will raise it also with my European colleagues, probably by letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be on the agenda for the ECOFIN meeting as a result of the Irish initiative or do we have the support of other Ministers whose names will also be attached to any motion put down at the ECOFIN meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure who has it on their agenda, but a growing number of countries are supportive and are changing their position on it.  It is too early to say whether that is enough to change the position.  However, from a position where there was very little interest six months ago, the argument is gaining momentum.  There is still a huge amount of work to do.  I know from commercial organisations within the country and from correspondence from organisations outside the country that they are actively engaged in lobbying their politicians to try to have the matter redressed.  I have not seen any significant indication from the Commission of a change of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to say whether the item is listed for discussion at the next ECOFIN meeting which takes place on Monday week?  We are talking about a study on the employment impact of the abolition of duty free sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been told it will be back on the agenda of the ECOFIN Council and will be addressed by it.  I am not familiar with the agenda for the next meeting &mdash; I am sure it is not yet available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Prime Minister of Finland, Paavo Lipponen, raise the question of Ireland's support for the candidacy of the governor of the Central Bank of Finland for one of the executive director positions of the European Central Bank in the course of discussions with the Taoiseach? <Col N="787" /> If so, did the Taoiseach respond and is there any understanding that at some stage in the future Finland might reciprocate such support, as the governor of Finland's Central Bank is the only representative of a small country on the executive directorship of the European Central Bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed that matter at some length.  The Deputy knows the quality of the Finnish candidate from previous experience which was recalled.  We addressed this issue at the meeting and I strongly supported the Finnish candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What did you get in return?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows a decision has been made that it will be a rotational position. It is important that the smaller countries, including Finland and Ireland, work together.  We did not have a suitable candidate to put forward. Whatever about the arguments of last weekend, for future reference it would seem that candidates will have to be either Secretary General of the Department of Finance or governor of the Central Bank.  If we do not put forward people at this level we will not be in the game.  This is what happened others last week.  We must look to the longer term, perhaps seven or eight years, when the rotational system will lead to support.  I hope I have that understanding with Finland and perhaps a few other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss with the Finnish Prime Minister how small countries such as Ireland and Finland could deal with economic upheavals which may arise in future, given that we are now part of EMU and the mechanism of adjusting exchange rates is no longer available?  Did he discuss Finland's novel introduction of a buffer fund, namely, the use of various funds to ensure the state can deal with problems of unemployment or shocks to companies which may experience trouble?  This fund was agreed by the social partners in Finland in late 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not discuss that scheme. However, we talked about how things will pan out over the coming years.  Finland has quite high levels of unemployment.  Before the 1989 changes in Eastern Europe the unemployment rate was 2 per cent or 3 per cent.  This increased to double digit figures and an attempt is being made to reduce it again.  Both countries see the opportunities, including opportunities for exporters, of an enlarged community.  The big political issue which is concentrating the minds of politicians and the media is Finland's first presidency, which is a year away.  This is seen as very important to Finland.  Finland's proposal concerning a northern dimension to the EU is aimed at enhancing regional political and economic co-operation among all states in the Baltic, including Russia.  It <Col N="788" /> believes this would bring stability to the area in the long term and assist smaller countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and build up its economy for the future.  The Finns have put great effort into this.  They accept there will be problems and that the disciplines will be fairly severe, but they are also aware of the opportunities that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Taoiseach has said.  I am not making a case against EMU, I am merely making the point that in market driven economies there inevitably will be a downturn at some point and this country and others will hit heavy weather at some stage in the future.  Will the Taoiseach examine the initiative the Finns have taken by putting in place a counter cyclical mechanism which would assist countries like Ireland to overcome difficulties.  There is no mechanism in place at European level to help us to do that.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Higgins (Mayo)</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if the Government has completed its review of the procedures for the protection of classified information; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10412/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On foot of unauthorised releases of information on Northern Ireland matters, the Government decided last November to establish the Interdepartmental Committee on the Protection of Classified Official Information. The committee was mandated to recommend measures on the protection of classified information. It was chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and included representatives from the Departments of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee has reported and the Government has approved the implementation of the following key measures.  The current practice in the retention of documents by former Ministers and Ministers of State should continue.  The Government has decided that arrangements should be put in place for the storage within Departments of documents returned voluntarily by former Ministers and Ministers of State and that priority should be given to a comprehensive review and a thorough revision of the Official Secrets Act 1963.  The report of January 1997 on the review of the Officials Secrets Act by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security is recognised as a good starting point for such a review.  One classification of &ldquo;top secret&rdquo; should be applied for interdepartmental purposes to particularly sensitive documents which because of their nature or content should receive only very limited, if any, circulation.  An information technology security group chaired by the CMOD division of the Department of Finance should be set up.  An interdepartmental committee to develop detailed <Col N="789" /> work practices and procedures for the protection of classified information, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, should also be established. The implementation of the overall programme of action set out in the report should be supervised by the interdepartmental committee which will make a progress report to Government later this year.</P>
    <P>In drawing up its report, the interdepartmental committee was mindful of the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act which, as Deputies will be aware, is being implemented fully by this Government.  At the same time the Act recognises that there will always be exempt material of a security, public interest or diplomatic nature which will now be defined in a more focused way.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined that sensitive information will receive the highest possible level of protection.  It is especially concerned about any unauthorised release of information which could place lives or the national interest in danger.  I have arranged to have the interdepartmental committee's report placed in the Library of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> In light of the Taoiseach's admission that the initiative came from him in the wake of a breach of the Official Secrets Act, whereby sensitive information was leaked to a Sunday newspaper prior to the Presidential election leading to the high profile arrest of a special adviser, the person's subsequent release and to a decision by the Attorney General and the DPP in the past ten days that there is no evidence against the person, is the Garda investigation ongoing?  Is he confident that the guilty person will be brought to trial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no ongoing investigation into the matter.  The Garda believed they had a case but the DPP did not uphold it.  As the DPP is independent, the case fell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Does the Taoiseach not realise this was a matter of major concern last October which he said had the potential to shake the very foundations of the State?  The matter remains unresolved.  It is clear that somebody leaked the documentation in question.  Has the Taoiseach sought a report from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner on the matter?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is now asking a question which does not relate to the content of his original one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> When did the Taoiseach receive the report in question and did it make any reference to the issues I have just raised by way of supplementary questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no role in regard to decisions made by the DPP and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on such decisions. I understand the Garda made a comprehensive <Col N="790" /> report to the DPP following their investigations, a report which they obviously felt would stand up. However, the DPP decided not to proceed with the matter and it subsequently fell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Does the Taoiseach not realise that a serious issue remains outstanding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer the Deputy did not pursue this line of questioning. His question refers specifically to the procedures which are in place for the protection of classified information.  I would ask him not to raise matters not contained in his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> In view of the fact that the very initiative which we are discussing constituted the genesis of the report presented to the Government in regard to the leaking of official information, it seems strange that it cannot be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other means by which the Deputy can raise the matter in the House.  However, he may not do so under this question.  I am obliged to adhere to Standing Orders and there have already been two unrelated supplementary questions to the original question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated he has the report in his possession.  When did he receive it and have any of its recommendations been backdated? Does the Taoiseach intend writing to former members of Cabinet asking them to return documents for safekeeping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I wrote to all former Ministers and Ministers of State asking them to ensure that any information they retained on leaving office was kept in a secure place.  I thank the Ministers, Ministers of State and parliamentary secretaries who replied. Some people asked about the possibility of such documentation being kept in a library in Government buildings in order that it would remain accessible.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I had a meeting with Sinn Féin on Thursday, 23 April and again on Friday, 1 May.  We discussed follow-up to the Multi-Party Agreement, with particular reference to the referenda on 22 May. We did not discuss the issue of the disappeared on these occasions.  I have repeatedly made clear to the republican movement my views and feeling on this matter.  I will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also met over the weekend with Prime Minister Blair.  He and I discussed the positive reaction to the Multi-Party Agreement and how best to maximise the support for it in the forthcoming referenda.  The Prime Minister and I remain fully committed to doing whatever is necessary to ensure the success of the process.  I have no plans to visit Northern Ireland in the near future but <Col N="792" /> I will avail of any suitable opportunities as they arise.</P>
    <P>The Government's primary objective is to maximise the support of the people for the Multi-Party Agreement.  Once the referenda have passed, implementation of the State's commitments arising from the Good Friday Agreement will be closely overseen by the Government, particularly the Ministers most closely concerned, that is myself and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Officials of all relevant Departments are already focused on the issues.  There are specific timescales for particular matters set out on the Agreement and these must and will be adhered to.</P>
    <P>In relation to specific steps being taken to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions on the island, I remind the Deputy of the Government's commitment in relation to the First World War Memorial at Messines in Belgium and of the interdepartmental committee, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is examining the development of the site at the Battle of the Boyne.  It is envisaged that concrete steps will be taken on foot of both these initiatives within the short term.  The scope for further steps is being considered in a positive spirit.</P>
    <P>Distribution of copies of the Good Friday Agreement to households throughout the country is progressing well.  Some 1.4 million copies have been printed.  Distribution began on Tuesday, 28 April and will be completed by Friday, 15 May at the latest.</P>

      <P>When was the last time the Taoiseach raised the question of the disappeared with the political parties which are close to paramilitaries, Sinn Féin and the loyalist parties?  The location of the bodies of the disappeared is one issue which would help heal the deep wounds in Northern Irish society.  This is an issue on which the parties referred to could use their influence to seek to have the bodies recovered.  In relation to the commitments in the Agreement, in particular the legislative commitments, is the Taoiseach co-ordinating the various Government Departments' response to those commitments?  I refer in particular to the commitment to ratify the Council of Europe Framework Convention for national minorities to establish a human rights commission to implement and enhance employment equality legislation and to introduce equal status legislation? How soon can we have a timetable for the introduction of those measures?</P>

      <P>Just a few weeks ago &mdash; I cannot recall the precise date &mdash; at the end of March or early April the relatives of the disappeared came to meet me and may also have met other Members.  I had a lengthy discussion with them and got much detail about particular cases.  Following that meeting I took up the named cases which date back to the 1970s.  These are harrowing cases. Three or four of them were raised by the mothers <Col N="793" /> of young men.  I promised them I would seek whatever information I could and try to follow them through.  I took up those particular cases.  In the past I had taken up several cases but not of named people.  I will continue to raise those cases and hope I will receive some feedback.  There is contact with the republican movement about some of these cases but my information is sketchy and is not sufficiently authoritative to put before the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second question, as of now and until after the referenda my officials and the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be involved.  At this stage I have gone through the agreement and, where we have given firm commitments, I am co-ordinating what we must do, how we can do it and a timescale and process for benchmarking these commitments and ensuring they are fulfilled.</P>

      <P>Is it the Government's policy to raise the location of the disappeared with so-called Republican prisoners, who have either been transferred from the United Kingdom to this jurisdiction or who have been released, or the organisations of which they purport to be members &mdash; as distinct from Sinn Féin which diplomatically disclaims a formal connection?  In the course of the dialogue the Government will have with regard to the release of such prisoners, will specific information with regard to the location of the disappeared be a factor in the consideration of those releases?  The Government does not have responsibility for loyalist paramilitaries but does the Taoiseach not agree that any such step taken by the Irish Government should be replicated by the British Government?</P>
      <P>Mr. Gerry Adams has repeatedly stated that this is a matter for the paramilitaries and not for Sinn Féin.  The Irish Government has paramilitaries from the Nationalist side in custody and they would be a primary source of information since they are members of an organisation which knows in most cases where the disappeared are located.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that some form of information, even if it is inconclusive, should be communicated to the relatives?  Would he consider that constructive in the process of creating the climate of peace and reconciliation which is clearly necessary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know the prisoners are asked if they and the organisation with which they are involved are removed from involvement in violence and whether they will return to violence and on their reassurance the prisoners are released under licence.  However, such questioning is a possibility with regard to trying to find the whereabouts of the disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the limited checks I have been able to make, I am aware it is not necessary that people get this information.  There are many circumstances surrounding this issue which are too gruesome to discuss here.  Some of the cases date from <Col N="794" /> 20 to 25 years ago.  In more recent cases, information has been forthcoming and some progress has been made.  However, most of the cases being pursued by the disappeared action group date from the 1970s.  If information is available at any level it is our obligation to pursue it.  Before I got involved in this issue I thought it would be easier to pursue particular information but it is not that simple.  Some of the people who were involved in active units during the 1970s are themselves long dead or vanished and the information, unfortunately, is not as easy to get as I thought.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach join me in welcoming the decision announced today by the Ard Chomhairle of Sinn Féin that it will recommend a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote to its Árd Fheis which resumes on Sunday, 10 May?  Will he also agree that it is essential that delegates to the Árd Fheis and supporters of Sinn Féin, North and South, recognise that the success of the Agreement, to which the Taoiseach's negotiating skills were central, depends on the integrity and entirety of the Agreement being accepted?  It cannot be cherry-picked. One cannot selectively identify the bits and pieces with which one agrees.  In coming days those who contemplate supporting the Agreement must recognise, as the Taoiseach has said on a number of occasions in public, that the integrity of the entire Agreement must be respected, otherwise progress will not be made.</P>

It might be more helpful, therefore, if I say as little as possible.  As I have said endlessly, the Agreement cannot be changed at the edges or interpreted in a flexible, vague or ambiguous way.  It has to be dealt with on that basis.  That applies to everybody.  On examination, those who saw difficulties with the Agreement early on now see that it is balanced and can deal with age old difficulties.  It is important to convince the electorate of this and ensure there is a high turn out.</P>

Will he also agree that the higher the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote the greater the authority and the greater the risk to be taken by any group which may seek to challenge the decision?  On &ldquo;the disappeared&rdquo;, will the Taoiseach agree in relation to confidence building measures that so far it has been a one way process and that this would be a major contribution by the republican movement to confidence building?  Would he agree that a harder line should be taken in this matter?  It is a human rights issue.  Maybe we could enlist the support of some of our friends elsewhere, particularly in the United States.</P>
      <P>One of the missing persons was particularly well known to me.  That person disappeared within this jurisdiction and the likelihood is that the body remains within this jurisdiction.  Perhaps progress could be made in relation to that case. We want progress in relation to all 13 people who have disappeared.</P>

      <P>On the face of it, some of the investigations seemed simple enough and we thought there must be somebody who knows the information, but it is not quite so simple.

      <P>I agree with Deputy Currie on the issue of the vote.  The stronger the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote, both North and South, the stronger it will be for the institutions that will arise from the Agreement. Since the general election of 1918 different republican groups have believed they have a mandate for violence from that vote.  They have interpreted it that way and people are familiar with the arguments.  While Members of this <Col N="796" /> House have argued about it for as long as the House has been in existence, people have tried to use that vote as some kind of a mandate.  Republicans have felt strongly about it through the years. It is not a fair interpretation of what people did in 1918 but it has been used as such since that time.</P>
      <P>This is the opportunity.  For the first time since then, on a single vote and a single issue, people will have a chance of giving their answer to that argument, if there was any validity in it, concerning the vote of 1918.  It was an act of self-determination and I do not accept any argument to the contrary.</P>
      <P>On 22 May, people of all persuasions and denominations, North and South &mdash; including those who believe in the union with Britain, those who believe in a united Ireland and those who will not be pushed either way &mdash; will have an opportunity of giving their verdict on violence. The rest of the world will be watching.  The importance of a huge &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote is that the rest of the world will see this is the view of the people on this island that has been scarred so much by violence though the years.  There is a danger if people are apathetic about this.  It is not good enough to pray, march and articulate the case for peace if, when one gets an opportunity of voting for it, one does not do so.  The pressure is on all of us to ensure that people turn out and sincerely show that the way the vote of 1918 has been used and abused by people will end.</P>
      <P>We already know there will be groups who believe we are all wrong and that they know it all.  They will continue their violent ways.  It is important for us to be able to say that their mandate is effectively non-existent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with what the Taoiseach has said.  However, has he taken the opportunity of asking the leaders of the republican movement, face to face, why the mandate from a vote on this island &mdash; organised by an Irish Government, which they now recognise, in this part of the island, and organised by another Government in the other part of the island &mdash; is considered less than that from a vote organised in 1918 by a British Government in control of the whole island?  What is the logic of saying this vote is a lesser mandate than that in 1918?  It seems entirely illogical.</P>

That was an act of self-determination and it has been internationally recognised as such.  The logic of their argument does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>

      <P>In my previous replies to the House on the work of the National Centre for Partnership, I outlined the aims and work programme of the centre.  Since March, when I last updated the House, progress has been made in a number of areas.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of important developments in the public sector.  In the Civil Service, the Department of Finance and Civil Service unions have now agreed on the role and constitution of partnership committees for each Department.  These committees will comprise management, trade union and staff nominees. One of their first tasks will be to develop modernisation programmes for various Departments and offices as set out in Partnership 2000.  My Department has now set up its committee and it is expected that other Departments will do so shortly.</P>
      <P>The National Centre for Partnership, in conjunction with the Centre for Management Organisation and Development in the Department of Finance, has also begun preparation of training materials for those involved in the partnership process.  The materials will cover such areas as public sector change, joint problem solving, consensual decision-making and communications.</P>
      <P>The centre is also providing facilitation services to public service organisations in the local government and health sectors where unions and management have decided to develop their own partnership system.  A number of commercial semi-State bodies are also interested in this process and have asked the centre to assist them by providing advice, information and facilitation.  In the private sector, the first of a series of briefing conferences for employers, trade unions and employee representatives is currently being planned and will take place next month.  It is also planned that similar conferences will take place in other parts of the country during the remainder of the year.</P>
      <P>It is also envisaged that the first National Centre for Partnership bulletin will be produced shortly.  This is aimed at chief executives, human resource managers and trade union officials and will contain examples of best practice and also general information on partnership.  The centre has an important role to play in facilitating and developing partnership.  It will continue to have my support and encouragement in its endeavours.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that, while there has been reasonably good progress on the public sector side of the activities of the <Col N="798" /> National Centre for Partnership, the same cannot be said for the private sector side?  Will he outline what steps, if any, he intends to ensure the centre will take to intensify the private sector side of the debate?  Are there plans to house the National Centre for Partnership in a location other than in the midst of Government Buildings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn already raised that issue with me.  The National Centre for Partnership has opted to remain in its office.  It has no contact with my Department other than having an office there for a small number of staff.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right that there is more activity on the public sector side and that we are concentrating on driving that forward.  I hope the briefing conferences and seminars and the publication of the centre's bulletin will help the private sector side.  It has evolved over the past ten months since its establishment.  It did not get its full staff until the autumn.  They have put together a pack on best practices in developing partnerships in the private or public sector.  We in the public sector can push the agenda, which we are doing, but we also need people in the private sector to come on board.  People should be conscious that this is a commitment in Partnership 2000.  That is why I emphasised the bulletin's approach.  It is aimed at senior management and human resource managers to ensure they realise the considerable benefits senior executives can gain from this process.</P>

      <Quest>his immediate and long-term policies for dealing with the high levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and lead in Dublin and Cork, as a consequence of increased traffic levels; the response the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, gave at the EU Council meeting in Brussels on 23 March 1998; when this matter was discussed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a significant growth in road traffic volumes in Ireland in recent years and this is giving rise to increases in journey times in peak urban conditions. While there are obvious implications for urban air quality, monitoring data show that overall air quality is generally good and all mandatory national and EU ambient standards, including in Dublin and Cork, continue to be met. Air quality management planning is a local authority function under the Air Pollution Act, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under EU Directive 96/62/EC regarding ambient air quality assessment and management, a proposed subsidiary directive relating to limit <Col N="799" /> values for sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air is under discussion in the EU Council of Environment Ministers and the European Parliament. During an open debate at the Council meeting on 23 March 1998, I indicated that Ireland supports the proposal, but acknowledged that the proposed limit value for NOx and PM 10 especially will be challenging in some heavily trafficked urban areas.</P>
    <P>Measures already taken, such as the bans on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal in Dublin and Cork and the promotion of the sale of unleaded petrol, have made significant contributions to reduced levels of SO 2 and lead in the atmosphere.  I am satisfied we are well placed to meet the stringent standards proposed for these pollutants.</P>
    <P>The thrust of policies within the EU since 1970 regarding emissions from motor vehicles has been, and continues to be, based on vehicle type approval and emissions standards.  Successively more stringent standards for passenger and goods vehicles have been laid down and Ireland continues to comply with all EU vehicle emission control directives.  Ireland also continues to support the developing EU auto oil programme as an appropriate means of addressing many of the environmental issues arising from vehicle emissions. The programme will introduce further measures to reduce emissions from vehicles as well as more stringent fuel standards to apply from the year 2000 and later from 2005.  These will assist in meeting the proposed new limit values for NOx and PM 10.</P>
    <P>Traffic management strategies for the major urban areas, including Dublin and Cork, have regard to environmental factors.  Major road improvements for these areas are also designed to bring benefits in terms of environmental quality. Local measures such as the Dublin Transportation Initiative and traffic management measures elsewhere, the improvement of public transport, the promotion of other alternatives to the private car in major urban areas and the extension of compulsory vehicle testing will assist in the response to urban traffic increases and associated vehicle emissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise the Minister of State I will not refer to him as &ldquo;Minister of State, Danny Morrison,&rdquo; as the chairman of the environment committee recently did.  Will the Minister of State tell me if he is disappointed action to reduce on street vehicle emissions in Dublin has been deferred even further by the Government's crazy decision on the Luas?  Although the Minister of State claims air quality in Dublin and Cork is generally good, will he indicate what has been the trend in the concentrations of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, lead and particulate matter in the air in those two cities in any recent period?  Will he confirm the trend is for the concentrations of those substances in the air to increase?  Will he <Col N="800" /> indicate whether he is satisfied we have a sufficient number of sampling points in those two cities to be sure we have a reasonable picture of the concentrations of those substances?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We must recognise that because of the unprecedented success of our economy there has been a large increase in the number of vehicles on our roads in the last decade. The number of private vehicles has increased from 700,000 to one million in that time and it is estimated that number will increase to 1.6 million by the year 2010.  The increase in the number of people using private vehicles has environmental consequences.</P>
      <P>We have made progress in reducing vehicle emissions because of improved technology in motor vehicles and new initiatives in the transport area.  Our approach to dealing with this problem is progressive.  Because of the unprecedented level of development there is a problem in this area.  However, I emphasise air quality throughout the country does not breach any national or international standards; it complies with EU standards.</P>
      <P>We support the proposed EU directive under negotiation, on which I had the opportunity to speak at a recent EU meeting, because we believe it is the right approach.  From 1970 we have complied with EU standards in this area and I am confident we will be able to do so in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State did not answer any of the questions I put to him.  I ask him again to confirm that the concentrations of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, lead and particulate matter in air in the cities of Dublin and Cork in recent years has been increasing.  I am not challenging the fact that, as he stated, we comply with EU standards.  I want to know if I am right in understanding that the concentrations of those substances in the air in those two cities are increasing.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that the number of sampling points for taking air samples in Dublin and Cork is sufficient for us to be sure we have a proper picture of the air quality of the two cities?  In my opinion we do not have enough sampling points and, therefore, we cannot be sure that we are getting a proper picture.  I ask the Minister of State to reply to those two questions instead of giving me another statement of general principles.  Will he indicate if in the context of the challenging proposals he is proposing to support in the new European Union directive, on which I agree with him, the Government intends to take action of any concrete kind to reduce the overall level of vehicle emissions in Dublin and Cork for a start by taking any action that will affect the volume of motorised traffic on the streets of those two cities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The monitoring of air quality in an area is a matter for the local authority concerned. The Government is very conscious of this <Col N="801" /> problem and has a policy on this area.  Its policy includes improved vehicle technology implemented in type approval of vehicle emission standards, greater investment in and use of public transport, better integration of public and private transport, better interaction between transportation and land use planning, better traffic management and management of the demand for road use, mandatory vehicle testing from 1999 and promotion of cycling and walking.  I believe that in all of these areas there is an opportunity in the wider community to participate in relation to the whole environment.  I do not believe there is a particular sector on which the responsibility falls with regard to how we go forward on the environment.</P>

      <P>The restoration programme for county roads is fully on track for completion by 2005, that is, within the original ten year timeframe.  As I indicated at the launch <Col N="802" /> of the non-national road grants in February 1998, the total national bill to eliminate the backlog of surface restoration and road reconstruction works is estimated at £755 million from the beginning of 1998.  This sum, subject to ongoing adjustment for inflation, is accordingly required to complete the restoration programme.</P>
      <P>The 1998 provision for restoration improvement works stands at a record £94.7 million compared with £70 million in 1997 and will fully maintain progress in relation to the timeframe and budgetary requirements of the programme.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Has he any mechanism to update the Ove Arup report outlining the total work to be done in restoring non-national roads, which he would have received at the end of last year?  Is there a constant evaluation of road conditions?  I am particularly conscious of the horrendous weather which most counties have endured through this very wet winter.  Can we depend on the data which was gathered many months ago to be the definitive indicator of county road needs or is there an ongoing evaluation to ensure that the 2005 deadline is achieved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There will obviously be a need to continue to monitor the needs of the programme. The Deputy, who as Minister commissioned this report, recognised the need to have at least a baseline study from which to work, but it is the intention of the Department that we will continue to monitor needs on an annual basis.  We will continue on the basis of submissions made to us from local authorities, which are good at keeping us informed of their needs, as the Deputy knows from his experience in the Department.  Through the use of the rolling five year programmes, initiated a number of years ago by the Deputy, we will be monitoring that and using it as a yardstick also.  I accept the Deputy's point that there is a need to monitor continuously to ensure that the programme is kept up to date and that any necessary extra expenditures are provided for.  I intend to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister put anything in train to ensure that local authorities contribute a reasonable portion of their own resources to match State grants?  Is there a disincentive for local authorities to come up with such moneys? In other words, are those which do not allocate such moneys still getting the maximum possible grant?</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular difficulties endured at individual locations as a result of storms, will there be a separate fund or separate recognition of the needs of local authorities where catastrophic damage has been done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear in letters to the local authorities that I expect that the own resources element of any roads funding will continue and increase at least in line with inflation.  I <Col N="803" /> have underlined that.  While I have not spelt this out, I have the opportunity now to spell it out.  It is something I have checked and taken up in a number of local authorities on my visits.  Where my information was that they had decreased the amount of money, I made it quite clear that if they start reducing the amounts of own resources I will start reducing the amount which they receive from the Department on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. I am making that quite clear.  I do not want a recurrence of the previous situation.  The Deputy might have had some experience &mdash; his predecessor certainly did &mdash; of instances where increased funding was allocated to local authorities and they reduced their own funding almost proportionately.  Local authorities are committed, by and large, to an improvement in their county roads structure and they must provide some of the funding themselves.  I do not want to see that diminishing.  Anywhere I find it is diminishing, they will suffer accordingly.</P>
      <P>With regard to storm damage, it depends on one's definition of catastrophic.  We occasionally see catastrophic storm damage in continental Europe.  There was some serious storm damage in various parts of this country over the past couple of years.  However, it has been the practice, one which I have continued, that local authorities hold a portion of the roads allocation they receive for unusual circumstances as a contingency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>They may never do it, but I decided &mdash; again my predecessors followed this practice &mdash; to allocate all of the money because there is a relatively short period of time in which local authorities can spend it.  It would not be wise to start taking some of the money which we are allocating and laying it to one side in case something happens.  I urge local authorities to have some money left for contingencies such as this, but I do not propose to lay aside any special money for those kinds of circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Roads Authority is responsible for the signage and delineation of the national roads network. The specific provision made by the NRA for these purposes in 1998 is £4.35 million or 1.5 per cent of the total budget for improvement and maintenance of national roads.  The provision and maintenance of signage and road markings on non-national roads is funded from local authorities' resources and from the discretionary improvement and maintenance grants made available by my Department.  As these expenditures are discretionary, subject only to general conditions and guidance set out in my Department's Memorandum on Grants for Non-national Roads, 1996-99, there is no specific information available in my Department on the amounts or percentages expended locally on road markings and signage.  My Department's guidance, however, draws attention to the need to provide adequate traffic signs, including roadway markings, on non-national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this question because I am conscious of the poor quality of road signage and markings.  A tourist guide book advises tourists not to trust Irish road markings and signs because there is no guarantee of where they will end up. This should not be treated as a joke because it is a reflection on Ireland, which has one of the fastest growing economies in Europe.  We have visions of tourists looking at maps as they approach roundabouts and losing direction.  Will the Minister carry out a national survey to find out the inadequacies of the present system compared to the system of our European partners?  Will he make available adequate funding to local authorities to deal with this matter?  I am particularly conscious of the quality of material used in signage, which was specified in the 1950s.  That was adequate for roads in the 1960s and 1970s but it is not good enough today when there are wider carriageways and major roundabouts.  The quality of road signage needs to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The standards that apply are those set out in the traffic signs manual published in December 1996.  That manual, which was circulated to all road authorities, provides a comprehensive guide to the provision of road signage. It gives full information on traffic signs and road markings and sets updated standards to ensure <Col N="805" /> road users are given clear messages in good time. This is a serious matter where lives are at stake and I fully accept the Deputy's point.  The traffic signs manual should be of specific interest to traffic engineers.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy is probably referring more to non-national than national roads.  In fairness to the National Roads Authority, which is often criticised in this House, it has had a good programme of signage and delineation in recent years.  It has completed signage on the M1, M2, M13, M14 and M15 and has substantially completed signage on the N3, N4, N8, N9, N10, N11 and N25.  Delineation is completed on the N1, N2, N3, N4, N8, N9, N10, N11, N13, N14, N15 and N25.  The full programme on the national routes is scheduled for completion by the end of 1999.  I accept there could be major improvements on non-national roads, but money for that work comes from the roads allocation provided to local authorities.  Record grants of more than £200 million were provided this year, an 18 per cent increase on the previous year.</P>
      <P>This is a matter to which local authorities should give greater attention.  On foot of the Deputy's question I will issue a circular again asking them to put in place a plan to bring signage up to date within a reasonable period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>The specification of the National Roads Authority is substandard compared to that in Europe.  The same quality signage is not used here.  Is the Minister aware there is better quality signage available and will he consider that rather than the present specification which was introduced in 1950?  Given that we will have a Euro route in the near future, will the signage on that route be of the same substandard quality?</P>

      <P>The upgrading and maintenance of their rented dwellings is the responsibility of local authorities using their own resources and availing, as appropriate, of funding from my Department to assist authorities in their task.  These sources of funding are: the remedial works scheme &mdash; £192 million has been made available to local authorities to date, including £19.024 million in 1998, to assist them in carrying out major structural works to designated housing estates; and the bathrooms sub-programme &mdash; £16.5 million, including £500,000 in 1998, has been made available to assist local authorities in the provision of bathrooms-showers-toilets in their rented dwellings which lack such facilities.  Bathrooms may also be provided as part of larger refurbishment projects under the remedial works scheme; and the estate improvement programme &mdash; the programme, introduced in 1997 arising from the recommendations of the First Report of the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs, is providing £3 million over two years &mdash; £1.5 million in 1997 and £1.5 million in 1998 &mdash; to assist certain authorities in tackling environment and related problems in severely run-down urban housing estates and flats complexes in disadvantaged areas.  The objective of the programme is to eliminate or modify aspects of the design and layout of estates which are conducive to anti-social behaviour, carry out improvement work to enhance the living environment for tenants and establish improved estate management arrangements; the use with the Minister's specific approval of capital receipts from the sale of local authority houses towards certain once-off upgrading of housing in Dublin city and housing transferred from the corporation to the adjoining county councils.</P>
      <P>On improvements to private housing, a range of targeted measures is currently available to assist in the case of low income households or special category needs.  These include: the disabled person's and essential repairs grants schemes &mdash; £4.75 million is available for recoupments to local authorities in 1998; the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly &mdash; £5 million is available in 1998 compared to an outturn of £4.132 million in 1997; the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing &mdash; £1 million extra has been made available to bring the 1998 provision to £3.66 million to enable local authorities to improve or extend existing private accommodation of housing applicants instead of rehousing them in local authority accommodation; and local authority house improvement loans.</P>

Does the provision of £19 million not fly in the face of the statement made by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil on signing their programme for Government that the refurbishment of existing inadequate housing would be one of their key priorities?  Will the Minister of State not admit that the remedial works scheme is wholly inadequate because it refers substantially to housing schemes built before 1940 and that many inadequate housing estates were built in the 1960s and 1970s when he served as Minister for Local Government?

Is it his intention, by means of the examination to which he referred, to reconstitute the remedial works scheme because it is completely inadequate to deal with the scale of the problem?</P>

      <P>The remedial works scheme is satisfactory and I would be glad to entertain any applications received from local authorities. The works they have undertaken as part of the scheme have brought great comfort to 9,500 families.  Work is currently under way to bring greater comfort to approximately 6,000 families.  That extensive remedial programme is ongoing, and the amount being provided by the Government in 1998 is substantially increased on last year.  I have not had any complaints from elected representatives regarding any specific aspect of the way in which the scheme operates. If complaints have been made I will be pleased if they are brought to my notice.  My experience to date, however, has been that this scheme is working successfully.  It is expensive but the Government is committed to funding it and we will continue to keep it under review.  If the Deputy wishes to indicate to me specific flaws in the scheme, I will be pleased to hear from him about a specific case.</P>

      <P>Operation Freeflow and its successor, Operation Clearway, are operational strategies designed to improve road space and travel times in Dublin city pending the fuller implementation of the infrastructural and traffic management measures of the Dublin Transport Initiative. Operation Freeflow was launched in December 1996, originally to combat the traffic problems associated with the Christmas period.  The programme was drawn up and implemented by the Dublin Transportation Office in conjunction with Dublin Corporation, Dublin Bus and the Garda and was maintained during 1997 with an intensification of activity again concentrated on the Christmas period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1998, the Dublin Transportation <Col N="811" /> Office announced that a restyled Operation Clearway would operate outside the month of December and would concentrate on keeping Dublin's bus lanes and clearways fully functioning. Operation Freeflow would be targeted at the month of December each year.</P>
    <P>The wider programme of DTI traffic management measures is being advanced urgently and its importance to the successful construction and operation of Luas is well acknowledged.  Some £14 million has already been expended on the provision of quality bus corridors, environmental traffic cells, cycle ways, traffic calming and other traffic management improvements in the wider Dublin area.  Investment in this traffic management programme has been increased in 1998 and will continue at a high level in 1999.  Executive responsibility for co-ordinating traffic management measures in Dublin city is now concentrated in the new Office of the Director of Traffic, Dublin Corporation, who is developing a range of initiatives in line with this mandate.</P>

When does he believe the construction of Luas will begin and, consequently, what resources has the Government made available for the traffic management solutions it envisages will be needed to ensure the city of Dublin does not come to a standstill during the construction phase of the project?  Who will be responsible specifically for the management of traffic during the construction phase of Luas?  Will it be the Director of Traffic or will the Minister take some responsibility to overview the various agencies that will be required to be managed to ensure the city centre continues to operate?</P>

      <P>In keeping with the jargon invented by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, last night, I hope the Minister tells us he is planning for a Macken Street Bridge &ldquo;plus&rdquo; because he knows Dublin needs a second bridge in addition to the Macken Street Bridge.  Could the Minister outline, even in the most sketchy fashion, what kind of strategy there is to deal with traffic problems? According to the famous cruciform diagram published last night, it is planned to build an underground station at St. Stephen's Green, another at an unspecified location in the city centre, which we presume will be somewhere in O'Connell Street, and another at Broadstone.  In the event that, instead of tunnelling between two of those points, it was found that the appropriate method of doing the job was to cut and cover, for how long would we need these emergency measures? What part of the &ldquo;plus&rdquo; has been allocated to the cost of dealing with that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The tunnelling, the laying down of tracks, routes and so on, is included in the £400 million plus.  I am not an engineer and I will not attempt to answer questions about the engineering aspects.  These will have to be fully detailed in an environmental impact statement and a particular procedure will have to be followed to ensure full public participation, whether it goes above or below ground.  I do not want to waste the time of the House by going back over the various measures that will be available to the director of traffic, but I will do so if the Deputy insists.</P>

      <P>Free-flow is about managing traffic.  With finite street space and an ever-growing amount of traffic it has limited ability to be effective in solving the city's problems.  Is the Minister aware of the latest traffic predictions from the DTO?  Has he any plans to put traffic reduction measures in place as soon as possible, given the inevitable delay in the Luas project? Traffic cells, on which much emphasis is being placed, can only facilitate public transport.  Without public transport they are pointless and cannot work.  Has the Minister any plans to use his influence with the Minister for Public Enterprise to ensure that Dublin Bus is resourced and equipped to deal with the consequences of the traffic reduction measures that need to be put in place immediately, prior to commencing the construction of Luas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Free-flow is only one part of the overall transport initiative.  There was provision in the transport initiative for regular reviews because the problem of increasing traffic levels was anticipated at the time of the commissioning of the report.  A review is currently ongoing.  I expect the resulting report to be finalised in the next month or so.  It will take into account the increased traffic and measures that may be needed to revise the strategy we have here.  In addition, in its mid-term review of the operational programme on transport, the EU requested a consultant's report in relation to road pricing and other mechanisms for the Dublin region.  Consultants will be appointed shortly to undertake that report.  They may come forward with ideas on management and traffic reduction measures. Traffic, particularly in the Dublin area, is increasing by leaps and bounds.  Travelling into Dublin this morning I noticed a car with a Dublin registration number of 30,000 which indicates the rather large increase in the number of cars in Dublin.  There are problems.  Traffic reduction <Col N="815" /> measures will have to be implemented in addition to other expenditure on the Dublin transportation initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose answering the four Private Notice Questions together.  Neither I nor the Government ignored the W.S. Atkins report.  It favoured the surface option in the short-term, but if a long-term visionary view of a light rail system for Dublin is taken, then part of that system should go underground.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the first phase of the proposed network comprises a surface line from Tallaght to Connolly Station, which is based on the CIE preferred alignment from Tallaght to O'Connell Street and is consistent with the surface option recommended by W.S. Atkins, a line from Sandyford to Ballymun and Dublin Airport using the old Harcourt Street and Broadstone railway alignments and with an underground section in the city centre linking these alignments.</P>
      <P>The underground section in the city centre is about 2.5 kilometres and will address two important issues raised in the W.S. Atkins report, namely, the scale of disruption during construction on key city centre streets &mdash; Lower O'Connell Street, Westmorland Street, College Green, Nassau Street and Dawson Street &mdash; and potential longer term capacity constraints in the central area as the network is extended.</P>
      <P>On the issue of funding, the Government agreed to the development of the light rail network for Dublin which I have already outlined. The Government also noted that the cost of the network had been estimated to be in excess of £400 million.  The House can be assured that appropriate funding arrangements will be put in place to deliver on this commitment.  As is the normal practice, the precise funding commitments for the project will be addressed as part of the normal budgetary process when the Government is preparing its annual public capital programme.</P>
      <P>The general question of private financing for infrastructure projects is being addressed by the Department of Finance with a view to early consideration of the matter by Government.  It would be prudent to await the outcome of that work before taking any decision on the scope for private financing of the light rail project.</P>
      <P>I have always made it clear that EU funding would not be the determining factor in making a decision on Luas.  My primary concern has always been to ensure that Ireland does not lose the EU funding involved and that objective will be achieved through the timely transfer of this money to other suitable projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be working to ensure that a reasonable proportion of the £114 million decommitted will be used to address public transport requirements. The Atkins report has highlighted a number of areas where investment is needed in transport infrastructure in Dublin.  My Department has also been working with CIE to identify projects on suburban rail, including the DART and Maynooth <Col N="817" /> line, where work could be undertaken by 2001.  The Department will now be entering into urgent consultations with the Commission on this issue.</P>
    <P>The light rail project as decided upon by Government yesterday will be submitted for EU assistance under the next round of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds, particularly in view of its integrated nature and the provision of a link in the first phase to Ballymun and Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>Regarding a timetable for the commencement and completion of the project, I will not tie myself or the Government to a timescale at this stage.</P>

When will commuters in Dublin have a reasonable or realistic prospect of an improved light rail public transport system in view of the Government's decision?

Does she accept she has agreed to kill off Luas and replace it with a wish list of pious aspirations without a plan, timetable, costing or even money?  She commissioned the Atkins report, which cost £200,000 in taxpayers' money, and gave a clear unequivocal promise in the House on 12 November and 16 December 1997 that regardless of what was in the consultants' report, it would be implemented.

      <P>My target date equates with that outlined in the Atkins report.  However, I cannot interfere with the democratic process. People are entitled to have their say before a judicial inquiry. <Col N="825" /> The expected cost of the project, which is entered into the Government decision, is £400 million plus.  The Deputy said it was unusual for a Government to make decisions without being aware of the costs involved and I agree.  The Ballymun decision did not have Government sanction.</P>

      <P>The project is a good one and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is fulfilling the objectives set out by the previous Minister.  However, the Government did not outline a specific amount of funding in its decision.</P>
      <P>I was asked if I could give a commitment that the £114 million EU money which was to be spent on Luas could now be spent on public transport in the Dublin region and Deputy Belton asked that the money be spent on public transport in rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to know whether the EU funding will be spent on alleviating traffic congestion in Dublin if it is not spent on Luas. Newspaper estimates of the cost of Luas have ranged from £600 million to £800 million.  Which of these does the Minister regard as being most realistic, particularly in regard to tunnelling which tends to involve escalating costs as evidenced by the port access tunnel to which she referred?  Can the Minister indicate a timescale for the construction of phase one of the project?  Which elements of the plan will be built first?  How will phase one break down in reality given that the Tallaght line seems to be little changed from the original proposal and could well be built immediately?  Will the Minister give a commitment that the elements of the project which are identical to the original proposals, or little changed from them, will be built in the near future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Two distinct lines have been identified, one running from Tallaght to Connolly Station and the other from Sandyford to Dublin Airport.  The lines will not intersect and will not have interchangeable rolling stock.  The Minister referred to all of these as phase one.  Is she seriously suggesting that these lines can be built simultaneously, with an underground system? <Col N="827" /> The reality is that choices will have to be made. What are those choices?</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister is anxious to offer something to everybody and does not want to deprive people in Dublin North but someone will be disappointed. The Minister said it would be possible to proceed with those elements of the plan which have been cleared.  That is meaningless.  Will the lines, such as the Tallaght one, be built and opened or merely built and left until the rest of the plan is completed?</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined a measurement of 2.25 kilometres for the tunnelling portion of the plan. As I see it, the figure is closer to three kilometres. The tunnelling will occur along a straight line from Stephen's Green to Broadstone and will go under Dublin Castle and Capel Street, completely ignoring the city centre.  Is that the Minister's intention?  Does she realise the tunnel will have to be twice as long if it is to cover the city centre? Will there be any stations along the length of the tunnel?  If so, where will they be and will they intersect with the east-west line?</P>

      <P>The tunnel will be 2.5 kilometres long.  I stated that if judicial reviews and preparatory work were completed, construction work could proceed on the relevant lines.  I am sure the Luas management group will appoint building contractors who will decide whether they will build simultaneously on all the lines.  I doubt that will happen.</P>

Will she have the honesty and the decency to admit that the Government has committed itself to a black hole of a tunnel under the city centre which it does not know how long it will take to build, how much it will cost and what problems may be encountered because no geological work has been done?  Dr. Phillips said today this may cost £1 billion.  This haphazard, bizarre fashion is no way to run Government business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On Saturday last in Brussels a number of truly historic decisions were taken. These concerned the countries participating in economic and monetary union, EMU, with effect from 1 January 1999; the presidency and board membership of the new European Central Bank; and the pre-announcement of the bilateral exchange rates of the currencies participating in the euro.  Few people could be surprised by the decisions because for some time we have had available to us the recommendations from various reports &mdash; the European Commission's, the <Col N="838" /> European Monetary Institute's and our own Central Bank's convergence reports.  We have also had the statements made by the Governments of a number of member states as to their intentions. However, the lack of surprise should not detract from the real significance of the decisions.</P>
      <P>It is important to be aware of the process involved in making these key decisions.  Ministers of Finance met on Friday, 1 May in ECOFIN and made recommendations as to participating countries. The European Parliament met on the morning of Saturday, 2 May and voted overwhelmingly in favour of the ECOFIN recommendations.</P>
      <P>It was at this point in the process that I and the other Heads of State or Government met, first informally and later in formal session, to consider the convergence reports of the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute (EMI), the recommendations of ECOFIN, the Parliament's opinion as to who should participate in the euro and the declaration on budgetary policy prepared by ECOFIN.</P>
      <P>The informal discussions which began over lunch, as was widely reported, also dealt with the issue of the presidency and membership of the European Central Bank board.  The key outcomes of both the informal and formal meetings by Heads of State or Government were: the approval of the ECOFIN recommendations that 11 member states should participate in the euro &mdash; Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain; the endorsement of the declaration on budgetary policy prepared by ECOFIN; and the reaching of political agreement as to the European Central Bank presidency and board.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it was the more predictable outcome as to participation and the content of the declaration that focused media attention on the only undecided area; that of the ECB board membership and the presidency in particular.  This was unfortunate because it tended to distract from the very substantial areas where agreements had been reached.  However, the scope of the agreements reached and the full involvement of all the key European institutions in them have ensured that last weekend will stand as an historic milestone on the road to a single currency.</P>
      <P>I extend my congratulations to Mr. Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch candidate and current head of the Economic and Monetary Institute, on his selection.  I wish him well in his new position.  He has indicated he is unlikely to serve the full eight year term.  I note also that it was decided that a French nominee should succeed Mr. Duisenberg and that the French Government has indicated its intention to nominate, at that stage, Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet for the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While no final decision on the ECB presidency was required last weekend, it was important that the matter should have been settled as soon as possible.  I am glad it has been agreed and that Finland, a country with a population not much greater than our own, is amongst the countries <Col N="839" /> represented on the board.  Finland has secured a position and, I hope will provide a voice for smaller countries.  While we will not be members of the first board, it is important that when the positions on the board fall to be filled in rotation early in the new millennium, Ireland will be in a position to nominate a suitably qualified candidate.</P>
    <P>The sequence of rotation is as follows; the vice president has a four year term and each of the four remaining members has a five, six, seven and eight year term.  These have been allocated to nominees from France, Finland, Spain, Italy and Germany, respectively.</P>
    <P>The preparations for economic and monetary union have been under way since the Maastricht Treaty of 1992.  Over the intervening years, substantial convergence in the planning and co-ordination of economic policy amongst member states has been achieved, with the rate of this convergence accelerating in recent years.  This has provided a generally stable economic climate in much of Europe.  Convergent and stable economic policies have allowed a relatively low inflation and low interest rate environment to prevail in many member states.  There is a danger we may take for granted this very real achievement. We have all been encouraged at the rigorous approach adopted across the Union by those countries wishing to participate in the euro.  The adoption of individual national programmes and budgetary policies designed to promote stability and sustainable growth must reassure those who have criticised the entire euro project, or questioned the ability or determination of member states to qualify for participation.</P>
    <P>Ireland's performance in reducing debt is note-worthy, as are the performances of many of our fellow participant countries.  It was a proud moment for me as Taoiseach and for the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to see Ireland selected as one of the founder members of economic and monetary union.  Qualifying for EMU was a significant national achievement and we comfortably met all the criteria.  We all remember a time when the chances seemed very slim that Ireland could comfortably meet a deficit limit of 3 per cent of GDP.  In 1989, we got our deficit down to below 3 per cent of GDP and we have kept it there ever since.</P>
    <P>Similarly, our debt ratio was once almost double the 60 per cent limit.  By the end of last year it was down to around 66 per cent and it will probably have fallen to around 60 per cent by the start of economic and monetary union on 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>From Ireland's point of view, last weekend provided a formal recognition of the economic progress that we have made and a recognition also of our determination to control inflation and put the public finances on a sounder footing.  It is not enough for Ireland to qualify for the euro; we must continue to observe the criteria and requirements in the Maastricht Treaty, the stability and <Col N="840" /> growth pact and the declaration approved at the weekend if we are to remain competitive and the economy is to continue its steady growth path.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the high level policy objectives set out in chapter 2 of Partnership 2000 remain essential.  These are: sufficient trust between the social partners to ensure an adequate information flow and burden sharing, and continuous efforts to strengthen the underlying competitiveness of the economy.</P>
    <P>The continued successful implementation of Partnership 2000 by Government and the social partners, and the strict adherence to its terms, are critical to the sustainability of our recent economic performance.</P>
    <P>The other key outcome of last weekend came from ECOFIN.  As widely forecast, it was also announced that the bilateral exchange rates of the currencies participating in the economic and monetary union will be based on their current central rates in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).  As the Minister for Finance made clear in his press statement at the weekend, the decision to use the ERM central rates is fully consistent with the economic fundamentals and convergence performance of the 11 member states involved.</P>
    <P>As to the benefits of EMU, we know from the ESRI and NESC reports of July 1996 and March 1997, respectively, that participation in EMU is in Ireland's favour and will bring economic benefits. The balance of advantage is now even more strongly in favour of Ireland's participation.  The statement issued by ECOFIN last Friday as to the benefits of the single currency said:</P>
    <P>The move to the single currency enhances further the conditions for strong, sustained and non-inflationary growth conducive to more jobs and rising living standards.  It eliminates the exchange rate risk among participating member states, reduces transaction costs, creates a broader and more efficient financial market and increases price transparency and competition.  It thus provides the decisive step for a truly single market.</P>
    <P>This extract captures succinctly the benefits to which we should look forward.  The decisions of last weekend allow us now to focus our attention on the practical steps necessary for the changeover to the euro.  This is an area which the Minister for Finance will address in detail in his response, but I commend him and his Department on the publication of the National Changeover Plan and on the establishment of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I also commend the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forfás and the major banks and business organisations for their efforts to prepare the business community for the competitive and practical opportunities and challenges which the euro presents.  With the decisions of last weekend behind us, the campaign to generate wider public and consumer awareness will gain momentum.  While the euro <Col N="841" /> notes and coins will not be available until 1 January 2002, the euro comes into effect from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes suggested that the decisions by Government as to participation in EMU are taken without any reference, or very little reference, to the potential effects on cross-Border trade and on the island economy.  The same was said when we joined the EMS in 1979.  It was not true then and is certainly not true on this occasion.  We would greatly prefer if the UK were to participate from the beginning.  That would help to facilitate and underpin steps towards creating a single island economy.  We are happy that the Prime Minister Mr. Blair's Government has given a firm positive orientation towards joining before too long.  However, it would not help towards building a strong island economy if we were to hang back from involvement in the single currency from the outset.</P>
    <P>The enhanced surveillance of the economic policies of all the member states and the agreed arrangements as to relations between the &ldquo;ins&rdquo; and &ldquo;outs&rdquo; will help to prevent competitive distortions between the member states of the Union sharing the single currency and those not yet participating in EMU.</P>
    <P>So long as the situation persists as between ourselves and the United Kingdom it will simply mean, so far as the transactions costs aspects are concerned, that there will be two currencies, as now, and that the gains from cutting out exchange costs will not be realised.  The trading relationship between North and South is becoming stronger all the time and I would not expect it to be affected adversely in any serious way during the few short years when we still have an exchange rate between us.</P>
    <P>I met the Prime Minister Mr. Blair in the margins of the European Council meeting and we reviewed the reaction to the Agreement reached in the Multi-Party Negotiations.  The Prime Minister and I welcomed the widespread support which the Agreement has received to date, both within political parties and, more widely, as expressed in opinion polls.  We reaffirmed that there is now an unprecedented opportunity for real change for the better in relationships on and between the two islands.  We called on everybody to focus on the prize of peace in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>We asked those who have not yet made up their minds on the Agreement to view it positively in this light and we challenged the Agreement's opponents to spell out their alternatives, or their view of the future in the absence of peace and stability.  We looked forward to a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendums, North and South, on 22 May and we pledged ourselves to doing everything necessary in this event to implement the Agreement as rapidly as possible and to realise its vision and full potential to the benefit of all the peoples of these islands.</P>
    <P>There are those who are actively seeking to undermine the Agreement by violence.  However, we cannot allow them to succeed.  The recent violence <Col N="842" /> underlines the need for an overwhelming &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 22 May to demonstrate beyond any doubt the people's support for peace and reconciliation and their total opposition to violence and intransigence.</P>
    <P>We are in a period of accelerating change within the European Union.  Simultaneous with the changeover to the euro, the negotiations under Agenda 2000 will take place.  It will be important that Ireland secures adequate transitional arrangements in relation to Structural and Cohesion funding.  We need to secure funding and to use it wisely.  The outcome as regards the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy must fully protect our interests.  In view of the challenges presented by both the Single Currency and Agenda 2000, it will be important that sound economic policies are pursued which augment our existing economic and social infrastructure. Government and social partner co-operation in the formulation and implementation of a new national development plan will be essential. Last weekend was a major success for Ireland.</P>
    <P>It provided a recognition of our standing among our EU partners and secured our place at the core of the Union and our part in its future economic development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance on sharing with their European colleagues in the successful launch of the Single Currency last weekend in Brussels.  I also pay tribute to my party leader, Deputy John Bruton, and to the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, for the roles they played as Taoiseach and Minister for Finance and to their predecessors who did much of the preparatory work for Ireland's entry to the Single Currency.</P>
      <P>The decision to join the euro was ratified by the people in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.  It is appropriate, therefore, to recognise that they deserve praise for their contribution to this truly historic development.  By hard work and application, they have transformed the economy into a successful model for many countries in Europe.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger is the most overused cliché in political and economic debate, yet the prosperity and success we see all around us is real.  As we enjoy the good times, we must remember to move on from the self-congratulations and plan for the future.  The Irish National Competitiveness Council report, which was published six weeks ago, must be the basis for the future reinvigoration of the economy.  Ireland is a young country so we must commit ourselves to constant change if we want to remain vigorous.  Complacency will be fatal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be realistic about EU money.  Ireland cannot expect to get the same share of EU money as in the past if the Czechs, Hungarians and Poles are to be accommodated.  We can either choose to meet the challenge of changes in EU funding or we can be rolled over by them.  In the next ten years Ireland will rise or fall by its own efforts, <Col N="843" /> not by those made by anyone else.  Ireland will have to compete, sell better goods and provide better services than our competitors.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael set up the Irish National Competitiveness Council to advise on what we must do to compete.  We are determined that its first report will not gather dust.  If we do not act on this report, the Celtic tiger of today will become the mangy old beast ten years from now.  The report highlighted seven areas where Ireland is falling behind &mdash; Telecom internet charges, delays in planning decisions, insurance costs because of excessive court awards, ability in foreign languages, delay in paying bills, poor investment in vocational training and retraining and competition in the provision of public services.  Fine Gael has set a specific target for improvements in these areas in the next three years.  That is what Ireland must do to stay in front in the race for growth.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision announced in Brussels at the weekend that arrangements will be put in place to monitor the budget policy of every euro member state.  It is inevitable and desirable that when close co-ordination of economic policies is to take place among euro member states, they co-operate and share information about each other's budgetary strategies.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that at a time when the Government is committing itself to outlining its budgetary intentions for 1999, it is simultaneously embarking on capital expenditure projects as haphazardly costed as yesterday's Luas announcement.  It is hard to believe that the European Central Bank or the Council of Finance Ministers would allow any member state to cost a major capital project in terms of a base line figure with a plus added on which could be equal in magnitude to the original base line figure.  I hope the Minister for Finance tells us what he thought of the decision to add a plus to the figure of £400 million, what that plus means and if there will be pluses and minuses after all his budgetary figures in the future so that he has latitude.  It is hard to believe the Minister for Finance told the gardaí at the weekend and anyone else who asked for a pay rise that there was no money available, yet he can stand over a Government decision to add a plus to the figure of £400 million which might be equal to the original base line figure.  I find it difficult to reconcile yesterday's Government announcement with the commitment given by the euro member states to use any excess moneys in their Exchequers to reduce debt rather than increase spending or cut taxes.</P>
    <P>This example highlights the need for clear Government leadership on the economy.  The Government must act now to limit uncertainty with a clear statement of medium term economic and monetary policy.  It must agree with the social partners shock absorbers for the economy to deal with any turbulence arising from the operation of the euro.  With the pound euro exchange rate now locked, we are already in the euro.  We must be <Col N="844" /> ready to face pressures, which may be exceptional, for which economic shock absorbers may be necessary.</P>
    <P>In the past 30 years Ireland's normal growth pattern has diverged greatly from that on the Continent.  A study of the period from 1960 to 1993 shows only a 0.20 correlation between Irish and average European growth patterns compared to 0.63 correlation for Britain and 0.91 correlation for France.  Our economy could have different needs from some of the other participants in the euro.  Steps to cushion our economy against sterling volatility are also politically important because the impact of any divergence between sterling and the euro will be felt most acutely in the Border areas.  The Border between the Republic and the North, the German Danish border and the Swedish Finish border are the only currency land borders in the EU.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a small open economy which depends more than others on foreign investment to create and maintain jobs.  If we are to protect our record levels of job creation, we must have shock absorbers to spread the impact of any downturn through a system of wage flexibility which would also reward wage earners when things are going well.  Otherwise, the entire shock of any downturn would be absorbed through redundancies in a few exposed sectors.  Such a system incorporating profit sharing was negotiated by the last Government in Partnership 2000.  This Government has done nothing to advance those structural changes.</P>
    <P>We also need to develop a system of financing housing which does not extenuate shocks to household income when the going gets rough and interest rates rise.  Home ownership has been an achievable aspiration for many Irish families over the past five decades.  Proportionately twice as many Irish families as German families own their homes, but, on average, Irish householders have four to five times as much debt as their German counterparts and most of the debt is at variable interest rates.  Irish firms also tend to borrow more often at variable rates of interests whereas German firms tend to fund themselves through fixed rate bonds.  That makes Ireland much more vulnerable to interest rate changes.</P>
    <P>House prices in urban areas are continuing to spiral to a stage where couples on average incomes can no longer afford a house or, if they can, it will involve up to three hours commuting daily.  The Central Bank, in its spring bulletin, stated we are not far from the point where home ownership will be beyond the reach of persons on average incomes, and this Government will be in power when that happens.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are expected to fall by a further 2 per cent this year.  Unless the housing supply is increased, that will convert directly into increases in house prices, which will benefit those fortunate enough to invest in property, but will kill the dream of home ownership for many of our people.  The Government has promised action and we await the outcome of its proposals. However, the Government's piecemeal tinkering <Col N="845" /> response appears to be cosmetic and is unlikely to make any real difference to those anxious to buy a home at a reasonable and, more importantly, affordable price.</P>
    <P>The issue of bank charges will also become a major political issue in the early years of the use of the euro.  In practice, the punt and the euro will operate in parallel for a while and people will need to be able to change cash freely from one form into another.  If the banks impose a charge each time that happens, that could be exceptionally oppressive for households.  The Government should make it clear it will not allow banks to impose charges for changing euros to punts and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>We must recognise the transfer to the euro is logistically a very difficult operation for everyone who deals in money.  Major investments of time and equipment will be necessary.  This must be undertaken at the same time computer programmes are adjusted for the year 2000 problem. The Government needs to give a strong lead to small businesses stating the steps that must be taken and estimating the amount of money and time that will have to be set aside.  The Government cannot be a spectator in this process, it must be a participant.</P>
    <P>The Government must also take steps to address the findings of a new survey that reveal Irish companies are lagging behind firms in Germany, France and the Benelux countries in their preparation for EMU.  Perhaps the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance who were busy attending 11 hour lunches and participating in the euro launch did not see that survey which was published last weekend.  It found 65 per cent of German firms and 53 per cent of French firms consider themselves prepared for EMU.  That compares with 50 per cent of Irish firms and 37 per cent of British firms.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has supported Irish policy to join the euro since it was decided at Maastricht by the Irish Government.  However, we are lacking a coherent economic policy and logistical follow up by the Government of the type that could give real confidence.  Economic and monetary union is, in the final analysis, a political project.  It is happening because of political will.  Its purpose is to bind Europe's countries so closely together that they will never again come into conflict with one another as they did so disastrously twice this century.  The undignified squabble over who should hold the post of president of the European Central Bank was a less than auspicious start, but I hope more mature approaches will prevail in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    <P>It is right that Ireland should participate in this vital project.  As the euro's only English speaking member, we will have tremendous job opportunities in financial services.  We will also attract new investments, but we must recognise that political unity of purpose will be vital if the euro is to work.  Countries will not be able to dine <i>a la carte</i> at the European table anymore.  Europe needs to develop political institutions that have <Col N="846" /> sufficient democratic legitimacy to demand sacrifices of European peoples and to mobilise them for a common cause.</P>
    <P>The United States of America, the world's other great and successful currency union, has strong federal political institutions.  Europe has yet to develop in that direction, but it will have to do so.  A resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the Amsterdam Treaty referendum later this month will be important in putting a human face on Europe. The single currency debate focused attention on money in Europe, but we must not lose sight of the human values the money was being created to sustain, such as good and rewarding work, a clean environment and safe and healthy products in our shops.  The decision to join the single currency was a good one for Ireland and for Europe, but we must not lose sight of the many further steps we must take to keep our economy competitive and strong.  Any complacency would be fatal.</P>

      <P>I welcome the decisions taken in Brussels last weekend and I compliment the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance for the role they played in bringing this Act to a successful finish or to, what in reality, is a successful start.  I acknowledge the role played by my party leader, Deputy Quinn, when he was Minister for Finance in bringing us to the position in which we now find ourselves.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I very much welcome what happened last weekend.  We have long supported monetary union and all that goes with it, but we do not do so in a starry-eyed fashion.  We do so conscious that it presents economic challenges and threats as well as opportunities. In a sense, EMU is, and always has been, an economic challenge, particularly to peripheral countries such as Ireland, but it has also been, and still is, very much a political imperative.  It is a political imperative that flows from the Acts of the founding fathers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, that flowed as a seamless route through the 1970s and 1980s through the creation of the Coal and Steel Community, the Economic Community, the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty and, most recently, the Amsterdam Treaty.  It is something that has been borne out of the conviction in most of mainland Europe that we must never return to war, a conviction, particularly on the part of Germany and France, that the age old vision between those two countries, which has so often brought the Continent into division, should not happen again.  Even though we did not participate in those wars and have been peripheral to them, those of us, even of our generation, can appreciate this driving force and dynamic is something we must appreciate, participate in and, in every way possible, share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pure economic terms the EU is an appreciation by the French and by President Francois Mitterrand, in particular, that socialism in one country ceased to be a possibility in Europe quite some time ago.  That was a lesson those of us on the left learned the hard way, but it is one we <Col N="847" /> should never forget.  It was not possible to create an economic power such as France, the third or fourth largest economic power on the planet, and to create economic circumstances to use economic instruments in a fashion with which the markets disagreed.  The markets ultimately had a veto and they showed that to the French Government in no uncertain terms in the early 1980s.  If we want to reflate our economies, influence, for the good, what happens in the European economy, stimulate employment and invest in infrastructural development, we need to do so in a co-ordinated way which makes sense.  It is no longer possible and has not been for some time for any one of us to go it alone.  EMU is also a product of the realisation in Germany, particularly on the part of Chancellor Kohl, that for Germany to stay peaceably at the heart of Europe there was a need for it to be anchored in a way that was not going to change over the decades to come.</P>
    <P>In relation to the economic challenge, the report of the Commission produced a few weeks ago sets out the targets for EMU as being to revitalise the European economy and the Single Market, to foster investment, boost business competitiveness, benefit consumers and savers and make life easier for citizens where both work and travel are concerned.  If all of that were true or likely, then the case for EMU would be unanswerable; only time will tell.  The importance of confidence has been very clear over the past year and for some time before that.  Six months ago many of us felt it was likely the period before 1 May would be dominated by speculation on the currency markets, but that did not happen.  It did not happen because the markets formed the view that politicians were serious and that they were going to do the business.  The business was done and the markets were stable.  The markets today and yesterday have accepted that and, I hope, markets will continue to be stable.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union was based on five convergence criteria: price stability, debt-GDP ratio, current budget requirements, membership of the ERM and interest rates. However, what was clearly lacking were convergence criteria dealing with the real economy. There was no reference to growth or the lack of it or to employment or the lack of it.  We all know the political reality of why that happened. Some people would say, perhaps cynically, that these criteria were designed by the Bundesbank or perhaps by Germany generally to ensure that some countries did not participate.  In hindsight, I am glad the Germans got it wrong.  I believe that EMU broadly based with 11 countries is or will ultimately be a much healthier monetary union than one narrowly based on four, five or perhaps six economies in the centre of Europe.</P>
    <P>That is not to say we should not look in greater detail at the convergence criteria which did not apply.  Employment is important.  It is perhaps the single economic criteria which most impacts on the lives of Irish and European citizens throughout <Col N="848" /> the Union.  The Luxembourg Summit set targets or obliged Governments to set targets for employment and training between now and the end of the century.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment produced those targets just a couple of weeks ago.  The House will excuse me if I express a certain scepticism about the way in which those targets were produced and were presented by the Tánaiste.  I got no sense of mission, no sense that she had given this any great thought.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I got the feeling that a few bureaucrats were asked to put together targets which we would then present to our European partners and say we had complied with the requirements of the Luxembourg Summit.  For example, the plan to oblige people under the age of 26 to take a form of training or take a job is not researched.  We have not been given detail. We have not been given an indication that the Government has given it any real thought or has any real intention of implementing it.  Incidentally, I believe proposals of that kind have some merit if they are properly worked.  However, our experience with the local employment service has been patchy to say the least.  Employment is important and the Luxembourg targets should be taken seriously.  The contents of the Amsterdam Treaty dealing with employment must be taken seriously also but, regrettably, I see no indication from the Government that it is doing so.</P>
      <P>With regard to interest rates, all of us probably accept that we do not need lower interest rates in the current economic circumstances and that a reduction of 2 per cent or perhaps more than 2 per cent between now and the end of the year would not be a good thing in general terms.  I am interested that Spain reduced its interest rates by 0.25 per cent this morning or yesterday.  We are conscious of course that there is currently speculation that the Bundesbank will raise German rates.  I hope it does &mdash; I know it is conscious of what is happening in Asia and in the so-called peripheral economies in Europe &mdash; because this raises a central question about what happens after 1 January next and the way in which the European central bank sets interest rates.  Those of us in Italy, Spain, Finland and Ireland, where growth rates have been considerable for the past two or three years and interest rates are, and probably should be, higher than they are elsewhere, are entitled to expect that due weight will be given to the requirements of our economies, the non-core economy, and that the ECB decision making will not be dominated or dictated by the requirements of France and Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a sense perhaps we have been lucky.  Six months ago one might have said we were on a completely different economic cycle to the rest of Europe.  There are now some indications that the core economies are turning towards growth, that <Col N="849" /> things in France, perhaps in Germany and certainly in Italy are improving.  Perhaps in that sense we, in Ireland, have been very lucky, but I hope that there are in place mechanisms whereby Euro X and ECOFIN can in some way inform the decision of the European Central Bank.  I want to be clear about this.  I accept that the central bank should be independent in the strict treaty definition of the term, but I also believe that we must avoid a situation where six or seven extraordinarily powerful people make decisions entirely irrespective of the views of Finance Ministers in the Council of Ministers.  Let us face it, there is a sufficient democratic deficit in Europe already. We should not be in the business of creating a central bank which is entirely unaccountable and uninformed by the views of the people directly elected by the peoples of Europe either to their national parliaments or for that matter to the European Parliament.  In that respect, I agree entirely with what Deputy Owen has been saying.</P>
    <P>There are obviously particular difficulties for Ireland in the fact that the UK has decided at least for the moment to stay out.  The concern is not really with the current relationship with sterling but with what happens to the relationship when sterling inevitably begins to reduce in value. All of us accept that will happen sooner or later. All of us accept too that Britain will become a member of the EMU within a relatively short time and that has been clear from the utterances of the Chancellor Mr. Brown and the Prime Minister Mr. Blair in recent days.  I am encouraged by the comments of the Trade and Industry Secretary, Ms Margaret Beckett, over the past day or two when she has been counselling British industry to prepare even earlier for effective entry into EMU.  All of us expect that the euro will become a widely used currency in business and, for that matter, in peripheral areas of the UK such as Northern Ireland within a relatively short time.</P>
    <P>Over this past weekend we have voluntarily surrendered a measure of our economic sovereignty. We have voluntarily surrendered control over exchange rate policy and interest rate policy. We retain, broadly speaking, within our control two large instruments of economic policy: fiscal policy and a measure of flexibility.</P>
    <P>A few months ago few people were talking about tax harmonisation in a serious way but I have been struck over this past two or three weeks by the way in which tax harmonisation is suddenly central to the argument.  There is already a measure of harmonisation with VAT rates.  We are reducing corporation tax rates, and there is more and more influence on corporation tax by virtue of the ruling on State aids and investment.  However, it is quite clear that soon we will be talking of the harmonisation of income tax, for example.  This is something about which we must be extremely careful.  Budgetary supervision and co-ordination is a good thing.  I never really believed that it was important to keep all budget secrets until the day of the budget, and clearly that is becoming less and less the case. <Col N="850" /> Ironically, one of the reasons always given for keeping budget secrecy was that it could affect the markets.  We are about to abolish one of those markets, probably the one which was most susceptible to being influenced, namely the currency. Therefore, that argument no longer holds water. If the Minister is being required and has agreed with our European partners that he will flag to them the broad outlines and parameters of his budgetary policy, then surely we, in this House, need to consider a way in which we can make the process of budgetary decision making a good deal more transparent that it is currently.  I am talking about the process of the so-called Estimates campaign as well as the decisions on taxation which are taken on budget day.  If they are being flagged to the Commission in advance, then we need to develop a process in this House whereby that process becomes more accountable and transparent before the event so that we make real choices.</P>
    <P>The unseemly row about the presidency of the ECB does not matter a great deal.  Mr. Duisenberg will do a good job.  Mr. Trichet would have done a good job had he been appointed for the full eight year term too.  All we may have done is given those who want to be sceptical a reason to be sceptical.  Those who want to see that the bank is less than independent can now do so.  I am surprised and perhaps like everybody else I do not understand what the French were playing at.  I do not understand why they persisted with Mr. Trichet's candidature for so long.  There was never a real choice in the sort of policy which the central bank would pursue and that has not been influenced by the choice which has been made.  I am sorry in a sense the argument happened, but we can put it behind us quickly.</P>
    <P>I hope, as the Taoiseach said, that the presence on the governing board of a Finn, from an economy and country which shares many of our interests, will help us to express our view and interests at European level.  This is very much an economic challenge.  It presents threats to producers and opportunities to consumers.  It is very much part of a political project which all parties, except one or two, support, and I count the Labour Party among them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other speakers in congratulating the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach on our successfully joining EMU and on the process that took place last weekend. Deputy McDowell expressed doubt about what the French were about in terms of their argument for their nominee for the European Central Bank.  I suspect it related to the perception in France.  The French are strongly nationalistic and chauvinistic.  Joining EMU represents a significant derogation of sovereignty in financial matters and it seems the French were attempting to demonstrate that they would still retain significant control over the financial matters which in reality they are ceding to a large group of states which will share that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> A great deal of nonsense has been written and spoken about the weekend summit.  What was a fairly mundane event has been hyped into a macho arm-wrestling bout between France and Germany which has very little relevance in the real world as even the notoriously febrile financial markets have subsequently confirmed.  Most of it has been invented by a bored press, fuelled by so-called experts in the financial markets and Europhobes of the right and left who suddenly find the honour of the Bundesbank worth defending to the death.  The ultimate in silliness is the suggestion that this development justifies a &lsquo;no&rsquo; vote in the forthcoming Amsterdam referendum.</P>
    <P>It would have been preferable if the decisions were taken more efficiently and the long lunch avoided.  On a purely technical basis, however, it seems reasonable that Mr. Duisenberg should step down at age 72 and that he should be succeeded by the French nominee.  On the wider question, I am happy the French view prevailed, that it is clearly established that the operation of the future European Central Bank is a political question and that it answers to all the people of Europe, not merely to the financial markets and so-called economic &ldquo;experts&rdquo;.  I see this argument as part of the ongoing battle to correct the gaping flaw in the Maastricht Treaty which refused to establish any institutional democratic control over the Central Bank and refused to ensure that it takes account of growth and employment objectives as well as inflation and currency stability.</P>
    <P>We should not forget that Europe's recession of the 1990's, the longest and deepest since the war, has &ldquo;made in Germany&rdquo; printed all over it. That was brought about by Kohl's predictably disastrous absorption of Eastern Germany and the equally disastrous high interest rate policy of the Bundesbank in the first half of the decade. Those who believe that employment and social progress is the primary objective of economic and fiscal policy will have to take sides in the coming years.  The Progressive Democrats has long sided with the stockbrokers and central bankers, but perhaps Fianna Fáil will enlighten us on which side it is on.</P>
    <P>Away from all the hype surrounding the summit, the decisions which were taken will have pro-found consequences for Europe.  The formal sealing of the single currency project rather than closing the chapter instead underlines the necessity for other policy options to be assessed and complementary decisions taken.  A single currency area without the rapid evolution of corresponding political and economic structures will fail and almost certainly collapse.  The new regime which deliberately removes currency and interest rate adjustment mechanisms from national control cannot be managed by the economic and political instruments now available.  No matter what the neo-liberal gurus prescribe, the workers of Europe will not indefinitely acquiesce to ongoing <Col N="852" /> pay restraint as they see stock markets boom and inequalities widen.</P>
    <P>The issue of a Community budget appropriate to manage an area as integrated as Europe 11 now is, must be tackled urgently.  The proposal in the Commission's Agenda 2000 documents that the new single currency regime and up to ten impoverished central and east European states can be absorbed with a budget of less than 1.27 per cent of GNP by 2006 is madness.  Thus far the only voices raised against it, apart from the agricultural sector which always thinks that everybody else should make sacrifices for its benefit, are those countries such as Germany, Holland and Sweden who want more of their money back, presumably reducing the budget even further. These assumptions should not be allowed go unchallenged any longer.  It is the responsibility of those political forces committed to European integration as an agent of social advance to seek to change the thrust of the debate.</P>
    <P>Regardless of how this country will fare under the budgetary regime after 1999, it is vital to our interests that Europe continues to have the capacity to intervene for social objectives.  A budget appropriate to the powers and responsibilities of the newly established monetary entity is an absolute essential.  If after accepting the transfer of economic policy levers from the member states Europe shows itself incapable of intervening in the face of recession, unemployment and reduced living standards in areas of the Union, it will not be long before a disintegration process begins.  That the current pathetically inadequate Community budget will be unable to face these challenges is an infinitely more important issue than the weekend nonsense about the personality who will head the Central Bank in 2003.</P>
    <P>I will briefly address points about Northern Ireland referred to by the Taoiseach.  I welcome the further meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on the margins of the summit at the weekend.  Maximum co-ordination and co-operation between the British and Irish Governments is essential between now and 22 May.  The two Governments must speak with one voice in promoting the Agreement in both Northern Ireland and the Republic.  I hope all parties to the Agreement will note the joint statement issued after the meeting which said that it had to be seen &lsquo;as a single comprehensive package of many different elements which taken together require compromise on all sides&rsquo;.  This is a clear rejection of the notion that any party can cherry-pick elements of the Agreement, deciding to support what they like and reject what they find difficult.</P>
    <P>To ensure the Agreement has the fullest possible moral authority it is clearly desirable that it is approved not just by a majority in the Republic but also by a majority of both Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland.  I hope this can be achieved.  No effort should be spared by the two Governments and the parties to ensure a resounding endorsement of what offers the best <Col N="853" /> chance for peace in 25 years.  This is a time for democrats, North and South, to step together to bring the people of Ireland closer together in peace, democracy and partnership.</P>
    <P>The signs are positive.  Endorsement of the Agreement by a whole series of local authorities in Northern Ireland last night, including Belfast City Council and Ballymena Council, is a positive development.  Similarly the decision of the Sinn Féin Árd Comhairle to recommend a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on both sides of the Border and the Árd Comhairle motion for the Árd Fheis to allow its representatives to take their seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly, are important developments. Mr. David Trimble is entitled to enormous credit for the sound judgment and steady leadership he has shown since Good Friday.  He has remained resolute in his support for the Agreement, despite the internal difficulties he has faced within the Ulster Unionist Party.  All of these factors would suggest that the pieces of the jigsaw are falling into place, but there is no room for complacency.</P>
    <P>No reasonable person could disagree with the conclusion of the two leaders in their statement that the agreement is &ldquo;fair to both Nationalist and Unionist traditions&rdquo;.  The Agreement must be sold for what it is, not what some would like it to be.  It is a delicately balanced work, the end product of almost two years of intensive discussion, and it could be scuppered by ill-chosen words or triumphalist interpretations of it.  There is, as I noted at the weekend, no need to gild the lily, whether it be an orange or an Easter lily.</P>
    <P>There are many problems to be overcome, the most difficult of which will almost certainly be the decommissioning issue, but the commitments in the Agreement on decommissioning will have to be honoured.  The premature demand for decommissioning was allowed, for far too long, to become an obstacle to the opening of talks.  A refusal by the paramilitaries to face up to the decommissioning issue provided for in the Good Friday Agreement must not be allowed to obstruct its implementation when it has been endorsed by the electorates, North and South.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last weekend was most important from an Irish as well as a European point of view.  Of greatest importance is the fact that the Heads of State or Government confirmed the recommendations of ECOFIN Ministers that 11 member states, including Ireland, should adopt the euro from 1 January 1999.  The recommendations from ECOFIN to the Heads of State or Government were accompanied by the text of a joint declaration on budgetary policy.  The Heads of State or Government also reached a political understanding on the persons to be recommended as president, vice-president and the other members of the executive board of the European Central Bank. The ECOFIN Council then adopted the recommendation on these appointments.  Following consultation with the European Parliament and the European Monetary Institute, these nominations <Col N="854" /> will be confirmed by consensus of Heads of State or Government of participating member states before 1 July 1998, after which the European Central Bank starts functioning.</P>
      <P>ECOFIN Ministers also decided that the current ERM bilateral central rates of the currencies of the member states which will adopt the euro as their single currency on 1 January 1999 will be used in determining the irrevocable conversion rates.  ECOFIN adopted the joint declaration on budgetary policy, which went to the Heads of State or Government with the recommendations on which member states qualify for EMU, reflecting the existing framework of the Stability and Growth Pact and the Treaty.  ECOFIN also agreed a declaration noting the substantial progress made by Greece towards meeting the convergence criteria.  Finally, ECOFIN Ministers adopted various proposals on the legal aspects of the euro and noted Commission recommendations in respect of the practical preparations for the changeover to the euro.</P>
      <P>To review these significant decisions in turn, I am pleased that the Heads of State or Government were able to confirm that 11 member states should adopt the euro from 1 January 1999.  This decision was soundly based and made with the benefit of detailed convergence reports from the European Monetary Institute and the European Commission and on the basis of the recommendations of the European Commission and ECOFIN, with the opinion of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>As regards the decision on the composition of the executive board of the ECB and its presidency, these were obviously very important issues and I am very pleased that we now have arrangements in place for two eminently qualified candidates to take up in succession the position of president.  These arrangements are totally consistent with the provisions of the Treaty on European Union, and in particular regarding the independence of the ECB.  I must point out that Mr Duisenberg's wish not to serve the full eight year term is voluntary.  He said in his statement:</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that this is my decision and my decision alone and it is entirely of my own free will and mine alone and not under pressure from anyone that I have decided not to serve the full term.  Also in future the decision to resign will be my decision alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the appointments to this important position are resolved for at least the next ten years, and well after the early period of the ECB's existence, this important position will have a longer period of predictability than the eight year term envisaged by the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any concerns in relation to the credibility of the European Central Bank are totally without foundation since the framework established for it by the Treaty makes it one of the most independent central banks worldwide and makes it clear <Col N="855" /> that its primary objective is the maintenance of price stability.  I am confident that this arrangement will provide the euro with a credible basis for its existence as a strong and stable currency.</P>
    <P>To turn now to the decisions taken by ECOFIN Ministers, I am pleased that, as widely expected, ECOFIN Ministers announced that the current exchange rate mechanism bilateral central rates of the currencies of the member states which will adopt the euro as their single currency on 1 January 1999 will be used in determining the irrevocable conversion rates.  This announcement provides a clear message to the markets and, by eliminating uncertainty, will assist financial market stability in the run-up to EMU.  The decision to use ERM central rates is consistent with economic fundamentals and the sustainable convergence of the member states concerned.</P>
    <P>What this means for the Irish pound is that from the start of EMU on 1 January 1999 its bilateral exchange rate with all other EMU participants will be locked at the rates agreed last weekend. In line with the Treaty, the actual setting of the conversion rates of the participating currencies against the euro can only take place on 1 January 1999.  This is because the ECU is a notional EU currency which contains elements of currencies, such as sterling, which will not participate in the euro.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact, ECOFIN Ministers also adopted a joint declaration which reflects the existing framework of the Pact and the Treaty, agreeing to start to implement the regulation on &ldquo;the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and co-ordination of economic policies&rdquo; on 1 July 1998.  ECOFIN Ministers agreed to ensure that the national budget objectives set for 1998 are fully met, if necessary by taking timely corrective action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was also agreed that the ECOFIN Council would engage in an early consideration of member states' budgetary intentions for 1999 in light of the framework and objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact.  In addition, we agreed that if economic conditions develop better than expected, member states will use the opportunity to reinforce budgetary consolidation to reach the medium-term objective of government financial positions close to balance or in surplus, as embodied in the commitments of the Stability and Growth Pact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ECOFIN also recognised that the higher the debt to GDP ratios of participating member states, the greater must be their efforts to reduce them rapidly.  To that end, in addition to maintaining appropriate levels of primary surpluses in compliance with the commitments and the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact, other measures to reduce gross debt should be put in place.  Furthermore, debt management strategies <Col N="856" /> should reduce the vulnerability of budgets to adverse developments.  ECOFIN Ministers also undertook to submit, at the latest by the end of 1998, national stability or convergence programmes which will reflect these important elements.</P>
    <P>I was glad to agree to this declaration which makes sense from an EMU perspective.  It also reflects what was already being done in Ireland in respect of budgetary policy.  The Government's economic and budgetary stance is already in line with these commitments on budgetary policy. This stance, cited in the communiqué issued in Brussels on 14 March when the Irish pound's central rate was revalued, includes the elements of the revaluation itself, our budgetary policy for 1998 and 1999, and the Irish Central Bank's intention to continue its present monetary policy orientation which is aimed at price stability.</P>
    <P>As regards the legal aspects of the euro, the House will recall that two Council regulations will together form the legal framework for the use of the euro.  One of these was adopted last June; the text of the other was settled, but it could not be adopted until the identity of the member states participating in EMU was known.  Accordingly, ECOFIN formally adopted this second regulation at the weekend.  ECOFIN also formally adopted a regulation on the technical specifications of the euro coins.  Again, the text of this regulation had been settled some time ago.</P>
    <P>As regards the practical aspects, on 23 April 1998 the European Commission issued three recommendations relating to the introduction of the euro &mdash; on bank charges for conversion to the euro, on dual display of prices and on dialogue and monitoring to facilitate the transition to the euro.  ECOFIN welcomed the attention paid to these practical aspects, in so far as they support a voluntary approach to the questions of bank charges and dual display, while respecting member states' freedom to take whatever measures they consider necessary; and said the recommended standards of good practice can facilitate the transition to the euro in these areas.  The ECOFIN Council also noted the recommendation regarding monitoring of preparations and information provisions.</P>
    <P>There is a need for everyone to appreciate the extent to which we will be operating in a very different environment from 1 January 1999.  Our membership of the single currency is not simply a technical transition; it is a move to a new and more challenging environment.  In that environment, it is imperative for everyone to examine their strategies and structures and see how fit they are for the new Europe.  In doing so, we need to assess not just our weaknesses but also our strengths.</P>
    <P>Now that these decisions have been taken, the practical preparations for the changeover to the euro move to centre stage.  My Department has responsibility for co-ordinating the preparations of the Irish public administration and has a key role in helping the rest of the economy to prepare <Col N="857" /> itself for the changeover.  Much work has already been done in this area.  As long ago as 1995, my Department set up the single currency officers' team, which consists of a representative from every Government Department as well as from the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Central Statistics Office and the National Treasury Management Agency.  Its remit is to co-ordinate preparations for the changeover to the euro in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The euro changeover group was established in 1996 and it included representatives from ICTU, IBEC and a wide range of private sector bodies. Its remit was to aid the co-ordination of the changeover throughout the country.  The single currency officers and the euro changeover group were centrally involved in the preparation of the National Changeover Plan, the second edition of which I published in January.  The plan outlines the changeover arrangements that will be made by the public sector, as well as by banks, building societies and the Stock Exchange.  It also includes an extensive appendix which describes the changeover work being done by various public, trade and professional bodies and lists contact points for further information.</P>
    <P>All Members of the Oireachtas have received copies of the plan so I do not propose to describe it in detail.</P>
    <P>The National Changeover Plan aimed, among other things, to provide businesses with the certainty they need for planning for the changeover. Information for businesses about the changeover is provided by the Forfás Business Awareness Campaign.</P>
    <P>Over the coming weeks, Forfás will issue a guide on information technology and the euro, and a guide for retailers.  Forfás will also launch a document for its information pack to summarise the results of a consultancy study commissioned by the campaign to identify actions in the fields of finance, marketing, distribution, etc.  that firms could consider as part of their planning for the possible contingency of sterling falling below its equilibrium level.</P>
    <P>Turning to law, EMU and the adoption of the euro require a number of changes to Irish legislation. Already, the Central Bank Act, 1998, has ensured that our Central Bank legislation is compatible with the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty, while the Finance Act, 1998, provides for the taxation changes required for the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition to these changes, the Government has approved the drafting of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) Bill, 1998, to cater for the other legislative changes necessary for the introduction of the euro from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure a clear and comprehensible framework in Irish monetary law following the introduction of the euro; to remove incompatibilities between monetary law and the <Col N="858" /> legal framework for the use of the euro; and to give effect to enabling provisions within the legal framework, for example, in relation to the rede-nomination of outstanding debt.  The Bill is also designed to facilitate companies which wish to redenominate and renominalise their capital structure in euro even before euro notes and coins are put into circulation on 1 January 2002. It is intended to have the Bill enacted by summer 1998.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have already said that extensive preparations have already been made for the changeover to the euro, but more remains to be done.  The National Changeover Plan made it clear that a changeover board would be set up after the decision on which member states would be founder members of EMU. Because of the importance of the work to be done, we launched the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland yesterday, the first working day after the EMU decision.</P>
    <P>The board includes representatives from organisations across a wide cross-section of life, including consumers, trade unions, business, accountants, farmers, financial institutions, the European Commission and the European Parliament, as well as the Central Bank and Government Departments.  The board will be chaired by a senior official from the Department of Finance.  It will have two basic tasks: to oversee the implementation of the changeover and ensure it runs as smoothly as possible, and to provide information for the public and consumers to facilitate that objective. As regards the first of these tasks, the board will prepare a third edition of the National Changeover Plan for issue before the beginning of EMU on 1 January next.</P>
    <P>As regards public information, an information programme will begin in June, after the two referendums. Its main objective will be to provide the public with appropriate and timely information about the changeover to the euro, particularly about the timetable, and to reassure the public that the changeover will be manageable for them.</P>
    <P>The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland has an important task to fulfil.  I am very grateful to the organisations represented on it for helping us to carry out this task and I wish the board every success in its work.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that the agreements made last weekend have set in train the arrangements for Ireland's participation in a unique economic environment. Our economy is well placed to successfully participate in the EMU project from the outset.  We look forward to the challenges and opportunities which EMU will pose.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have the greatest respect for the Defence Forces and for their record of loyalty and service to the State.  In the course of recent months I have been greatly encouraged by many letters and phone calls from serving and former members of the Defence Forces.  Those who have taken the trouble to contact me have overwhelmingly supported the Government's policy in tackling this complex issue.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Defence, my overriding priority is to lead to a successful conclusion the redevelopment and revitalisation process which has been under way for a number of years.  That remains my primary concern.  When facing the thousands of claims, foremost in my mind has been the appalling damage wrought on the morale of military personnel and on the image and reputation of the Defence Forces as a major and important national institution.</P>
      <P>In recent months, I have stressed again and again to the soldiers I met that the reorganisation and revitalisation of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps will go ahead.  While public attention has been centred on compensation claims, positive developments within the Defence Forces have continued apace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, my Department launched the procurement process for new armoured personnel carriers, the first such re-equipment programme since the 1970s.  A programme of major upgrading of existing armoured vehicles is being launched. Batteries of refurbished artillery guns are currently being delivered.  Before the end of this year, the programme to replace the Army's radios at a total cost of £11 million will be completed.  A new ship is being constructed for the Naval Service. For the first time ever, we have a policy of continuous recruitment.  Across the Defence Forces, numerous building and refurbishment works are taking place.  In the Naval Base at Haulbowline, nearly £3 million will be spent on a new dining complex.  Work on a major new hangar will <Col N="860" /> shortly get under way at Casement Aerodrome. Major projects are also in train for Collins Barracks, Cork and at Finner Camp in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer must rise to meet the ultimate expense arising from compensation claims, regardless of other commitments.  Since, as a society, we have learned the hard way that ultimately Government borrowing merely postpones taking the hard medicine, cuts will have to be made should the ultimate costs mushroom to doomsday proportions.  In that event, it is unlikely the Government would start by cutting spending on health, education, welfare and the environment. On the contrary, it is far more likely that at an early stage of such a crisis, the Defence Estimate would be ravaged, leading to a reduction in numbers and the wholesale abandonment of development plans.  Therefore, we must fight to contain the cost of compensation claims within reasonable limits, not only in the interest of equity and fair play, but ultimately to defend and protect the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Given the background to this problem, I hope we will see a large measure of cross-party support for the Government's response to a very difficult situation.  I do not wish to engage in a party political slagging match.  On the contrary, I hope to prevent one.  For the majority of the period during which this problem unfolded, the parties now in Opposition were in power.  I do not criticise what they did.  On the contrary, as I outline the history of this problem as it has developed, and take the opportunity to lay to rest several myths that have grown up, I hope it will be clear to any fair-minded observer that, at each stage, Governments formed from both sides of the House sought to respond constructively and, with due regard for the independence of the courts with regard to the rights of genuine claimants and the protection of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am here this evening to commend to the House an unprecedented form of legislation. When the Bill is passed, the Judiciary, who are constituted as an independent branch of Government, will be required for the first time to have regard to a scientific standard when a particular category of personal injury cases is heard. Deputies will rightly want to be assured that the separation of powers between the Legislature and the Judiciary is being fully respected in the proposed legislation and that the rights of individual claimants are properly vindicated.  The measures set out in the Bill are necessary and are in the public interest.  A careful balance has been struck between the independence of the Judiciary and the need to legislate to ensure consistency.  The Bill represents a measured intervention in the area of personal injury legislation with a view to achieving a justified and reasonable objective.</P>
    <P>In the course of the general public debate, the record of the Defence Forces in protecting soldiers has been the subject of intemperate and unjustified criticism.  It has been alleged that, being aware of the problem since 1952, nothing <Col N="861" /> was done until 1987.  To put it bluntly, this is an untruth and I would like to set the record straight.</P>
    <P>Medical awareness of the potential hazard to hearing posed by noise has evolved gradually.  In 1952, knowledge was limited compared to today. Equipment for the measurement of sound levels was primitive at that time compared to modern standards.  Scientific opinion was dependent on the much more limited tools of the time.  In the aftermath of World War II, there was a dawning awareness that soldiers exposed to the extreme noise of war sometimes suffered from a dulling of their hearing.  The precise link between exposure and level of injury was not understood as clearly as it is today.</P>
    <P>During the 1960s, considerable research was carried out in Britain and America and gradually a clearer picture emerged.  However, to put matters in perspective, it was not until 1975 that detailed regulations for the protection of industrial workers in Ireland were made under the Factories Act.  In this context, the response of the Defence Forces in issuing ear plugs to all personnel in the early 1970s was well ahead of the practice elsewhere in Ireland and only slightly behind military practice in the US and Britain.  Lest there be any doubt about it, I want to re-emphasise what I said.  The Defence Forces, on their own initiative, were buying and issuing tens of thousands of ear plugs before the question of hearing protection was meaningfully addressed in regulations covering other Irish employers.</P>
    <P>The ear plugs in question were similar to those on issue to the British Army.  They were among the best available at the time.  In truth, they compare poorly with modern ear defenders.  There were problems fitting them.  Personnel found them uncomfortable to wear, and it appears their usage was unpopular.  In conformity with the practice of the time, it was left to each individual to follow advice and wear the plugs.  It would appear now that many decided to ignore the safety instructions and chose not to.  However, I emphasise that similar problems were encountered elsewhere.  The plugs in question were products of their time reflecting the position that, even as late as the 1970s, awareness of the hazard posed by noise was still evolving.</P>
    <P>However, long before any litigation commenced, and long before any of the alleged injuries came to light, better plugs were developed and issued, and a stricter regime of training and enforcement introduced.  Once again, the Defence Forces led the way in introducing a comprehensive hearing conservation system in 1987, a full two years before the health and safety legislation addressed the question.  Although the tidal wave of compensation claims was then completely unforeseen, it is important to note that without any compulsion from outside regulators, before any legislative requirement, in advance of civilian employers generally, a major reform was undertaken by the Defence Forces on their own initiative, resulting in a comprehensive regime which has subsequently withstood challenge in <Col N="862" /> the courts.  However the measures taken may appear now, they represented the best available at the time and were a genuine attempt to take all necessary care of the health and hearing of soldiers.</P>
    <P>Given these facts, it may legitimately be asked why the claims are succeeding.  To successfully defend a claim, it is necessary to be able to prove in the case of each named individual that he was issued with plugs and wore them every time he fired on a rifle range.  Quite understandably, records in such detail were not maintained and, given the passage of time, the production of such detailed evidence is an impossible task.  Regrettably, the fact that 81,000 sets of Sonex ear defenders were issued in the 1970s and early 1980s appears to be of no relevance in an individual case before a court.  However, I emphasise that there is a world of difference between being negligent on the one hand and, on the other, being unable to defend oneself because of the passage of time and a lack of records and evidence. The matter is compounded when the actions of 20 years ago are viewed with the effortless wisdom of hindsight, through the lens of the 1990s.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the Army's record in hearing conservation, Deputies are also entitled to be reassured that the problem posed by the avalanche of claims has been properly managed. Because a number of untruths have unfortunately gained currency in recent times, I will outline all that has happened from the time claims first arose until the necessity for this unprecedented legislation became apparent.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to suggest that it was known in the Department of Defence as far back as 1994 that we had a looming crisis in Army deafness claims. The emerging dimensions of the present crisis have been visible only for around 18 months as attempts to persuade the courts of the relatively minor nature of the injuries received failed and as significantly large damages were awarded, thus encouraging more claims.</P>
    <P>In 1994, only a handful of claims had materialised and it was then uncertain how the courts would address them.  Even as late as the beginning of 1996, as few as 2,000 claims had been received.  I regard this as very important, as my Department has been criticised in some quarters for its lack of clairvoyance.  At that stage, the Department was reassured by the advice of leading medical experts that the cases coming forward showed little evidence of material hearing loss. Added to this was the knowledge that noise induced hearing loss does not increase when exposure to noise ceases.  Accordingly, a connection between symptoms emerging in 1995 and service prior to 1987 should, in logic, be difficult to establish.  It was against this background that cases began to run before the courts.  I also emphasise that there is a considerable time lag between the receipt of a claim and listing before a court.  Accordingly, a large number of cases <Col N="863" /> were in hand before the courts began to take a view one way or the other.</P>
    <P>The cases as they had been heard before the courts went as follows: an isolated case was given an award in August 1992; the next case did not arise until February 1994 &mdash; in this case the claim was dismissed; arising from the time lag before cases come to hearing, it was not until December 1995 that a landmark case, the B case with little actual impairment, was heard in the High Court and an award of £45,000 was made; it was not until June 1996 that another case, the N case, came to hearing &mdash; the claimant received £24,720, notwithstanding the fact that the presiding judge found that the individual had persevered with a claim for loss of hearing that, on relatively clear evidential grounds, was unsustainable.  I have nothing to add to the court's stated reservations about the plaintiff's honesty.  Without labouring the point, I trust it will be clear to all Members that this case came as a shattering blow to the State's defence as it laid down a precedent that, even where the plaintiff has been found to be untruthful in the matter of hearing loss, he may still receive substantial compensation for tinnitus. Severe tinnitus &mdash; a constant ringing in the ears &mdash; is normally present in a small minority of hearing loss cases.  It cannot be measured objectively. The case I have just mentioned prompted a major increase in the number of claims.</P>
    <P>One further case came to hearing before the summer recess in 1996 and was awarded £25,000. However, it was the sixth, the K case, that proved to be a major landmark.  An individual was awarded £80,000 for a minor hearing loss. Although this figure was subsequently reduced under negotiation following a Supreme Court appeal by the State, and although similar cases have subsequently received as little as £5,000, the impact of this judgment is best illustrated by the following statistic: in the five years leading up to this case, a little over 4,000 cases had been submitted to the Department of Defence; in the nine months following it, another 4,000 were received. The floodgates were literally burst open by this judgment.  A further case was awarded £17,500 in December.  In addition, 136 cases were settled by negotiation during 1996.</P>
    <P>However, three cases were brought to hearing in January 1997, with two of them dismissed.  I emphasise that as a large number of cases began to be listed for hearing in February 1997, ten cases had gone to court and three had been dismissed. Standing out like a beacon was the judgment in the K case awarding huge money for minor injury.  A relatively large number of cases were then processed through the courts with several being heard each month.</P>
    <P>The initial results from larger numbers of cases were disappointing.  Apart from the welcome vindication of the Army's regime of hearing conservation since 1987, the line followed by the courts was that hearing handicap assessment systems would not be accepted and that the plaintiff's evidence <Col N="864" /> on his own behalf, provided that it was endorsed in general terms by a medical practitioner acting for him, would be sufficient of itself to provide grounds for making an award of damages.  The reason I have devoted so much time to this is to make it clear that the point at which it became clear to the Department that a huge number of cases would be successful and not thrown out by the courts was early 1997, some 15 months ago.</P>
    <P>Faced with this scenario, the State adopted a policy of contesting liability in every case to the door of the court with a view to trying to shut the floodgates.  Selected cases were then run with a view to encouraging a reduction in the quantum of compensation.  Other cases were settled by negotiation.  This policy has been subsequently followed by this Government.  It was the correct policy when it was introduced and for the first half of 1997 when the Deputies opposite were in power.  It will remain the correct policy until such time as we can take other measures to regulate the situation.  The average quantum was reduced from £35,000 in 1996 to around £20,000 when all cases were adjourned in February this year.</P>
    <P>The policy has been the subject of considerable criticism, all of it ill-conceived and some of it emanating from vested interests.  It has been suggested that the State should concede liability to save money on legal costs.  To paraphrase Ralph Waldo Emerson, that is about as sensible as stopping the clock to save time.  I emphasise in the strongest terms that I share the view taken by the parties now in Opposition that a general concession of liability in the face of this difficult situation would have led to tens of thousands more claims being made.</P>
    <P>However, it is equally clear that such a policy could only remain valid for a limited time and it has always been my ultimate objective to remove this problem from the courts on terms which would be fair to all sides.  Clearly, given the huge number of claims in hand &mdash; some 10,500 at present &mdash; the courts are unable to cope.  In the course of my recent appearance in the High Court it was claimed that at the present rate of processing it will take seventeen and half years to work through the cases in hand.  This estimate makes no allowance for cases which are still being submitted.  Clearly a simpler and more streamlined method must be adopted.</P>
    <P>Any fast-track system established by me can only succeed if it pays out the same level of awards as a court.  At present court awards are too high.  It is also obvious that the rapid processing of a large number of claims requires an objective yardstick by which each can be judged. If the disability assessment system being underpinned by the Bill is accepted in the courts, it will be possible for me to establish a system which will remove the need for persons with a genuine hearing injury to institute court action.  It will also be my intention to facilitate people who have already initiated a claim but who wish to transfer to a non-adversarial system.  For this development <Col N="865" /> to take place it is essential that the courts accept the hearing disability assessment system and, with equal importance, attach a fair and reasonable tariff of compensation to the varying disability levels.  Provided these conditions are met the present phase of the problem can be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>I accept without reservation that there are individuals who served in the Army who have a noise induced hearing loss.  From the start I have made clear my commitment to see fair play for all who have a genuine claim.  That said a situation where a large number of people receive some money simply because they served in the Army is unsustainable. While it has never been the State's contention that all of the claims are bogus, it is equally improbable that all of the 10,500 awaiting processing have equal merit, particularly following the wave of advertising by a minority of the legal profession and the incentive effect of certain early awards.  Equally, an equitable system of adjudicating claims must recognise that, in the case of those who had relatively short service and left the Defence Forces many years ago, there is a serious question mark over the cause of any hearing loss they may have.  Any viable solution to the problem of Army hearing loss claims must give substantial compensation to people with a serious injury.  Equally, it must compensate those whose injury causes no real or significant handicap in a proportionate way.</P>
    <P>I will now specifically address two legal aspects which arise from the Army hearing loss cases, namely, the question of the Department's liability for the injuries caused and the method by which the injuries are assessed in the courts.  Regarding liability I note that, particularly in recent months, there has been a great deal of comment on the Department's policy of denying liability in all these cases.  The argument has been made that if the Department admitted liability, or at a minimum negligence, significant costs could be saved on the day of the trial as an engineer or other experts would not have to be present to prove the damage that can be caused to hearing by gunfire. Much play has been made of the fact that as early as 1993 the Attorney General's office provided advice on the basis that it was preferable to concede liability in these cases and thus save on costs. Such advice was received at a time when a relatively small number of claims were being made. Legal advice is only one element of policy formation. As the size of the problem increased, it became apparent to my predecessors that such a course of admitting liability could not be contemplated. The main argument that can be made in this connection is that by conceding liability, or even negligence, a clear signal would be sent to serving and former personnel that the money was simply there for the taking.  It would open the floodgates with enormous consequences for the taxpayer.  This would happen in a context where I believe, as did my predecessors, the type of awards being made in court for this type of injury were too high.  The policy, therefore, that the <Col N="866" /> Department has consistently adopted, has been to fight all cases.  I am fully aware of the short-term cost savings which might be effected by conceding liability.  However, the reduction in quantum that has been achieved by the Department standing firm on this issue and fighting selected cases has justified my present policy and that of my predecessors.</P>
    <P>As an aside, I will comment on the effect of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, 1991.  This Act allows a plaintiff three years within which to sue from the date on which he or she discovers, or ought reasonably to have discovered, the fact, significance and causation of his or her injury.  The introduction of this legislation was at the time seen as a very progressive move and I support its general tenor.  However, in the case of my Department this legislation has rebounded in such a way as to facilitate the enormous volume of litigation that has come from hearing loss claimants.  While clearly those who have suffered major injury that does not become apparent for a considerable number of years should have a right of redress, we must also find some way of balancing this with the rights of defendants.  It is surely unfair that defendants should be faced with old claims where it is impossible to find evidence to mount a defence because of destruction of records, passage of time and the frailties of human memory.</P>
    <P>In connection with the concept of conceding liability or negligence, there have been many calls for the establishment of some kind of board or tribunal to facilitate the payment of compensation without heavy legal expenses.  In general I very much favour this approach.  However, again like my predecessors, I feel it is premature to embark on such a course until the level of quantum of damages in the courts has been drastically reduced.  It must be recalled that the current level of damages is in or around £20,000 per claim.  If this sum of money were paid, even free of legal costs, to the 10,500 claimants already on the books, the taxpayer would be required to pay £210 million.</P>
    <P>This and previous Governments have resisted this option, largely motivated by the fact that most claimants, in the context of industrial injuries tribunals in other countries, would receive little or no compensation for the minor level of injury they have incurred.  While this may seem a harsh attitude, I have no doubt that Deputies on all sides of the House will appreciate that resources are scarce and should be spent in the most beneficial way for society at large.  I do not wish to labour the point, but in the context of there being many worthy demands upon the Exchequer, we must stop and consider whether the expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds on individuals who are suffering minimal or no handicap in their daily lives is justified.</P>
    <P>Regarding the assessment of injury, I will deal with the issue of handicap or disability.  Hearing is a sensation perceived in response to sound.  It is not capable of being measured in absolute <Col N="867" /> value but rather is calculated by comparative reference to the hearing levels of others.  Individuals are tested on an audiogram by recording their response or ability to hear sounds of different frequencies played at different levels of intensity or volume.  The degree to which an individual's hearing deviates from the norm, established by patterns of a large sample group of the population as a whole, measures the extent to which hearing is deficient.  It is possible to have good hearing at relatively low conversational frequencies with impaired hearing at higher frequencies.  It is also a fact that as age increases, the ability to hear very high pitched sound decreases.  Other factors can affect hearing, including illness such as an ear infection, and a noisy environment.  Lifestyle, such as motor bike riding or attendance at discos, can also produce a hearing loss, particularly when exposure is over a prolonged period.  Noise induced hearing loss usually manifests itself in a loss of high tone hearing.  Such a person may, however, be able to hear sounds that arise in normal conversation quite adequately at the lower frequencies.  A loss of hearing in the high reaches of the medium area can result in an inability to distinguish conversation against a degree of background noise such as found in a crowded room.</P>
    <P>The question which must be considered, and which is crucial to this debate, is the degree to which a hearing loss at higher frequencies, such as that which may be caused by gunfire, impinges on an individual's daily life and affects his or her ability to understand conversation or to have a normal relationship with family, work colleagues and neighbours.  The Department has been of the view, throughout this controversy, that the type of injury incurred by the majority of plaintiffs in these cases is of a relatively minor nature and does not impact seriously on their ability to understand conversation in a normal context.</P>
    <P>This is not just a matter for the Department of Defence to decide.  In this connection the advice of leading experts has been obtained.  Deputies will be familiar with the fact that the Americans and the British have systems of translating hearing loss into a percentage handicap.  Those systems have not been accepted in the Irish courts and a controversy has ensued as to the relevance of such formulae in assessing the relevant injury. In B's case, which was one of the early cases before the courts, the High Court held that the appropriate way to assess the injury was to have regard to the extent of the hearing loss and the way in which this affected the individual's everyday activities.  This reasoning has been adopted by the High Court and the Circuit Court in dealing with all the cases that have come before them. As recently as the Gardiner case, heard in the High Court in March 1998, this jurisprudence has been approved and followed.</P>
    <P>In the course of cases heard before the courts, there has been repeated judicial comment on the absence of an agreed Irish standard for assessing hearing loss.  In the absence of this agreed standard, <Col N="868" /> there has been occasional reference to Army regulations which deal with the medical categorisation of personnel.  This has been, I respectfully suggest, a mistake.  The Army medical regulations are designed primarily as a categorisation to establish capability and, in the case of hearing, the protective measures that are necessary.  Army hearing regulations are based on European Union worker protection legislation and include measurement at frequencies of 6,000 hertz and 8,000 hertz.  These two frequencies are included to provide an early warning system so that employers can identify employees who have early hearing loss and provide appropriate types of hearing protection for them.  The Army regulations, and the Irish health and safety legislation upon which they are based, were never intended as a system of assessing the handicap or disability which may arise in an individual as a result of hearing loss.  All the relevant authorities are clear on this point.  This has been emphasised in the Department of Health and Children report and by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>In view of comments on the absence of an Irish system or standard for assessing hearing handicap or disability, the Department of Health and Children was requested at the end of August 1997 to assemble a group of experts and ask them to develop such a system.  The group reported to the Minister for Health and Children at the beginning of April 1998.  The green book or the hearing disability assessment is now available, having been published on 9 April.  There has been comment in the High Court on the absence of an Irish standard for assessing hearing disability.  The purpose of this Bill is to address this gap and to end confusion in relation to the American and British systems by providing one which has been developed by Irish experts.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines hearing injury as including hearing loss and tinnitus.  Tinnitus is an injury which involves noise in the ears which can be frequent or intermittent, loud or very quiet.  Section 2 provides that the provisions of the Act shall apply to all proceedings at present before the courts.  Section 3, one of the key sections, provides that judicial notice shall be taken of the report in all proceedings before a court where damages are claimed for a personal injury arising from an injury to hearing.  Section 4(1) provides that where a court is assessing the extent of personal injury arising from hearing loss, it shall have regard to the formula contained in the report. Section 4(2) provides that where a court is assessing the extent of a tinnitus injury, it shall have regard to the classification method for tinnitus contained in the report.  I have been advised by the Attorney General that, because of the approach adopted in the Bill, effectively making its adoption by the courts a voluntary one, there are no constitutional difficulties with the Bill.</P>
    <P>If it is the case that, as a consequence of this report and the Bill before us, the level of quantum in Army hearing loss cases falls to a reasonable level, I will waste no time in developing a <Col N="869" /> compensation mechanism which will provide a fair and speedy solution for those who have suffered a significant hearing loss.  I will do this without further recourse to the courts and in doing so will effect the savings in legal costs to which I referred earlier and remove a huge volume of litigation from the courts which I accept is threatening to overwhelm the personal injuries system there.  If the quantum does not fall to what the Government would consider a reasonable level, a further examination of this problem will continue with a view to ensuring the interests of the taxpayer and of those who are in dire need of scarce resources are protected.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I am extremely concerned about the impact this ongoing controversy has had on the morale, image and reputation of the Defence Forces.  It has significantly interfered with the process of implementing major changes in the Defence Forces and used up resources that were needed for essential reforms.  The widespread compensation claims for deafness from members and former members of the Defence Forces is one of the most complex and potentially damaging situations the State has ever faced.  The exact scale of the problem is not yet clear, but even modest or conservative estimates indicate it is immense.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the legislation, it is necessary for those of us elected to legislate and govern to approach the matter in a way which places the common good at the centre of the resolution.  In saying that I include firmly within the concept of the common good the right of individuals to seek redress in law for damages done to them and to have those rights respected and upheld.  We face the complex task of finding an approach to this evolving issue which protects the State in financial terms while at the same time facing up to the responsibility we have to protect our citizens.  We need the best possible thinking based on facts to arrive at a such an approach.  I regret this has not been evident at all times and there are certain parallels between the handling of this matter and previous cases against the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before commenting in more detail on this I will place the position in Ireland in a global context. There is no doubt that hearing disabilities are a problem for defence forces worldwide and for other employers in many countries.  They are increasingly a problem in developing countries as industrialisation progresses.  Hence the plethora <Col N="870" /> of research, guidelines and systems in place to deal with the consequent problems, as is evident from the expert group report.  There is a great deal of information available which should probably have been guiding our actions for some time, but instead the matter was left to the point where cases are being raised continually in the courts. In many ways we are overwhelmed by the problem. The Minister is attempting to find direction even as cases are being dealt with in the courts.  I accept the hard work and effort of many on the Minister's staff and others, as highlighted at the Committee of Public Accounts hearings, to try to find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I question some aspects of the State's strategy and some of the underlying assumptions that may be directing thinking on the matter.  There has been a tendency to rubbish the cases and to stereotype claimants.  There has been great concern about ambulance chasing solicitors who are dealing with the matter in an opportunistic way. While I accept there is a problem, we cannot stereotype all solicitors or lawyers dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>The matter has been left to the courts and when this has not produced the desired results, judicial decisions have been queried.  Whatever we may wish to assume, we cannot dismiss the claimants involved.  Leaving aside the Irish situation, there is adequate global evidence of hearing disability being caused in the manner described by many claimants.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to introduce this Bill on an issue on which the Minister has commented on numerous occasions in the past five or six months.  Many crimes are vicious and unpleasant but the crime of sexually abusing a young child, robbing that child of its innocence, is surely so repugnant that we are entitled to look for special ways of dealing with it to make society's abhorrence of such activities clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> According to studies carried out in Britain, repeat offences among paedophiles run at an estimated rate of 95 per cent.  Suffice to say these statistics make the curative approach quite unrealistic.  Containment and control is the appropriate policy in these circumstances.  These need to be combined with more effective and co-operative arrangements amongst concerned agencies and a long-term preventative effort directed against child abuse.  The rate of recidivism among other sex offenders is less pronounced but disturbingly high nevertheless.</P>
    <P>This Private Members' Bill, if enacted, will establish a register of those convicted of sexual offences against children.  Under the proposed legislation, convicting judges will have the discretion to decide whether, and for what period, those found guilty of such offences must remain on a register.  The register will also extend to people convicted of similar offences in the United Kingdom.  It is ironic that on 9 February this year, the eminent Mr. Justice Budd released a former Irish soldier from Arbour Hill Prison on condition that he agreed to be registered in Britain as a sex offender.  He was serving a six year sentence, imposed in 1995, for sexually abusing his step sister and assaulting another ten year old victim. He agreed to reside with relatives in the UK. This is a firm indication of the view of the Judiciary with regard to the availability of a register of child sex offenders to ensure some control over their movements.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a small, but important, step in the fight against child sex abuse.  I am introducing this Bill because society must give the rights of children priority over those of their abusers.  I do not regard the Bill as a panacea to prevent all sexual offences against children.  No measure can control all paedophiles but this Bill would be a significant step which would help the Garda to track those who might offend against children.  If the Garda were armed with the information provided for under the Bill, it would not only help them identify suspects once the crime has been committed, but would act as a deterrent to some would be re-offenders.</P>
    <P>This Bill constitutes a fair and balanced approach to the issue.  Convicting judges will decide on whether a person found guilty of a child sex offence should be registered.  In these cases, the notification of the offender will be quite stringent.  He will be required to register any change of name or address with the Garda within seven days of release from a penal institution. In addition, the offender must inform the Garda of any address at which he spends a total of 14 days in a calendar year.  Severe penalties will be applied to offenders who fail to comply with the notification requirements.</P>
    <P>Access to information contained in the register will be restricted to the Garda Síochána.  This information can only be disclosed with the permission of a designated High Court judge who will also decide to whom the information can be <Col N="872" /> given.  Sex offenders, who are subject to the notification requirements of this Bill, will be allowed to apply to the courts to be exempted from these requirements if they can provide evidence they have been fully rehabilitated.</P>
    <P>The notification requirements of this legislation will also apply to those convicted of similar offences against children in the United Kingdom. Given that UK paedophiles have been identified in Ireland, seeking to escape the rigours of the UK register, it is imperative that such individuals would be statutorily required to inform the Garda of their personal details.</P>
    <P>In a report published during the latter part of last year, the eminent journalist, Phelim McAleer, outlined that four Derry paedophiles had moved to Cork to avoid the sex offenders register which tracks and monitors their movements within the UK and Northern Ireland.  Mr. McAleer stated that the revelation will increase concern that sex abusers are now using the Republic as &ldquo;a safe haven&rdquo; to continue their activities.  He reported that, according to legal sources in Derry who deal with ex-prisoners, the four paedophiles who moved to Cork met when they were serving their sentences at Magilligan Prison.  One of the men is a persistent offender who has served two separate jail terms.  The legal source said that, from the questions the men asked before they left prison, it was clear they were going to Cork to avoid the register.  They were asking if they could be tracked there and what their obligations would be.  Cork is a logical choice, it has no register and is the furthest place in Ireland from Derry.  If one goes to Dublin for the weekend, it is even money one will meet somebody from Derry walking down Grafton Street.  That would be highly unlikely in Limerick and even less likely in Cork. Cork is also a city and one can be more anonymous in a city, the source said.</P>
    <P>There is some evidence that groups of paedophiles are also arriving in the Republic from Britain.  The situation is a very dangerous one. Being in each other's company provides paedophiles with self-justification, each validating the other's illegal behaviour as acceptable.  In those circumstances, they pose a high degree of risk to children.</P>
    <P>Mr. McAleer reports that Breidge Gadd, head of the Northern Ireland Probation Board, said the failure to set up a register in the Republic means it will attract paedophiles, particularly persistent offenders, who intend to continue abusing. She saw it as an inevitability that people involved in paedophile rings would see the South as a safe haven.  She said it was clear that abusers would take advantage of the loophole.  She is quoted as saying that &ldquo;a paedophile with evil intent will almost naturally go to one of the parts of these islands which does not have a register and where his movements are not being monitored as closely&rdquo;.  Ms Gadd said that those in statutory agencies, who worked with sex offenders, were increasingly finding that their clients had moved to the Republic:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> I hear from other professionals that there are people who have gone to the South, there is word around Northern Ireland that this is happening.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, it is estimated that about 5 per cent of boys and 7 per cent of girls are sexually abused before the age of 16.  The estimate for physical abuse is put in a range of somewhere between 8 per cent and 12 per cent of children.  The characteristics of a person who sexually abuses children vary depending on the relationship.  If strangers are abusing a child, they are generally loners, single men who usually have no history of being in a marital relationship.</P>
    <P>They attack children in a violent way in a once off situation.  They sexually assault the child and move on to other victims.  They accumulate a number of victims and have been known to claim as many as 200-300 victims.</P>
    <P>A different type of sexual offender is the parent or blood relative who is abusing the child. Such offenders do not have many victims and are not usually violent.  They persuade the child to accept the abuse over a long period.  They convince the child that such abuse is an education or a game.  They persuade them it will do no harm. In most cases they are living with the child. Between the above two spectrums &mdash; the once off violent case and the close family relationship &mdash; there is a person who is known to the child but does not necessarily live in the house with the child.  They can have a number of victims at any time or sequentially.  All sex offenders tend to have low self-esteem, low sense of self-worth and little understanding of their victim's position. They do not understand how the victim feels. They often consider they are not doing the child any harm or minimise the harm caused and many blame the child for the abuse.  They blame the child for what happens, that the child was being too friendly or too dependent.  They do not accept any blame for the abuse.  If they accept any blame they usually point to an external source such as drunkenness and as such make excuses for their actions.  Such offenders are usually socially isolated. The main difference between physical and sexual abuse is that the latter can never be accidental. Sexual abuse is planned and if taking place in the home, is planned over a long period.</P>
    <P>Child sexual abuse is a carefully planned act over a long period, whereas physical abuse can occur on the spur of the moment.  Deep regret usually follows physical abuse because the person lost his or her temper and did not intend to harm the child.  Studies reveal that child sex abusers are approximately 85 per cent male and 15 per cent female.  For physical abuse it is 50-50.</P>
    <P>Most sexually abused children suffer long-term traumatic stress disorders.  Such children usually have a range of mental health problems.  They often inflict harm on themselves either directly through deliberate injury and self-mutilation or indirectly through eating disorders and drug abuse.  Once children become victims of abuse, they tend to suffer further abuse in later life at <Col N="874" /> the hands of the same person or another perpetrator.</P>
    <P>Children abused in a family situation are often more vulnerable to the advances of paedophiles on reaching school age and adolescence. This is due to low self-esteem and low self-confidence. The paedophile identifies and targets them by offering some form of comfort and attention.</P>
    <P>There is no argument against controlling the movement of paedophiles when one examines the effect of their vile activities.  The victim of child sexual abuse is likely to suffer deep and extremely traumatic effects as a teenager and as an adult.  They suffer from multiple personalities, bouts of alcohol consumption to the point of feeling suicidal, depression and elation, nervous breakdown, long periods of life spent alone in self-imposed isolation from human beings due to mistrust and disbelief in humanity.  They discard friendships like a spoilt child throws away sweet papers and are unable to see the difference between reality and fantasy.  They live most of their lives in a state of fear.  The argument that people who inflict this should not be controlled is akin to condemning many children to a life of no self-esteem or self-worth, a sense of hopelessness, isolation and difficulty with relationships.</P>
    <P>The argument is often advanced that a register will leave those who are on it open to attack.  This must be controlled.  The Bill provides that access to information be restricted to the Garda Síochána. This information can be disclosed only with the permission of a designated High Court judge who will also decide to whom the information can be given.  This would provide a balance between the safety of the person on the register and the protection of children.</P>
    <P>In December 1997 the <i>Irish Independent</i> revealed that the Garda uncovered a major paedophile ring which has been operating in the west for several years.  Middle-aged and elderly men had been targeting boys in their early teens and using them for sex.  The Garda believe at least a dozen men have had an involvement since the late 1980s and that members of the ring sought to win the boys' confidence and eventually proposition them.  In many cases the approaches were made in or around public toilets in Galway city centre.  Other boys were targeted near the promenade in Salthill.  A boy who agreed to go off with a man was usually invited into his car.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> report stated that the men drove to a remote area outside the city and sexual activity took place in the back of the vehicle.  The boys were sometimes rewarded with money while information on their names or whereabouts was later passed among the ring.</P>
    <P>A number of boys were subsequently followed by other men and propositioned after the adults indicated they had a mutual acquaintance.  In many cases the boys were from poor backgrounds and came from families where the home circumstances were far from ideal.  They were easy targets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> While such paedophile rings are dreadful and disgusting, it prompts a still more dreadful question. Is it the only one of its kind?  We cannot afford not to answer this question because there is a strong possibility that more paedophile rings exist than the group whose vile activities were disclosed in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in December.  It has long been known that paedophiles are well organised and have a number of such rings operating throughout Europe and more recently on the Internet.  This is particularly disturbing as innocent people can access information by mistake. It is easy for a paedophile ring to create a home-page titled under an agreed name.  The ring can decide to include child pornography under a pre-determined though generally innocent generic heading.  Tracking this ring takes law enforcement agencies significant time and resources.</P>
    <P>When the processing has eventually been done the paedophile ring has moved to their next home-page.  It is worth noting that many paedophiles do not use hard-core pornography to sexually excite themselves.  What would be considered innocent photographs of children playing on a beach or having a bath can be intensely erotic to a paedophile.  This matter was discussed at length recently on Second Stage of the Child Pornography Bill.</P>
    <P>Society must protect itself from such activities. We must start by instituting a register of child sex offenders as outlined in the Bill.  The threat is real and we must have real action to counter it.</P>
    <P>The provision of such a register of child sex offenders is a new approach in our justice system. It is absolutely necessary and I believe everybody accepts that among criminals paedophiles are in a special category.  We can distinguish their sexual activity from that of violent criminals.  Research shows that paedophiles are highly manipulative and clever and often their offending behaviour intensifies as they get older.  They are in a particularly dangerous category, and there is a need for a register to tackle the problem.  One of the difficulties of dealing with hardened paedophiles is that they do not consider their activities to be wrong.  Hardened paedophiles believe the rest of us set unfair parameters on their sexual behaviour. They do not believe that having sex with children is wrong.  Many believe it is right and that we are wrong in trying to restrain their activity.</P>
    <P>That is what makes them especially dangerous and that is why they are so clever and manipulative.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill is the interpretation section.  Section 2 provides for the short title and commencement.  Section 3 deals with the sexual offenders who are subject to the notification requirements, which includes both those convicted of a sexual offence or those found guilty but insane in respect of such an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2) outlines the main criteria which should underline the judge's decision.  The principal objective of this legislation is to act as a deterrent <Col N="876" /> against recidivism.  Consequently, those whom the court considers particularly likely to reoffend are specifically targeted by this measure. Aside from the offender's history, the court, in ruling on the matter, shall also consider the degree of access he or she is likely to have to children in his or her social or domestic activities.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2) provides that the court should consider the offender's private profile, which means making a professional assessment of whether the offender has regular contact with children in the course of his or her private life, and social profile, which means making a professional assessment of whether the offender has regular contact with children in the course of his or her work or recreational pursuits.  Section 3(2)(f) provides for judicial variations of the notification requirements where there is evidence of rehabilitation or deterioration in the convicted offender's behaviour. This introduces an essential element of flexibility into the process.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the notification requirements. The governor of a prison or place of detention or the medical director of the hospital in which the offender was last held must inform the Garda Commissioner of the date of release from the institution or place of detention or hospital of a person who is subject to the notification requirements.  The notification requirements are stringent.  An offender must report to the Garda Síochána before the end of seven days, beginning with the date of release, and upon registration the offender's personal details &mdash; address, fingerprints and a signed photograph &mdash; must be submitted to the Garda Síochána.  When the offender changes his name or address he or she must notify a local Garda station within seven days of this development.  If he or she spends a total of 14 days in a calender year at an address other than his or her residential address in the Republic of Ireland, he or she must give the address to the local station.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that young sexual offenders between the ages of 17 and 21 should not be exempt from notification requirements as the judge can take all circumstances of the case, including the age of the offender, into account when ruling on this issue.  It would be better to omit offenders under the age of 17 years from the provisions of the Bill.  Specialists working in the area claim that this group have significantly better rates of rehabilitation.  Many of the offenders in this category may not be aware of the illegality of their behaviour.</P>
    <P>It is submitted that there could also be a problem with enforcement in the event of the offender breaching the notification requirements.  United Kingdom legislation makes a person enjoying parental responsibility for the young offender liable in the event of the young offender breaching the notification requirements.  This might not be acceptable in Ireland.  However, section 5 provides that the Bill shall apply to a sentence of detention in St. Patrick's Institution.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that a person convicted of <Col N="877" /> an offence under the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1966 shall be obliged to comply with the notification requirements of this legislation.  Under section 7, a person subject to a statutory notification under United Kingdom law for a sexual offence perpetrated against a child shall, within 48 hours of taking up residence in the State, provide a member in charge of his or her local Garda station with the information specified in that section.</P>
    <P>Such a person shall be deemed to be resident in the State if he or she has been resident in the State or is planning to reside in the State for a period of 14 days or more from the date on which he or she entered the State.  The person subject to notification requirements under United Kingdom law has four days to inform the member in charge of any Garda station where there is a change in the information originally given to the Garda station.  Such an individual shall comply with the notification requirements described in sections 7, 1 and 4 for as long as he is subject to statutory notification requirements under United Kingdom law.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government should promote among their EU colleagues the establishment of a European-wide register.  It is important that there is international cross-reference between such registers.  However, because of the ease of communication it is important that paedophiles travelling from the North of Ireland and the UK are included under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with breaches of notification requirements.  A person who so breaches shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both, or on indictment to a fine not exceeding £5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with disclosure of information on the register.  It is essential that access to the register be confined to the Garda Síochána.  Only the Garda can make an application to a designated High Court judge to lift this requirement in exceptional circumstances.  This procedure is similar to that employed where the Garda must make a judicial application for a telephone tap and is designed to protect the constitutional right to privacy of the individual.  Such restrictive access to the register should reassure offenders that they have nothing to fear from vigilantes, thereby increasing the efficacy of this Bill through improved compliance rates.</P>
    <P>The greater awareness and huge emphasis given to child sexual abuse and the social revulsion at such abuse does not confer a licence on people effectively to take the law into their own hands.  Repugnance for child sexual abuse cannot be a justification for mob rule.</P>
    <P>There can be few more reviled figures in society today than the persons who sexually offend children.  In the past, such men were often tolerated and classified as dirty old men whom it was better to avoid.  They were rarely, if ever, <Col N="878" /> prosecuted.  The change in awareness of the damage done to children by such people has changed society's attitude to them.  However, offenders are released from prison without any real co-ordination between the various statutory services.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to support this Bill.  It recognises that nothing could be more hateful than sexual offences against the most innocent and vulnerable members of our society.  The Bill contains important provisions to tackle a problem which is the cause of widespread concern.  Its enactment will mean the Garda Síochána will have up-to-date information on the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders and will be able to use that information for the investigation and prevention of crime.  The registration requirements will be a powerful deterrent to offenders who will be aware that, from the moment they register an address or change of address, the Garda will be aware of their presence and will have them in their sights.  Those who are tempted not to register will be aware they are committing a further serious offence.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are tough and I make no apology for that.  They will place some offenders under an obligation to report their movements for the rest of their lives and that is as it should be.  I commend the Bill to the House on the basis that it strengthens the power of the Garda Síochána to tackle the scourge of child sexual abuse.  Our children deserve no less.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Neville on his initiative in introducing this Bill.  It is a welcome measure that will address the fears which have been raised throughout the country that Ireland is fast becoming a safe haven for paedophiles.</P>
      <P>Last December, newspaper reports revealed that four paedophiles from Derry had moved to Cork in an effort to avoid the sex offenders register in the UK.  These reports caused serious concern and worry among parents in Cork, particularly in my constituency.  They feared that convicted paedophiles were living within their community and were concerned that there was no system whereby they could be monitored and kept in check.  Deputy Neville has described the horrendous nature of the crime of sexual abuse of children and one can understand the worry of such parents.  How are they to protect their children when known paedophiles are living unchecked in their communities?</P>
      <P>They cannot allow children to go to the shop, be five minutes late in collecting them from school or let them play outside on their own in green open spaces.  They have to protect them. Parents will be somewhat appeased by the introduction of this Bill which I hope the Government will accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parents in the vicinity of Dillon's Cross, Cork city, are in a state of high alert following the horrific rape of an eight year old in broad daylight in recent weeks.  The person who committed this horrendous crime remains at large.  All the research shows that he is likely to reoffend.  A sex <Col N="879" /> offender's register may not have prevented this attack or necessarily help the Garda Síochána with their inquiries but if such a register was in place, they would have some idea about the nature of the people living in an area and would be able to monitor known offenders.</P>
    <P>This Bill would require the registration of offenders convicted by Irish courts of certain sexual offences against children committed inside and outside the jurisdiction.  The convicting judge would decide when handing down sentence whether the convicted offender's name should be entered in the register on release from detention and the length of time it should remain on it.  I welcome the fact that members of the Judiciary will make this decision and I hope the Minister will provide a comprehensive training package to enable members of the Judiciary to fulfil this role in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>The notification requirements laid down are stringent and thorough.  The Bill provides that access to the register would be confined to the Garda Síochána.  That is right and proper.  There are systems in place for the exchange of suspicions of alleged abuse between the Garda Síochána and the health boards.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that offenders convicted in the United Kingdom will be required to register with the Garda Síochána within 48 hours of taking up residence in Ireland.  The UK Sex Offenders Act came into force last September. The statistics show that, to date, only 12 per cent of convicted sex offenders in Britain have failed to register with their local police force.  Under further legislation they face a six month jail sentence for not informing the authorities of their current addresses.</P>
    <P>Extra resources are required by the Garda Síochána for monitoring the most dangerous paedophiles once released from jail.  The Minister will have to address this issue in conjunction with the Garda authorities.  A recent article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> highlighted the fact that more than 150 sex offenders are due to be released from jail by the year 2000.  They include some of the country's most harmful child abusers.  The impending release of paedophiles will instil fear and worry in communities, especially since Arbour Hill is the only prison to offer a sex offenders' treatment programme.  Only 30 prisoners have availed of this treatment since the introduction of the programme in 1994.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the issue of treatment for sex offenders is a subject for another debate but I urge the Minister to address the issue.  Treatment programmes must be introduced in all prisons where sex offenders are held.  There should be mandatory follow-up programmes on their release into the community.  Treatment for offenders in the younger age group of 17 to 20 is crucially important as research shows that this group responds best and has the greatest chance of reforming their ways.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> I urge the Government to support the Bill which would go some way towards protecting our children from convicted sex offenders.  I urge it to provide the necessary backup resources for the Garda Síochána, training for members of the Judiciary and treatment programmes for sex offenders in our prisons.  Acceptance of the Bill would go some way towards allaying the worries and fears of the parents of young children.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Neville on introducing this Bill.  My only criticism is that it should have been introduced a long time ago.  It is, nevertheless, timely.  We have heard that many sex offenders are due to be released from jail. Are we to allow these people to wander freely in the community?  One more child abused is one too many.  We have to gather the resources of the State to fight this growing evil.  This should have been done a long time ago.  I have four children. As Deputy Clune said, many people live in fear that something awful, terrible and unspeakable could happen to one of their children.</P>
      <P>It is horrific to consider that this country could become a safe haven for paedophiles.  As a former counsellor, I can testify that for many paedophiles there is no treatment or cure.  They are devious, clever and well organised.  They work so that they can get close to children and gain their confidence.  We must act immediately.  I urge the Government to accept this Bill, even if it is in need of amendment, but we should not waste time as the matter is too important.  These people, if one could call them that, use the Internet to spread their evil and communicate with each other.  It is important that the Garda Síochána have the necessary resources and power to keep track of them.  At the very least, it might act as a deterrent and prevent offenders coming here from other jurisdictions.  We have enough of our own without attracting others from other jurisdictions. We have been told that Britain has put its house in order to some extent.  It is time we put our house in order.  I ask the Minister to provide the necessary resources as soon as possible to implement the Bill.</P>
      <P>We must not pretend that the problem does not exist.  As a Deputy from Cork, I am horrified that paedophiles head south, the furthest point from Northern Ireland where a register is in place.  It was reported recently that a paedophile was living in east Cork.  People were afraid.  We turn to the Minister and the Government to support the Bill.  I am confident the Minister will agree with the spirit of the Bill, that it is timely and should have been introduced a long time ago.  It is important to send a strong message from this House to these people that they are not welcome and that if they do decide to come, they will be monitored, tracked and controlled.  It is frightening to think that people can gather together to plan to sexually abuse children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is balanced in that it safeguards the rights of individuals.  It is important, however, because it puts the rights of children to the fore. <Col N="881" /> I beg the Government to accept it in the name of humanity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Deputy Neville's Bill.  I commend the Deputy for the work he has put into this Bill.  I acknowledge his interest in introducing effective legislation in this area over a protracted period. Having introduced a number of Private Members' Bills in Opposition, I can fully appreciate the amount of time and effort that goes into preparing such legislation.  It is something that should not go unacknowledged.</P>
      <P>Having said that, however, while I accept fully the desirability of establishing a sex offenders' register, I will, for reasons that will presently become clear, be opposing the Bill.</P>
      <P>The primary aim of the Bill, as set out in its accompanying explanatory memorandum, is to require registration of offenders convicted of sexual offences against children.  Most responsible people would agree that this can play an important part in managing the risk of child sexual abuse.  In fact, the need for some type of register is beyond doubt.  The detail, however, such as whose names should be on it, how long those names should remain on it, who should decide in what circumstances, if any, those names should be removed and who should have access to it, are still matters for debate and decision.</P>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to introduce a register of sexual offenders.  I am fully committed to implementing the Government's intentions in this regard.  For some time now my Department has been carrying out a detailed study of the issues which arise from a system of registration of sex offenders.  That study has been undertaken in the context of a discussion paper on the law on sexual offences which I will publish in a week or two.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville is well aware that the publication of the discussion paper is imminent as it has been made clear to this House on a number of occasions that work on it was at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's Bill is somewhat minimalist in that it concentrates on only one aspect of registration, namely, the requirement to register <i>per se</i>.  The discussion paper, on the other hand, will contain a thorough analysis of the many other complex issues involved in the setting up and operation of a registration system.  The paper will, I hope, stimulate a public debate and encourage interested persons, professionals and bodies to make submissions to me and my Department on any changes to the law they believe necessary.  It will thus provide a backdrop against which all aspects of a register can be assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am keen to ensure that, in debating this Bill, we do not pre-empt the outcome of the debate that will undoubtedly ensue from the discussion paper and, in particular, that we do not deprive people of their opportunity to participate in the <Col N="882" /> consultation process.  With the publication of the discussion paper now imminent, this debate should help to stimulate an interest in aspects of the law on sexual offences, in particular a sex offenders' register and, as such, is welcome.</P>
    <P>In light of the outcome of the consultation process following publication of the discussion paper, I will bring forward proposals to Government without delay for whatever legislative measures may be deemed necessary and appropriate.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I would like to comment on the proposals before us.  There are some good, or potentially good, aspects to the Bill but it raises as many questions as it answers and, while I do not wish to overemphasise its drafting weaknesses, some would have consequences that I feel obliged to point out.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill contains the words and definitions used in the Bill.  The word &ldquo;child&rdquo; is not actually used in the Bill, but I presume it has been included with a view to limiting the scope of the Bill to persons convicted of sexual offences against children.  The long title and explanatory memorandum certainly seem to suggest that is the intention.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill, as drafted, would have the opposite effect.  It would require the registration of all offenders convicted of the sexual offences listed in the Schedule, regardless of whether they were committed against children.  While I am not sure if this is what Deputy Neville intended, it nevertheless raises an important question concerning the scope of any system of registration and who should be required to be registered.</P>
    <P>We should think carefully about the appropriateness of confining the register to persons convicted of sexual offences against children.  A case can well be made for a more expansive register dealing with a wider category of sex offender. While I do not want to prejudge the issue in advance of the consultation process, of which the discussion paper will be the catalyst, an important factor in considering the scope of a register may prove to be the likelihood of reoffending and not just the age of the victim or the nature of the offence.  This is, as I have intimated, one of the elements being addressed in the context of the discussion paper.</P>
    <P>Moving to the other definitions in section 1, the concepts of &ldquo;domestic profile&rdquo; and &ldquo;social profile&rdquo; could lead to problems.  For one thing, what does &ldquo;regular&rdquo; mean in each definition?  An event that occurs on one day a year every year could be said to be regular.  Also, what does &ldquo;professional assessment&rdquo; mean?  I would have thought that evidence from the prosecuting garda ought to be sufficient in some cases, but the Bill might rule this out.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on drafting points, but I should also mention that if, indeed, a sex offenders' register were to cover persons found &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo;, then consideration might need to be given to the question of providing also for the case where a person charged with a sexual <Col N="883" /> offence relevant to such a register was unfit to plead to the offence charged.</P>
    <P>Turning to section 3, I note that subsection (1) is taken from section 1 of the UK Sex Offenders Act, with the omission of persons who are cautioned by the police.  The reference in subsection (1) to persons &ldquo;convicted&rdquo;, however, would mean that some non-custodial sentences would also come within the scope of the Bill.  This seems to conflict with the requirement under section 4 of the Bill for persons to register upon release from detention or imprisonment.</P>
    <P>As to the type of sexual offences applicable, I will deal with these later when discussing the Schedule.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2)(c) of section 3 deals with the length of time the name of the convicted offender remains on the register.  This seems to be left to the court's discretion.  Subparagraph (e) would require the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, by regulation, to set out guidelines for the court to follow.  However, the section is silent on the nature of such guidelines or the criteria that should apply.  The Bill seems to be deficient in this respect because it would be left open to legal challenge as an unlawful and unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.  This House will know that Ministers cannot make regulations in a vacuum or on foot of vague primary legislation.  At the very least, it would be necessary to give an indication of time limits and criteria applicable to a person's registration.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom has dealt with this matter by way of primary legislation.  Under the 1997 Act the length of registration is determined by how the case is disposed of.  The Act sets out applicable lengths of registration on a graded scale proportional to the gravity of the punishment.  At the lower end of the scale a police caution or a non-custodial penalty results in registration for five years.  At the other end of the scale, imprisonment for 30 months or more results in registration for an indefinite period.  Furthermore, the duration of registration is halved for offenders aged under 18 years at the time of conviction.</P>
    <P>Subparagraphs (b) to (d) of section 3 deal with the court hearing evidence and making its decision.  The Bill omits to say at what stage in the proceedings the court would attend to this.</P>
    <P>The implication is that the decision would be made after conviction and determination of sentence but that is not clear.  If that is the case, the legislation would need to specify it.  However, would that be the best time to make such a decision?  People change, even sex offenders. What incentive would there be for a sex offender to undergo treatment while in prison if it made no difference to his or her name being placed on a register?</P>
    <P>I want to make two points on section 4.  It would be better for the prison governor to notify the Garda Síochána in advance of a pending release.  Notification after the event could prove too late and would defeat the purpose.  It may be <Col N="884" /> that advance notification was in fact intended but this is not clear from the drafting of subsection (1)(a).</P>
    <P>The second point relates to the requirement in subsection (1)(b) for the offender to physically report to his or her local Garda station within days of his or her release from prison.  I am not convinced that actual attendance at a Garda station should be a necessary prerequisite to the registration procedure getting under way.  Section 4(5) proposes that a person may opt to furnish the information to the Garda either orally or in writing.  The authenticity of fingerprints provided through the post would be open to question. There is also the point that fingerprints would be available to the Garda already since the time of investigation of the offence and charge.  It appears that the nature of the information to be furnished or registered and the mechanics of how information should be furnished would need to be thought through.</P>
    <P>Section 6 would bring certain child sex tourism offences within the scope of the Bill.  The offences mentioned are, by virtue of the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996, treated in law as if they were offences committed in this jurisdiction.  I query, therefore, why the Bill has dealt with them in a separate section as opposed to including them in the list of offences set out in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 7 would make persons who are subject to registration requirements under the United Kingdom 1997 law liable to notify the Garda upon their taking up residence here.  The explanatory memorandum describes this provision as an imperative for paedophiles who seek to escape the rigours of the United Kingdom Act.  I appreciate the motives behind the section but I have some reservations about its feasibility in practical terms.  We should not lose sight of the fact that failure to notify in the United Kingdom is already an offence under United Kingdom law punishable by up to six months imprisonment, not three years as would be the case under this Bill.  We should also bear in mind that well established channels of communication exist between the Garda and the United Kingdom police authorities whereby information and intelligence is exchanged on an operational basis.  This seems to be an area where co-operation not only on a bilateral but on a multilateral or European level would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>As regards section 8, I have already mentioned that the penalty maxima for a breach of the notification requirements far exceeds those provided for in the United Kingdom.  Under the 1997 United Kingdom Act, the offence is summary only and punishable by up to six months in prison. Under the Bill the offence is punishable by up to three years imprisonment on indictment. This could mean that a sexual offender in breach of the registration requirement, depending on the seriousness of the original offence, could end up spending more time in prison for the breach than he or she did for the original sexual offence.  From <Col N="885" /> the point of view of proportionality of punishment, therefore, the section is seriously suspect.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this provision which gives me cause for concern is that it takes no account of the age of the person found to be in breach. This is in contrast with the provision in the United Kingdom legislation where persons under 18 can be fined only and not imprisoned.  I assume that it followed a deliberate decision during the course of drafting.  Deputies will know that the Children Bill, 1996, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage in this House, proposes that no person under the age of 18 should be sentenced to imprisonment.  I am interested to know the reason Deputy Neville is now proposing a departure from that policy.</P>
    <P>One other consequence of section 8 is that it could potentially lead to the imprisonment of a prison governor or a medical director of a hospital for three years for failure on his or her part to notify the Garda of a sexual offender's date of release in accordance with section 4(1)(a). That may not be the intent but it is certainly the effect.</P>
    <P>Section 9 would confine access to the register to the Garda.  It proposes that disclosures to anyone other than the Garda could only be made after application to the High Court and then only in accordance with the limits laid down by that court.  The section is markedly lacking in any appreciation of the function a register should serve and the purposes for which information contained in the register might legitimately be used.</P>
    <P>In this regard it might be useful to refer to existing practices within the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Criminal Records Office maintains an index of all persons convicted of criminal offences, including persons convicted of sexual offences.  These records may be disclosed to third parties, such as the health boards or other prospective employers, with the consent of the individual concerned.  There are also times when the Garda need to share information with other law enforcement bodies both inside and outside the State.</P>
    <P>Section 9 would appear to outlaw these current practices if the register proposed in the Bill is intended to replace the present arrangements, at least in so far as the offences covered by the Bill are concerned.  It gives the impression of a register lying idle serving no useful function.  I hasten to add that I am certainly not advocating the gratuitous dissemination of information on such a register.  Neither do I want a situation where the register is a public document and prurient members of the public can visit their local town hall or surf the Internet to discover which of their neighbours are sex offenders.</P>
    <P>The information on the register would be of a highly sensitive and confidential nature.  It should only be disclosed when relevant and necessary in a formal and controlled manner on a case by case basis with safeguards to protect the individual concerned. Each and every disclosure would require a <Col N="886" /> balance to be struck between the legal and constitutional rights of the offender and the protection of other persons.  The requirement in the Bill to resort to the High Court every time a disclosure is anticipated would tilt that balance unduly.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill contains a list of offences which would be subject to the requirement to register.  As I said earlier, there is some confusion in the Bill as to whether a paedophile register or a more general sex offenders register is being proposed. On the one hand, the long title and the explanatory memorandum refer only to sexual offences against children.  On the other hand, the Schedule and the short title deal with sexual offences against persons of every age.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects to the Schedule which would require clarification.  I note the offences of unlawful carnal knowledge of girls under 15 and 17 years of age are not mentioned.  As those offences would be ones with which paedophiles, in particular, would be likely to be charged, I am surprised at this omission.  Neither is there any mention of incest by a female aged 17 years or more, though incest by males is listed.  Careful consideration needs to be given to the question of the offences to which a register should apply.</P>
    <P>I have shown this House has some way to go yet before approving legislation in this area.  The issue of a register of the nature we are discussing raises complex, sensitive and often constitutional concerns.  The Bill before us is narrow in focus in that it touches on only some aspects of such a register and many of its underlying policy considerations can be questioned.  Issues, such as who would maintain the register, whose names should appear on it and for how long, who should have access to it and in what circumstances should such access be granted and disclosures made, are not cut and dried.  Issues related to who decides to place names on a register and, if and when appropriate, to remove them, are also not as straight-forward as this Bill would lead one to believe. Other important related issues, such as post-release supervision and rehabilitative support of sex offenders, are also relevant to the decisions I will take in the light of the discussion paper.  That is not to say I disagree with the underlying aim of this Bill.  On the contrary, I have already taken the initiative in this area by prioritising the publication of the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences.</P>
    <P>While I commend Deputy Neville for his efforts in bringing forward this Bill, apart from the frailties I mentioned, it has the appearance of running ahead of the consultation process that will follow the publication of the discussion paper and thus depriving interested persons of the opportunity to put forward their views.  I am not prepared to operate on that basis.  I strongly believe this House owes it to those interested in the subject matter of this Bill to have the benefit of their views taken into account in whatever legislation is introduced in this House on the matter. The discussion paper will set a time limit for <Col N="887" /> the receipt of views, and I assure the House there will be no delay in acting on them and bringing forward fully thought out, comprehensive proposals for legislative reform.  For the reasons I outlined the Government opposes this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Neville on introducing this Bill and giving us the opportunity to debate the registration of sexual offenders.  I am disappointed the Minister will not accept it but I welcome his indication that he will produce a discussion paper and there will be a time limit for the receipt of views.  I urge him to consult widely and to ensure there will be no delay in introducing effective legislation.</P>
      <P>This is a timely and important debate which gives us an opportunity to examine ways of reducing the opportunity for sexual offenders to repeat their heinous offences.  It is not possible to describe the sense of terrible shock felt in our society in recent years over the type of revelations made particularly when people view our society as a caring one that values and protects our children.  People have to come to terms with the fact that appalling offences occurred over many years.  We must introduce effective legislation that deals with these offences and does not try to hide them.  We must learn from other countries that have introduced effective legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>Over the recent past the frightening level of abuse and exploitation inflicted, particularly on children, in Irish society has been laid bare.  For too many years we sought to ignore these offences and pretend they did not happen.  That attitude effectively facilitated the brutal acts perpetrated by sexual offenders.  The revelations of recent years exposed the dangers of that attitude. That attitude ignored the plight of those who suffered and, in effect, offered shelter and support to the criminals who perpetrated those acts.  As legislators, it is our duty to provide protective legislation that will no longer allow such things to happen.</P>
      <P>We must learn from the hurt and pain experienced by so many in the past, from the young boys and girls whose childhoods have been ripped apart and from the women who have been savagely raped and left for dead by sexual offenders. As legislators, there is an onus on us to design legislation and administrative systems that seek to protect society and to ensure criminals, who have perpetrated acts of abuse, are effectively prevented from doing so again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier speakers mentioned that legislation in this area is in place in the UK and some people are travelling to this jurisdiction because we do not have such effective legislation in place.  That means the need to introduce legislation in this area as soon as possible is even more urgent.  We must also examine ways to rehabilitate and educate offenders in so far as is humanly possible.  It is ironic that when we are debating this Bill the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform <Col N="888" /> stands over the shameful neglect of our prison system, nowhere more so than in the appalling failure to provide rehabilitation places for sex offenders.</P>
    <P>There was extensive media coverage of a case today, of the horrific details of the offences committed by the offender and of the life he had led up to the time of the offences.  Apparently that offender sought rehabilitation and treatment while in prison, but was not able to receive it.  It is extremely important that we should also examine the question of rehabilitation and the complex needs of people who have offended in this way. They are often people who have been horrifically treated in their childhood.  We cannot deal with one aspect of this matter without dealing with the rehabilitation, where possible, of offenders.</P>
    <P>The Bill offers ideas as to how we could go some way towards providing the protection we need for our society.  From my reading of it, it appears only those offenders convicted of sexual offences against children would be liable for inclusion on a register.  When Deputy Neville is replying to the Bill, he might indicate if that provision has a broader meaning, but from my understanding of it protection would be provided only in relation to offences against children.  That would apply to offences committed inside and outside this jurisdiction and would allow the courts to identify those particularly liable to repeat the crime of sexual abuse for inclusion on a register.  This is a complex issue and we must take care to ensure that proposals we make are effective, will provide real solutions and respect fundamental values.  A balance of values must be found in any legislation that will be introduced in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated he will produce a discussion paper and it is extremely important there should be consultation on this.  The question of how such a register would be used needs to be carefully examined.  This Bill restricts the use of a register exclusively to the Garda.</P>
    <P>In doing that, it may be that we will not be in a position to effectively deal with the consequences of sexual abuse.  The role of health boards and the probation service is important in ensuring not only that the offender does not repeat the horrific crime of sexual abuse, but making sure that the offender is actually supervised and steered from further crimes.  It is extremely important that there is co-operation between the Garda, the health boards and the probation service if we are to effectively use such a register.  In restricting it solely to the Garda, we should examine whether there are appropriate people within the health boards and probation service who should also have access to the register in particular cases.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not name the rank and file gardaí who will have access to the register.  However, it should specifically restrict access to those gardaí who have a specific reason to consult the register as it should not be a free for all for members of the Garda force. <Col N="889" /> This House needs no reminding of the grim past which has dogged so many young lives.  Sexual abuse of children has been widespread within families, within communities, within institutions and in social outlets.  The harrowing story of the McColgan family and the revelations of sexual abuse perpetrated by people to whom children and parents gave absolute trust &mdash; I include members of churches, swimming clubs, etc.  &mdash; have left many in shock.  In many cases the abuser is somebody in whom trust is placed.  Often they are people who can be persuasive that that trust is justified.  Therefore, it can be extremely difficult to withstand that kind of person who has the skills to encourage trust when, in fact, that trust is being abused.</P>
    <P>During the World Congress on the Sexual Abuse of Children held in Stockholm in 1996, UNICEF produced shocking figures in relation to child exploitation and abuse.  These figures showed that over one million children are entering the prostitution trade each year.  Many of these become deeply traumatised and hurt by the acts perpetrated on them.</P>
    <P>The horrific details of cases across Europe, particularly in Belgium where the vices of Marc Dutroux numbed a nation, point out the necessity of not only strong national laws to prevent this abuse, but also of the need for maximum co-operation between states.  This Bill provides a means to ensure that Ireland does not become a hideaway for paedophiles seeking to escape from the registers in their nation.  It ensures that Ireland can be put on an equal footing with those EU member states which have come out hard and strong against child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville indicated the use of the Internet in this regard.  Obviously, it is extremely difficult to control paedophile rings using the Internet but every effort must be made through international co-operation to exercise control.</P>
    <P>The question of legislation in relation to sex tourism has been dealt with, and I remember taking part in a debate in Seanad Éireann in that regard.  It is important that we protect children in other jurisdictions as well as in this one, and ensure people are not going abroad to perpetrate abuse on young children in other countries.</P>
    <P>Sexual offenders are, without doubt, one of the most difficult groups to supervise in the community. However, it has been cited time and again that one of the most effective ways of ensuring that offenders do not repeat such acts is through co-operation with the police and other agencies so that they can be monitored and supervised. The role of a register of offenders is, therefore, relevant in both preventing recidivism and in maximising the opportunity to afford treatment for the offender.  Restricting the register to the Garda may not offer that maximum level of protection.  We should consider limited access to the register for other relevant professionals, being careful to have the balance of rights so that there is no abuse of it and people's human rights are not violated in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> The arguments for a register are clear.  If we do not know where offenders live, to where they travel and how much access they have to children, we simply cannot uphold our function to act in the best interest of society</P>
    <P>On the introduction of a number of key Bills in Britain, including that of a Sex Offenders Act, which provides for a register, Joyce Quinn said: &ldquo;If sex offenders are not accommodated in this way [that is, through across the board co-operation with key institutions] we are in fact increasing the danger to the community by driving them away from safe and secure circumstances where they can be supervised, to a life underground where they may resurface, unknown and pose an even greater threat to children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The recent appearance by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, before the UN committee on the rights of the child and the subsequent report of that committee point to our failure, as a society, to provide adequate resources in terms of services and protection for our children.  The UN made a number of points in its report that the Government must address.  These shortfalls include the lack of co-ordination between agencies whose task it is to protect children and the lack of an ombudsman for children's rights.</P>
    <P>We must send out a signal to people involved in the sexual abuse of children that the State will not tolerate their heinous crimes.  For that reason, the Labour Party will support the Bill on Second Stage although we would not endorse each and every proposal therein.  I congratulate Deputy Neville on bringing forward the Bill and on moving the debate forward as a result.  I am disappointed that the Minister will not accept this Bill on Second Stage, but I welcome the fact that he is introducing a discussion paper in the immediate future.  I encourage him to waste no time in bringing forward effective legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Private Members' Bill, the Sexual Offenders Registration Bill, 1998 as it is useful to have a discussion on it.  Everybody in this House agrees with the underlying objectives behind this Bill, but we have a difficulty with it being presented in this form at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question we are looking at here is the sexual abuse of children.  In recent years this has become prevalent in Ireland and we have discussed it in the House on previous occasions.  I take the view &mdash; it is a personal view and there is no empirical evidence to support it or otherwise &mdash; that we are only lifting the lid on what was happening for a long number of years and which had not been reported.  It was being covered up. It is a sign of our openness and maturity that we are now able to face these issues which have been underneath our society for so long.  It is an old problem, but I am pleased to see that we are now starting to deal with it for the first time.  It is a compliment to this generation that we are prepared to do that.  It is a difficult and painful issue <Col N="891" /> for families and the victims who have been so abused over the years.</P>
    <P>It is important to note when we see so many cases reported of people accused of abusing children it comes out in their previous history that it happened to them when they were youngsters. This is further evidence that this issue should have been dealt with a long number of years ago.</P>
    <P>I especially thank the media on this whole issue because they have been highlighting this problem. Maybe some people, particularly older people, find it uncomfortable to listen to it every day, but the media has pursued the issue relentlessly.  They are to be complimented for highlighting the issue to the extent that people cannot walk away from it any more and pretend it is not happening.  It forces us into the reality of dealing with the situation and in that context Deputy Neville brought forward this Bill.  It is a sign of the times that we are having an open and public discussion in Parliament on this issue.  This type of debate would not have happened many years ago.</P>
    <P>It is not just an Irish problem.  It is a European and worldwide problem.  We are all aware of the issues in Belgium in recent times and the gravity of the problem is recognised at the highest level of Government there.  Not only is it happening in various countries, it is now transnational.  There is now child pornography on the Internet, a new phenomenon.  It is a whole new experience for us as legislators to face up to.  It is an issue that will probably take us a long time to come to grips with because it involves new, evolving, fast-changing technology, something with which legislators around the world have not come to grips.</P>
    <P>Some of the difficulties that will arise will relate to where the offence has been committed, whether it is where the pornography is produced, where it is put on the Internet, where the server provides it to customers, where it is transmitted or received, or in the house of the individual who uses the Internet facility.  I do not know the answers to those questions and the best minds in the world could not give definitive answers.  This is an issue that cannot be tackled in isolation by individual countries.  It is a wide issue which requires a worldwide response.</P>
    <P>Many questions have been raised about access to the register.  If we are to have a meaningful register there must be ready access to it.  There is no point having a hidden register because that would add further complication to the system.  An open register will, however, cause problems. Those issues have not been fully teased out in the Bill introduced by Deputy Neville.  While opposing the Second Reading of the Bill, Fianna Fáil supports the underlying objectives of the register. The Government action programme prioritises the introduction of such a register, which is welcome. The Bill is premature and pre-empts the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences which the Minister will publish shortly.  Nevertheless, it serves a useful purpose in bringing the issue before the House.  A register of sexual <Col N="892" /> offenders cannot be considered in isolation from other related issues which the discussion paper will address.  One of the basic problems with the Bill is that, while its focus is well intentioned, it is too narrow in its approach.</P>
    <P>The Bill is modelled on the UK Sex Offenders Act, 1997.  The UK Act was preceded by a Home Office consultation paper inviting comments from the public, in the same way that the forthcoming discussion paper will invite comments and stimulate and inform public debate on the matter.  It is important that is done at this stage.  As we are all aware, on issues of sexual offences and sexual morality it is difficult to get consensus.  There should be informed public debate on this issue before specific proposals are finalised.  It is important we get the legislation right rather than concentrate on its quick passage through the House.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill is confused in some respects.  I think it was Deputy Neville's intention to limit it to persons convicted of sex crimes against children, or so-called paedophiles, but as drafted the Bill would cover all sexual offences. The scope of the register needs to be carefully considered.  The discussion paper will deal with this matter and raise issues for debate without taking a particular stance.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that the main objective of the Bill is to deter offenders from recidivism.  Some of the information on this matter is not based on fact.  There has not been sufficient research into this issue to draw conclusions on it.  This matter should be further investigated and statistics sought not only in regard to Ireland but also other countries.  We need to know the reoffence rate in this regard.</P>
    <P>The question of a treatment programme for sex offenders in prison is relevant to discussion on this matter.  This issue came into the public arena today.  I hope greater resources will be provided in this area.  It is not sufficient that there are only ten places in prisons for treatment of sex offenders.  It is important that that number is increased because an increasing number of the prison population are there for committing sex offences.  That issue will have to be addressed. Neglect of this area is not the fault of the last or the current Government.  This issue has come into the public arena only in recent times and we are starting to face up to it and provide the necessary framework and resources to deal with the problems. There will be improvements in this regard in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>Drafting of the Bill appears to have been hurried and flawed.  The substance needs to be thrashed out in greater detail.  Section 1 of the UK 1997 Act covers persons cautioned by the police and non-custodial sanctions.  This Bill is confined to persons sentenced to imprisonment or detention, or found guilty but insane.  Under section 3 of the Bill there is a requirement for the Minister to introduce regulations and secondary legislation setting out guidelines for a court to follow in determining how long a person will be on <Col N="893" /> the register.  This could be struck down as an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the Executive.  The question of how long a person should be on the register and at what stage, if ever, the person's name should be cleared must be thrashed out in further detail.  There should be greater transparency on this issue.  Primary legislation should set down some indication of the time limit applicable to this matter.  It should not be deferred, as suggested in the Bill.  The UK Act dealt with this point in primary legislation, but it is not clear why it is not dealt with in this Bill. Perhaps Deputy Neville is not happy with the UK approach, but given that he followed the UK Act in such detail in many respects I am curious to know why he did not follow it in this case.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is modelled closely on section 2 of the UK Act, but that Act does not require finger-printing or the provision of a photograph.  The mechanisms on how the requisite information is to be collated are not clear from the Bill.  Subsection (1)(b) states that the offenders shall report to the local Garda station, but subsection (5)(b) refers to written notification.  We must be consistent in our approach to this issue.  I compliment Deputy Neville on the Bill, but there are a number of technical faults in it and, therefore, it would be inappropriate to pass it at this stage.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals only with persons subject to registration requirements in the UK.  This is one of the biggest flaws in the Bill.  As has been stated, this is not just an Irish or an English problem, it is a worldwide problem.  I do not know the reason for the suggestion that registration requirements relate specifically to the UK.  What about other countries that have registration systems? They need to be considered and provided for.  Before finalising debate on this issue there must be co-ordination at European level.</P>
    <P>On a wider issue, the provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty on greater co-operation between police forces in various European countries through Interpol will, in time, provide greater scope for preventing transnational crimes.  Again I highlight the question of Internet crimes, crimes on computers to which many people have access.</P>
    <P>The penalty of up to three years' imprisonment for breach of the notification requirement seems excessive.  To make prison governors subject to the same sanction for failing to comply with the requirement to notify the Garda Commissioner in writing as laid down in section 4(1) is drastic.  I understand why there should be a penalty for failure by the prison governor to notify the Garda, but the sanctions proposed are too extreme and need to be considered.  That point must be considered in the wider debate.</P>
    <P>The requirement for a Garda inspector to have High Court approval in advance of disclosures of information from the register is incredibly unwieldy and flies in the face of current Garda practice.  Fianna Fáil opposes the Bill.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>Whatever we may wish to assume, we cannot dismiss the claimants.  Leaving aside the Irish case there is adequate global evidence of hearing disability being caused in the manner which some claimants are describing.  Our problem is not the claimants, it is the absence of an effective and fair system of assessing the state of each claim against accepted measurement of disability.  That the State failed for a long period to put in place such a system is not the fault of claimants.  Were such a system in place, those claims which would not stand up to scrutiny would fall and only the genuine claimants with real disability would receive compensation.</P>
      <P>We cannot rely on a strategy that aims to convince the public that a large percentage of these claims are false or questionable.  Neither can we rely on a strategy that may be designed, directly or indirectly, to indicate to the Judiciary that it should reduce compensation or dismiss cases.</P>
      <P>The absence of facts in identifying or quantifying the level of real cases of hearing disability, as opposed to hearing loss, which is a result of service in the Defence Forces means we are simply guessing on many occasions.  The guesswork relies on the assumption that many of these claims are at worst false or at best an exaggeration. The lack of an agreed standard has made this difficult to quantify.  I welcome the work of the expert group in this regard.  It has also apparently meant that in a certain percentage of cases &mdash; the Minister referred to a number of individual cases &mdash; those with low levels or, perhaps, no level of disability have received compensation. This is contrary to what would happen in other jurisdictions.  It has become an easy option to point to the development of a compensation culture in Ireland and to the relatively high level of claims.  However, we must inquire into the origin of the message that claiming compensation for everything is acceptable.  Going down this route we come to a much wider failure of our society to inculcate respect for the community and the nation at every level.  We have not legislated in this area and a report, to which I will refer later, has suggested some parameters or different methods which might be used in dealing with claims.  Consideration must be given to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue must be approached on the basis that claims may be valid and, at the very least, that claimants have a right to make their claim, while <Col N="895" /> at the same time ensuring that the system is rigorous, fair and clear.  Those initiating claims should make a judgment as to whether their circumstances warrant an assessment for compensation. The same is surely true of lawyers who are currently able to advise their clients and potential clients in a virtual vacuum.  They did not create that vacuum so there is little point in blaming those messengers for the situation in which we find ourselves.  However, I condemn excessive advertising by solicitors on this issue.  If there was a proper framework there would not be the considerable space which has been allowed to develop in which a very wide range of cases can expect to be taken successfully.</P>
    <P>This is not the first occasion on which this House has left it to the courts to arrive at decisions.  At times it has suited that this should be the case, particularly when legislators have found it uncomfortable to address certain issues. However, to castigate members of the Judiciary for making judgments based on what is stated in law and what they see before them is akin to shooting the messenger.</P>
    <P>With regard to legal tactics, cases are defended in large numbers to the steps of the courts where settlements are made without admitting liability and with the attendant legal costs.  I believe I am correct in stating that no case has been appealed on to the Supreme Court.  This raises the question of whether the AMA test and standard should have been appealed to that court.  I am aware appeal proceedings were entered into in one case but it was withdrawn when agreement was reached.  Has the AMA standard been tested at Supreme Court level?  I do not believe it has.  The argument has been made that this is the best course of action because court decisions are unpredictable.  However, this makes a mockery of our insistence that there is no liability.  There may be a fine legal point here but to the people the money is being paid and the effect is the same.  I question whether the legal strategy on this simple and practical matter is having an impact on those issues with which we are concerned.</P>
    <P>Have the cases settled given us any clear pattern in terms of the range of seriousness involved?  I respect the context in which the Minister quoted a number of individual cases earlier in the debate.  However, the vast majority of cases &mdash; 1,431 according to the Minister on 22 April &mdash; have been settled without court hearings.  In terms of a pattern, the answer based on this evidence is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Could the State be said to have played directly into the hands of those who may be pursuing untenable claims by ensuring that in so many cases the judicial test is not applied? There is a sensible and pragmatic way of dealing with the situation and, in doing so, of attempting to ensure that we do not face a similar shambles in the future.</P>
    <P>We must begin by addressing the issue and not denying it.  Stereotyping the claimants, their lawyers and the courts is a waste of energy.  There <Col N="896" /> are, without doubt, people who have served in the Defence Forces who have suffered hearing disability as a result of that service.  Equally, we have a huge quantum of claims, some opportunistic, some unfounded.</P>
    <P>The Government must clearly state that it intends to provide leadership which is fair, balancing the rights of individuals who have suffered a disability with the right of the nation as a whole. I have no doubt that the people would accept a fair assessment system, with clear guidelines matching payment levels with the seriousness of the disability, as long as that system was seen to protect their rights.  They would back an administrative system of dealing with such compensation claims as long as it was not introduced primarily to give the State the upper hand.  However, I accept that a difficult hill remains to be climbed. I also accept that the Minister is operating in a complex situation trying to find a direction which will prove effective.</P>
    <P>This Bill may or may not be effective.  I have a number of concerns regarding its constitutionality and its capacity to have the desired effect should it prove constitutional.  My concern relates to the separation of authority and powers of the Executive and the Judiciary.  The Bill has been carefully drafted but it raises the question as to whether the nature of the direction it contains could be deemed to respect that principle.  Equally, there is the matter of the courts applying such legislation to claims which are already in train.  It remains to be seen whether this is constitutional</P>
    <P>Going beyond the constitutionality issue, there is then the question of the language in the Bill. What precisely will the phrase in section 3 &ldquo;Judicial notice shall be taken of the Report&rdquo; be deemed to mean, or in section 4 &ldquo;the Courts shall, in determining the extent of the injuries suffered, have regard to Chapter 7&rdquo;?  How will the term &ldquo;have regard&rdquo; be interpreted?  If it is not interpreted to the satisfaction of the State, will decisions be appealed on this point of law?  Will the courts be bound to &ldquo;have regard&rdquo;?  Could some judges &ldquo;have regard&rdquo; while others ignore the legislation?  Even with cases entered after the enactment of this legislation, will judges be bound by the Bill's provisions?  A number of the potential steps to be taken beyond this legislation are not clear.</P>
    <P>Assuming the House passes the Bill, it will go to the President who may exercise her right to refer it to the Supreme Court.  If she does and it fails the test, we are back to square one.  If she does not, then there is always the potential for a challenge from a claimant, when the Bill may fall. Whether with reference from the President or through a challenge from a claimant, if the Bill is found to be constitutional we will then move to the next test in the courts, namely, how will it be applied by the Judiciary.  Since there is still no connection between levels of disability and compensation, we may or may not see a reduction in compensation awarded and therefore in the cost to the State.  If the judges do not apply it, or apply <Col N="897" /> it with reference to a scale which the State considers still to be too generous, then little or nothing will have changed.</P>
    <P>The impact of this Bill is unreliable and, even if it is applied, it may or may not reduce the costs involved.  All the claims may be found to be genuine, but in the likely event that the guidelines in the Bill apply and eliminate those which are untenable or fall below the threshold, we are still none the wiser as to the impact on the bottom line.  We are still operating speculatively &mdash; guessing that this percentage or that may not be successful &mdash; but totally unaware of the numbers likely to fall into this category or the range of seriousness of those which remain.</P>
    <P>In many ways the Bill represents a mere tinkering at the edges of a serious problem.  It is an absolute disappointment for those who would look for a radical solution to a serious problem of public policy.  It may be unconstitutional, it is minimalist and, given the Minister's expressed concerns, seriously so.  It may, depending on the response in the courts, put some perimeters around tariffs for different levels of disability.  In effect, the Minister is attempting to adjust the speed of the windscreen wipers as the car drives over the cliff, such is the scale, according to himself, of this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered more radical solutions?  For example, what consideration has been given to substituting hearing disability pensions for awards in the civil courts and introducing legislation for this?  A system of disability pensions could have the following advantages: it would take the whole compensation system for Army hearing loss out of the courts and eliminate most, if not all, of the legal fees; it would allow the expert report which is at the heart of this Bill to be used as a tariff, not merely as some sort of guide which has to be taken notice of in some uncertain way; it could form the basis for a clear and fair tariff of hearing disability pensions which could be administered by officials with the sort of experience that exists in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs; and specialised staff in the Department of Defence could be trained.  Such a system would have the advantage of removing the attraction of large lump sums and would have the effect of spreading the burden of payment over a longer period.</P>
      <P>What consideration has been given to such a scheme?  What would be the disadvantages of it? It would not be in replacement of the right to sue. If personnel wished to sue they could do so, but the pensions would have to be taken into account. The scheme would introduce a certainty because there is a tariff.  It would use existing Civil Service expertise and experience and would reduce legal costs immensely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> We need a reformed Army Pensions Board and a State claims agency to ensure the more efficient and rational management of claims taken against the State.  This is a huge problem facing this country at a time when we are subject to EMU and Maastricht guidelines and when we need to carefully manage the economy.  It has the potential to interfere totally with that management.  The volume of potential as well as current claims is an issue.  As the Minister said this evening, even at a conservative estimate we are talking about a large amount of money.  It is impossible to predict the numbers of actual cases which will come before the courts in the years ahead.  How many of the 150,000 potential claimants will actually claim? There is also the possibility of claims coming in from State employees in other sectors.  The potential is enormous.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to detail the number of factors which have come together to create this situation but they range from the fact that there is no system in the Army of compensation for injury.  Advice was circulated widely in the Defence Forces that there was no case to answer.  The Minister stated that was at an early stage and that liability should be conceded, and I accept that.  Another factor was the lack of a hearing disability assessment test, which has now been remedied.  Other factors include the Statute of Limitations and the enactment of the new safety legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the hearing disability assessment report.  This is a relatively conventional report which questions the point at which one regards a degree of loss as a disability and sets out parameters.  Obviously the report does not deal with causation.</P>
    <P>Putting this hearing disability assessment into legislation is an exceptional measure for an extraordinary situation.  It is an attempt to ask the courts to have regard to a particular hearing standard with the expectation that a scale of compensation will then be developed for hearing loss.  It appears to be well grounded on mainstream scientific analysis.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that this is a reasonable report.  I do not believe it is designed to knock people out of the system but as a reasonable standard to assess hearing disability.  The report also takes age and tinnitus into account.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Johnson in judgments on 13 March and 21 April l998 stated:</P>
    <P>If the legislature wished the Courts to accept any specific standard, then it is for the legislature to legislate to that end.  It is not for the Courts to make Law, it is for the Courts to interpret Law..</P>
    <P>In the particular case to which he referred, Mr. Justice Johnson also noted that no stay was asked for in the High Court or in the Supreme Court. In his second judgment, Mr. Justice Johnson pointed out the difficulty of the lack of an agreed standard and highlighted the fact that expert witnesses can still be found who would disagree with the standard, if it existed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> There is a series of Supreme Court decisions dealing with the judicial process and the separation of powers, the most famous of which is Buckley <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, often called the Sinn Féin case.  In that case the Oireachtas was not allowed to pass legislation while a case was before the courts.  The opinion given at the time stated: &ldquo;In our opinion this is clearly repugnant to the provisions of the Constitution, as being an unwarrantable interference by the Oireachtas with the operations of the courts in a purely judicial domain&rdquo;.  This principle was also examined in a number of other cases, including Deaton <i>v.</i> the Attorney General and de Vito <i>v.</i> the State.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the group established by the Government in l996 to develop a personal injuries tribunal which made a number of suggestions. The majority of the working party recommended the establishment of a court-based occupational injuries mediation service.  What further developments have there been in that regard?</P>
    <P>This legislation is unusual.  It is an attempt to deal with a complex problem.  Fine Gael will support the legislation despite the fact that we have some problems with it.  We need to establish a system that is fair to the claimants, clear and rigorous. The sooner the better we put in place that type of system because it will enable us to move forward.  The legislation may be found to be unconstitutional but, even if it goes ahead, it is not necessarily the answer to this complex problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on making the effort to bring forward this legislation.  We are all concerned about this problem and the cost to the Exchequer.  As Deputy Fitzgerald pointed out, we are also concerned about the impact on morale in the Defence Forces.  Having had discussions with members of the Defence Forces, I am aware that morale is currently quite low.  I caution against scapegoating members of the Defence Forces on this issue.</P>
      <P>I want to raise an issue which I have raised on a number of occasions in the past.  We are debating this Bill tonight because of a certain degree of negligence on the part of the State.  Proper hearing protection was not provided.  As the Minister said earlier, we are talking about a different time when perhaps people did not know any better.  I have had first hand experience of people who were told to remove hearing protection on firing ranges because they had not been issued with it.  Currently, members of An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí are not issued with personal hearing protection.  They are expected to share the ear defenders among themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could soon be back in this House discussing liability arising from a problem which is being experienced now.  Picture the situation where somebody is on the ranges, perspiring, and wearing an ear defender.  When he is finished he takes it off and throws it into a box.  It should be cleaned, <Col N="900" /> but is not because cleaning swabs are not available.  Personnel are meant to wear a type of protective device or sheet between the ear and the ear defender.  That does not happen either. Where will we stand if a member of An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil gets an ear infection because of this?  I ask the Minister to ensure that all members of An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí are issued with personal ear defenders forthwith.  It is not good enough that members have to share them.  Surely we have learned something from what went on in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have been told that these items are issued to personnel, but I made inquiries and was told otherwise.  Personnel in these organisations have not seen these items.  To ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past we should ensure that the members of the FCA and An Slua Muirí are issued with proper ear defenders.  There is another type of ear defender, for use with heavy weapons, and members of the FCA should be issued with them.</P>
    <P>What arrangements are there to look after a member of the FCA who has been injured, and is perhaps out of work as a result?  Perhaps the Minister will address that issue in his reply.  My information is that if members of the FCA or An Slua Muirí are hurt and hospitalised, it is their tough luck.  They are not looked after.  In the context of this debate the Minister might take this on board because it is an important issue and it has been neglected for quite a while.</P>
    <P>I beg the forgiveness of the House for digressing from the subject of the debate, the Civil Liability (Assessment of Hearing Injury) Bill, 1998, but what I am saying is relevant.  I want to avoid the possibility of us having to come back here before long to discuss the question of serious ear infections because of the lack of proper ear defenders.  Compared to the overall budget the amount of money involved in issuing proper ear defenders to all members of the Defence Forces would be extremely small, but we are talking about hundreds of millions, if not billions of pounds, on the one hand while on the other we are penny-pinching.  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>I have a difficulty with the Civil Liability (Assessment of Hearing Injury) Bill, 1998 in that it may be unconstitutional.  How will cases before the courts at the moment be dealt with?  Will they be allowed to proceed?  Will this Bill apply only to injuries incurred from now on or will it have retrospective effect?  Are the rules now being changed in respect of somebody who was injured ten, 15 or 20 years ago?  It is a question on which we need to reflect.</P>

      <P>The Bill before the House deals with an issue that has caused grave concern within the <Col N="901" /> Defence Forces and throughout the wider community. Army deafness and the subsequent compensation claims before the courts are an important issue for all our citizens.  There is genuine concern among PAYE taxpayers over the total cost of these claims to the Exchequer. People are also concerned that some of the claims before the courts are opportunistic and that the absence of a common standard for hearing loss is rewarding dubious claimants.  These opinions have been to the fore in the public debate regarding Army deafness claims.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this saga which is of equal seriousness, the effect on the morale of our armed forces engendered by the public debate on Army deafness claims.  Since the foundation of the State our Defence Forces have earned and enjoyed the respect of citizens. They have a proud role in protecting the nation's vital interests and in contributing to peacekeeping missions across the globe. However, in the current climate this history of service and sacrifice of our Defence Forces has been largely forgotten.  The near constant abuse that members of the Defence Forces have endured from some sources is having a devastating effect on morale within the force.  This is extremely serious and it is imperative that the Minister addresses this issue and outlines the steps he is taking to rectify the situation.</P>
      <P>At the outset of any debate on the current cases before the courts, it is necessary to state the origins of the controversy.  For decades Defence Forces personnel in this State were sent on firing ranges without ear protection.  This practice was continued even when the Department was made aware of the health risks associated with it.  As a result of this negligence many members of the Defence Forces suffered severe damage to their hearing.  They have a right to seek recompense for this damage to their health.  They should not be ridiculed for doing so and they deserve the same protection and right of recourse to the law as any other workers who believe that their employer has been negligent or unnecessarily placed their health at risk.  This fundamental point has often been lost in the tumult of concern expressed at the exposure of the State to the totality of claims, and it needs to be restated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the actions, or more properly the inaction, of the State over many decades has resulted in serious hearing loss to thousands of former and serving members of the Defence Forces.  There is no getting away from this basic fact.  We cannot wish away the reality that the State has an obligation to compensate these persons for the suffering they have endured. We cannot wish away the fact that thousands of people genuinely suffered significant hearing loss due to the failings of the State.  Nor can we wish away the fact that the eventual cost to the State of the actions currently before the courts will be substantial, regardless of the standards established in the Green Book.  In a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 10 April it was estimated that even if <Col N="902" /> the standards proposed in the Green Book were accepted by the court without exception 70 per cent of cases would still go through for a full hearing and the bill for public expenditure would still remain at between £1.5 billion and £2 billion.  This is the legacy of past negligence by the State and, enormous though the cost implications are, it must be accepted as a bottom line in this debate.</P>
    <P>Just as there is a duty on the State to compensate people for genuine damage suffered through negligence, there is also a duty on the State to prevent bogus claimants from winning awards due to the complexity of the scientific evidence regarding hearing loss.  This is what the Green Book attempted to do and what the Bill seeks to address.</P>
    <P>In principle, the Labour Party welcomes the publication of a Bill that attempts to establish an independent standard to assess hearing loss.  The absence of such a standard has been central to the current controversy.  However, there are issues of concern in the Bill which I hope the Minister will clarify during the course of the debate.  It is particularly important that the Minister responds as fully as possible to the questions raised by all speakers in this debate due to the speed with which this legislation has been introduced and the speed with which it is proposed to pass it through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill applies to all court proceedings, whether commenced before or after its enactment, and it is not confined to the Army cases. Section 3 provides that, in all hearing injury cases, judicial notice shall be taken of the report of the expert hearing group contained in the Green Book.  Judicial notice is a means by which a matter can be received in evidence without formal proof.</P>
    <P>The report can simply be handed into court without the need to call its authors to give sworn evidence that they wrote it and that it contains their opinions.  Section 4 provides that, in determining the extent of hearing injury, a court shall &ldquo;have regard&rdquo; to chapter 7.  The effect of the two sections is to create a specific exemption to the general rule governing the admissibility of evidence from experts, such as the authors of the Green Book.  While the section changes the rule which would otherwise govern admissibility, it does not ordain the weight to be given to the report when admitted in evidence.</P>
    <P>Lay witnesses must, generally speaking, give evidence only as to the facts which they have observed and not of the inferences which they have drawn from such facts.  However, the opinions as distinct from the factual observations of expert witnesses are admissible when the person giving the opinion has a particular expertise or experience in the relevant area based on a special study of day to day experience.  The burden of proof with regard to the expertise of an expert witness rests on the person tendering evidence. The witness must give evidence under oath, establish his or her credentials and be available <Col N="903" /> for cross examination by the other side.  The Bill abolishes the need to comply with each of these requirements.  However, a court is not compelled to accept as binding the conclusions of the report: it must merely have regard to it.  This is in essence the import of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of questions arise which need clarification. Section 2 of the Bill refers to proceedings before a court, whether commenced before or after the enactment of this Bill.  In my experience it is extremely unusual for legislation to be enacted which impinges on cases that have already commenced.  It also raises the prospect that this legislation may come before the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.  Will the Minister outline the legal advice he has received on this specific matter and give precedents whereby legislation enacted by the Oireachtas impinged on cases already commenced in the courts?</P>
    <P>The key element of the Bill hinges on the principle of judicial notice.  It is important to note that the legislation does not require the court to accept the Green Book as the only reliable assessment of hearing loss.  Judicial notice will only ensure that the findings of the Green Book can be treated as evidence.  As such they can be challenged by claimants in court and it is also highly likely that the report will be challenged by the plaintiffs.  There will in all likelihood be a test case in which the authors of the report will give evidence on behalf of the State and the courts will then decide the status and weight the report shall have in relation to all cases.</P>
    <P>This begs the question as to whether this legislation is necessary in the first place.  Surely the Green Book findings could be presented by the State's defence in any case and it does not take an Act of the Oireachtas to require the court to consider this evidence.  If there was no legislation, the State would still seek to rely on the new assessment system.  The authors would give evidence on its behalf and a test case would be decided.  All subsequent cases would be determined on similar lines because, even though plaintiffs could notionally object to evidence being admitted without formal proof, they would in all likelihood be punished for incurring unnecessary costs.</P>
    <P>In light of this it is difficult to see what can be claimed on behalf of the Bill.  The question arises as to whether the Minister is introducing the legislation merely for the sake of being seen to do something regarding the cases before the courts.  Will the Minister explain the advice he received from the Attorney General regarding the necessity for the Bill?  Is it not the case that the future legal import of the Green Book does not require legislation; that a test case of the accuracy or otherwise of the findings of the Green Book will be clarified by the courts and that this would be the case without the passage of legislation?</P>
    <P>There is also a specific aspect of the Green <Col N="904" /> Book report that I would like the Minister to clarify, especially as it is included in Part 1 of the Schedule to the Bill, namely, the fact that the air conduction hearing threshold levels are not taken at the 3,000 hertz level.  By deleting the 3,000 hertz level there is a clear imbalance in the assessment levels and it is important to note that the original Defence Forces regulations issued by the then Minister, Deputy Andrews, in October 1997 included the assessment at the 3,000 hertz level. Will the Minister explain why this level was not included in the Green Book and indicate if he is open to accepting amendments to the Bill which would restore it?</P>
    <P>It is important to state that this Bill will not of itself resolve the problems that have entangled the Army deafness hearings.  Indeed there is a legitimate question as to whether the Bill is necessary as the final decision of the weight to be attached to the Green Book findings will be clarified by the courts.</P>
    <P>However, I accept the bona fides of the Minister in his attempt to resolve the matter and, while I have reservations regarding the manner in which he approached his recent High Court hearing when seeking an adjournment of cases before the courts, I wish him well in his endeavours.</P>
    <P>The Army deafness cases have produced much comment in the media.  Many people are outraged at the total sum of money that the State may be required to pay out.  It is right that the State should attempt to limit its exposure to those who have been genuinely injured or impaired by their time in the armed forces.  The Labour Party supports the Government in this regard.  However, the reality is that, regardless of what standard of hearing loss is accepted, there was gross negligence in the past.  This negligence has affected thousands of Defence Forces members and they, in common with every other citizen, have a right to seek recompense for the pain and suffering they endure.  The eventual cost to the State will be substantial.</P>
    <P>In the face of these facts we must move to end the cloud of suspicion that has hung over many members of the Defence Forces.  We have produced the Green Book, the courts will establish the weight to be attached to it and genuine cases will proceed on this basis.  Bogus claims must be rooted out and dismissed.  However, the real blame for this ongoing saga does not rest with individual members of the Defence Forces but, ultimately, with the State for failing in its duty to protect the health of its employees in the past.</P>
    <P>Health and safety of employees has for too long been treated as a second class issue by some employers, including, as evidenced in the Army deafness cases, the State.  This culture must be changed and we have made some progress in this matter over recent years.  However, the tragic death some months ago of a young man on a Dublin building site points to the vital importance of the effective enforcement of our health and safety legislation and the urgent need for more resources to be provided for the Health and <Col N="905" /> Safety Authority to enforce legislation and inform workers of the protection afforded them under it.  These are the long-term lessons to be learned from the Army deafness saga.</P>
    <P>After guiding the Bill through the House the matter will again be in the hands of the courts. The most urgent task facing the Minister then will be to restore morale within the Defence Forces. It is an institution that has been greatly undermined over the recent past.  Some individual members of the force bear partial responsibility for this.  However, the entire membership of the Defence Forces has been unjustly subject to unbalanced criticism and ridicule.  This has had a serious effect on the public image of the Defence Forces and the Minister has responsibility for redressing the balance, something he must do at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for the speed with which he delivered his contribution &mdash; I could have avoided much surgery on my own speech.  I propose to allow time for Deputy Timmins.</P>
      <P>This legislation is the latest instalment in a saga which has reflected little credit on any of those involved.  Senior Army officers who failed to ensure proper procedures were in place to protect the health and safety of its personnel, successive Ministers for Defence who failed to take action and allowed the drift to continue, a minority of military personnel who saw an opportunity to milk the system and greedy lawyers who saw the prospect of fat legal fees must all share the blame for the financial and legal morass of the Army deafness issue.  The only ones deserving our sympathy are those soldiers who suffer genuine hearing loss as a result of negligence and whose health and social lives have suffered as a result.</P>
      <P>The entire saga has been bad for morale among the Defence Forces, with soldiers, the vast majority of whom have served at home and overseas with courage, honour and distinction, becoming the subject of cheap jokes and jibes from not very funny comedians.  We are left with an appalling, expensive and demoralising mess for which nobody has been called to account.  Nobody at political, official or military level has been called to account for negligence or incompetence in landing the taxpayer and the Defence Forces in this mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little doubt the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence were negligent in not ensuring their own limited regulations concerning ear protection were adhered to.  At different times cotton wool, cotton wool with vaseline and hard ear plugs were provided.  According to the Public Accounts Committee, over £500,000 was spent by the Department of Defence on ear protection since 1972.  As far back as 1952 the medical evidence associating repeated weapon use with hearing damage was well known to the Department.  Regulations were issued by the Defence Forces at different times, but they have been largely ignored.  Who was responsible for <Col N="906" /> ensuring that the Defence Forces exercised a reasonable duty of care for the people for whom they were responsible?  Since taking office the Minister for Defence has adopted a very macho approach to the whole problem, depicting himself as some sort of administrative Rambo who will rescue the taxpayer being held to ransom by greedy and opportunistic soldiers.  So far, however, we have seen little evidence of results from this posturing.  The Minister's attempt to have all the cases deferred until the autumn has been rebuffed by the High Court and the cases will start being heard again shortly.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the latest attempt at damage limitation. Given that measuring hearing loss is a very difficult and complex matter, not easily understood by people other than members of the medical profession specialising in this area, and given that there was no standard assessment in this country for measuring hearing loss, it was not unreasonable for the Minister to establish a working group of experts to devise such a system of assessment.  That working group has produced a report and I do not consider it unreasonable that the courts should be asked to take notice of its findings in considering claims before the courts. The Bill obliges the courts only to take notice or have regard to, not necessarily accept, the report. Neither, as I read the Bill, is there anything to stop the court from taking other reports or standards into account.</P>
    <P>However, I am concerned that the Bill applies not just to future cases but also to proceedings commenced prior to its enactment.  This seems to be a departure from the legal norm and must surely raise serious questions about the constitutionality of the measure.  It is virtually certain that the Bill will face legal challenge in the courts and it will be the Judiciary who will determine whether it conforms with the Constitution.  The courts have been vigorous in defending their constitutional independence and it would be a brave person who would forecast that this provision will be found to be constitutional.</P>
    <P>The right of any person to go to the courts to seek compensation where he or she believes they have suffered personal injury as a result of negligence on the part of their employer is a fundamental principle of our law and one which should not be interfered with.  Soldiers are citizens and they are entitled to the same degree of protection and care from their employer as any other person. They are entitled to the same access to the courts as any other citizen.  Whatever about the past, we must make sure that such unnecessary risk to the health and safety of our soldiers never happens again.  In this regard the continued refusal of the Minister to allow the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 to apply to members of the Defence Forces is particularly inexplicable. The last annual conference of PDFORRA was told of Army drivers falling asleep at the wheels of lorries because of the long hours they are asked to work.  Even if, for legal reasons, it is difficult to formally apply the Act's provisions to the <Col N="907" /> Defence Forces, surely there could be a policy decision that it would be applied voluntarily and by Army regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Wall and De Rossa for sharing time with me.  When I was a child I was often told about the great Fianna Fáil organisation.  I see proof of this this evening with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on the Front Bench ready to speak on this subject as he tries to reclaim the postal vote in the Limerick East constituency.  I note his tactical ploy.  I also note Deputy Collins is present in case the virus spreads out west.</P>
      <P>This country does not have a long established military tradition.  One is most unlikely to find a roll of honour in any vaguely public place of members of the Defence Forces who were killed in the course of duty or otherwise at home or abroad.  Virtually all such remembrances refer to Irish people who served with the British forces in the Boer War and in the First and Second World Wars which are generally to be found on the internal walls of churches.  It is strange, and rather sad, that more Irish wolfhounds, who played the role of mascot to various British regiments, have been acknowledged with a small monument than members of the Defence Forces who were killed in action.  While such acknowledgment gives no great consolation, it certainly poses a question as to why this is the case.</P>
      <P>The initial brutal birth of our Army was finally laid to rest with the changeover of Government in 1932 as the force became an institution of the State that was above reproach.  Yet in the 1940s and early 1950s most young Galway girls, when walking along Shop Street in the city on a Sunday afternoon, opted for Moon's side of the street lest they would have to meet soldiers who, having walked along the railway line from Renmore, remained on the Skeffington Arms side of the street as they headed down to the west end.</P>
      <P>Up to the early 1970s a serving soldier who managed to recruit a new member was rewarded with a sum of £5.  Prison or the army was an often used judicial cry as enlistment in the force was once viewed as today's equivalent of community service.  It is said that in the initial days of service in the Congo, the heat was so intense and the troops were so ill-equipped in their bulls-wool uniforms that they occasionally wore pyjamas during the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come a long way since then and despite the neglect of several Governments over many decades our Defence Forces have carved out a niche for themselves which has earned the respect of all other nations who have served with them.  This status was not gained by exposing others to an arsenal of equipment and technology. That was impossible due to a lack of resources.  Rather it was built around personal qualities and an education and training system that ensured our officers, NCOs and men could <Col N="908" /> compete with other nationalities in any task they were given.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the graveside guard of honour at John F Kennedy's funeral was supplied by Irish cadets under the command of the then Lieutenant Frank Colclough.  In the area of United Nations service we supplied force commanders in Cyprus, Lebanon and currently an Irish general is the force commander with UNDOF in the Golan Heights.</P>
    <P>Irish officers and NCOs regularly attend courses in the US and Great Britain and to date they have a proud record of achievement.  Since the Niemba ambush the Defence Forces have slowly gained a place in the hearts of the nation. This was reflected by the intense competition that developed throughout the 1980s to obtain entry into the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. Today, however, the Army stands at a crossroads, as many commentators ask if it is a luxury we cannot afford.  This discussion has come about due to the phenomenon that is called &ldquo;Army deafness&rdquo;.  One has only to glance at the letter pages of the daily newspapers to note the anger, disagreement and sadness, not only among the public but also among former and serving members of the forces as they try to grapple with the rights and wrongs of the matter.</P>
    <P>While the soldier in his pyjamas in the Congo was representative of Irish society in the 1960s, the development of the compensation culture in today's Defence Forces is a reflection of today's society.  Given the same set of circumstances, who could say what course any individual or group might take?  To date we have only the one example and its scale must give cause for serious concern.  At a cursory glance, how can one justify an apparently healthy soldier getting a large sum of money from the State as compensation for an ailment of which he or she may not have been aware when there are long hospital waiting lists and school children may be denied the services of a remedial teacher?</P>
    <P>The deafness question has certainly paralysed the Defence Forces.  However, various Governments have neglected their well-being over a long period and only in recent years has a serious effort been made to address the many problems that were clearly visible.  Is it not ironic that resources had to be allocated to upgrade the accommodation at Spike Island before the Department of Justice would permit prisoners to be housed there?  It was good enough for the Naval Service but not for criminals.</P>
    <P>Several studies of the Defence Forces have been carried out in recent years.  The most recent, the Price Waterhouse report, made several recommendations and even though legislation was promised in 1997 to implement them, we have not seen sight of it to date.  There is concern that, rather than take the lead on the issue, the Minister is letting it drift.  Many commentators have cast the easy gibe in the direction of the Defence Forces without seeking to analyse the problem.  Many members of the force who have <Col N="909" /> never even contemplated initiating proceedings have been portrayed as figures of ridicule.  This is particularly disturbing when it comes from people who hold recognised and responsible positions.</P>
    <P>In recent times the problem has spiralled out of control.  The reasons for this include the aggressive advertising by the legal profession, the relative ease with which some claimants appear to have received an award and the lack of any recognised hearing disability assessment system. The Minister is seeking to address the latter and I welcome the legislation he has brought before the House.</P>
    <P>The expert group is also to be complimented. Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the difficulties which may arise in regard to the legislation and I will not go over that ground again.</P>
    <P>This dilemma should serve as a lesson to us all; what other nightmares are staring us in the face? What potential areas of disaster will have to be addressed in the future?  Has the time come when, like some of our counterparts in the private sector, we are required to allocate responsibility for dealing with the future rather than the present to a section of Government?  Perhaps a small group of futurologists might be a good investment.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of ill informed comment on this matter.  The Minister, in outlining a chronology of events, mentioned the years 1952, 1977 and 1987.  Mr. Dermot Gleeson headed the commission set up in 1989 which reported in 1990.  It was the first such commission set up since the foundation of the State and the Defence Forces, its objective being to address the issue of pay and conditions in the forces.  The commission published a document more than 300 pages long in July 1990 but, to the best of my knowledge, it did not refer to health and safety or hearing problems in spite of the fact that the commission received 215 written submissions, held a total of 18 oral hearings and met approximately 3,000 members of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I fully subscribe to the idea that someone who sustains an injury through someone else's negligence is entitled to seek and get compensation. However, I have long argued that our system of determining liability and assessing damages is fundamentally flawed.  The problem which this emergency legislation is being introduced to address is merely a symptom of that larger problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, this problem has cost the taxpayer in excess of £45 million.  That money could have been spent on reducing hospital waiting lists, improving the condition of substandard primary schools or a range of other areas which would <Col N="910" /> have been immensely more socially and economically advantageous to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister, humbly and charitably, did not refer to the record of the previous Administration, nor did he compare it with his own.  I am doing my best to emulate him but, having listened to Deputy De Rossa's comments, I am bound to say that if the previous Government, of which Deputy De Rossa was a joint leader, had displayed a little less indolence, hand wringing, navel gazing and paralysis, the problem would undoubtedly not have reached the proportions we are confronted with today.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on the dynamism he has brought to this area and the head-on manner in which he has confronted this extremely difficult and intractable problem.  It must also be remembered that this is not the only initiative instigated by the Minister for Defence. Earlier this year, the Government introduced measures to curb certain types of advertising by the legal profession.</P>
    <P>I piloted the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1992 through this House which, for the first time in the history of the State, allowed solicitors to advertise their services.  I did so armed with assurances from the Law Society and individual members of the profession with whom I am acquainted that the new rights being accorded to them to advertise their services and fees would not be abused. Unfortunately, that is not the case.  A small minority of solicitors abused my tolerance and the new powers they received.  Though they were, and continue to be, a small minority of the legal profession, they have done immense damage. That damage is reflected by the growth in litigation in regard to this issue for which they are largely responsible.  They have also done immense damage to their own standing in the community.  I avail of this opportunity to thank the Law Society which I know is concerned about this situation for the way in which it has co-operated in the Government measure to reduce some of the more obscene forms of legal advertising which some members of the profession have unfortunately availed of.</P>
    <P>As the courts are constitutionally independent, this legislation can only provide, as it does in section 3, that judicial notice shall be taken of the new assessment system which has been introduced. Section 4 provides that the courts would have regard to the relevant sections of the Green Book in determining damages.  The courts are independent in the exercise of their functions under the Constitution and the question of this legislation being unconstitutional simply does not arise.</P>
    <P>We have been painstaking in ensuring that the Constitution is not breached in any way.  We could only be charged with introducing unconstitutional legislation if we tried to compel the courts to take account of the independent assessment system.  However, we are not in a position to do that.</P>
    <P>There have been references in court cases to <Col N="911" /> other assessment systems.  We have been forced to introduce our own systems because arguments made by counsel for the State in previous cases which referred to the independent assessment system for hearing damages introduced by medical authorities in the UK and the US have been simply brushed aside by the courts.  Someone looking at our legal system from the outside might be somewhat surprised at that attitude but anyone well acquainted with it would not be.  The courts' attitudes are inevitable by-products of the compensation culture with which the system of awards for personal injury damages is infected.  If the courts have regard to the new assessment system introduced by the Government's team of experts and, if they interpret the legislation as we hope and anticipate they will, the effect will be two-fold.  The level of awards will be substantially reduced and the Minister will be enabled to set up a parallel system for people seeking compensation which will be much cheaper, faster, non-adversarial and more cost efficient.  This will be part of a two-part process.  If the courts decide not to have regard to the new independent assessment system as the basis for assessing the level of damages, the problem will remain and it will be incumbent on the Government to look for other solutions.  If that situation arises, the Government should look much more radically at the whole issue of how damages for personal injuries are assessed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on the dynamism and determination he has brought to this difficult issue.  I listened carefully to the debate tonight, particularly to the contributions from Members of the Opposition.  I heard a great number of questions but I did not hear many answers.  I did not hear one definitive, credible alternative to the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>Legislation, often introduced with the best will in the world, occasionally has the potential to do great harm.</P>
    <P>There is no downside in this legislation.  It does not have the potential to do harm.  If the courts deal with it as envisaged it has the potential to do a great deal of good for many people.  That is why it deserves to be supported by all sides and the reason I commend it, unhesitatingly, to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, for sharing his time with me.  The proliferation of Army claims from the perspective of the Exchequer is certainly not welcome.  Compensation of £36 million and plaintiff costs of £8.5 million have been paid out to date.  The average settlement is about £20,000 per claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the claimants contend they are suffering from tinnitus.  This is a separate question from the issue of hearing loss but one which must be addressed in the context of this discussion.  Tinnitus is a ringing and buzzing in the ears.  Medical opinion has proven time and again that tinnitus is <Col N="912" /> an extremely aggravating and distressing condition, demonstrating itself in different individuals from a low degree of background noise in the ear to a persistent and deafening roar.  Medical opinion is divided on whether the severity of tinnitus is dictated by the degree of hearing loss one may have at any particular time.  One thing is certain, those to whom I have spoken in the Army who are suffering from tinnitus are generally in a great deal of pain.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in working towards devising a system of compensation for Army claimants, under what is known as the Green Book system.  This Green Book system of compensation is a specifically new and novel form of assessment of compensation for the civil cases before the courts in Army deafness case matters. Legislation is being introduced which will require courts to have regard to this new system of evaluation of Army deafness claims and this is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Green Book also sets out procedures for the assessment of tinnitus in cases of noise induced hearing loss.  The American and British medical authorities have developed systems and formulas for translating hearing loss into a percentage handicap but it is recognised that these systems of assessment have found little favour in the Irish courts.  I hope the new Green Book system is successful in bringing about a common structured and streamlined system and will command the confidence of the Judiciary in its evaluation of Army deafness cases in the future.</P>
    <P>The Irish Army has had a proud record of national and international service on behalf of the people since the foundation of the State.  In recent times the Army has been engaged in international duties in the former Republic of Yugoslavia, Angola, Somalia and Rwanda.  The Army rightly won international acclaim and plaudits for its efforts and endeavours on these overseas missions.</P>
    <P>At any given time there are up to 600 Irish soldiers based in the Lebanon as well as soldiers based in Cyprus.  The Irish soldiers in the Lebanon have carried out their duties in an impeccable manner and have done much to keep the peace in this contentious area of the Middle East, in accordance with their peacekeeping mandate.</P>
    <P>Our soldiers have been professional at all times in their duties at home and abroad.  This has been recognised by the United Nations and other key international observers.  I hope the debate on Army deafness claims will not have the effect of lowering people's expectations and respect for our national Army.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the Irish Army is going through a fundamental change which is a totally separate issue from that of the Army deafness claims.  Since the Gleeson report was commissioned into the future make-up and structure of the Army it was clear the Army would have to modernise.  PDFORRA and RACO which represent Army soldiers and Army officers have had to negotiate real change within their remit of <Col N="913" /> responsibility during the past five years which included the early retirement package for serving officers and soldiers.  The good work of the Army, nationally and internationally, in terms of its internal reorganisation and overseas duties must not and should not be affected by the debate on the Army deafness cases pending before the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Bill.  In dealing with it I wish to take up a point on litigation raised by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and build on it.  Ireland is one of the most litigious countries in Europe.  The compensation culture is like a cancer eating our society and borders almost on the immoral.  This compensation culture permeates right through society here, not just in the Army.  The State must move quickly to halt this slippery slope where all commercial and service facilities will eventually grind to a halt.</P>
      <P>The system acts against the best interests of the genuine claimant who may have to wait many years for the resolution of a claim with its consequent distress and uncertainty regarding the level of appropriate compensation.  It also discourages rehabilitation and return to work.</P>
      <P>Insurance costs are creating complications for employers, businesses, motorists, public authorities, voluntary and sporting organisations.  No area has been spared the paralysis that has accompanied the escalation in litigation.  For example, in schools teachers can no longer send a student to the nearest shop for a message.  Open season has been declared on public houses, clubs, hotels and supermarkets for people who fall on their premises.  The compensation culture is pervasive and is on its way to destroying the ordinary decent person's enjoyment of society.  The playground where so many young people have enjoyed themselves over the decades is almost a thing of the past.  It is almost impossible to obtain insurance cover for swings, slides, climbing frames and so on.</P>
      <P>Motor insurance premia are 98 per cent higher than in the rest of the EU.  A male aged between 17 and 21 with a full driving licence will have to pay almost £2,000 to insure a Ford Fiesta car.  One cannot begin to justify such prohibitive costs.  The situation must be changed.  As legislators we have a duty here.  I have raised this matter over a number of years so I am not directing it only at this Government.  This problem, which has been growing for a number of years, is manifesting itself more and more and will have to be tackled.</P>
      <P>Personal injuries compensation represents 67 per cent of the claims pay out in motor insurance and almost all claims pay out for employers and public liability insurance.  Ireland, to its competitive disadvantage, has the highest personal injury awards in the EU.  Irish claims frequencies and award levels are twice that of the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the problem resides with the legal system. The courts appear to take a lenient attitude to claims, often holding employers responsible no matter what the circumstances.  In most such <Col N="914" /> cases, employers are guilty until proven innocent. Only one in nine cases coming before the courts is dismissed.  Most of the cases do not go to court but are settled beforehand.  This is because insurance companies are aware that going to court will probably increase the level of payment. The chances of proving a case against an employee or a motorist or any such plaintiff are so low that the insurance companies will settle rather than go to court.</P>
    <P>That means the person who claims is taking a low risk.  He or she has a 90 per cent chance of not even being obliged to give evidence.  His or her initial claim has a 90 per chance of not even going to court and having compensation and costs paid.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister's actions in the House today.  I admire him for attending the court and for being prepared to stand up and be counted. Other Ministers might not have done so.  He is dealing with a small but vital issue, particularly for the State's coffers and for the morale and future status of the Army.  However, this issue must also be dealt with in a broader way which will probably involve changing the system.  Perhaps we should consider the New Zealand system in which a person has self insurance rather than general insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their unanimous approval of what the Government is attempting to do in this complex area.</P>
      <P>Less than two weeks ago we saw probably one of the finest television programmes one could wish to see on the Defence Forces, &ldquo;Kenny Live&rdquo;.  That performance by members of the Defence Forces on United Nations duty and here at home portrayed the skills, loyalty, service, trauma and other factors that have shaped what our Defence Forces can do.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons I refer to that programme is that, notwithstanding the generality of support for the Bill, there were some oblique attempts to incriminate me for the problems that might arise with regard to morale from the Army deafness claims.  I emphatically reject those attempts.  Not only is this a problem I inherited but the Defence Forces are more than capable of overcoming this difficulty and of going forward into more positive development.  Earlier I mentioned many of the positive developments currently taking place.  We will continue to pursue them with vigour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no way I can hide 12,500 cases.  There is no way I can represent the community and not have the public know there is a real danger that many hundreds of millions of pounds will have to be found and taken from somewhere to deal with this problem.  If any Member of the House believes I can hide that or that the public should not know or that the court hearings will take place and the media will pay no attention to them, they are living in the type of world I do not inhabit and which I do not intend to inhabit.  In confronting this problem I have sought the fairest and most equitable way forward, a way which will <Col N="915" /> ensure that both those with genuine claims and the taxpayers who face many other problems are treated fairly.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with a number of issues raised by contributors.  We must accept that this problem is uniquely Irish.  Internationally, there is some variety in handicap assessment systems but all of them would categorise large numbers of our claimants as having a nil disability or a minor injury.  A huge proportion of claimants would not receive compensation in any other jurisdiction. This is a different jurisdiction with a different Constitution.  I would like to go as far as possible in dealing with every case but if I see a situation where we are out of kilter with the generality of experience elsewhere, I must question it and find a better way forward.</P>
    <P>Deputies Wall, Fitzgerald and Stanton queried the Bill's constitutionality.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide judicial notice of the Green Book.  This means that it acquires the status of evidence in court, similar to that of other pieces of evidence adduced before it.  It is up to the court to decide the merits of this evidence and to adjudicate accordingly.  There is no directive element in the legislation so the question of interfering with the independence of the Judiciary does not arise.</P>
    <P>If the legislation has the desired effect, it will be because the courts are persuaded by the rationale of the Green Book.  Under this legislative approach, the courts will remain free to adopt whatever attitude they wish in dealing with this issue.  I hope they will recognise the efforts of the Oireachtas to come to grips with this problem. However, if the level of damages does not reduce consequent on this legislation, the Government will move to ensure that only those cases involving a significant hearing injury will command the type of high award which has been made in these cases.  We are accepting Judge Johnson's invitation to legislate and we are underpinning the Green Book with legislation.  We are responding to the wishes of the court.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Fitzgerald's view that the crucial issue is to ensure the right of fair compensation for the individual while protecting the interests of the taxpayer.  I have said as much previously on many occasions.  However, I am not naive enough to believe that there are many who will not be disappointed by the new regime which this Bill will inaugurate.  Expectations of many are high having been fuelled by court awards which the Government believes are unsustainable.  I am in favour of fairness.  This means a reasonable level of compensation for those with a significant injury or disability and modest or even no compensation for those whose daily lives are unaffected by a minimal hearing loss of a type which many other people, without Army service, have.</P>
    <P>That means, and we have at least some evidence to suggest, that a considerable number of claimants have a level of handicap or disability which is such as to make them no different from <Col N="916" /> the average person in society.  In that case, taxpayers should not be obliged, as they appear to be at present, to find the resources which the Government is being asked to provide in these cases arising from the awards being made.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers all cases currently before the courts.  It does not change any rules or impose a mandatory regime on the courts.  When the Bill becomes law, I hope it will provide a basis on which the courts can examine claims coming before them for hearing loss and use the Green Book in making an assessment of the extent of the injury suffered and, in consequence, the level of damages which should be awarded.  It is clear that somebody who has suffered a percentage hearing disability of up to 19 per cent and who, according to page 9 of the report, can hear whispered speech is not in the category of serious injury.  I expect such a person not to receive £20,000 in damages although I admit it remains, under the Bill, a matter for the court to decide.</P>
    <P>What level of damages is appropriate to somebody who has suffered 100 per cent hearing disability? We would all agree that someone who has suffered this catastrophic injury should continue to receive the level of award which would be made in the High Court, but we must ask what level of award would be made to someone suffering a 4 per cent or 5 per cent hearing disability on the same scale.  There is an issue of inner logic and consistency which should be addressed by the courts arising from the scale and formula contained in the report.</P>
    <P>We cannot anticipate the effect of the Bill &mdash; judges may not reduce the level of damages.  The Bill adopts a minimalist approach.  By common consent, a more radical approach would be fraught with constitutional difficulties.  We can revisit these if the courts do not match low handicap with low damages.  We will adopt a more radical approach if we have to.</P>
    <P>The reason no cases have been appealed to the Supreme Court is the likelihood that the level of damages would only be slightly reduced and then cast in stone with detrimental effects on the level of quantum.  It should be remembered that the level of quantum in the High Court has fallen consequent on the Department's legal strategy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton raised the question of whether FCA personnel are issued with disposable liners to ensure cleanliness.  There have never been financial constraints when it comes to the issue of ear defenders which are cheap and widely available. FCA personnel are issued with same.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Wall for his succinct summary of the effect of the Bill with regard to judicial notice.  The Bill is constitutional because it does not, unlike the legislation in the Sinn Féin funds case to which Deputy Fitzgerald referred, purport to direct the courts to do something.  That is the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wall referred to the selection of the frequency of 4,000 hertz rather than 3,000 hertz. This is a matter for the medical experts who <Col N="917" /> wrote the Green Book and one in which I do not propose to interfere or accept amendments.  To do so would undermine the objectivity of the report.  The inclusion of 4,000 hertz rather than 3,000 hertz operates to the advantage of soldiers as plaintiffs since most noise damage occurs at this frequency.  Under the American system a figure of 3,000 hertz is used.  This has been the subject of frequent criticism by plaintiffs.  In that context the Green Book favours the plaintiff.</P>
    <P>It was our intention to produce the Green Book in evidence but we were requested by the courts to contemplate the legislation we deemed to be necessary.  That is the reason we are responding in this way.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the contributions which have been made that there is wide agreement on all sides of the House that we are faced with a difficult problem which requires an urgent solution. I thank Deputies for their constructive remarks. Together we face a difficult situation which is not amenable to a magic wand solution.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that the situation has evolved in a way that has proved so harmful to the Defence Forces.  My overriding concern is to ensure the development and revitalisation of the Defence Forces are not put at risk by anything that happens in the area of compensation claims. More importantly, I am anxious to ensure the Defence Forces are protected in so far as possible from the effects of the crisis and return to normality as soon as possible.  This Bill is an essential first step along that road.  I hope, with the passage of legislation, the way will be open for acceptance of the Green Book and the development of a fair and consistent tariff of compensation for those with a genuine injury.</P>
    <P>Because of the short time available to address this question I regret that the debate on this important measure has been telescoped.  I appreciate the co-operation we have received from the party Whips representing all sides of the House to enable the Bill to be processed in the shortest possible period.  With the resumption of the court cases next Tuesday, it is of vital importance that we provide the courts with the basis on which they can address this problem.</P>

      <P>County Wicklow, which has a population of more than 100,000, does not have a public swimming pool.  Residents of the county who wish to avail of the facilities of a pool have to travel to Wexford, Carlow, Kildare or Dublin. This causes a difficulty for primary schools which wish to avail of swimming lessons.  It can involve a round trip of more than two hours.</P>
      <P>After much lobbying over a long period, the Minister for the Environment in the rainbow coalition Government, Deputy Howlin, in March 1997 gave the green light to two projects, one in Wicklow town and the other in Arklow.  Fund-raising committees have been in operation in both towns for some time.  To date, the Wicklow town committee has raised approximately £300,000 and the Arklow committee, £200,000.</P>
      <P>Much local effort has been put into the projects and a certain air of disquiet has enveloped both towns as they wait in anticipation of an announcement by the Minister.  I would appreciate if the Minister would clarify the position in respect of both projects.  Anything short of a definitive commitment and timescale would be a disappointment and scant reward for much hard work.</P>

The committees in both towns have put in a tremendous amount of work and have received the support of their local councils and communities.  The case was put so strongly and effectively that both pools got the go-ahead under the previous Government, of which I was proud to be a member.  Will the Minister indicate the timeframe involved for both pools and clarify, once and for all, that they will be safeguarded in the Department.</P>
      <P>The county I represent does not have a publicly owned swimming pool.  That is an extraordinary state of affairs as we approach the end of the 20th century.  We have an opportunity to realise the ambitions and goals of two strong communities which have shown their commitment.  I ask the Minister to match it and indicate a specified timeframe for the construction of both pools.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond to this item and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
    <P>The Department pays grants of up to 100 per cent of the approved cost of refurbishing existing swimming pools and up to 80 per cent of the approved cost of new pools, with the remainder of the cost being funded by local contribution.  To qualify for a grant, a pool must be built to the Department's specification.  The commitment of funds to a particular project can only be considered when the project design has been approved and the local authority is in a position to accept a tender.</P>
    <P>The overall allocation for the swimming pool programme and the competing demands of other swimming pool projects for the available funds must, of course, be taken into account.  The provision for the swimming pool programme in 1998 is £4 million.  The cost of swimming pool projects has risen considerably over the last few years due to general increases in construction costs and the higher standard of facilities being provided.</P>
    <P>Commitments in respect of approved projects under construction, or on which work is expected to commence later in the year, amount to £7.5 million.  In addition, there is over £40 million worth of projects in hand in the Department at various stages of planning, which are also seeking funding.</P>
    <P>Approval to preliminary proposals for a new swimming pool in Wicklow town at an estimated cost of £1.4 million issued in April 1997.  The local authority was asked at the time to prepare contract documents for the project and to submit them to the Department for approval.  The local authority subsequently submitted a cost plan with some drawings but the detailed specifications and drawings which constitute the formal contract documents were not submitted to the Department until 8 April 1998.</P>
    <P>Approval to preliminary proposals for the refurbishment of the existing pool in Arklow, at an estimated cost of £1.2 million, also issued in April 1997, with a request to prepare and submit contract documents for the project.</P>
    <P>The initial documents submitted by the local authority did not comply with the Department's guideline specification for swimming pools and in August last year the council was asked to submit revised documents.  The formal contract documents were finally received in the Department at the beginning of April.</P>
    <P>The contract documents for both projects are currently being examined in the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for attending.  I raise this issue in the light of numerous media reports concerning a shortage of hospital beds in Cork city.  One accident and <Col N="920" /> emergency unit was closed in recent weeks in one of the main city hospitals and patients had to be sent to alternative accommodation.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a critical shortage of hospital beds in the Cork city area, which has led to growing concerns that health services are failing the people of Cork.  Why, when we read in newspapers that Ireland has the fastest growing economy in Europe, do we also read frightening stories about the main accident and emergency unit in Cork city being closed to further admissions because it is full to capacity?</P>
      <P>The reason for this, seemingly, is because not enough beds are available in the hospital to accommodate casualty admissions.  Patients recovering from heart attacks, strokes or surgery are put on trolleys in corridors, or else returned to their family doctors, because of a critical shortage of hospital beds.  Extremely ill people &mdash; general medical cases or cardiac patients &mdash; have been known to lie for hours in casualty or wait for days before a bed can be found.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks the problem has reached crisis level.  Is the Minister for Health and Children aware of this and, if so, what is he doing to address this serious problem?  Does he recognise the additional stress and trauma this places both on patients and their families at an already stressful time?</P>
      <P>When people become ill suddenly they need to be reassured that the State will provide adequate services for them.  They should not be treated in a dismissive fashion and told they must find another hospital because there is no room.</P>
      <P>Family doctors are also coming under extreme pressure in this situation in trying to find beds for their patients.  These doctors are frustrated and angry with the situation as they find it.  They have to reassure patients and their families while at the same time trying to gain admission to hospital for their patients.  They must spend hours on the 'phone locating beds for their patients.  In many cases they must choose between keeping patients at home under their care or having them face the discomfort of a hospital trolley.</P>
      <P>This situation is unsatisfactory and it is placing much pressure on family doctors to take decisions they may not feel qualified to make.  The manager of one hospital said many beds there tend to be taken up by elderly people awaiting discharge to geriatric units or nursing homes.  The VHI's announcement that it intends to cut benefits for care in homes will only contribute to this situation.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister of State to address the seriousness of the situation that seems to have been compounded in Cork in recent weeks.  He should also address the stress and trauma this is placing on patients who are already in a stressful situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and providing an opportunity to <Col N="921" /> discuss the major developments in acute hospitals in Cork.</P>
      <P>Based on the average number of in-patient beds available for use in 1997, the total bed stock in Cork city hospitals is 1,334 beds.  Of this total, the average number available in the three accident and emergency hospitals &mdash; Cork University, the Mercy and the South Infirmary-Victoria &mdash; is 925 beds.  The remaining 409 in-patient beds are available in St. Finbarr's, Erinville, and St. Mary's Orthopaedic and form an integral part of the acute hospital infrastructure in Cork.  I am satisfied that the present level of bed availability is adequate to meet the acute hospital needs in the Cork area.</P>
      <P>In considering the operation of these beds it is important to understand that in looking at service delivery it is opportune to consider overall levels of service rather than focus solely on bed numbers. This reflects major changes in medical practice which have resulted in shorter average in-patient lengths of stay, a marked shift from in-patient to day case surgery and increased treatment at out-patient level.</P>
      <P>In developing service plans, the implementation of an appropriate mix between in-patient, day case and out-patient care would be a major consideration for local management in seeking to maximise overall activity.  The conclusions of a recent OECD comparative study which reviewed health expenditure here found that there have been significant improvements in hospital productivity over the past 15 years, pointing to the fact that the average in-patient length of stay has been reduced by 29 per cent and that better management of resources has allowed the average bed occupancy rate to rise to nearly 85 per cent &mdash; one of the highest in the OECD area.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that this increase is set against a background of a reduction in bed numbers in the late 1980s, the relevance of focusing on overall activity rather than availability of bed numbers as a measure of the hospital system's output becomes evident.</P>
      <P>While the OECD report makes it clear that the acute hospital sector is managing well, delays resulting from sudden peaks in admissions through accident and emergency departments occur from time to time, as the Deputy has stated.  The increased level of admissions through accident and emergency in recent years is an international phenomenon common to many health systems and requires effective management of resources to ensure that emergency patients get priority.</P>
      <P>The Minister's policy in this, as in other areas, is to ensure that the productivity of the hospital system is optimised, that the hospital system continues to respond efficiently, effectively and equitably to the needs of the population and that it is resourced appropriately to provide high quality hospital services, in meeting those objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the situation in Cork, the Southern Health Board has addressed the issue of effective bed management in Cork University Hospital with plans for the appointment of a bed <Col N="922" /> manager to promote more effective use of the in-patient beds, and a liaison nurse with responsibility for the placement of persons who no longer require acute care but are still in need of subacute care.  In addition, a study of bed utilisation at Cork University Hospital is currently in progress and will be completed at the end of this month.  These measures will further promote effective bed management.  As well as ensuring effective use of existing resources, the Minister made funding available for a number of significant developments in acute hospital facilities and services.  New ward facilities and laboratories at the Mercy Hospital have recently been completed and are currently being equipped, while planning for the development of improved radiotherapy facilities, a new 110 bed maternity unit and a new accident and emergency department at Cork University Hospital is ongoing.  These developments represent considerable enhancement of the facilities at these hospitals and will improve services and facilities for key groups of patients, including emergency patients, expectant mothers and cancer patients.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided significant additional resources this year for the development of services in Cork.  The developments for which additional resources have been provided in 1998 include improved staffing levels in the accident and emergency and intensive care units at Cork University Hospital, the appointment of additional consultants in the areas of cardiology, oncology and accident and emergency and additional staff associated with the new development at the Mercy Hospital.</P>
    <P>This increased development funding for the Cork region represents a marked improvement on the additional funding provided by Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left when in Government during 1995, 1996 and 1997.  In addition, the Minister provided capital grants totalling £1.25 million to the Southern Health Board, the Mercy Hospital and the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital this year for the purchase of medical equipment.</P>
    <P>This considerable investment currently being made in the development of both the physical infrastructure and services of Cork's acute hospitals will help to ensure that the hospitals in this area continue to provide a service that is on a par with the best in Ireland and demonstrates this Government's commitment to the development of hospital services in Cork.  It is the Minister's intention to sustain and enhance this process of investment in the acute hospital sector and, through my Department, to work with management in hospitals and health boards in continuing to seek improvements in the delivery of services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Mayo</i>): I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for choosing this important matter for the Adjournment.  I am sorry the Minister <Col N="923" /> for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is not here because he is the final judge, jury and court of appeal in this case.  Only he can decide whether the deportation order in respect of this couple is invoked or rescinded.</P>
      <P>This evening we are putting to the test the seriousness of Ireland's claim as a country with a deep sense of humanitarian concern.  The decision whether to implement the deportation order of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of Mr. Joseph Nitendereza, his wife and three children is an acid test of whether rigid cold bureaucracy on the one hand, or discretion and compassion on the other, are more important to us as a nation. Tonight we will make history for the wrong reason if the Minister decides that this Burundian family must leave the State.  Up to now we have deported Muldovans, Romanians, Cubans and Russians, but they were all single people. This will be the first occasion that a family has been deported.  I ask the Minister to listen to the pleas of Amnesty International, the UNHCR, the family and this House.</P>
      <P>This family is in an impossible position.  It left Burundi in 1995 to get away from a civil war which claimed 150,000 lives, including that of Joseph's brother.  Both parents have lost close relatives, neighbours and friends.  Their home was shelled and the two older children were traumatised as a result of witnessing neighbours and their children slaughtered in the streets.</P>
      <P>In 1995 they fled to Germany in the belief that their professional qualifications would enable them to integrate easily into German society. Unfortunately, their experience in their new home village near Frankfurt was far from pleasant. According to them, they were wrongly accused of various acts.  They had to suffer taunts and racial slurs and they maintain they were threatened with a Lübeck &mdash; the fate of ten asylum seekers who died in a fire bomb attack on a hostel in Lübeck.  All the family wanted was calm, normality and a peaceful environment in which to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family has been living in Blackrock since it came to Ireland last December.  These are serious people of high calibre who would be an asset to any community.  Joseph has an economics and marketing degree and ten years experience as head of marketing in a large brewing company.  In addition to several African languages, he speaks fluent French, German and English.  Carinie, his wife, is a trained secretary who was promoted to an administrative post in an insurance company where she was employed prior to leaving Burundi.  She also speaks French and German fluently and her progress in English, which she has been studying since she arrived in this country, is impressive.  Lionel is eight and a half years old and Andrea is five and a half.  Both are attending Carysfort Primary School and are making good progress.  The boy has joined the local football <Col N="924" /> club which his father now coaches.  Apart from the humanitarian aspect, how could anyone not realise that these are talented people whose abilities would be a major asset to this or any country?</P>
    <P>The deportation order is based on the Dublin Convention.  However, there are no direct flights from Burundi to Ireland with the result that anyone seeking Ireland as a destination must come via another country.  I appreciate that the convention stipulates that applications for asylum must be heard in the first EU state in which the applicant sets foot.  However, I ask the Minister to examine the comments by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Peter Van Der Vaart, that &ldquo;Ireland should not implement the convention in a rigid way by returning every asylum seeker who has come from Europe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to use his discretion to enable this family to stay here rather than face the unpalatable experience which was their lot for two years in Germany or the horror of being sent back once more to their native Burundi.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Jim Higgins in appealing to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not to implement a deportation order in the case of this family and to permit it to remain in this country where it can make a valuable contribution to our society and economic life.  The Minister has the discretion to make the decision not to proceed with deporting this family.</P>
      <P>The family is currently living in Blackrock in my constituency.  I have met it and discussed the situation.  The family consists of a mother and father, who are highly qualified, and their three young children, the two oldest of whom are attending Carsyfort Primary School.  The principal of that school has written in support of the application to stay in this country and of the appeal the family made to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Why is this family here?  Most people in this country are familiar with the horrific civil war and savagery in Burundi.  The terms Hutu and Tutsi are synonyms now for civil war savagery.  This family is a victim of that savagery.  The reason it had to leave Burundi was that both parents were involved in a political movement which was known as Parena whose purpose was to try to achieve reconciliation between the warring tribes in Burundi.</P>
      <P>Given our experience here and the exercise we are going through, we should have a great deal of sympathy for that process.  As a result of their involvement in that political movement they fell foul of the Tutsi and Hutu factions in their country. They felt their lives were at risk, a fear quite justified having regard to the fact that Joseph's brother was put to death in l994.</P>

    <P>The family moved to Germany because Mr. Nitendereza has business contacts there and he told me he had previously visited Germany in connection with his work as a senior marketing executive for a brewing company.  Unfortunately, their experience in Germany was not good.  As <Col N="925" /> Deputy Higgins said, they were subjected to a great deal of racism.  There was an incident involving police officers.  There was a car accident involving a police officer's car and Mr. Nitendereza believed, as a result of that, he was subjected to particular difficulties in the area in which he was living.</P>
    <P>They came to the conclusion they were not safe in Germany and moved to this country.  I know the position of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that the family should return to Germany for their asylum application to be processed there.  The difficulty with that is they are extremely fearful about returning to Germany.  If the asylum application is processed in Germany, it will have the effect of uprooting the family from their present situation here with children at school and so on.  The Department's position is also based on the belief that they have a legal permit to stay in Germany, which, strictly speaking, they do not have.  While in Germany they had a type of tolerated residence, known as duldung.  They left Germany for Ireland on 6 September last and their tolerated residence status was due to expire on 12 December.  Their position in Germany is quite tenuous, which adds to their fear that once in Germany they will be deported back to Burundi to the situation from which they came.</P>
    <P>On humanitarian and compassionate grounds, this is a case where the human values and compassion to which we in this House all subscribe should be applied and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should act accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I thank Deputies Higgins and Gilmore for raising this matter thereby enabling me to clarify the Minister's position on a number of points.  It is the policy of the Minister not to reveal the personal details of asylum seekers, given that their applications are received and treated in confidence. This protection is provided for in section 19 of the Refugee Act which, while not in force, is respected in spirit.  Accordingly, my comments in this debate will, of necessity, be general in nature and confined to the publicly known facts as carried in the media in recent days.</P>
      <P>The situation is that the persons involved arrived in this State at the end of last year, after residing for more than two years in Germany, their youngest child having been born there.  They applied for asylum here, not being in possession of valid visas for entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their case was processed under the Dublin Convention.  That convention is in effect since 1 September 1997 and provides a set of criteria for determining which EU country should deal with an asylum application made in one of them.  It does not provide for a substantive examination of the application.  The criteria include such matters as whether a country has issued a visa or a residence permit to the applicant, which country was first entered, legally or otherwise, by the person, <Col N="926" /> whether that entry was simply as a transit passenger and whether an asylum application is already being examined in another EU country.  The objective of the convention is to prevent a situation where an applicant for asylum could be sent from state to state, with no state accepting responsibility for examining the application, while at the same time aiming to avoid multiple applications for asylum.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Convention does not affect the recognition of refugee status, the administrative process for examining requests or the position of the asylum seeker while his or her request is being examined.  The convention's starting point is that it guarantees the commitment of member states to honour their obligations under the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Convention (Implementation) Order 1997, made under section 22 of the Refugee Act, sets out a detailed procedure for making decisions in such cases, giving the applicant proper opportunities to make representations and to be represented in that procedure.  Even though the convention does not require it, the order includes a right of appeal against a decision to transfer to another EU state.</P>
    <P>In this case, the appointed officer under section 22(4)(a) of the Refugee Act determined that Germany was responsible for dealing with their asylum application.  That country had agreed to take the family back for the purpose of dealing with their application.  The family then availed of the independent appeals procedure.  The appeals officer considered the applicant's grounds of appeal and the decision of the appointed officer and found that the decision of that officer was in conformity with the Dublin Convention.</P>
    <P>On this basis it is clear that the family's claim for asylum should be determined in Germany. The state in question is a party to the Geneva Convention and to the 1967 Protocol, as well as to the Dublin Convention.  There are no grounds for believing that this or any other family's application for asylum would be dealt with by the German authorities in anything other than the highest international standards.  To suggest otherwise would be to cast a slur on the integrity of our European neighbours which under any view would not be sustainable.  The Minister is not prepared to acquiesce in any suggestion that general injustice against asylum applicants prevails at the hands of the German authorities.</P>
    <P>It would be a matter of grave concern if it was being suggested we could not trust our EU partners to live up to their obligations under the UN Convention.  They are, after all, one of the member states of the EU with whom we are proposing to further strengthen our ties under the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>The convention's starting point is that it guarantees the commitment of member states to honour their obligations under the Geneva Convention which specifically provides against <i>refoulement,</i> that is, it specifically provides that no contracting state, shall expel or return a refugee in <Col N="927" /> any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that, even where another member state is responsible for processing an asylum application under the Dublin Convention, the Minister may choose to have the claim examined here at his discretion.  This is the case. However, I warn if it was felt the Dublin Convention procedure was optional in its application here, it would serve to encourage persons to risk moving their asylum applications from other countries to ours as it suited them.  It is important to note that in returning persons to other Dublin Convention countries no evaluation or judgment is being made of the validity of their asylum application one way or the other.</P>
    <P>I should also inform the House that court proceedings have been instituted in another case calling <Col N="928" /> into question the validity of the Dublin Convention and the statutory instrument which implements it.  The Minister will be strongly defending his position in these proceedings and he is not prepared to suspend the operation of the convention in other cases in the interim.  It has also been suggested that it has been the practice not to use the Dublin Convention in the case of applicants from certain countries, including Burundi.  On behalf of the Minister, I emphasise this is not the case.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise, however, that the file on this case is still being examined in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister has not considered the case, nor has he made deportation orders in respect of the family. The views expressed by the Deputies here this evening as well as the other comments expressed on this case will be taken into account by him in making his determination.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 on Thursday, 7 May l998.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>Good progress continues to be made under the Strategic Management Initiative, the programme of change in the public service.  As set out in Delivering Better Government, the key objective is the achievement of an excellent service for the Government and the public as customers and clients at all levels, building on the good service provided at present.</P>
      <P>The preparation of new strategy statements by Departments and offices was a key requirement of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, which came into operation on 1 September last year.  As I announced on 1 May, the new statements of all Departments and of offices under their aegis have now been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and are being published.</P>
      <P>In addition as the Deputy is aware, the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, came into effect on 21 April last.  A considerable effort has been put into preparing to meet the requirements of the Act which will result in major changes in the culture and practices of the Civil Service.  Taken with the publication of the strategy statements, a new climate of openness and transparency in the conduct of official business has been created which is unprecedented.</P>
      <P>The pursuit of quality customer service is at the heart of the change programme.  The quality customer action plans of departments and offices, launched towards the end of 1997, are now in operation.  A system to monitor and benchmark progress across the Civil Service is currently being drawn up to ensure that the momentum is maintained in this important initiative.</P>
      <P>On 19 February last, following consultation with the Opposition parties, I announced the establishment of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Strategic Management Initiative. Deputy Quinn is a member of the committee.  I said then that it was appropriate that the Oireachtas, with which the Civil Service at official level is so deeply engaged, should be more actively involved in the process, particularly now at the stage of implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> Apart from the new legislation I mentioned, up until now most of the effort in the Strategic Management Initiative has been devoted to developing the proposals in the key areas of Delivering Better Government.  This effort has been harnessed through the various working and other groups which were established.  Arising from their recommendations, the position now is that the SMI implementation group, which is driving the change programme in the Civil Service, has prioritised four areas for action this year. These are in human resource management, financial management, information technology and regulatory reform.</P>
    <P>There is a very wide agenda for change in the management of human resources, with the emphasis on giving more authority and responsibility to line managers in managing and developing their staff.</P>
    <P>An effective performance management system is a vital part of modern human resource management and central to the improvement we seek in the delivery of quality services.  Consultants were engaged in 1997 to advise and assist in designing an appropriate system for the Civil Service.  As part of their report the consultants advised that successful implementation of the performance management system will require that issues such as organisation of work and reward-recognition be addressed.  The report is at present being considered by the SMI implementation group prior to submission to the co-ordinating group and the Government.  Arrangements for implementing the proposed performance management system will involve consultations with the Civil Service unions in accordance with the participative approach provided for in Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>In relation to financial management, changes are necessary to support the SMI process, in particular to underpin a results-driven approach to managing the public sector in a modern, competitive economy.  The Government earlier this year took decisions on administrative budgets and multi-annual budgets.  Further proposals on the delegation of financial authority and on a new model of financial management will shortly be submitted to the implementation group.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, proposals in relation to information technology and regulatory reform also will be considered later in line with the priorities set for 1998 by the implementation group.</P>
    <P>Chapter 10 of Partnership 2000 sets out the framework for implementing the change programme in the public service.  A key feature is the 2 per cent pay increase that is dependent on the achievement of verifiable results in each Department and office in implementing its action plan on a partnership basis between management, staff and unions in support of the changes.  A General Council Report, No. 1331, has now been agreed providing for setting up partnership committees comprising management, unions and staff representatives. Departments and offices will now establish partnership committees in each organisation to develop the action plans for change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> The National Centre for Partnership was established arising from the commitment in Chapter 9 of Partnership 2000.  The centre has been consulting widely with management and unions in the public sector to identify the level of partnership existing in the workplace and to promote discussion of partnership at local level.</P>
    <P>The changes already effected are formidable. The changes still to come will be equally challenging. I am satisfied with progress to date and I am determined that no momentum will be lost in progressing the change programme.</P>

      <P>The fifth plenary review meeting on Partnership 2000 took place on 27 April. It was chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and it focused on the following two themes: enterprise, jobs and small business, and rural exclusion and action to develop agriculture, food and forestry.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive exchange of views took place on each of these themes from the short-term and long-term perspectives.  It was agreed at the meeting that the next plenary review will take place towards the end of July and will focus on the themes of social inclusion and modernising the public service.</P>
      <P>On the implementation of Partnership 2000 generally, an impressive amount of progress has been made so far.  The agreement, like its predecessors, has produced very significant benefits in economic and social terms.  These benefits can certainly be sustained, provided that there continues to be a disciplined adherence to the agreed terms.  For our part, the Government will remain firmly focused on implementing fully all commitments, thereby paving the way towards a successor partnership agreement early in the new millennium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 27, 36, 64, and 231 together.</P>
      <P>The consultant's report on the house price study, An Economic Assessment of Recent House Price Developments, was published on 23 April together with the Government's Action on House Prices, which sets out a balanced range of measures in response to the report.  Copies of the report and Action on House Prices were circulated to all Oireachtas Members and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The consultant's report highlights the extent to which positive economic and demographic factors, reinforced by a number of additional factors such as investment demand for residential property and difficulties on the supply side, due to certain infrastructural constraints and the effect of stamp duty rates, have resulted in recent very high levels of house price increases.</P>
      <P>The package of measures adopted by the Government involves a three pronged approach to increase the potential supply of housing, address factors causing overheating or distortions in the market, and improve the position of prospective first time buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures to assist first time buyers form a key element of the package, including the increase in the income limit for the local authority shared ownership scheme to £20,000 for single income households, with corresponding increase for joint income households.  The position of first time buyers will also be helped by removal of fiscal incentives to investors who were pricing low income buyers out of the market and by reductions in stamp duty rates, particularly at the lower house price levels.  Stamp duty has been abolished on houses priced up to £60,000 and the <Col N="933" /> rate on prices between £60,001 and £100,000 has been halved to 3 per cent, with reductions at all house price levels up to £500,000.  The overall package of stamp duty reductions will improve mobility in the second hand house market and, as a result, increase the supply of these houses available to first time buyers.</P>
    <P>The consultants did not recommend any change in relation to the £3,000 new house grant for first time buyers.  The main thrust of their recommendations is towards removal of distortions in the market and, in present market circumstances, any increase in the new house grant would be likely to be absorbed in higher prices. It is not possible to quantify the precise number of prospective first time house buyers in any particular income category.  I am confident that the measures now being taken will assist a significant number of lower income households in getting access to home ownership.</P>
    <P>Measures to boost housing supply will also help first time buyers and dampen price increases by improving the balance between supply and demand.  Allocations of the first £15 million tranche under the serviced land initiative to provide water and waste water services for some 45,100 additional housing sites were announced earlier this week.  The Government has also decided to provide an extra £15 million to fund further releases under the serviced land initiative and a new provision of £5 million to help target areas where roads infrastructure is a constraint.  This will bring to £35 million the total Exchequer funding available to provide services required to open up additional land for residential development and will result in overall investment by local authorities of over £85 million when development levies are taken into account.  This investment will help significantly in addressing constraints on housing supply, particularly in the Dublin area. My Department will also be identifying water and sewerage schemes to open up land for residential development which might be suitable for execution by way of public-private partnership. The Irish Home Builders' Association has also been asked to bring forward proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>Other measures being taken to boost supply of housing include promotion of increased densities at appropriate locations and a temporary reduction for the next four years to 20 per cent of capital gains tax on disposal of serviced land zoned residential to encourage faster land release for residential development.</P>
    <P>I believe that the balanced package of measures being implemented will help to dampen down house price increases, ensure continued accessibility to home ownership for lower and middle income groups and secure the long-term strength and stability of the housing market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is increased public and political concern about road safety.  While we have greatly improved our road safety performance over the past 20 years, the increasing road travel and vehicle numbers, resulting from strong economic growth, are now threatening to erode these gains and re-establish adverse trends.  It is a major priority of the Government to improve road safety both by the intensification of existing efforts for better enforcement, education and road engineering and by the introduction where necessary of selected new measures.</P>
      <P>Some months ago the High Level Group on Road Safety was mandated to develop and submit to Government a national road safety strategy. This is a new and important initiative which will provide both better co-ordination and prioritisation of existing road safety activities and a platform for new initiatives.  I am confident that it will benefit Irish performance considerably. Work on the strategy will shortly be completed and it will be presented to Government prior to its publication.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the relevant public agencies have continued to be active in relation to road safety.  A substantially increased grant has been provided by my Department for the National Safety Council in 1998 for the purpose of improving road safety and promoting road accident prevention. Garda enforcement of road traffic law continues to be given a high priority under the direction of the National Traffic Policy Bureau. The Garda Operation Lifesaver is continuing through 1998 and its effectiveness is constantly reviewed and improvements made to enhance enforcement as necessary.  The National Roads Authority has increased its provision in 1998 for its low cost safety measures programme and for other road safety related measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concerns about pollution in our inland waterways.  Primary responsibility to prevent pollution incidents rests with those engaged in activities that could entail a pollution risk.  However, local authorities, as statutory pollution control authorities, have a key role in protecting water resources.  The Environmental <Col N="938" /> Protection Agency is also responsible both in so far as activities licensable by the agency are concerned and as part of its overall responsibility for the preparation and implementation of environmental monitoring programmes and the establishment and maintenance of databases of information related to the environment. Extensive statutory powers are available under the Water Pollution Acts, 1977 and 1990 and the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, to support these bodies in their roles.</P>
      <P>In view of my concern about the number and impact of pollution incidents during the summer of 1997, I wrote to local authorities in August 1997 urging them to intensify their efforts to identify potential pollution sources and to take appropriate follow-up action to eliminate the risks involved.  The measures I outlined then continue to provide a firm basis for effective action to minimise damage from pollution.  Local authorities were particularly asked to ensure that industrial effluent discharge licence conditions, operational practices and material-waste storage facilities are adequate to safeguard water resources.  In relation to agriculture, I asked the authorities to pursue a programme of visits to farms and intensive production units and to give special attention to the management of animal slurries, silage effluent and sheep dip facilities, including disposal arrangements.  I also emphasised the need to ensure that water and sewage treatment plants are maintained and operated to design specification to prevent pollution.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly urged local authorities to use the statutory provisions available to them to recover costs associated with the prosecution of offenders, including the cost of measures to mitigate or remedy the damage done; these provisions offer a mechanism to offset the effects of pollution and augment the deterrent value of penalties by the courts in line with the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle.</P>
      <P>Alongside my immediate concern to ensure that every effort is made to minimise the risk of pollution incidents, a broadly based and comprehensive strategy is in place to address the increasing levels of eutrophication in rivers and lakes. This strategy incorporates a wide range of measures to tackle phosphorus inputs to waters from sewage, industry and agriculture.  In implementing its terms, local authorities have been urged to adopt an integrated catchment based approach to the development and implementation of their pollution control policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the critical role which phosphorus plays in the eutrophication process, I will shortly be prescribing environmental quality standards for phosphorus in rivers and lakes to secure phased improvements in the condition of these waters.  The effect of defining environmental quality standards for phosphorus will be to oblige local authorities to take all necessary steps to ensure that phosphorus concentrations in fresh-waters do not exceed stated levels.  In addition, in the case of relevant activities coming within the <Col N="939" /> integrated pollution control licensing system, conditions imposed by the EPA will have to ensure that the quality standards are fully respected.  As part of the implementation of the strategy, I am also preparing guidelines for nutrient management planning on farms.</P>
    <P>A wide range of measures are in place to address the environmental impacts of agriculture, including impacts on water quality.  These include nutrient management planning, promoted by Teagasc and local authorities as a key management tool in reducing phosphorus losses from farms; efforts to achieve greater uptake by farmers under the rural environment protection scheme, REPS; an improved package of measures has been approved by the EU Commission in respect of natural heritage areas, NHAs, and commonages; improved capital allowances for targeted investment by farmers in pollution control measures; a targeted reduction in artificial P fertiliser usage over the next five years, and detailed advice and recommendations in the Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates.</P>
    <P>The catchment strategy also involves a major investment by my Department in upgraded sewage treatment facilities throughout the country, including phosphorous reduction facilities where warranted in light of local water quality conditions. Catchment based projects supported by the Cohesion Fund provide, in addition, for comprehensive monitoring and management systems which will enable pollution control strategies to be tailored to the particular needs of the local situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 33 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>Statistics for 1997 in regard to local authority enforcement of litter legislation are now available in the Oireachtas Library.  While improved performance may be attributable to the flexible and extensive powers now available to local authorities under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, there is a continuing need for more responsible action on the part of the public and more rigorous enforcement of the law by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently finalising a range of measures as part of an anti-litter programme to support strengthened local authority action on litter this year.  The programme will include measures for an ongoing litter pollution monitoring regime, selective funding of local authority awareness-raising initiatives in areas with the most pressing litter problems and anti-litter awareness activities in schools.  I expect to be in a position shortly to announce details of these measures, which will be funded from the provision of £418,000 available for anti-litter initiatives under subhead D.2.4 of my Department's Vote. <Col N="941" /> I emphasise that primary responsibility for the implementation of the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, which came into operation on 1 July 1997, rests with the local authorities.  The Act requires a new and more structured approach to litter management planning on the part of the authorities and provides them with the necessary powers to tackle litter pollution.  In this regard, local authorities will be able, next year, to use the additional resources under the Local Government Fund, proposed in the Local Government Bill, 1998, currently before the House, to take a more pro-active approach to their functions under the Litter Pollution Act.</P>

      <P>The rights of tenants in private rented accommodation are determined, in the first place, by reference to the terms of the lease or other tenancy agreement under which the tenancy is held.

    <P>The general question of security of tenure for <Col N="944" /> tenants of private accommodation requires careful examination of all the considerations involved because of the complexity of the landlord and tenant code and the importance of the issues involved.  This is a matter which I propose to have examined in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>The protection available to tenants under the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, relates to those formerly controlled dwellings subject to the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Acts which were found by the courts to be unconstitutional. It would not be in the best interests of the private rented sector to extend these particular provisions to the sector generally and I have no proposals to do so.</P>

Similar possibilities <Col N="945" /> apply to grants that are provided to local authorities, civic trusts and other conservation bodies to carry out conservation and restoration projects in urban centres under the same sub-programme.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 218 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent Dublin Corporation report from the Office of the Director of Traffic entitled &ldquo;Review of the existing air quality and proposals for additional monitoring of traffic related emissions in Dublin City&rdquo;.  Like the Environmental Protection Agency baseline study on concentrations of PM 10 and volatile organic compounds in Dublin City published earlier this year, the report notes that levels of certain air pollutants show some correlation with traffic volumes and recommends that the impact of current traffic management strategies on air quality should be assessed.  However, air quality in Dublin and elsewhere in the country is generally good and all mandatory national and EU ambient standards are currently met.</P>
      <P>A proposed subsidiary directive relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead under directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management is under consideration by the EU Council of Environment Ministers and the European Parliament.  I have indicated Ireland's support for the proposals while acknowledging that the limit values, for oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter especially, will be challenging, particularly in some heavily trafficked urban areas.</P>
      <P>A proposal for a directive setting an air quality standard for benzene, highlighted in the Dublin Corporation report, is expected from the European Commission as part of the programme of subsidiary directives to be developed under directive 96/62/EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> I am committed to ensuring that any necessary measures required to comply with new EU air quality standards, within specified timeframes, will be put in place.  I refer also to the replies to Questions No. 126 of 27 November 1997, No. 123 of 4 December 1998, Nos. 13 and 38 of 5 March 1998, No. 213 of 28 April 1998 and Nos. 129 and 130 of 30 April 1998.</P>

      <P>High standards of environmental protection are applied to the incineration of hazardous waste in the context of the licensing of such activities by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  The agency has issued seven licences for such activities.</P>
      <P>Council Directive 94/67/EC of 16 December 1994 establishes common standards to be applied throughout the European Community in relation to the incineration of hazardous waste.  The standards, emission limit values and other requirements specified to protect the quality of air, soil and water apply to new incineration plant from 1 January 1997 and existing plant from 1 July 2000. However, they have been anticipated in the comprehensive licensing system implemented by the EPA.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Licensing of Incinerators of Hazardous Waste) Regulations, 1998, transposed the directive into Irish law.  The regulations require review, on or before 1 July 2000, of licences granted on or before 31 December 1996, in accordance with the formal requirements of the directive.  It is a matter for the EPA to carry out such reviews.  I understand that an early review of licences is intended by the EPA.</P>

With regard to the emissions reduction target for member states of the EU, arising from the Kyoto Protocol, I refer to the reply to Question No. 3 of 5 March 1998.  Internal burden sharing within the EU will be discussed at the EU Council of Environment Ministers meeting in June 1998.</P>
      <P>Details of the policies and measures in place to limit and-or reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and their costs where available, are set out in Chapter 5 of Ireland's Second National Communication under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have now received the completed report of a consultancy study commissioned by my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise to identify additional policies and measures to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the scope for the intensification of existing policies <Col N="948" /> and measures.  The study, which will be published very shortly, includes estimates of the emissions savings and costs associated with measures identified, and it will form a basis for consultation and decision making in regard to greenhouse gas abatement action.  At EU level, consideration is also being given to the adoption of common and co-ordinated policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    <P>While there is no Cabinet committee on greenhouse gases, appropriate contact is being maintained at ministerial and official level, and the above mentioned study will facilitate wideranging sectoral and Oireachtas input to the consultative process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The average waiting period nationally for a driving test is 28 weeks, although applicants requiring an early test for urgent reasons such as employment are generally tested within ten weeks or less.  The longest waiting time, at 34 weeks, obtains at the Finglas test centre.  There are currently some 66,000 applications for driving tests on hand nationally; 12,003 of these applicants have been given test appointments.</P>
      <P>My Department is taking steps to improve the present unsatisfactory service for driving test applications.  In addition to Saturday testing, the permanent driver testing corps is being increased and the negotiation of productivity measures is being advanced, which will increase testing out-put and permit the engagement of further testers on a contract basis.</P>

      <P>The adequacy of road networks must be regularly assessed in terms of some or all of the standard criteria for this purpose, i.e. pavement condition, safety-geometric standards and capacity.  Major national assessments of this kind have recently been carried out in the Non-National Road Pavement Condition Study (a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library) and in the National Roads Needs Study (which will be published shortly). Both assessments make clear the need, which is being addressed, for a continued high level of investment in improving and maintaining national and non-national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Transport provided for investment of over £1.2 billion in development of the national road network in the period 1994-99.  Reflecting this, the 1998 Revised Estimates for Public Services provide for expenditure of over £263 million in 1998 on construction-improvement of national roads &mdash; an increase of more than 13 per cent on the 1997 <Col N="950" /> figure and the highest ever such provision.  In addition, a further £25 million is being provided for maintenance of national roads.</P>
    <P>As regards non-national roads, it is a major priority to ensure that sufficient funding is provided to enable the restoration programme to be completed by 2005 &mdash; within the ten-year period originally proposed.  The 1998 Estimates allocate a record amount of nearly £204 million for non-national roads, an increase of almost £26 million or 15 per cent on the 1997 outturn.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the combination of up-to-date roads needs assessments and enhanced roads programmes is supporting the upgrading of our roads systems to meet present and future requirements.</P>

      <P>As well as State and EU funding being provided to extend public and private water supplies, a major investment programme is also under way to improve sewage treatment and collection facilities.  Since 1994, more than £258 million has been spent on major public sewerage schemes.  A further £185 million has been provided for my Department's 1998 capital investment programme for water and sewerage schemes.  Within this investment programme with the aid of EU co-financing my Department, in conjunction with local authorities, is engaged in the improvement and expansion of sewage treatment and collection infrastructure having regard to the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive and to facilitate new development.</P>
      <P>In relation to new development, I refer in particular to the serviced land initiative introduced in November last.  Arising out of the recent report of the study on houses prices the funding for the initiative has been doubled with the result that £30 million will now be available over the 1998-2000 period for water and sewerage services to open up land for residential development. Details of the schemes to be funded from the initial tranche of funding were announced yesterday and provide for over 45,000 housing units.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 214 of 28 April 1998, in which I recognised the value and potential of using the fiscal system to achieve environmental objectives.  In regard to the promotion of cleaner fuels, an excise differential has been applied for a number of years to encourage the use of unleaded petrol, and sales have now increased to almost 82 per cent.  I am aware that a significantly favourable excise differential also applies to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  The potential for extending such incentives in regard to other environmentally friendly fuels will be kept under review in the context of ongoing consideration of environmental taxation measures.</P>

      <P>As an incentive to land owners to dispose of development land, the Government's recently announced &ldquo;Action on House Prices&rdquo; provides that a reduced capital gains tax rate of 20 per cent will apply for a period of four years to the disposal on or after 23 April 1998 of serviced land zoned for residential development, with a rate of 60 per cent to apply thereafter.</P>

      <P>While I recognise that a general house improvement grant scheme would help to promote the conservation and improvement of the housing stock, I am also conscious of the cost of the previous scheme and the fact that the construction industry is operating at a very high level of demand.  Available resources are being concentrated on the social housing programmes and the range of measures set out in the Government's &ldquo;Action on House Prices&rdquo; in response to the issues raised by increases in house prices.</P>
      <P>A range of targeted measures to assist in the improvement of housing conditions are currently available, as follows: disabled persons and essential repairs grants; the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly; the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, and local authority house improvement loans.</P>
      <P>I am, in the context of the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, examining possible options to extend the range of measures currently available to assist low income households in securing necessary improvement works to their housing.  Pending completion of this examination and decisions arising from it, I do not propose to comment on the possible outcome.</P>

      <P>My Department, in conjunction with local authorities, is involved in a major programme of works to upgrade sewage treatment and collection infrastructure to comply with the requirements of the urban waste water treatment directive and to ensure, amongst other things, that the high quality of our bathing waters is maintained.  The directive stipulates that all sewage discharges from population equivalents of 2,000 or more must receive secondary treatment by the year 2005.  Many resort towns and villages are benefiting from the provision of this infrastructure which is being implemented under my Department's water and sewerage services investment programme and a number of sub-programmes and initiatives, such as the resorts and serviced land initiatives and the small schemes element of the rural water programme.</P>
      <P>In 1996 a special initiative was introduced by my Department to improve water and sewerage facilities in designated resort towns.  Nine schemes were approved to advance under this initiative and to the end of 1997 a total of just over £2 million has been expended on these schemes and a further £2.4 million will be spent to complete them.  A total of six schemes has been completed and a further three schemes will be completed this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key measures that can be used to assess our resort areas is the quality of their bathing <Col N="956" /> waters.  The Environmental Protection Agency's 1996 Report to the European Commission on the quality of bathing waters in Ireland for the 1996 bathing season indicates that the quality of bathing waters in Ireland generally is very good, with 96 per cent of the 124 sampling points complying with the mandatory standards of Council Directive 76/160/EEC concerning the quality of bathing waters.  In addition, over 88 per cent of the sampling points complied with the more stringent guide values for these parameters contained in the directive which are used, together with criteria concerning general beach management and other factors, for the determination of awards under the blue flag for beaches scheme.  A total of 70 Irish beaches secured blue flags in 1996, the highest number awarded in any year.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission issued a reasoned opinion to Ireland on 12 June 1997 in relation to Directive 76/464/EEC on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community.

    <P>Regional accounts in Ireland are compiled by distributing the published state levels of GDP to the regions where the goods and services are produced. A range of statistical data relating to the different sectors of the economy which are available at regional level are used in this process.

      <P>The establishment of an implementation group of nine secretaries general and heads of office with a mandate to drive the Strategic Management Initiative forward within the Civil Service was announced in July 1997.  The group commenced meeting in September 1997 and reports on progress to Government, through the SMI co-ordinating group, every three months. The group is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and comprises eight other members drawn from a number of Government Departments-offices.  No additional costs are incurred by the Department of the Taoiseach in association with the work of this group.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána in November 1997 the Government decided to establish an implementation steering group with a mandate to: develop the overall implementation plan in respect of the recommendations of the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána; commence immediately the &ldquo;bottom-up review&rdquo; recommended in the report; and develop an approach to addressing the cross-organisational issues identified in the steering group report.</P>
      <P>The implementation steering group, which commenced work in January 1998, is chaired by Mr. Kevin Bonner of Business Insight and former Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and includes 21 other members including representatives from Government Departments-offices, the Garda Síochána and unions.  The steering group has been asked to report to the Government within six months, setting out their initial proposals for implementation and will report regularly to Government thereafter.  No additional costs are incurred by the Department of the Taoiseach in association with the work of this group.</P>

    <P>A high level working group to examine the issue of trade union recognition was established on 1 August 1997 under the terms of Partnership 2000.  The group comprised 16 members, which included representatives of ICTU, IBEC, Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, IDA Ireland and Forbairt.  The group explored the different approaches to trade union recognition and what their implications might be in the Irish context. <Col N="961" /> Costs associated with the group totalled £2,110.80. The group reported to the Tánaiste and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in December 1997.  It is envisaged that the group will be reconvened to continue its work.</P>
    <P>A project group to examine the progression of labour market intervention measures was established in October 1997, on foot of paragraph 4.24 of Partnership 2000.  The group comprised 21 members which included representatives of the social partner organisations and the Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Finance, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  There were no costs associated with the workings of the group.  The work of the group concluded in November 1997 with the recommendation that 2,000 additional places be created under the part-time jobs option, and wholetime jobs initiative.</P>
    <P>A partnership committee is being established in my Department.  The function of the committee is to draw up and implement an action plan programme to give practical effect in the Department to the strategy statement and the range of initiatives being brought forward under the Strategic Management Initiative.  The partnership committee will then have a role in monitoring the implementation of the action programme and ensuring that verifiable results are being achieved.  The committee will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Department and will, initially, comprise ten members drawn from management and unions.  It will be expanded at a later stage to bring in other members of staff.  It is expected that the committee's action programme will be drawn up by the end of the year.  Apart from certain training-facilitation costs, the operating costs of the committee will be minimal.</P>
    <P>An Interdepartmental Committee for the Protection of Classified Information was established by the Government in November 1997.  The Committee has ten members and has reported to Government on two occasions.  Apart from routine costs associated with such committees &mdash; photocopying, catering, etc.  &mdash; there are no other costs associated with this committee.</P>
    <P>In February, 1998 the Government announced the establishment, following consultation with the Opposition parties, of an all-party Oireachtas committee on the strategic management Initiative. The committee comprises 14 members.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference are as follows: to consider and report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on progress on the programme of modernisation for the Civil Service outlined in Delivering Better Government having regard to: reports from the SMI implementation group of Secretaries General and Heads of Offices to the co-ordinating group on the SMI; action by Departments and offices on chapter 10 of Partnership 2000 for inclusion, employment and competitiveness; strategy statements of Departments and offices; and any legislative proposals initiated to progress the programme of change.  The secretariat of the <Col N="962" /> committee is provided by the Department of the Taoiseach.  An allocation of £50,000 has been established by the Department of the Taoiseach for the support of the committee during 1998.</P>
    <P>The all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution which lapsed on dissolution of the Dáil in mid-May 1997, was reconstituted on 16 October 1997.  The committee was initially established on 3 July 1996, with a view to drawing up a detailed programme of constitutional change arising from the report of the Constitution Review Group.  As with the Constitution Review Group, the secretariat for the committee is provided by the Institute of Public Administration.</P>
    <P>The committee proposes to examine the institutions of the State, including the Seanad on which the earlier committee had issued a progress report and the scope for participation by people living in Northern Ireland in national political life.  The Government has also agreed that the review of the electoral system envisaged in An Action Programme for the Millennium would be undertaken in the first instance by the committee.  The committee hopes to report before the end of 1998 on these issues.</P>
    <P>The committee uses the report of the Constitution Review Group as a basis for discussion, invites written and oral submissions from interested parties on the issues under discussion and then produces progress reports on sets of issues that could be grouped together for referenda. The committee has 12 members.  Its budget for 1998 is £240,000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each individual business and other users of computer systems to assess the implications of the year 2000 on their systems and to determine the solution.</P>
      <P>They have no way of preventing or avoiding the costs associated with solving the problem.  The level of cost and the economic impact in any particular case will depend on the extent of the problem. It is important however that Irish businesses address the issue as the cost of ignoring the problem could ultimately be far greater than the cost of solving the problem at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Government can help is in raising awareness of the issue and by providing guidelines to businesses to help them tackle the problem. Approximately 100,000 copies of an awareness <Col N="965" /> leaflet on the Year 2000 computer problem, prepared by our Department in June 1997, with the assistance of Forfás and IBEC, have been distributed to industry, chambers of commerce and county and city enterprise boards throughout the country.  This leaflet suggests initial steps to be taken to enable industries IT systems, deal with the date change.</P>
    <P>Some recent research on the year 2000 problem has indicated that, while there is a high level of awareness of the problem, the level of action to deal with the problem, particularly among SMEs, still falls below what is required.  Accordingly, earlier today, I launched a further awareness campaign, with which I have been personally involved for some time.</P>
    <P>A further and more comprehensive brochure outlining the nature and implications of the problem and giving advice on how to go about dealing with it is, at present, being circulated to businesses both directly and indirectly, through industrial development agencies, county and city enterprise boards and chambers of commerce.  I have arranged to have copies of this brochure circulated to all Deputies and Senators.  In addition a series of regional public meetings will be held to highlight awareness of the problem and, in particular, the urgency of the need to address the issue.</P>
    <P>Our Department, along with myself and my officials, have also had discussions with representatives of the financial sector, the insurance industry, the accountancy bodies and others including the IT sector, to seek their assistance in highlighting the need for Irish businesses to take action.  These interests have agreed to support the Government's campaign and I have established a steering committee representing a range of relevant business organisations and State agencies to oversee the campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose and reasons for the creation of a new client <Col N="966" /> centred support structure for indigenous enterprise involving the amalgamation and restructuring of An Bord Tráchtála, Forbairt and FÁS is set out in the briefing document: &ldquo;New Support Structures for Enterprise Development &mdash; the Issues and Concepts Outlined&rdquo;.  Copies of this document are available in the Library.  It is intended that the new agency should commence operations in July of this year.</P>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's assertion that the needs of science have been damaged and ignored since the establishment of Forbairt, Forfás and IDA Ireland in 1993.  In conjunction with my Departments office of Science and Technology, both Forbairt and Forfás have continued to strongly develop science and technology.  Both Forfas and Forbairt have been working to ensure that Ireland maximises its involvement in the EU framework programmes for research and development.  In addition, the measure four structure which brings together fundamental, strategic and applied research and involves the third level institutions and industry has proved to be a particularly important development.  I am satisfied from consultation with the S&amp;T community that, far from being damaging to science and technology, structures such as measure four are seen as a positive enhancement to Ireland's research effort which I have no intention of undermining.</P>
      <P>Science and technology will continue to play a key role in the new structures.  However, it should be stressed that the development of Ireland's science and technology base, covering diverse activities in areas such as agriculture, health, environment, education and industry, cannot be adequately catered for by a single agency.  As I indicated in reply to a recent question from Deputy Owen, the co-ordination mechanisms which have been put in place via the Office of Science and Technology, Forfas and the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation are designed to ensure that we continue to strengthen our technological base across the broad spectrum of science and technology activities. As is currently the case, Ireland will continue under the new structures to have a range of agencies and government Ministries dealing with specific areas of science and technology.  This is also the case in the majority of EU member states.</P>
      <P>In regard to the functions of the former Eolas, these were subsumed into Forbairt and Forfás when those bodies commenced operations in 1993.  As already indicated, both agencies have been continuing to develop science and technology and to provide relevant support services which meet the requirements of clients.  Such services have been evolving and will continue to do so in response to changing client needs.</P>

      <P>I accept that delays are being experienced in providing advances of European Social Funds to project promoters in this joint Ireland-Wales EU-supported initiative.  These are due to the need, on the one hand, for full compatibility between financial applications, from both jurisdictions, when processed in Brussels and, on the other, to <Col N="968" /> a number of problems experienced by the Cardiff and-or London authorities.</P>
      <P>Our Department has had frequent contact with all concerned promoters on the Irish side, has drawn the nature of the delays to the attention of both the European Commission and the Department of Finance, which has overall Irish responsibility for this initiative and has had several meetings in Brussels, Cardiff and Dublin in efforts to help resolve these matters.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, given the joint nature of this case, funding arrangements for the Irish promoters of projects cannot be made separate from those on the UK side.  I am hopeful that the European Commission may soon be able to give a favourable decision to joint proposals, before it on this initiative, but I cannot guarantee such.  I can assure the Deputy however that our Department is continuing to make every effort in this regard.  To be of assistance, our Department has been in touch with all of the Irish promoters concerned, to offer whatever assistance is possible, for example, by way of letters of comfort.  The funding approved will not be jeopardised by the delays and the amounts approved will be honoured in full.</P>

      <P>The interim skills group which was established under the aegis of Forfás recommended the following additional output from the education system: 1,000 additional computer applications graduates, 1,000 additional linguists from PLC and regional technical college courses, and 750 additional technicians from regional technical college courses.</P>
      <P>In November 1997, the Government launched the £250 million scientific and technological education (investment) fund which included allocations to cover the cost of these additional places.  At the same time, I also announced a new business, education and training partnership.  As part of this partnership, an expert group on skills was established to carry out analyses of the future skills needs of the economy and to develop proposals to meet these needs.  As part of its work the expert group is examining the demand and supply of skills for technology companies in Ireland, and is expected to report shortly.  Its report will contain both an assessment of the supply and demand for technology skills and proposals to address any possible shortfalls.</P>

      <P>The decision to commission consultants Brady Shipman Martin to prepare and publish a report on coastal zone management and a discussion document on a draft coastal zone management policy was made by Ministers of the previous Government, in 1994, with a view to progressing the development of a national coastal zone management policy and implementation framework.  That was the first attempt by an Irish Government to address the many issues involved in a comprehensive way.  Those documents were published and presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas on 2 December 1997 and a public consultation seminar was held in Dublin on 30 March.  The outcome of that process is currently being reviewed and I hope to obtain a Government decision in the coming months on the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coastal erosion is one of the important issues for coastal zone management.  The funding of £5.1 million available under the operational programme <Col N="975" /> for environmental services has allowed protection schemes to be undertaken at some 28 key locations around the coast, and a further major scheme is planned for Bray.  Nevertheless, it is clear from the research undertaken by the County and City Engineers' Association and from the lists of priorities submitted to my Department by local authorities that we face a considerable challenge in addressing this problem. There is a clear need for an overall national strategy which identifies both the priorities for coast protection in the future and the optimum means of addressing them.  My Department will pursue the development of this strategy in the context of the evolving national coastal zone management policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>In November 1994, my Department contributed £5,000 to the Ballina Industrial and Development Association and Killala Community Council towards the cost of carrying out an economic and feasibility study, undertaken by a firm of consultant engineers, McCarthy and Partners, of proposed deep water berthing facilities at Ross Point, Killala, County Mayo.  This study was a follow on to earlier studies carried out in 1978 and again in 1983 by McCarthy and Partners.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate it is essential that any investment decisions in relation to the Ross Point proposal be well grounded and have full regard to the findings of this exhaustive assessment.  Undoubtedly the attractions of the region and proposed jetty to industry, as outlined in the conclusions of the report prepared by McCarthy and Partners, are easily recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the strenuous competition for investment in port infrastructure, I draw the Deputy's attention to the conclusions arrived at in the report.  In particular recommendation 10.11 which states that &ldquo;.  ..taking fully into consideration the existing and the likely future demands for jetty facilities from the indigenous industrial and fisheries concerns, it is nevertheless considered <Col N="976" /> unrealistic to proceed with the construction of a jetty at Rathfran Bay before a commitment has been received from a suitable new &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; industry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Such an &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; industry would have to be sufficiently large to warrant the capital expenditure on jetty construction and onshore access and ideally have requirements for deep sea berthage and necessary support structures.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that existing industries in the region &mdash; including Asahi at the time of the study &mdash; did express a willingness to make use of jetty facilities.  However, it is clear that none of these concerns would make marine infrastructural development at Ross Point an economically viable proposition at present levels of demand for shipping movements.</P>
    <P>In the broader context of funding seaport infrastructure projects, my Department received applications for grant aid under the EU Transport Operational Programme 1994-1999 from the bulk of the ports handling commercial traffic.  The investment &ldquo;bid&rdquo; from regional ports alone was far in excess of the allocation of some £8 million EU aid provided for investment.  It was therefore necessary to prioritise investment proposals.</P>
    <P>The regional ports measure of the programme is aimed at facilitating relatively small investments to assist in preserving existing assets which will improve operational efficiencies.  The provision of £8 million EU aid has been fully allocated. Also, it is pertinent to note that the proposal for the development of facilities at Ross Point, would involve an investment of nearly £10 million costed at 1995 prices.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of adequate seaport capacity is crucial to the success of our maritime transport policy.  Future infrastructural investment strategy will be the key to sustaining growth in trade through seaports.  In this regard consultants, which I appointed, are about to complete an EU funded study to provide a definitive measurement and authoritative independent examination of the adequacy of national seaport traffic handling capacity to cope with current and future demand. This study is a vital step towards ensuring the development and maintenance of adequate infrastructural capacity at strategic Irish ports to cope with economic growth and to underpin future development plans to deliver that capacity.</P>
    <P>The review addresses the long-term trends in traffic growth and will also appraise existing modes of sea and land transport, the extent of potential transfer between modes and their portal interface and current and future adequacy.  Indications from the preliminary findings of the review are that there is adequate deepwater berth capacity nationally at existing ports and that future capacity demand can be met from the enhancement where appropriate of existing facilities.</P>

      <P>Since July 1997, a number of expert groups have been established.  The east coast marine emergency helicopter contract evaluation group was established to evaluate the specification and tendering for the east coast marine emergency helicopter contract.  The group, which had seven members, reported on 14 November 1997.  The costs associated with the group were £8,553.19. The steering group for expenditure review of the Irish marine emergency service, which has six members and is overseeing the expenditure, is due to report later this year.  The estimated cost associated with the group is £15,000-£20,000 for management consultants.</P>
      <P>The task force on the dumping of radioactive materials in the maritime area was established to review and assess the information becoming available on the dumping of radioactive materials and based on the review, to advise on monitoring and management measures in order to ensure maximum protection of our marine resources and restore public confidence in the quality of the marine environment.  The group, which has eight members, is due to report shortly.  There are no additional costs associated with the task force over and above normal administration costs.  The aquaculture industry forum which comprises 15 members, was established to facilitate and improve communication between the aquaculture industry, the Department and State agencies on key strategic issues and challenges facing the industry.  The forum reports on an ongoing basis to the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne.  There are no additional costs associated with the task force over and above normal administration costs.</P>
      <P>The task force on seafarer training and employment, which has 13 members, was established to examine the current training activities and capabilities in Ireland; to determine opportunities and threats to Irish seafarer employment; to establish the potential for increased employment through improved training; and to consider potential sources of funding for seafarer training.  The group is due to report at the end of June 1998, and will cost no more than £8,000, including fees, for consultancy assistance and public consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The liaison group on forest service human resource training was established to examine the current training activities and future requirements to meet the needs of the forestry sector. The group has 17 members, including representatives of Coillte, Forbairt and Teagasc, and is due to report in September 1998.  The estimated cost of the group is £750.  The task force on the management and marketing of herring was established in November 1997 to comprehensively <Col N="978" /> assess the management and marketing of herring to maximise the returns for the catching, processing and exporting sectors of the Irish fishing industry.  The task force has 17 members and its report will be published shortly.  The principal cost outside normal administration will be in publishing the report.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 97, 98 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>Any person wishing to deal in the purchase or sale of eels requires a dealer's licence under Part X of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1954 as amended by Section 20 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1994 which is issued by the local regional fisheries board.  This licence obliges the holder to keep a register, in a prescribed form, of all purchases, sales and exports of eels. Ensuring that the licence conditions in relation to eel dealing are adhered to is the responsibility of the local regional fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>The management strategies for eel fishing generally are currently under review by the Marine Institute.  The aim of this review is to produce an integrated development strategy for the fishery. The review will also cover licensing arrangements and legislation requirements governing the sector. There are no figures readily available at present on the commercial value of eel exports on a weekly basis.  My Department does not have any jurisdiction in relation to tariffs regarding the export of eels.  This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that I have recently made a by-law capping the number of licences which the boards may issue for long line commercial eel fishing in the interests of stock conservation.</P>

      <P>A &ldquo;needs&rdquo; study of the Irish coast carried out in 1992 by the national coastal erosion committee of the County and City Engineers' Association estimated that, out of the 5,800 kilometres of coastline within the State, 1,500 kilometres are at risk from erosion and that £125 million would be required to address the coastal areas most at risk. Research cited in the report on coastal zone management policy prepared for my Department and the Departments of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and Environment and Local Government by Brady Shipman Martin estimates that coastal erosion causes a loss of land area of between 160 and 300 hectares a year.</P>

Such measures are to include, as one element, a pilot project on additional control elements combining satellite tracking and on-board observers to apply to a limited number of larger vessels. The present position is that the proposed set of measures, including the pilot project, are under discussion between the European Commission and the Norwegian authorities and no definitive decisions on implementation have been made.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the deep concern of the Government in regard to the human rights situations in Indonesia and East Timor.  We are actively seeking means of engaging the Indonesian Government in dialogue, urging commitments to concrete action that will lead to real improvements in those situations.</P>
      <P>At the recent session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland supported a chairman's statement on human rights in East Timor which was negotiated with the Government of Indonesia and in which the Indonesians made a number of substantive commitments to improve the human rights situation.  Foremost among the measures agreed to were:</P>
      <P>The invitation to the UN special working group on arbitrary detention to visit East Timor and to submit a report of its findings to the next session of the Commission.</P>
      <P>An undertaking to ratify the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</P>
      <P>Access for a programme officer to East Timor and a report from the Secretary General of the UN to the next session of the commission on the human rights situation in East Timor.</P>
      <P>This Government also supports the appointment of a special envoy to East Timor by the UN Secretary General, the establishment of regular dialogue involving the Secretary General and the Portuguese and Indonesian Foreign Ministers and the intra-Timorese dialogue.</P>
      <P>With regard to the role of the IMF, I am informed that, while specific humanitarian or human rights criteria are not set as conditions for its support to its member countries, the IMF, within its mandate, seeks to promote and maintain high levels of employment and real income, consistent with the level of sustainable growth.  To this end, IMF policy advice has emphasised the need for labour policies aimed at ensuring competitive and flexible wages, and at removing rigidities, while adhering to ILO principles.  Such policies can contribute to improvements in labour productivity and hence sustainable increases in real wages as well as a rise in labour standards.</P>
    </Speaker>

I was, however, represented in London by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt.</P>
      <P>On my behalf, Minister of State Kitt took part in a bilateral meeting on 2 April with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Ali Alatas, who was also attending the summit in London.  I have already referred to this meeting in my statement to the Dáil on 23 April on the outcome of the ASEM II summit.  As I mentioned on that occasion, the Minister of State raised with Mr Alatas the distressing human rights situation in East Timor and the effects of the Asian financial crisis on the Indonesian economy.

The Minister of State expressed Ireland's support for the continuation of the Intra-Timorese dialogue and our willingness to host a meeting of the dialogue in this country should the parties involved so desire; reference was also made to the excellent work of the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy to East Timor, Ambassador Jamsheed Marker.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Minister of State took advantage of the meeting to express his desire that trade and other economic relations with Indonesia should be encouraged to develop; he made reference in this regard to the consultancy work being carried out by the ESB as well as to the operations of other Irish companies in Indonesia.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5, who applied for an Irish passport, has lived in Ireland since she was aged 12 and whose parents were both born in Ireland, should have to produce her parents' marriage certificate; if she would be eligible for a passport if her parents were not married; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>From the information provided by the Deputy it <Col N="983" /> appears that the person in question was born outside Ireland.</P>
      <P>As only an Irish citizen may hold an Irish passport the Passport Office must be given documentary proof of citizenship before issuing a passport. Generally speaking a person is an Irish citizen if born in Ireland or if born abroad to parents at least one of whom was born in Ireland.</P>
      <P>When a person born abroad applies for a passport and claims Irish citizenship on the basis of a parent born in Ireland the Passport Office asks for documentary evidence that the person whose Irish birth certificate is presented is the father or mother of the applicant for a passport.</P>
      <P>It was formerly the practice, when a person born abroad applied for a passport and claimed Irish citizenship through the birth of a parent in Ireland, for the Passport Office to ask for only the applicant's foreign birth certificate and the Irish birth certificate of his/her parent.  However, to counter the possible misuse of Irish birth certificates by persons born abroad, neither of whose parents was born in Ireland, fraudulently to obtain Irish passports, it was decided some years ago also to ask such applicants for their parents marriage certificates as corroboratory evidence. Civil marriage certificates stating age or date of birth are of assistance in establishing the link between a person born in Ireland and his/her child born abroad.</P>
      <P>However, when a passport applicant states that his/her parents were not married to each other, the Passport Office has no alternative but to accept birth certificates alone as proof of Irish citizenship.</P>

      <P>The following are the details requested by the Deputy:</P>
      <P>1.  An interdepartmental committee on the possible development of the Boyne site was recently established at my behest to examine how best to encourage and facilitate an understanding of the historic Battle of the Boyne in the context of promoting reconciliation and mutual understanding on the island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The other Departments represented on the committee are the Departments of the Taoiseach, Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the</P>
      <P>Islands, Environment and Local Government, Office of Public Works and Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inaugural meeting of the committee was held on 12 March 1998.  It is not possible at this <Col N="984" /> early stage to say when the work of the committee will be completed.</P>
    <P>2.  The Department of Foreign Affairs chairs an Interdepartmental Group on Agenda 2000 which has been meeting since July 1997 and reports to the Ministers and Secretaries General Group on EU policy.  Agenda 2000 is the term given to the Commission's Communication of July 1997 and to its subsequent detailed proposals in March 1998 on the future financial framework of the European Union for the period 2000 to 2006, including the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and of the structural and cohesion funds.</P>
    <P>The other Departments represented on the Group are the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Agriculture and Food and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>The Group follows the ongoing negotiations in Brussels on the Commission's proposals which are expected to run into 1999 and reports regularly to the Ministers and Secretaries General Group.</P>
    <P>3.  Responsibility for the Communicating Europe Initiative, established in 1995 in the Department of the Taoiseach, was passed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in July 1997.  The purpose of this initiative is to promote a greater public awareness and knowledge of European Union affairs.  A committee was established to advise me on actions that might be taken under the initiative.  This committee, which comprises representatives of the European Parliament and European Commission Offices in Dublin, the Institute of European Affairs, the Irish Council of the European Movement and several Government Departments, meets under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>There are no additional costs associated with the administration of these groups.  A budget of £100,000 is provided to fund actions under the Communicating Europe Initiative.</P>

    <P>Under the Prosecution of Offenders Act, 1974, the Attorney General has an obligation when nominating in State cases to ensure a fair distribution of briefs among the Bar taking one case with another and having regard to suitability for specific cases and to the public interest.  In order to ensure that all these cases were not limited to a small number of State counsel but were spread more widely, the Attorney General established a panel of barristers with the intention that work in these cases would be distributed to the names on that panel by the Chief State Solicitor's Office up <Col N="987" /> to a maximum number of briefs per barrister. Because of the need to have a cut-off point there has been a substantial turnover on the panel of barristers.  As of the end of April there were 53 barristers on the list to be used in these cases.</P>

      <P>In November 1997 the Government directed that an interdepartmental working group be established to consider legislative measures arising from the army hearing loss litigation.  The group was chaired by the Department of Defence and comprised the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as the Office of the Attorney General.  It formalised pre-existing contacts between these Departments.  The committee reported to the Government on 20 April 1998 and, in consequence of its recommendations legislation is being enacted at present.</P>
      <P>Also, in January 1998, I established a steering group to oversee and direct a review of the Reserve Defence Force.  The steering group has eight members &mdash; an independent chairman, who is a specialist in the field of organisation and restructuring, three senior military officers, three senior civil servants and a serving officer of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiuil.  Secretarial services are provided by a civil servant.  The chairman is paid an agreed hourly rate for his services and travelling expenses.  To date, this is the sole cost of this steering group.  As part of its work, the steering group will be visiting a small number of reserve training exercises and camps, and the usual travelling and subsistence costs will be incurred.</P>
      <P>I have not specified any deadlines in the steering group's terms of reference for the submission of an interim or final report however I am confident that the group will conduct the study as quickly as possible and submit its recommendations at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Finally, I have recently agreed with the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation that a working group be established to examine funding for the Army Equitation School.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission have recently issued a reasoned opinion to Ireland concerning the implementation of Directive 79/409 EEC (the Birds Directive) which is the responsibility of the Minister for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>The opinion contains references to damage caused by overgrazing by sheep and my Department is addressing this problem through the rural environment protection scheme (REPS).  An improved package of measures in REPS has been drawn up to address environmental conservation in NHAs and commonages.  One of the measures includes the introduction of cross-compliance to prevent overgrazing in commonage areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With effect from 1 January 1998, sheep producers with commonage land in areas classified as overgrazed, including such commonages in areas designated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands as natural heritage areas, including special areas of conservation (SACs) under the EU Habitats Directive and Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the Birds Directive, are required to indicate their intention to participate in an approved agri-environment <Col N="989" /> programme in order to qualify for ewe premium/rural world premium and sheep headage payments.  A farmer may decide to participate in an agri-environmental programme under REPS or in a national scheme operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to meet this requirement.</P>
    <P>In addition, the new measures provide that overall framework plans for commonages are drawn up to ensure that sheep numbers are confined to sustainable levels in these areas.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will oversee the development and implementation of these plans.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these new comprehensive measures will be successful in combating the problem of overgrazing.</P>

      <P>): The person concerned submitted a ten month special beef premium application in respect of eight animals on 8 May 1997.  Two animals were subsequently deleted from the application due to ineligibility on age grounds leaving six eligible animals.</P>
      <P>An advance notification of an on-farm inspection scheduled for 27 June 1997 issued to the person concerned.  The animals in question were not presented for inspection as required by both the EU regulations and our national terms and conditions governing the scheme.  The herdowner was written to a second time and again given the opportunity to present the animals for inspection. Once again the animals were not presented.  The terms and conditions state that &ldquo;if an on-farm inspection cannot be made through the fault of the producer, the entire application shall be rejected&rdquo;.  Following an appeal the case was reviewed locally and the original decision was upheld.</P>
      <P>The special beef premium scheme is fully financed by the EU and governed by the relevant EU regulations.  An opportunity to have this case independently reviewed by the headage and premia appeals unit was offered to the person concerned. However this opportunity has not been availed of to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, section 54, Appointed Day and Exemptions Order, 1967 (S.I. No 217 of 1967), it is an offence, subject to a number of exemptions, to sell, offer or expose for sale or export any horned cattle to which the Order applies.  My Department will <Col N="993" /> continue to advise livestock mart managers of the statutory position in relation to horned cattle. Officers of the Department regularly monitor mart sales and points of export to ensure compliance with the Order.  The Department has issued a poster on dehorning for display at livestock marts.</P>
      <P>I am occasionally in receipt of representations on various aspects of the operation of the Order. I take the view that horns on cattle are a serious issue from the perspective of animal welfare and stock management.  They can also be a source of danger to farmers and their families.  The Departmental advice is that all calves should be dehorned before they are one week old, if possible, as treatment is least problematic at this stage.  It is, however, permissible to dehorn calves without an anaesthetic up to 14 days.  Preparations are available which enable producers to dehorn effectively and humanely.  Access to such preparations must be in conformity with the Animal Remedies Regulations, 1996 (S.I. No. 179 of 1996).</P>
      <P>Under the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, which are implemented by the Garda Síochána, it is illegal to dehorn, by any method, any calf over 14 days old without the use of an anaesthetic so administered as to prevent any pain during the operation.  Failure to comply with this prohibition attracts the provisions of section 1(1) of the 1911 Act.  The Deputy will wish to be aware that the Control of Horses Act, 1996, was availed of to effect a major recasting of the penalties under section 1 (1) to include conviction on indictment in the case of offences of cruelty. Section 1(1) now provides for maximum penalties for cruelty to animals as follows: on summary conviction, a fine of £1,500 and-or six months imprisonment; on conviction on indictment, a fine of £10,000 and-or two years imprisonment.  Any instance of cruelty to animals arising from improper dehorning practices should be reported to the gardaí for prosecution.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which the forage area was calculated for payments for a person (details supplied) in County Wexford in view of the fact that he feels that he was incorrectly paid; and if his Department will expedite payment of his special beef and suckler cow payments for 1998.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The incorrect amount of forage area registered for the person named has been amended from 7.77 hectares to 15.77 hectares and accordingly the outstanding amount due under the special beef premium scheme, £90.17 x 9 @ 90 per cent will issue over the coming week.</P>
      <P>The balancing payment of 10 per cent, cannot commence until the final position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the national quota is established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the 1997 suckler cow premium scheme is concerned, the person named applied for grants on 17 animals.  He was paid an advance of £1,307.50 on 19 November 1997 based on a forage area of 7.77 hectares.  The balance due to him was calculated as £871.67 since he was restricted to 15.54 livestock units based on the forage area registered for him at that time.  As the person named had been overpaid by £738.22 under the <Col N="995" /> 1993 special beef premium scheme, this amount was deducted from his 1997 suckler cow premium entitlement and he was paid the remainder of £133.45 on 3 April 1998.  He is due a further £204.74 under the 1997 suckler cow premium scheme when the amended forage area is taken into account and this will issue within the next two weeks.</P>

      <P>To qualify for agrimonetary compensation in 1997, eligible animals must have been disposed of within the period 1 April 1997 to 10 June 1997.  The person named had two male animals slaughtered within this period.  On 16 December 1997, agrimonetary compensation amounting to £82.02 was automatically paid to the person named in the form of a top-up payment to the deseasonalisation slaughter premium payment.  In addition, the person named was also due 1997 deseasonalisation slaughter premium payment of £30.04 and an additional EU funded agrimonetary top-up of £20 on the two male animals in question.  These payments were, however, offset against an overpayment due to the Department under BSE compensation paid to the person named previously.</P>
      <P>Herdowners wishing to qualify for agrimonetary compensation on finished heifers sold or slaughtered at approved outlets within the 1 April 1997 to 10 June 1997 period had to actually apply for such compensation on application forms made available for that purpose.  The arrangements for applying, availability of application forms, closing date for receipt and so forth was widely advertised in local, national and farming press.</P>
      <P>The apparent confusion in this case may have arisen from the fact that the agrimonetary compensation was automatically paid to producers who qualified for deseasonalisation slaughter premium on male animals.  No such arrangements applied to heifers disposed of, however, and producers were obliged to submit an application form for agrimonetary payments.</P>

      <P>Leptospira are among the most widely distributed bacteria in nature, causing disease in most species of animals and in man throughout the world.</P>
      <P>A form of leptospirosis, namely leptospira hardjo, is endemic in cattle and many herds will have been exposed to the organism over the past 10-15 years.  The severity varies depending on the immune status of the herd.  Infection of herds is mainly through the purchase of infected carrier animals or through flooding of pastures.</P>
      <P>Over the past 15 years the veterinary laboratory service' VLS, of my Department has advised private veterinary practitioners to encourage the implementation of disease-control measures in herds, including a vaccination policy to prevent the development of clinical disease and to reduce the potential exposure of dairy animals on farms to infection.  Vaccination, if correctly used, is a highly effective means of controlling the disease. Several vaccines are available on the market for this purpose.  The VLS continues to provide a diagnostic and advisory service to herdowners through their veterinary practitioners to assist them in controlling this disease.</P>

      <P>The following allowances are available under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of qualifying resort areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 352 and 353 provide for a special regime of capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of hotels, holiday camps, holiday cottages registered under the Tourism Traffic Acts and other classes of approved tourism facilities. One hundred per cent of the site exclusive cost of such expenditure may be written off.  To <Col N="1003" /> qualify for allowances as refurbishment, the amount spent on refurbishment must not be less than 20 per cent of the market value of the building, excluding the site cost, before refurbishment. The allowances are 50 per cent of initial allowance in year one with a 5 per cent annual allowance thereafter or 75 per cent free depreciation with a 5 per cent annual allowance thereafter for the owner-occupier or trade and 50 per cent initial allowance with a 5 per cent annual allowance thereafter for the lessor.</P>
    <P>Section 354 provides for a deduction, by way of an expense of the trade or profession, to the lessee of a business premises of twice the rent paid, provided certain conditions are satisfied. The double rent deduction is confined to a maximum rental period of ten years for each premises.</P>
    <P>To qualify for the above allowances, the expenditure on the qualifying premises must be made in the period commencing on 1 July 1995 and ending on 30 June 1998 or 30 June 1999, where the local authority certifies on or before 30 September 1998 that not less than 15 per cent of the total cost of the building or structure and the site had been incurred prior to 1 July 1998.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the 1996 Finance Act amended one aspect of the legislation dealing with the scheme, namely the self-catering area.  This section restricts the tax incentives for holiday cottages, holiday apartments and other self-catering accommodation in the designated resort areas in two ways.  First, it provides that the double rent allowance and capital allowances cannot both apply in the case of registered holiday cottages and apartments and other self-catering accommodation listed under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1957. Second, it restricts the manner in which capital allowances for registered holiday apartments and other self-catering accommodation listed under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1957 can be set off, bringing their treatment into line with that already in place for registered holiday cottages.  Thus, from 5 April 1996, capital allowances for all holiday cottages, holiday apartments and other self-catering accommodation in the designated resort areas can only be offset against rental income, including rental income from other sources, or, where the trade of operating such accommodation is carried on &mdash; against the income from the trade.</P>
    <P>These restrictions do not apply in cases where certain steps have been taken before 5 April 1996 in relation to the planning or development of such registered holiday apartments or listed self-catering accommodation.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the 1998 Finance Act introduces an annual cap of £25,000 on the amount of capital allowances on buildings that a passive individual taxpayer can claim against non-rental income, subject to transitional arrangements.  The buildings in question are all those on which capital allowances can be claimed including buildings in tax designated areas, for example, designated seaside resorts.  Owner operators and corporate <Col N="1004" /> investors are not affected.  The restrictions also do not apply to investment in holiday cottages since the capital allowances on such investments have already been ring-fenced to rental income, subject to transitional arrangements under section 30 of the 1996 Finance Act.</P>

      <P>Under the Valuation Acts, the use to which a particular property, including schools, is put determines whether or not it is exempt from rates.  Property used for charitable purposes, public purposes and the education of the poor are exempt from the payment of rates.  All national schools, vocational/technical schools and community schools are exempt on the basis of their dedication or use for public purposes.</P>
      <P>Prior to the enactment of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, secondary schools generally did not qualify for exemption under the provisions of the valuation code although some secondary schools run on a charitable and non-profit making basis were granted exemption on grounds of use for charitable purposes. However, since 1978, the provision of this Act granted full relief from rates to all secondary schools recognised by the Minister for Education under the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Acts.</P>
      <P>Private fee-paying schools which do not come under the definition of secondary schools in the 1978 Act or which are not covered by the charitable or public purposes provisions of the valuation code continue to pay rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any school governing body concerned with the rateable status of its school can seek to have this revised.  If dissatisfied with the outcome, an appeal can be made to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal.  There is a <Col N="1005" /> further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is being taxed under the marginal relief system which means that he has a tax exemption of £9,750 per year &mdash; £8,200 for a married couple and £1,550 for his three children &mdash; and any income in excess of this amount is taxable at the rate of 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, taxpayers who qualify for marginal relief pay less tax under that system than they would if they were taxed under the normal system of tax free allowances.  However, as the taxpayer in question has not provided his inspector of taxes with details of his income from his two employments, the inspector is not in a position to advise him as to whether it would be more beneficial for <Col N="1006" /> him to be taxed under marginal relief or the normal system of tax free allowances.</P>
    <P>Once the taxpayer forwards to his inspector of taxes details of his gross weekly income from each employment, the inspector will be in a position to issue appropriate certificates of tax free allowances to him.  If the taxpayer sends his P60s for the year ended 5 April, 1998 to the inspector, a review of his tax liability will be carried out to establish whether or not any refund is due.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the income tax burden on employment and commenced, in the 1998 budget, on a programme aimed at significantly reducing this burden.</P>

      <P>A levy of 1 per cent was imposed on certain insurance premiums in 1982.  This levy was increased to 2 per cent in 1993.  The levy is imposed on almost all non-life insurance premiums, the exceptions being reinsurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance.  The levy was introduced to broaden the stamp duty base, thereby raising additional revenue.  The yield from this levy in 1997 was £30.5 million.  Similar levies exist in most other EU countries and, in general, at rates higher than 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>The amount of the levy payable is directly related to the amount of the insurance premium i.e. 2 per cent of the premium.  The question regarding the level of car insurance premia paid by young drivers is a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the Revenue Commissioners categorise two people cohabiting as single persons for tax purposes and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs categorise the same persons as married for social welfare purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, tax law follows the general law relating to marriage. The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance, and double rate bands is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v the Attorney General, 1980, which held that it <Col N="1008" /> was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment. Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax free allowances and rate bands appropriate to single persons.  Consequently, as each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes, allowances cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.</P>
      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, in the Hyland case in 1989 the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an unmarried, cohabiting couple.  This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances. An interdepartmental working group has been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  This group is due to report by the middle of this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 to 173 inclusive together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the information I supplied in answer to his questions on 28 April on this topic.  As I explained in that reply, since Ireland's <i>per capita</i> GDP has now surpassed 75 per cent of the EU average, it would not be possible for Ireland to retain full Objective l status in the next round.</P>
      <P>According to figures recently published by the CSO, a number of subregions, as mentioned by the Deputy, had, up till 1995, <i>per capita</i> GDP levels below the level mentioned above.  It is important to stress that these subregions are not capable of attracting Objective l status as matters stand.  At my meeting with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies on 20 April last, we had a useful exchange of views covering this issue among others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to be able to thank the Commissioner on the positive contributions made by the Commission to the peace process in the North.  I was also able to welcome the fact that transition, rather than a sudden cut-off, had been recognised as important for regions like Ireland which were graduating from full Objective l status.  At the same time I emphasised the concerns facing Ireland, particularly the needs of those parts of the country which are still economically lagging behind.  The possibilities in relation to continued Objective l treatment for these <Col N="1010" /> regions were discussed.  The Commissioner made it clear that she could not support proposals to change the current regional basis for Objective l status which were not adequately based in terms of regional administration, comparability with other regions in the EU, and the appropriate statistical basis.  The door to further examination of the issue was, however, left open and the Government is continuing its consideration of the matter.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer's application did not contain sufficient information to enable the inspector of taxes to issue a C2 certificate and the inspector wrote to the taxpayer's agent requesting the outstanding information.  The inspector phoned the taxpayer's agent on 1 May 1998 and was informed that most of the required information has now been obtained.  When the inspector receives the required information he will process the application without delay.</P>
      <P>With regard to the requirements for eligibility for a C2 certificate, section 531(11) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, sets out the conditions which must be met before the commissioners can issue a C2 certificate.  Essentially, the inspector of taxes must be satisfied that: the applicant is or is about to become a subcontractor engaged in the business of carrying out construction contracts; the business is or will be carried out from a fixed place of business and has or will have such equipment, stock and other facilities as, in the opinion of the commissioners, are required for the purposes of the business; proper books and records will be kept in relation to the business; the applicant has paid all due taxes, and delivered all necessary returns and supplied all information requested by the inspector of taxes; and there is a good reason to expect that the applicant will keep proper books and records in the future.</P>

      <P>In September 1997, following the publication of the report of the McCracken Tribunal, I asked the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to review the existing Revenue powers in relation to bank accounts. Any decision to augment these powers will be taken in the light of all relevant information available. This includes information and recommendations which the Moriarty tribunal and investigations carried out by the Tánaiste under the Companies Acts may provide.

    <P>The tax strategy group considers taxation policy options in advance of each budget and Finance Bill.

There are no costs involved.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of proposed changes in the Finance Bill, 1998, for credit unions, I agreed to set up a working group with the Irish League of Credit Unions under an independent chairperson to examine the taxation of returns on credit union savings bearing in mind the special and particular nature of the credit union movement, its contribution to Irish society and the wider taxation issues involved.  The working group will report to me by 30 September 1998. There are no costs involved.</P>
    <P>I have established a working group on targeted tax relief for those in the home looking after a family member in need of care.  It includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Its report is due by autumn 1998. There are no costs involved.</P>
    <P>The expert group on improving public finance statements was set up to examine and analyse the financial statements currently published by the Department of Finance with a view to improving their simplicity and transparency.  There are nine members in this group which will report to the Minister for Finance before the 1999 budget.</P>
    <P>Recent allegations have resulted in significant public concern about certain of the activities of particular banks and the banking industry generally. It is with this concern in mind that I decided to establish a working group of representatives from my Department, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Central Bank, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General, the task of which is to investigate the law and practice governing the provision of financial services in Ireland and the impact this has on consumers.  In this regard, the group is undertaking an assessment of the laws relating to the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the role of the Central Bank, including the procedures used to give effect to these roles, with a view to identifying the impact of these on consumers and, in particular, to identify if there are gaps in consumer protection that need to be filled.  The group has also been asked to consider what steps may be required to increase the public understanding of the regulatory systems, including the manner of their implementation.</P>
    <P>The group has been asked to report its findings and any recommendations it may have to me by mid-May.  I understand the group has met on three separate occasions to date.  I have been advised that significant progress has been made and that I should have its report within the timescale prescribed.  There are no particular costs associated with this group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the problem of homelessness as it affects children and young persons.  I am generally satisfied with the quality of reporting by each health board as set out in the reports which each board is required to make annually under section 8 of the Child Care Act, 1991.  This information is supplemented by information provided by boards form time to time in response to queries from my Department.  The Deputy should note that the problem of homelessness varies form board to board and, accordingly, the reporting format also varies.  However, all health boards have dealt with the issue of homelessness in their most recent section 8 reports.</P>
      <P>The general techniques involved in the assessment of homelessness are as follows: &mdash; assessment by the social work service to determine the cause of homelessness and the appropriate response; co-operation between the boards and other agencies such as the Probation and Welfare Service, the Garda, schools, youth skills and training scheme organisers, youth organisations and voluntary agencies in assessing and responding to the problem; the collation and analysis of data regarding age, gender, reasons for homelessness, predisposing factors, social workcare profiles and the mental health status of the client group and also on the appropriate response joint working between social workers, clinical psychologists and child psychiatrists and the homeless young person and his-her family, where appropriate.</P>

      <P>This year £1.189 million has been allocated to the employment support scheme.  The scheme continues to operate.  I am advised that 388 persons with a disability are currently employed with the assistance of the ESS.  My Department is examining ways to expand the scheme and provide additional funding to employers who wish to avail of the scheme.  As the Deputy will be aware the Government decided in November 1997 to form <Col N="1016" /> an establishment group, tasked with the preparation of detailed proposals for, <i>inter alia,</i> the establishment of a national disability authority. As part of its remit the establishment group, which is chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is addressing the transfer of certain responsibilities in relation to the training and employment of people with disabilities, including the ESS from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The current arrangement whereby the Department of Health and Children has responsibility for matters relating to vocational training and employment of people with disabilities is outdated and reflects the old medical model rather than the currently accepted economic and social rights model.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to ENT services, I have made inquiries of the hospital authorities and I understand there are a total of 775 patients on the ENT waiting list, mainly for tonsillectomies.  The waiting time for those on the routine waiting list is approximately three years and for those on the non-routine list it is approximately one year. However, the hospital has identified a number of measures aimed at reducing the list.  It is in the process of validating the ENT waiting list and it is anticipated that this exercise will result in a significant reduction in numbers waiting and in waiting times.</P>
      <P>The hospital is exploring the possibility of opening its fourth theatre this year which should facilitate the ENT surgeon in carrying out additional procedures.  The Deputy may be aware that the hospital's 1998 letter of allocation included a sum of £100,000 specifically to deal with waiting lists, and I understand ENT procedures have been identified as the hospital's priority for this funding.  The Deputy may wish to know that a sum of £40,000 was provided under the waiting list initiative in 1996, and again in 1997, for additional activity, including additional ENT procedures.</P>
      <P>With regard to the individual patient referred to by the Deputy, as the determination of inpatient appointments is a matter for the hospital authorities in the first instance, based on a clinical assessment of need, I have asked the secretary-manager of the Children's Hospital, Temple Street to investigate the position regarding this patient.  Given the particular circumstances of this case, I have requested that he reply to the Deputy directly as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The number of cases of hepatitis A notified by health boards to my Department for the period 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998 is 378.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis A is a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981.  There is a statutory requirement on all general practitioners to notify their local Director of Community Care-Medical Officer of Health (DCC-MOH) of all cases of hepatitis A. On a weekly basis, the DCC-MOH's in turn notify the Department of the number of cases occurring in their area.  However, a breakdown by location is not required under the regulations.  Therefore, it is not possible to indicate the number of cases linked to schools.</P>
      <P>Control of infectious diseases is the statutory responsibility of the relevant health board and where an outbreak of hepatitis A occurs a range of measures, including providing advice on personal hygiene and provision, where necessary, of immunisation, is employed by the health board.</P>
      <P>A safe and effective hepatitis A vaccine is available and may be used in the case of outbreaks and to immunise those who may be at particular risk of acquiring hepatitis A. Department policy on this issue is guided by the advice of the Immunisation Advisory Committee, an expert group established by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  These guidelines provide information on the use of hepatitis A vaccine and other preventative agents in outbreaks, including those linked to schools, so as to prevent the transmission of the hepatitis A virus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware I recently approved a package of enhanced financial supports for student nurses participating in the nursing registration diploma programmes, including a 20 per cent increase in their annual maintenance grant. The total extra cost of these improved supports in 1998 alone is in the region of £1 million.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that student nurses participating in the nursing diploma programmes receive a far higher level of financial support than other third level students.  Each student nurse receives an annual maintenance grant of £3,000.  This grant is not subject to a means test.  In contrast, other third level students are required to satisfy a means test to qualify for a maintenance grant, the maximum rate of which is £1,624 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the abolition of third level fees does not extend to the nursing diploma programmes, the student nurses' fees continue to be paid by the <Col N="1020" /> relevant health agency on their behalf.  The average annual fee is about £1,300.</P>
    <P>A book allowance of £200 and a uniform allowance of £120 is also provided for each student nurse commencing the diploma programme.  They are also entitled to receive free meals on a seven-day per week basis in designated restaurants in health institutions.</P>
    <P>In addition, a new allowance of £20 per week was recently introduced to assist students undertaking external placements.  This is payable where it is necessary for the student to find accommodation for the duration of the placement. Students undertaking such placements who do not require accommodation receive a free weekly travel pass.</P>
    <P>The average annual total value of these supports is some £6,000 per student nurse, which compares most favourably with the level of funding available to other third level students.</P>
    <P>I presume Deputy Farrelly is referring to the one year full-time degree course which University College, Galway, is offering to students who have successfully completed the first general nursing registration-diploma programme which was introduced in 1994.</P>
    <P>The position is that successful completion by a student of the three year nursing registration-diploma programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais, at which point he or she will become eligible for employment as a nurse.  Since a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, such a qualification would be an optional post-registration qualification.  Members of the nursing profession wishing to undertake a nursing degree programme are, therefore, responsible for making their own arrangements, including the payment of course fees.  I am not in a position to provide funding for these courses.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing in its interim report has identified a number of issues relating to pre-registration nursing education and training, which it is expected to address in its final report.  I consider that it would be prudent to await the outcome of the deliberations of the Commission before contemplating any changes in the present arrangements, which are in compliance with the rules of An Bord Altranais and the relevant EU Directives.</P>

      <P>The latest consultant manpower survey carried out by Comhairle na nOspidéal indicates that there was a total of 220 women filling permanent consultant posts in the public health services at 1 January 1998.  This represents 18.47 per cent of the overall total number of permanent consultant posts in the public health services.</P>
      <P>Given that 12.9 per cent or 133 permanent consultant posts were held by women in 1990 some progress has been made in this regard.  The number of women in non-consultant hospital doctor posts has also increased over the period 1994-1996. For example, in 1994 some 42 per cent of registrars in the public health system were women while 49 per cent of these posts were held by women in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While progress has been made in ensuring that a more equitable male-female ratio obtains in overall non-consultant hospital doctor and hospital consultant appointments it is apparent <Col N="1022" /> that more progress needs to be made if the goal of equality of opportunity is to be met.</P>
    <P>The role of my Department in securing such progress is in maintaining adherence to equal opportunities legislation in relation to recruitment and selection procedures and in encouraging the professional bodies and employers to ensure that any perceived obstacles to progress are removed.  My Department has emphasised to health service employers, most recently through the issuing of a Model Equal Opportunities Policy for the Health Service in September 1997, of the need to ensure that discrimination which impedes achievement of full equality of opportunity will not be tolerated.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy that a major medical manpower crisis threatens the effectiveness of our public health service's acute hospitals. However, there is a need to address a number of medical manpower issues including those raised by the collaborative study group on medical manpower in acute hospitals, comprising representatives of the Department of Health, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board which produced a discussion document on medical manpower in acute hospitals in March 1993 and which were considered by a consultative conference in March 1996.</P>
      <P>My Department has been engaged in a process of consultation with the training and registration bodies in the context of developing a strategy to gain support for an agreed way forward on these issues.</P>

      <P>Section 261 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, states that a person not of unsound mind may be lodged as a boarder in a mental hospital.  The decision to lodge a person in a psychiatric hospital is clinically based.  Persons who are lodged are cared for similarly to those admitted as voluntary, temporary or persons of unsound mind patients.  There is no limit to the length of time a person can be lodged as a boarder and such persons are not detained against their will.</P>

      <P>Allergies arise from a wide variety of causes and affect individuals in many different ways.  Therefore, beyond advising sufferers to keep in close contact with their general practitioners or hospital consultant about their own particular situation, it is difficult to set down a general policy position which would adequately reflect the full range of situations which can arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that immunotherapy treatment for hayfever and other allergies is available in public hospitals.  However, as regards food allergies, the Deputy may wish to know that my Department has written to the health boards and <Col N="1025" /> voluntary hospitals alerting them to the problem of food allergies and outlining such issues as the likely symptoms and the appropriate treatment of patients presenting allergic reactions.  My Department asked the health boards and voluntary hospitals to bring its correspondence in relation to food allergies to the attention of all appropriate medical personnel in the relevant hospital or health board area, including, in particular, general practitioners.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for different aspects of policy on genetically modified organisms spans several Government Departments.</P>
      <P>My Department is responsible for Regulation (EC) 258/97, which applies to the placing on the market of novel foods and novel food ingredients. Food and food ingredients which have not hitherto been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community and which contain or are produced from a genetically modified organism fall, <i>inter alia,</i> within its scope.  The regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients, if not substantially equivalent to their non-novel counterparts, must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved/authorised before being placed on the European market.</P>

    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and <Col N="1026" /> Employment has responsibility for developments in the biotechnology industry.</P>

    <P>90/219/EEC on the contained use of genetically modified organisms and for Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms. This encompasses research and development including field trials, and the placing on the market of products containing genetically modified organisms but excludes those products which fall within the scope of the Novel Food Regulation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is at present preparing a national position paper on the issue of genetic modification.  My Department will be happy to contribute to those aspects of this exercise which fall within its competence.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that it can take 18 months for the Eastern Health Board to commence an assessment for suitability to adopt abroad; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the Irish Foreign Adoption Group have stated that the process in the Eastern Health Board area takes 41 hours of meetings and attendance at a pre-adoption course compared to an average of ten hours in the other seven health boards and that couples who have already adopted are subject to virtually the same process if they wish to adopt a second time; if he will intervene to speed up this process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the Irish Foreign Adoption Group last year and discussed in detail its concerns as outlined by the Deputy.  I also met senior management of the Easten Health Board to discuss the delays in carrying out assessments of couples who wished to adopt children from abroad.  Arising from the additional funding approved to the Eastern Health Board for child care services in 1998 the board has proposed, in its 1998 service plan, the appointment of three new social workers to its adoption service.  This will facilitate a speedier assessment of couples who wish to adopt children abroad.</P>
      <P>I understand that the current waiting time prior to assessment in the Eastern Health Board is 12 months; a reduction of two months on 1997.  This reduction can be accounted for by the allocation of additional resources and to greater efficiencies in the overall process of application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Eastern Health Board includes attendance at preparatory courses as part of its overall assessment process and this adds to the duration of the actual assessment.  However, the board has found that these courses have been of enormous benefit to both prospective adoptive parents and social workers. <Col N="1037" /> There are a number of additional matters including the progress of the first adoption which must be taken into account in the assessment of a couple wishing to adopt for a second time.  I intend to meet the Eastern Health Board again in the near future with a view to discussing the overall assessment process including the issues outlined by Deputy Haughey.</P>

      <P>Treatment of drug addicts continues to be a top priority within the health services and in the Eastern Health Board where the drug problem is most acute services continue to be enhanced and expanded.  A review group was set up in 1997 to advise on the approaches to be taken in the future in relation to the management and care of heroin dependent drug misusers.  The report, which was presented to me last year, was circulated nationwide to each general practitioner and pharmacist in January of this year, and outlines continued best practice in the treatment of opiate misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report's recommendations include the following:- methadone treatment continues to be a valid treatment for opiate dependent persons; the continuation of the central treatment list of patients being prescribed methadone.  Under this arrangement a general practitioner who is considering prescribing methadone for a patient can check whether the patient's name is on this treatment list and so minimise the possibility that the patient concerned is receiving methadone from more than one source; a personalised treatment card for each patient to be held by a local pharmacist who holds it for the duration of treatment; support to GPs and pharmacists through the appointment of GP facilitators including close liaison and communication arrangements with health board services in the event of a patient destabilising; contractual arrangements with GPs, pharmacists, etc.; the provision for supervised <Col N="1038" /> administration of methadone in cases where a general practitioner feels the need for this; the introduction of regulations to require that the prescription and supply of methadone be restricted to official prescription forms specifically designed for the purpose; specific training and information for GPs and pharmacists on the treatment of opiate dependent persons; and methadone monitoring to be placed on a statutory basis by regulation under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>
    <P>Since last year, a committee, comprised of representatives from the Eastern Health Board, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the General Medical Services (Payments) Board and the Department of Health and Children has been working on implementing the recommendations contained in the report.  The committee meets on a regular basis to work on the arrangements to allow for the smooth implementation of all of the recommendations.  Most of the ground work has now been put in place and full implementation of the recommendations is expected during the summer. This full implementation of the report's recommendations will make changes to the present system, as it will result in tighter control and monitoring of all those involved in prescribing and dispensing of methadone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, he-she may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of this special provision it is felt that it is not justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means, as a general rule, particularly in <Col N="1039" /> view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the arrangements referred to above the Government has identified as a key priority in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and my Department has made the necessary arrangements to advance this review with the health boards.</P>
    <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charges. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.  Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for those who do not have a medical card and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>

      <P>Under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, as amended by the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1997, a person is liable for a statutory charge unless otherwise exempt, in respect of in-patient public hospital services.  Currently, the charge is £25 per night subject to a maximum payment in any 12 consecutive months of £250.</P>
      <P>Public hospital statutory charges are based on the principle that those who can afford to do so are required to make a contribution towards the cost of providing hospital services.  There are a number of exemptions to the charge, including medical card holders, women receiving services in respect of motherhood and persons receiving services in respect of prescribed infectious diseases.  Furthermore, the charge may be waived in respect of an individual if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>
      <P>VHI Plan P covers the payment of the statutory charge only.  There are no other benefits available under the plan which costs £15.98 per adult per annum.  It is a matter for the person concerned to determine if he requires such cover.  If he is not entitled to a medical card or is not otherwise exempt he is liable for the charge.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to those who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  Based on the details supplied by the Deputy the income of the person concerned is above the guidelines.  However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though his income exceeds the guidelines, he may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that his medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  If the person concerned considers that he has an entitlement on this basis he should make an application for a medical card to his local community care office.</P>

      <P>As part of the Government's Action on House Prices, the rent charged on the local authority's portion of the equity is being reduced from 5 per cent to 4.5 per cent of the updated value of the equity, in respect of shared ownership transactions completed on or after 1 May 1998.  This change, which amounts to a 10 per cent reduction in the gross rent, will be of significant benefit to all qualifying participants, including those making maintenance payments.  I do not propose to make any further changes to the terms of the scheme at present.</P>

      <P>Under the new urban renewal scheme, which is due to come into operation on 1 August 1998, integrated area plans for Kilmallock, New-castle West and Rathkeale were submitted by Limerick County Council on 9 April 1998.</P>
      <P>Guidelines for the new urban renewal scheme made it clear that local authorities were expected to give priority to areas in cities and towns with strong urban characteristics and the highest concentrations of physical decay and socio-economic disadvantage in selecting areas for the preparation of integrated area plans.  The extent to which the integrated area plans submitted to my Department meet the criteria for the new scheme will be assessed by a broadly based expert advisory panel which I established last year to assess all the plans submitted and make recommendations in relation to the designation of areas for tax incentives.  Until such time as the plans have been examined by the expert advisory panel and considered further in the light of the panel's recommendations it will not be possible to say which towns are likely to be included in the new scheme.</P>

      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency's report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland in 1996, with a review of the period 1994-6, confirms the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water.  The report records compliance levels of close to or above 99 per cent in respect of health related parameters other than coliforms.  In the case of coliforms, there was a small increase in compliance in 1996, to 87.85 per cent, in comparison with the previous two years.  However, the report highlights the continued difficulties being experienced with this <Col N="1045" /> parameter in the more vulnerable private group and small private supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A range of measures was introduced by my Department in 1997 to deal with water quality problems in these supplies.  Measures include grant assistance for new group water schemes, the upgrading and taking in charge of existing group water schemes and grants to householders to install or upgrade private piped supplies.  Over £20 million was spent on these measures in 1997 and a provision of £28.15 million has been made for further expenditure in this regard in my Department's 1998 Estimates.  In addition, the National Rural Monitoring Committee was launched on 5 May 1998 to advise on national policy on rural water services and report on implementation of the range of measures aimed at correcting deficiencies in rural supplies.  One of the committee's key functions is to consider and approve a model strategic rural water plan which <Col N="1046" /> will provide a blueprint for upgrading and renewal of rural water supply systems into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>I understand that the EPA is collecting and collating the data on the quality of water supplies in 1997, and that its report will be published later this year.</P>

      <P>Shared owners must purchase at least a 40 per cent share in the house and that portion will normally be funded by way of the required deposit of £1,000 and a mortgage loan from the local authority, but cash may be contributed if the applicant is in a position to do so.  The actual maximum house price amount for which an applicant will be approved by local authorities, which are responsible for administering the scheme in their areas, would depend on the individual's circumstances and ability to meet the financial commitments involved.  The income limit for eligibility for shared ownership has been increased, in the context of the Government's Action on House Prices, to £20,000 for a single income household with appropriate increase for two income households.  This will increase significantly the maximum house price which eligible shared owners would be in a position to purchase.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, when a person finishes a community employment scheme and is eligible for unemployment assistance, any rent allowance he has is reduced; the action, if any, he will take on this anomaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>People in receipt of rent or mortgage interest supplement are required to contribute towards their rent or mortgage interest costs.  The minimum contribution is £6 per week which applies to people whose means are equal to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate, currently £65.40 per week for a single person. People who have assessable means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate are required to contribute £6 plus the amount of means in excess of the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance, SWA rate.</P>
      <P>For example, people on long-term unemployment assistance receive £2.10 more than the relevant SWA rate and are required to contribute a total of £8.10 per week, £6.00 plus £2.10, towards their rent or mortgage interest costs.  People on one parent family payment who have two children receive £6.10 more than the relevant SWA rate and are required to contribute a total of £12.10 per week, £6.00 plus £6.10, towards their rent or mortgage interest costs.</P>
      <P>Under the rules of the community employment, scheme, participants are paid a set weekly wage which is generally greater than the social welfare payment that they formerly received. However, the amount of rent supplement payable is calculated on the basis that all participants contribute a standard minimum contribution of £8.10 per week towards their accommodation costs.  In practice, this means that a higher rate of rent supplement is payable than would be the case under the standard means test which applies to other applicants for rent supplement.</P>
      <P>When participants finish a particular CE programme, they are then subject to the normal means test which is less favourable than that which applies while they are on the CE scheme. This can result in a reduction in rent supplement to the standard levels applicable to people in similar household and financial circumstances.</P>
      <P>In the normal course, former CE workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment should continue, where appropriate, to receive a rent supplement although they may qualify for a lower rate than that received while participating on the CE scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CE participants are insured for PRSI class A benefits from 6 April 1996.  As a result, those who complete the CE programme may qualify for unemployment benefit.  As unemployment benefit is paid at a higher rate than SWA, their rent supplement is reduced accordingly.  Any increase <Col N="1054" /> in means will result in a decrease in the rent supplement rate payable as the more means a person has the less supplementation they will receive.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance is available to people who are in receipt of certain long-term welfare-type payments or who satisfy a means test and who are either living alone, with dependent children or with a spouse or other person who is providing care for the applicant or who is permanently incapacitated and therefore unable to summon help in an emergency.</P>
      <P>Pensioners aged 75 or over may retain the allowance even where the qualifying household and medical conditions are no longer met, for example where another person comes to live with them.  This concession applies similarly in the case of couples, as soon as the pensioner in receipt of the qualifying payment reaches age 75.</P>
      <P>The type of case referred to in the question, concerns a situation where the pensioner is 73 and the spouse is 75.  Neither spouse is permanently incapacitated.  The pensioner himself is not yet eligible for the allowance, but his spouse might qualify in her own right, either by being in receipt of a relevant qualifying payment or by satisfying a means test and provided the telephone account was registered in her name.  The weekly means limit applicable to such a household is £163.40 a week.  If the spouse's half of the aggregate household income is below this limit, then she would be eligible.</P>
      <P>If the persons concerned wish to have their entitlement to free telephone rental allowance examined, they should complete and send the relevant application form to the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 and 242 together.</P>
      <P>Recipients of social welfare or health board payments, who have been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a diet supplement is determined by the health boards under the provisions of S.I. No. 382 of 1995, as amended by S.I. 190 of 1996, which specify the medical conditions in respect of which a diet supplement may be paid.  The various types of recognised diets are grouped into two categories, with the amount of supplement payable depending on which category of diet has been prescribed by the applicant's medical adviser.</P>
      <P>The amount payable depends on the type of diet and on the person's weekly means.  The formula typically results in payments of up to £6.20 per week in the case of one category of diets and up to £14.20 in the case of the other category of diets.  The average weekly expenditure on diet supplements is estimated at £60,000 with approximately 6,800 cases in payment.  I am arranging to send to the Deputy a number of examples showing how the calculations are made in practice.</P>
      <P>In the past, people in receipt of diet supplements could experience a reduction in the amount of their dietary allowance as a result of an increase in their basic social welfare or health board payments.  While it is accepted that the current method of calculation is complicated, it was introduced in 1997 to prevent general budgetary increases reducing the rate of diet supplement already in payment.  It is intended to review the diet supplement element of supplementary welfare allowance, including the formula for calculation. Any changes would have to be made in the context of the budget.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over as well as certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  At the end of last January, free travel passes had been issued in respect of about 505,000 people at an estimated annual cost of £33 million.</P>
      <P>The operation of the free travel scheme is based on the use of spare capacity and, therefore, time restrictions have been a feature of this scheme since its inception.  They apply generally from 7.00 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. Monday to Friday inclusive, and on Bus Éireann long distance buses from 4.00 p.m. to 7.00 a.m. on Fridays for up to 20 miles out from Dublin, Cork or Limerick.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been put in place on city and provincial bus routes because the transport companies concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening.  They do not, however, apply in the case of people with mental disabilities, those attending long-term rehabilitation courses and certain other people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>While the issue of time restrictions has been discussed with the CIE companies on a number of occasions, their position remains that the capacity constraints faced at peak hours do not allow for an easing of those time restrictions.</P>
      <P>However, the free travel scheme, in common with the other free schemes operated by this Department, is kept under review with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements and the issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>Since July 1997 I have set up a number of committees and working groups, the details of which are set out below.  In general, the costs incurred are incidental expenses associated with servicing the work of the groups.</P>
      <P>The Working Group on Women's Access to Labour Market Opportunities was established under Partnership 2000 and held its first meeting in October 1997.  The group is comprised of 13 members, representative of the four Pillars of Partnership 2000 and relevant Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The Small Business Users' Forum was set up in December 1997 between the Department and the Revenue Commissioners to consider how the administration of the social welfare and PAYE systems can be improved and simplified.  There is an overall steering group made up of representatives from all the organisations involved and business users panels comprising of employers and public servants.  The steering group has a total of 11 members.  Each business user panel will have 12 to 15 members.  The work of the forum will be ongoing and recommendations will be made on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>The Inter-Departmental Community Trust Working Group was set up in February to examine the feasibility of establishing a community trust to support voluntary and community activity in Ireland.  The group includes representatives from eight Government Departments and is expected to submit its proposals within a few months.</P>

Seventeen people have been invited to participate in the group in addition to three representatives from my Department.  The group's first meeting will take place on 8 May 1998.</P>
      <P>Regarding programme evaluations, the Department is engaged in a programme of expenditure reviews in a number of different areas and working groups have been set up, with representatives of other relevant Departments to assist the process. Costs, as yet unquantified, will arise in the engagement of outside expertise to assist on some of this work.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Government has approved the establishment of a National Museum of Ireland folklife facility at Turlough Park House, Castlebar, County Mayo in co-operation with Mayo County Council.  The Government agreed that a sum of £5 million would be earmarked for this purpose from funds available for cultural tourism purposes under the EU Structural Funds assisted Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-9.  The total capital cost of the project facility is estimated at £8.53 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A steering group has been established, chaired by my Department, and comprising representatives of the Office of Public Works, the National Museum, Mayo County Council, and the Department of Finance to supervise the progress of the project.  The Office of Public Works is acting as agent for my Department and the museum and is responsible for the management of the project, including the necessary legal, property and construction <Col N="1063" /> aspects of the development.  In this regard, I understand that negotiations are proceeding satisfactorily with the council regarding the terms of a lease to be executed relating to part of the Turlough Park House Demesne to enable the development of the folklife museum to be progressed.</P>
    <P>Functional and exhibition documents are at an advanced stage of preparation, which will inform the overall strategy to be adopted for this facility. As part of this process, a design is currently being prepared with a view to lodging planning permission documents for the proposed works, during the summer-autumn 1998 period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following formal task forces and working groups have been set up under the aegis of my Department since July 1997.</P>
      <P>A working group on the establishment of an academy for the performing arts, including a conservatoire in Dublin was established in March of this year jointly by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, and the Islands and the Minister for Education, Deputy Martin.  The working group will report to both Ministers on the steps necessary to establish the academy.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference include making proposals on the scope of the academy, identifying the ongoing cost and staffing implications of the establishment of the academy, reporting on the appropriateness and the suitability of the existing buildings at Earlsfort Terrace for accommodating the academy, identifying the potential for non-Exchequer funding for part of the capital costs, examining the financial implications of relocating the current educational facilities housed in Earlsfort Terrace, the timescale for such relocation, and the likely agreement of all interested parties in the relocation.</P>
      <P>The group comprises 11 members including a chairman and is due to report at an early date. No significant costs are anticipated arising from the establishment of the group at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group has been established to co-ordinate the development of specific policy proposals and actions in the context of the policy statement on architecture adopted by Government.  The working group is chaired by the principal architect, Office of Public Works, and has seven members.  The working group will identify an initial set of key issues to <Col N="1064" /> be addressed and will report to me within 12 months.  No significant costs are expected to arise from the establishment of this group.</P>
    <P>The task force for the Grand and Royal Canals was re-established in March 1998 under the chairmanship of Mr. Pat Magner.  The terms of reference of the task force are to co-ordinate and monitor the activities of the various agencies responsible for the development of the canal corridor, and to provide the necessary impetus for the implementation of the strategy and proposals in the consultants reports entitled Grand Canal Corridor Study, and Royal Canal Corridor Study.</P>
    <P>The membership of the task force is restricted to those public agencies involved in the canal corridors, including my own Department, the local authorities and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, and the Department of Environment and Local Government.  Currently the task force has a membership of ten including its chairman.  The task force will submit an annual report to me in each of the next three years.  Secretarial services and the use of a conference room are provided by my Department.  No significant costs are expected to arise as a result of the reestablishment of this task force.</P>
    <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on the Islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish Language will co-ordinate the implementation of Government policy with regard to the offshore islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language, seek to ensure that this policy is implemented in an effective manner, and review the provision of services to offshore islands and Gaeltacht regions by Government Departments and State agencies and where duplication occurs rationalise these services by consultation and agreement.</P>
    <P>Each Government Department was asked to nominate a representative to the committee.  The secretarial services are provided from my Department's offices in na Forbacha, Gaillimh and the committee which is chaired by Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, will meet on a regular basis.  No significant costs are expected to arise as a result of the establishment of this committee.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above I recently announced the establishment of an Appeals Board, under the chairmanship of Mr. Michael Mills, the former Ombudsman and local liaison committees as part of the arrangements for implementing the provisions of the EU Habitats Directive which requires the designation of special areas of conservation. The Appeals Board and the liaison committees are in the process of being established.</P>
    <P>I will announce shortly a think tank on the film industry.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for establishing and chairing an expert working group on childcare with a view to devising a national framework for the development of childcare facilities.  The establishment of the expert working group arises from a commitment contained in the Partnership 2000 agreement para</P>
      <P>5.7. The group is expected to complete its report by December 1998.</P>
      <P>The expert working group is to develop a national framework, which integrates the various strands of the current arrangements, with the intention of developing and delivering quality childcare services in Ireland.  There are 69 members in the group who represent a range of Departments, statutory bodies, non-governmental organisations and individuals who have expertise in the area of childcare.</P>
      <P>The expert working group is currently considering a range of childcare issues including the financing of affordable and accessible childcare provision by a variety of means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February 1998 the Government approved an equal opportunities childcare programme initiative. The aim of this initiative is to provide support for local childcare projects in disadvantaged areas to assist those with family responsibilities who <Col N="1067" /> wish to avail of training, education and employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>My Department has an allocation of £2.6 million in Exchequer and European Regional Development Fund funding for this programme in 1998.  The money will be used to fund the following initiatives: capital infrastructure for childcare projects with a focus on equal opportunities and disadvantage; core funding for a selection of pilot childcare projects; and employer demonstration childcare initiative to stimulate employer interest and involvement in supporting equal opportunities childcare facilities.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic Acts, 1961-1995, provide for a broad range of offences which probably comprehend the kind of behaviour understood by the term &ldquo;road rage&rdquo;.  These offences include dangerous driving, careless driving, driving without reasonable consideration for other persons using the roads, and speeding. When such offences are detected, appropriate action is taken.  The Garda authorities have assured me that the high priority given to enforcement of the road traffic laws will continue with the primary aim of reducing the high rate of accidents and, in addition, of bringing home to motorists the need to exercise at all times due care and consideration for other road users.</P>

On 13 March 1998, my Department, in response to a letter received from the French Ministry of Justice on 11 March, reconveyed the information previously conveyed through diplomatic channels to the French diplomatic authorities but which apparently had not been passed to the Ministry of Justice; a further copy of the formal response of 23 December 1997 to the letter of request was enclosed.  On 20 March 1998, my Department acknowledged a letter received on that date from the French Ministry of Justice forwarding a letter dated 3 February 1998 from the Investigating Magistrate addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions and confirmed that the letter had been transmitted as requested.</P>
      <P>As regards the investigation of the case, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation file has been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and his directions are awaited.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the person to whom the Deputy refers but it is long standing practice not to comment in detail on the case of an individual prisoner and I do not propose to make an exception to that practice in this instance.</P>
      <P>Before a review takes place detailed documentation is prepared for presentation to the group.  This would include, probation and welfare report, psychological-psychiatric report, if appropriate and report of local review committee. For these reports to be meaningful the prisoner must first engage for a reasonable period with the probation and welfare services and the therapeutic services.  The person referred to in the Deputy's question transferred to this jurisdiction in December last year and it is hoped that he will be seen by the Sentence Review Group later this year, possibly September. The Deputy may also wish to note that the person referred to has been kept fully informed by my Department.</P>

      <P>Under the local bargaining clause of the PCW it was open to each group in the Public Service to conduct separate negotiations in pursuit of their own claims.  Both the GRA and AGSI settled early in the process and accepted a pensions deal which made their unsocial hours earnings reckonable for pensions purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other groups in the Public Service settled later for agreements which provided for pay increases and also included elements of productivity and savings in order to meet the PCW cost requirements. Given these different approaches it was agreed to re-examine the situation of the Garda Síochána.  Pay discussions between the official side and the various Garda associations were commenced under an independent chairperson, Mr. Declan Brennan.  The Garda associations made both written and oral submissions and the official side made an offer of a 5.5 per cent increase to both the GRA and AGSI by reference <Col N="1072" /> to the norm for PCW local bargaining for the Public Service generally.  However, the offer also provided for the continuation of discussions to see whether further possibilities existed by identifying improved productivity and savings.  This was in line with the approach adopted for other Public Service grades.</P>
    <P>The AGSI has accepted an invitation from the independent chairperson to pursue this avenue but the GRA, regrettably, has not.  I would strongly urge the GRA to return to the pay discussions where I feel a satisfactory solution can be agreed.  I am satisfied that this is the only way to progress the matter.</P>

      <P>Kevin Street Garda station is situated in the Liberties next door to Marsh's Library and St. Patrick's Cathedral.  It has been a police station in one form or another since 1806.  Prior to this it was known as the Palace of St. Sepulchre and the building is over 800 years old.</P>
      <P>The building was sold to the Dublin Mounted Police and became a barracks from then until 1922, after which it was occupied by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The building is owned by the Commission of Public Works.  It is proposed to include the building in the Draft Dublin City Development Plan 1998, as a preserved building because of its historical interest.</P>

    <P>In addition to the above there is a National Steering Committee on Violence against Women that was established in July 1997, which while not appointed by me personally comes under the aegis of my Department.  This committee is chaired by the Minister of State at this Department, Deputy Mary Wallace.  The remit of the committee, as recommended by the report of the Task Force on Violence against Women, includes the development of a public awareness campaign in this area, ensuring the establishment of regional and local structures and overseeing the development of policies and guidelines in this area.  The membership of the committee comprises representatives of the key Departments and agencies in the area, as well as representatives <Col N="1074" /> of relevant non-governmental organisations. The intention is that the committee, which has a budget of £100,000 for 1998, will produce periodic reports.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Bill, 1997, which was published on 1 December 1997 prohibits discrimination in employment on a wide range of grounds, including age. The Bill has completed its passage through the Seanad and is expected to commence Committee Stage in the Dáil next week. The legislation will apply to both public and private sectors employments and when enacted will place Ireland among the most advanced EU member states in tackling ageism in employment.</P>
      <P>A revised Equal Status Bill, which will prohibit discrimination on the same range of grounds in non-employment areas, is being developed at present. The Bill is expected to be published later this year.</P>

      <P>The report of the Steering Group on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Garda Síochána proposed the development of a new control and accountability framework which would see the devolution to the Garda Commissioner of the role of Accounting Officer allied to the introduction of specific performance measures. The Government has agreed in principle with the recommendations of the report and has established a new steering group, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Kevin Bonner, charged with overseeing the implementation of the report's recommendations.  I expect the steering group to consider and make recommendations on any legislative requirements in due course.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 240 on 31 March last, the scheme for investment-based naturalisation was administered by my predecessors pursuant to their powers under section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as inserted by section 5 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986.</P>
      <P>As I have said in the House on previous occasions, the exact criteria for naturalisation under the scheme varied over time.  In practice, they appear to have centred, up to 1994, on acquisition of a residence in the State.</P>
      <P>The records in my Department confirm that, of the 95 adults who applied in the period 1988 to 1994 and were subsequently naturalised, the vast majority, 83, purchased a residence in the State. Our records in the Department may not be completely exhaustive but I have put the Deputy in possession of the information I have in this matter.</P>

As the Deputy may be aware, the Government formally decided on 20 April that the scheme in question should be abolished.  The Deputy has tabled a number of questions in the past few months about the operation of the scheme and, despite the fact that the questions relate to events which long predate my assuming office, I have provided the Deputy with as much information as possible, short of identifying the companies or investors involved.</P>

      <P>The local office of the Land Registry in Limerick is located in the Circuit Court office which is under the control and management of the county registrar.  The Land Registry records at the local office are normally continuously updated from information received from the Central Office of the Land Registry in Waterford.  However, since the granting of a career break last December to a member of staff in the Circuit Court office, it has proved impossible to keep the records there up to date.  As these records are relied upon by legal practitioners engaged in the conveyancing of property for clients, it was felt that liability might be incurred for potential loss because of failure to keep the records up to date.  Consequently the county registrar decided to close the Land Registry section temporarily with effect from 6 April, 1998.</P>
      <P>Last December, my Department immediately sought to fill the vacancy in Limerick Circuit Court office but due to difficulties outside its control has not yet been able to do so.</P>
      <P>However, the current position is that arrangements are being made to hold interviews for the vacant position which will be filled shortly hereafter, thus enabling the county registrar to reopen the Land Registry section in Limerick Circuit Court office.</P>

      <P>On 23 October 1997, the Olympic Council of Ireland sought funding of £97,500 from my Department to send a team of 104 competitors and 34 officials to the inaugural World Youth Olympics in Moscow in July 1998.  The Olympic Council indicated that it had no funds at its disposal to meet the cost of participation.  The request for funding was subsequently increased to £147,500 &mdash; the additional £50,000 to meet the cost of sports gear.</P>
      <P>Following correspondence between my Department and the Olympic Council of Ireland, the application was considered at a meeting of the High Performance Advisory Committee of the Irish Sports Council held on 10 December 1997.  A representative of the Olympic Council of Ireland attended this meeting to make a presentation on the application.  Based on the information provided, the High Performance Advisory Committee recommended to me the allocation of a grant of £50,000 or 75 per cent of the costs involved, whichever is the lesser, subject to: a more detailed cost analysis of the event when the teams have been identified; specification of criteria for the selection of the teams; and details of the preparations by the teams for the event.  I accepted this recommendation and I wrote to the President of the Olympic Council of Ireland on 19 December 1997 informing him of my decision. On 20 February 1998, I received a letter from the President of the Olympic Council of Ireland saying that, in the circumstances, they had decided to withdraw from participation in the World Youth Games.</P>

      <P>Under the student support schemes, maintenance grants are payable at either adjacent or non-adjacent rates.  The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grant-holder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college which he or she is attending.  The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.  Prior to 1995, students who were residing more than 15 miles from college and who could reasonably be expected to travel to college from home each day having regard to the journey and available public transport, were only entitled to the adjacent rate of maintenance grant.  The schemes of third level student support, since 1995, provide that the non-adjacent rate would be payable in all circumstances where the student resides more than 15 miles from college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation, the body statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme, that the <Col N="1083" /> normal residence of the student in question is within 15 miles of Tallaght Institute of Technology and therefore the student is entitled to the adjacent rate of maintenance.</P>

This staffing level was determined by reference to the school's enrolment of 478 pupils in September 1996.

      <P>The way in which funding is provided to second level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for voluntary secondary schools, vocational schools, community colleges and community and comprehensive schools.  Consequently, direct comparison between the different sectors is difficult.</P>
      <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant which also covers the VEC overheads and other activities apart from the second-level programme.  Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis while the annual budget for community and comprehensive schools takes into account factors which vary from school to school such as age of buildings, size of school, location, levels of vandalism etc.</P>
      <P>The capitation rate per pupil attending a voluntary secondary school amounts to £177.  An additional capitation grant of £30 per pupil is paid to schools which have been designated as disadvantaged. Accordingly the overall capitation grant paid to such schools amounts to £207 per pupil.</P>
      <P>The matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second level is currently being examined by a steering group on funding.  Under its terms of reference, the group will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second level sector while taking account of the needs of these different schools.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.  I have requested my Department's inspectorate to investigate the educational needs of this child with a view to arranging a suitable school placement as soon as possible.  Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services.  The precise nature of support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case.  In some cases, children with mild features of autism are educated in ordinary schools with the support, where necessary, of remedial or resource teachers.  Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in a number of special schools including schools dedicated to children with mental handicap and schools for children with emotional-behaviourial disorders.</P>
      <P>My Department has commenced a review of the operation of the pilot programme of special education services for children with autism which was first introduced in the 1995-6 school year.  This review, which is expected to be completed by the end of the current school year, will provide a basis for the development of future responses to the educational needs of children with autism.</P>

      <P>Under present arrangements at primary level, children assessed as having specific learning disability may transfer to a special school or special class for a maximum period of two years. Such children should have completed second class in a primary school or be at least eight years of age at the time of transfer.  Following their period in a special school or special class setting, the children are re-integrated into ordinary classes. Current enrolment procedures reflect the children's actual placement and resources are directed accordingly.</P>
      <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes.  In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Depending on the nature of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.  I am aware that an application for funding for block integration projects forms part of a submission which has recently been received in my Department from a special school for children with specific learning disability.  This submission is currently being examined in my Department.</P>

      <P>My Department provides capitation grants towards the day-to-day running costs of primary schools.  School authorities are required to supplement the capitation grant with a local contribution, which traditionally amounted to 25 per cent of the State grant.  I have no plans at present to abolish the requirement to raise a local contribution.  However, I would point out that since 1995 the local contribution has been frozen at £10 per pupil in the case of mainstream schools, and at £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>The State is obliged under the Constitution to provide for free primary education and to ensure that such education is available to children.  This is achieved through the partnership between the State and local community which is expressed in the State grant combined with the local contribution. I have provided for an 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level in 1998.  I wish to assure the Deputy that the matter of further increases in the capitation grant will continue to receive priority over the coming years.</P>

This circular sets out the terms for the recognition of qualified primary teachers trained outside the State for the purposes of teaching in special schools and special classes where Irish is not taught, without the necessity to have an Irish language qualification. A number of issues related to these provisions necessitated consultations with the partners in education before a circular could be finalised. These consultations have now concluded and the circular will be issued to school authorities in the very near future.</P>

The committee addressed a broad range of transport issues, including the imposition of a time limit on closure and amalgamation conditions for the purposes of determining eligibility for school transport.  The recommendations of the committee's report, which was published in January 1998, have generated extensive debate.  Serious consideration will be given to the product of this debate before any final decisions are taken on changes to the scheme.  Any change in the transport arrangements to the school in question would be considered in the context of any future amendments to the school transport scheme as a whole, as operated on a country wide basis.</P>

      <P>A scheme of additional capitation grants for the provision of caretaking and clerical services in primary schools was introduced in September 1992.  The current terms of the scheme provide for grant assistance at a rate of £15 per pupil for each service.  School authorities have discretion as to how the grant is to be applied to these services.  Rathcormac national school is in receipt of a grant of £9,000 per annum towards the cost of caretaking and clerical services.  This grant is calculated on the basis of an enrolment of 300 pupils, at a rate of £30 per pupil.  Since this is the appropriate amount payable under the current terms of the scheme, I regret that it is not open to my Department at this stage to make an additional grant available to this school.</P>

Since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science I have put in place many major policy initiatives such as the £250 million Education Technology Investment Fund, Schools IT2000, additional Youthreach places, Modern Languages for Primary Schools and the Points Commission.

I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school in question will be considered in the context of any additional resource teacher allocations which may be undertaken for the forthcoming school year.</P>

      <Quest>if a higher education grant will be paid to a person who has already completed a degree in psychoanalysis and who wishes to undertake a new degree in science in October 1998; if not, if he will amend the scheme to facilitate these applicants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme grants shall not be paid to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree. The student in question already holds an undergraduate degree and is therefore ineligible to receive a higher education grant in respect of a further period of study at the same level.  A similar situation pertains in the rules governing a student's eligibility to have tuition fees paid under the criteria for the Exchequer payment in respect of full time undergraduate fees.  I believe it is necessary to target available resources towards assisting as many students as possible to attain a third level qualification.  Any proposal to extend the scope of the student support schemes would have to have regard to overall resource constraints and other competing needs in the education sector.</P>

      <Quest>the number of substitute teachers employed on a regular basis in national schools; the proposals, if any, he has to give them greater recognition within the teaching service; whether he will provide in-career development opportunities for them to further their formal qualifications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Approximately 900 substitute teachers are required to work in primary schools annually. The majority of these teachers are fully trained and therefore do not require further training.  A proportion of substitute teaching service is given by personnel who are not recognised as fully trained primary teachers.  Many of these persons hold third level qualifications.  Post-graduate training courses to enable degree-holders qualify as primary teachers are provided from time to time by the colleges of education for primary teachers; one such course ran from January 1995 to June 1996 and a further course is being run in the period January 1997 to June 1998.  Discussions are currently on-going with the authorities of the colleges with a view to running this course again in the near future.  A public announcement will be made by my Department when this matter has been finalised.</P>

Generally, once it has been established that a community school requires additional computers, these are ordered and paid for directly by my Department.  However, should the school make a written application for funding to the planning and building unit, it will be considered in light of available resources.</P>
