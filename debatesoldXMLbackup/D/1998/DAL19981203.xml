      <P>Before the Order of Business I must deal with an item of private business. Seanad Éireann has passed a resolution in which the concurrence of Dáil Éireann is desired concerning the appointment of a joint committee of both Houses to consider the Trinity College, Dublin and the University of Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Bill, 1997. Before I call the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to move the motion, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brennan, wishes to make a proposal in respect of arrangements for taking this item.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann concurs with Seanad Éireann in its resolution communicated to Dáil Éireann on 6 November, 1998 that it is expedient that a joint committee of both Houses be appointed to consider the Trinity College, Dublin and the University of Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Bill, 1997.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. <i>d</i>9, motion re.  Leave to Introduce Supplementary Estimates, Votes 1 and 15; No. <i>e</i>9, motion re. Referral of Supplementary Estimates, Votes 1 and 15, to select committee and No. <i>c</i>9, Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance, 1998 (resumed).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in <Col N="1554" /> Standing Orders, that No. <i>d</i>9 &mdash; Leave to Introduce Supplementary Estimates, Votes 1 and 15 &mdash; subject to the agreement of No. <i>d</i>9 and No. <i>e</i>9 shall be decided without debate and any divisions demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith.  No. <i>c</i>9 shall not be considered in committee and the following arrangements shall apply to the resumed debate: the speech of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and of the Taoiseach, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 40 minutes in each case; the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case and Members may share time.</P>

      <P>I take it the House will have an opportunity to discuss the outcome of the Vienna Summit.  Will the Taoiseach convey to the German Chancellor, on behalf of this House, our rejection of the suggestion that the Amsterdam Treaty can be rewritten to introduce qualified majority voting on taxation?  During the negotiations on the treaty the Germans failed to agree changes in qualified majority voting and bringing the issue up now is a waste of energy and time.  It is contrary to the better interests of Europe and is a false debate.  Will the Taoiseach convey that to the Chancellor?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Vienna Summit is scheduled for the last week of this session. Although the Amsterdam Treaty has long been finalised, this is not the first issue relating to it to arise.  There is all-party agreement in this House that every country should implement the Amsterdam Treaty.  It was freely negotiated and, in Ireland and some other countries, was democratically voted on.  It would be more relevant if countries finalised passing and implementing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday the Taoiseach said, in response to a question from the leader of the Labour Party, that the changes in the drug refund scheme, which will put an additional burden of £10 per month on households that are dependent on prescription drugs, is an administrative matter that does not require regulations.  The Department of Health and Children has since confirmed that regulations are required.  When will these regulations be laid before the House and will there be a full debate on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked about legislation and told the House they did not require legislation. I understood that, during the debate on the changes, the Minister said they would not require regulations but were an administrative matter.  If I was wrong, I will accept it.  I will check with the Minister.  If regulations are required they <Col N="1555" /> will have to be put in place shortly because the changes are due to be implemented shortly.</P>

      <P>Regarding promised legislation, the Bretton Woods Agreement (Amendment) <Col N="1556" /> Bill, I asked on 9 October 1997 if the Taoiseach would consult with NGOs, particularly the debt relief and development organisations, given the impact this has on Ireland's relationship with the Third World.  Given that that Bill is on the notice of new business, did he consult with those organisations as indicated on 9 October 1997?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> The rainbow Government accepted the Fianna Fáil Party's Private Members' Bill, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent Abolition) Bill, 1997.  The Bill went into committee but the Government has failed to reactivate it.  What is the present situation?  It is ironic that a Bill proposed by his party appears to be stuck in a <i>cul-de-sac.</i></P>

      <P>I am not sure whether this is a question for the Chair or for the Taoiseach.  This morning I note in the questions to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that nine or ten perfectly legitimate questions have been omitted from the Order Paper, including a priority question about the interim report on a national minimum wage.  What can the Chair do to protect the rights of Deputies, and in this case of the Labour Party, to table relevant questions to the Minister?  She said she likes only nice questions but it should be appropriate to ask any questions we wish.</P>

The Taoiseach will be aware that under the British-Irish Agreement repressive legislation must be repealed.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach been in touch with the British Prime Minister since his visit to Northern Ireland last night?  Can he report progress towards clearing the impasse?  Some months ago the Minister for the Environment and Local Government promised a comprehensive and radical Bill to reform the planning laws.  On that basis a Labour Party Bill on gazumping and unfinished estates was voted down.  When will that legislation be published?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question relating to Northern Ireland, the discussions continued last night until 3 a.m. The British Prime Minister left shortly before that.  I had been in discussion with him until he left and afterwards with Seamus Mallon and Mitchell McLaughlin on the Nationalist side.  The Prime Minister will continue to deal with the UUP.  Discussions resumed this morning by telephone shortly after 7 a.m. A great deal of progress was made last night but there are still several difficulties to be wrapped up.  As soon as everybody is back in Stormont buildings, hopefully about midday, the conversations will continue.</P>
      <P>The planning Bill which is expected in the first half of 1999 will include some provisions relating to estates.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> On 20 September the Government Chief Whip published the Government's legislative programme.  The section dealing with justice, equality and law reform had six Bills: the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking and Employment) Bill; Family Law (International Protection of Children) Bill; the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill; the Data Protection (Amendment) Bill; the National Disability Authority Bill and the Criminal Law (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Bill.  Of those six Bills only the Family Law (International Protection of Children) Bill has been published.  With only two weeks to the end of this session that indicates an appalling state of lethargy in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has an enormous legislative programme and has brought forward a large number of Bills.

The National Disability Authority Bill was cleared by the Government on Tuesday and it is hoped to have at least two others on the agenda before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Two days ago I asked about the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill, 1998, which was circulated this morning.  In the Government's original legislative programme that Bill was scheduled for 1999 or possibly 1998. Will the Taoiseach agree that the purpose of the Bill is to rationalise what has already been decided by the Government in relation to making payments to ESAF, among other things, a proposal that will be opposed by my party?  If this is the case would it not have been better to structure the legislation in such a way as to allow a proper and adequate debate on debt relief and development rather than introduce a short Bill, ahead of time, which rubber stamps a decision that is not in the interests of the recipient countries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the reason for the rush in bringing forward a Bill from 1999 when he could have structured adequate legislation in 1999, satisfied most of the demands of the different Third World agencies and had a proper debate?  Is this not a classic example of the Department of Finance putting the rubber stamp on it when a decision has been taken in advance of the House discussing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will enable us to make payments under the ESAF in respect of the Brazilian package recently put forward by the IMF. That could not be achieved without providing a legislative base.

      <P>The budget is flawed by an internal contradiction.  The Minister has tried to stimulate the economy while failing to take the necessary steps to give it the capacity to respond to that stimulation.  The budget is like trying to inflate a child's swimming ring, while the child is still standing on it.  It could also be likened to a huge blood transfusion to a body with arteries which are already blocked.  The blockages in the arteries of the economy are most visible every day in the form of traffic jams.  These blockages are also to be seen in spiralling house prices, the unavailability of child care and the lengthening waiting lists for medical care.  The extra spending power in the budget will not relieve the traffic jams, bring down house prices, or relieve the child care or medical concerns of families.  If anything, it will increase the pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, on entering into the Da áil yesterday, had a budget surplus of £400 per year to distribute for every man, woman and child. However, child benefit will only increase by £36 a year while old age pensions will rise by only £312 a year.  The standard-rating of income tax allowances is welcome and will remove a structural unfairness from the tax system.  This will be potentially helpful for future budgets.  However, the contribution of two budgets introduced by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition to tax fairness has been to widen the gap between lower and upper income groups.  Following those two budgets, a single person on £15,000 a year is now better off by £14 per week after those two budgets, but a single person on £50,000 a year is better off by more than £27 per week.  For a married <Col N="1561" /> couple, the difference is even more marked, with a gain of only £18 per week for the lower income couple, as against £38.67 per week for the higher income couple.</P>
    <P>The old age pension increase of £6 per week looks much better than it is because £2.40 of it will be absorbed by inflation and £2.50 by Minister for Health and Children's reduction in drug refunds.  That leaves only £1 per week of a real increase, out of which many pensioners will be obliged to pay an increase in their differential rents.</P>
    <P>The £8 million for hospital waiting list reductions is measly.  A number of weeks ago the Minister for Health and Children seemed to imply that he does not believe in waiting list reduction initiatives.  Now he has introduced one, but it is so small it does little more than underline the Minister's lack of appreciation of the crisis facing our hospital services.  The reduction in the tax on gambling amounts gives away more money than the entire increase in provision for services for the physically and mentally disabled.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children revealed his long awaited waiting list report on budget night.  He obviously did not want it discussed, therefore, he chose to publish it last night.  This report has been in the Minister's office since last July, a period of almost six months.  During that time waiting lists have lengthened and families have been traumatised by seeing loved ones suffer in pain as they await operations.  Last July's report made a number of short-term recommendations. The review group states in its report: &ldquo;a number of recommendations. could be implemented before the end of 1998&rdquo;.  The groups clearly expected that these recommendations would have been implemented before the end of the year.  Instead, the Minister effectively buried the report by refusing to publish it and nothing has happened as a result.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told his party's Árd Fheis a number of weeks ago that no one in the country is obliged to wait more than seven months for cardiac treatment.  That statement is untrue.  If the Taoiseach had asked the Minister for Health and Children to check the lists he could have obtained the correct figures.  At the end of September this year 832 people had been waiting for cardiac surgery for 12 months or more.  The Taoiseach was as misinformed about the health services at his party's Árd Fheis, as was his predecessor when he called the 1989 general election.</P>
    <P>The official waiting lists tell only half the story. Almost every person who finally gets on to the hospital waiting list has spent anything between six months and one year waiting to obtain an appointment with a consultant to have his or her name placed on the list.  In many health board areas patients who visit their GP this week will not get a consultant's appointment before next summer.  That is before they are even included on the waiting list.  This issue is causing stress to families.</P>
    <P>Another issue causing stress to families is child <Col N="1562" /> care.  The lack of child care is not only depriving the workforce of people who want to take up paid work, it is also denying parents who choose, in an unpaid capacity, to care for their children, any relief to go shopping, visit a relative or any of the thousands of things a stay-at-home parent must do to remain sane or manage their lives.</P>
    <P>In our policies on child care, we must deliver even-handed support structures to all parents.  We must respect and value equally the work of women who fulfil the bulk of this essential, unpaid role, whether caring full-time at home or combining that role with work outside the home. Unpaid child care by parents, grandparents or other relatives must not be devalued by artificial incentives which place a higher financial value on paid forms of care for children.  Initiatives in this area must neutrally support parental choices between paid care and care by family members on a voluntary basis.  We must not introduce new inequities or financial incentives which artificially pressurise parents in one direction or another.</P>
    <P>The crisis in child care arises largely because women's role is changing.  There are 600,000 Irish women in paid employment.  Of these, it is estimated that 46 per cent have children under the age of four. The number of women working is expected to grow by 37 per cent by 2011 as a further 218,000 join or rejoin the labour force.  The change has increased the demand for child care dramatically. Meanwhile cre ches are being closed down because of planning difficulties, greatly increased regulatory costs and unsympathetic local authorities.</P>
    <P>To help deal with this crisis the Government promised tax relief for child care.  This would have benefited privileged high income families and penalised parents providing unpaid care for their children.  The Government has not proceeded with this and has no alternative strategy. This is typical of the lack of foresight that characterises Government decision making on a range of other issues.</P>
    <P>The revelation that the Education Estimates provision for 1999 is less than the no policy change provision for 1999 made 12 months ago shows that the Government is not giving priority to education.  I have said time and again that my priority for public spending is education before all other forms of spending.  Within education my priority is primary education.  It is easy to see the social policy difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael when the allocation for education did not match the Fianna Fáil no policy change provision.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael does not agree with Fianna Fáil that there is no need for a policy change in education. One in five children still leaves school functionally illiterate, unable to read instructions on a medicine bottle or fill up a job application form properly.  In a year when he opened his Budget Statement with the biggest budget surplus in the nation's history the Minister for Finance is adding only £10 million to the education budget to deal <Col N="1563" /> with disadvantage.  That is equivalent to an extra 42p for every £100 the Minister for Education and Science spends.</P>
    <P>The Government was wrong not to accept the case to include the self-employed in the family income supplement scheme.  The self-employed have families and low incomes.  Why should they be excluded from family income supplement if they can prove that their family income is below the qualifying level?  The Government refused to accept this case and decided to make changes in farmer's dole.  This was, surprisingly, welcomed by some farming organisations.  It makes it look as if the farming organisations were not making a case based on equity between farming and nonfarming families when they could be so easily bought off with a selective dole change.</P>
    <P>The farm income crisis should not be dealt with by special doles for farmers.  It should be dealt with by treating farmers the same as everybody else and allowing them qualify for family income supplement.  That is a sound principle to which no PAYE worker could object.  It does not isolate the farming community as a minority group. Special dole for particular sectors, by its nature, causes resentment and isolates one sector from another.  The Government has made the wrong choice.  The farming organisations which have supported its choice are also wrong.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s there was a national consensus to deal with the national debt.  The Government of the day responded and the problem was solved. In the early 1990s there was a national consensus to deal with chronically high unemployment.  The Government of the day responded and the problem has been partially solved.  As we turn the page of a new century there is a growing national consensus that our next task is to narrow the widening gap between the comfortable majority and the uncomfortable minority.  The gap is financial but it is also psychological, educational and geographic.  The socially-excluded are not only worse off than the rest of us, they are excluded from the consumer culture of the majority purveyed through television, often attend different schools and live in different suburbs.  That gap must be bridged.  In the budget the Government has shown no coherent commitment to do so.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government had a different set of tax priorities.  There is no sense that it has a plan.  It has a list of promises but it has no plan for housing, traffic, child care, farming or social justice.  That is the fundamental weakness of the budget, it is not part of a coherent strategy.  It is sufficient for the day but without any sense of what the ultimate destination should be.</P>
    <P>Most economists did not predict the strength of the economy's growth.  They are now suggesting that its growth pattern will not stop.  We should not be too self-congratulatory, therefore, in our reliance on economists and their analyses.  Economists, by their nature, are guiding the bus while looking out the back window.  The data on which they rely is retrospective in character.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> It is the job of politicians to analyse and identify the threats to current success.  There are two risks facing the economy &mdash; inflation and deflation.  It is hard to imagine from our current vantage point that deflation presents a threat to the economy but, as I will demonstrate, it could.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach acknowledged yesterday, we have the highest inflation rate in the euro zone at 2.6 per cent.  It has grown more quickly than in any other country in the euro zone.  There is a view in central bank circles in Europe that the Government should have a fiscally restrictive budget and run a bigger surplus on current account to reduce the risk that the inflation rate will rise further.</P>
    <P>That view is technically mistaken.  It assumes that this is a closed economy and that one can inflate or deflate it by what one does on budget day.  That is not the case.  If one stimulates the economy on budget day, a great part of the stimulus goes on imports.  One ends up, therefore, stimulating the British or American economy.  If one deflates the economy to reduce the inflation risk, one reduces the demand for British, French or German goods.  As a result the effect is spread across all our customers rather than being confined to the economy.</P>
    <P>The analysis prompting comment in central bank circles in Europe that the Government should opt for a restrictive budget to deal with the inflation risk is mistaken for the technical reason given.  This is not new but there remains an inflation risk.  It is driven by the supply, not the demand side of the economy.  It is driven principally by rising house prices and the rising cost of child care.  This will force workers into demanding pay increases that the country cannot afford without fuelling inflation.  The inflation risk is driven, therefore, by pay, not by consumer spending.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem with house prices, a structural problem which is affecting a minority of the workforce at present.  However, as more new entrants come into the workforce it will affect, through mortgages, an ever increasing segment of the workforce.  Even though house prices may not be rising very much at present, the number of people on high mortgages who pay those prices as a proportion of the total workforce will increase steadily as new people enter the workforce and others leave.  The problem of house prices and its effect on pay will increase inexorably because of the transformation of the workforce. We need a fall in house prices, not just a stabilisation, if we are to avoid the inflation risk that rising house prices can cause.</P>
    <P>The same problem arises with child care.  In the case of a household, the decision to strike for more pay is made not just collectively but by the individual participants.  If, for example, a woman going out to work finds that virtually all of her take-home pay after tax is absorbed in child care costs, even though her husband may be bringing in money which is paying other parts of the household budget, she will be so aggrieved by the <Col N="1565" /> cost of child care, that she, independently, will be disposed to go on strike for a very large pay increase over and above what the economy can afford.</P>
    <P>I contend that those two pressure points in our economy &mdash; house prices and child care pose a very real risk of generating inflation.  Unfortunately, the measures of inflation we use do not adequately take these into account.  House prices are not included in the consumer price index and I have no doubt, given that historically child care has been, to a great extent, part of the black economy, its costs are not adequately included in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>Those two threats to the economy &mdash; blockages in the arteries, to return to the analogy I used earlier &mdash; are very real and have not been addressed in a coherent way in this budget.  I realise there is not a huge market in the media this morning &mdash; perhaps the same will apply next Sunday in the post-budget euphoria &mdash; for those types of medium term considerations.  However, I assure the House they are real and they pose a genuine threat.  That is all I want to say about the risk of inflation.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Howlin, the former Minister of the Environment, is here because he is an expert on what I am going to speak about, the risk of deflation to the economy arising from fulfilment of the global warming commitments entered into at Kyoto.  There is a comfortable view in official Ireland that one can send environmental Ministers to these summits where they sign agreements.  However, no-one really expects anyone to do very much about them.  At the end of the day all we need do is put on our leprechaun hat and say, &ldquo;sure aren't we the poor Irish and can't we be exempted?&rdquo;.  If it comes to the crunch, our natural charm will get us out of whatever problem we are experiencing because of the commitments into which we have entered.  That unstated assumption we probably all make about Ireland's ability to escape from commitments will not work this time because global warming is a really serious issue.</P>
    <P>Up to three or four years ago there was a debate among scientists as to whether it was actually happening or whether we were just seeing freak weather conditions which had no underlying pattern.  That is no longer the case.  There is now, as other Deputies will concur, a scientific acceptance that global warming is a growing problem.  It is a human problem.  It is not all about the erosion of the coastline in Bettystown and a few houses having to be relocated.  Global warming is about more than coastal erosion.  It is about Bangladeshi farmers finding that their formerly fertile fields are under seawater for a large part of the year.</P>
    <P>I cannot remember whether one third or one half of the entire territory of Bangladesh has been underwater for several months.  It is worth recalling that Bengali is the third most widely spoken language in the world after Chinese and English.  This gives some idea of the number of <Col N="1566" /> souls affected by this flooding caused by global warming.  The social consequences of this are enormous.</P>
    <P>We will have no choice but to implement our commitments on global warming.  We have probably broken our limits already which means that to reach the target for 2006 we will have to substantially reduce the amount of energy we use.  I am not a scientist but I know there are three elements which contribute to global warming &mdash; the motor car, energy generation and agriculture, which is comparatively small but still significant as regards methane and livestock production.</P>
    <P>It is clearly the case that excessive private motoring will have to be fiscally discouraged. There is no way around this.  The sooner this is done, the less painful it will be.  If it is left until the end of the phase in 2005 to implement some draconian measures to reduce global warming emissions from motoring, it will not work.  It will be too late and people will be unable to change their consumption or life patterns quickly enough.  If the Government makes fiscal changes now, there is some chance they will work. However, by failing to listen to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who kindly told the newspapers what he was saying at Cabinet about this before he said it, the Government is building up a large problem in this area.</P>
    <P>The same applies to electricity generation.  It is not feasible to talk about bringing private sector investment into electricity generation or to think about the idea of selling shares in the ESB until one knows the conditions under which the ESB will have to operate as far as compliance with global warming is concerned.  People are being asked to buy a pig in a poke unless clear decisions are made.</P>
    <P>Instead of the highly relaxed consultative process with reports being produced, which contain no solid plans, and the endless consultations on global warming, the Government needs to take decisions.  It does not matter that the Buenos Aires Summit was a flop because the Americans and Chinese could not agree.  This will happen anyway.  The Americans and Chinese are playing politics.</P>
    <P>The physical reality of climate change will force all of us to take action.  The sooner Ireland acts, the better.  There are historical precedents for my argument.  One country which came out well of the 1973-9 oil shock was Japan.  This was because it took steps before the oil shock to significantly reduce its oil consumption and make its economy less energy intensive.  It sailed through the 1973 deflation almost unscathed, when the rest of the world, notably the United States, gas guzzling as it is, suffered the worst effects.</P>
    <P>The same differentiation will occur as regards global warming.  The countries that are well prepared and have taken planned voluntary steps to reduce consumption will come through well.  That issue represents the biggest threat of deflation to the economy.  If we face it too late, because we have not taken action in time, we will suffer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> I wish to raise the budget vote last night, particularly the vote of Deputy Blaney.  Was there any interference with the Garda in the performance of their duty in a law and order matter in Kerrykeel, County Donegal, to ensure that the Deputy voted for the Government?  The idea that the Garda might stall some operation to facilitate the political needs of the Government to get a Deputy to vote for the budget is deeply corrosive of our democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the House that two days before the presidential election there was a high profile arrest in a supposed leaks inquiry and we did not hear anything substantial about that matter after the election.  It was terribly urgent when the Government needed to hype up this issue for political purposes.  Afterwards it ceased to be of any relevance.  If there is evidence that the Garda has been interfered with in any way in the performance of their duty in regard to an issue in County Donegal to meet the needs of the Government, then we have the politicisation of the Garda Síochána and that is not acceptable.  This Government needs to be prevented from doing this sort of thing.  We need a police authority which stands between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the officers of the law whose job it is to enforce the law.  Before we give lectures in Northern Ireland on policing we should perhaps look in our own house first and see if we are ensuring that the Garda Síochána are afforded the degree of independence of political pressure which any respectable police service ought to have in any democratic country.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the reports I have heard about what was done to facilitate Deputy Blaney. I have no views about the location of this mast or about Deputy Blaney's advocacy of his case or that of his constituency.  Was there any pressure exerted on the Garda Síochána to do or not to do something to meet the political needs of the Government?  If so, does that explain to any degree the strange goings on before the presidential election?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Responding to the budget yesterday, my colleague, Deputy McDowell, described it as the most public declaration of contrition in political history.  One can only imagine the conversation which must have taken place between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in the lead up to the budget.  &ldquo;Bless me, Taoiseach, for I have sinned.  It has been 12 months since my last budget&rdquo;.  &ldquo;What have you done in the meantime, my child&rdquo;.  &ldquo;I have looked after the rich and powerful in our society&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Well, Charlie, we have local and European elections next year and a national agreement to get over so you had best mend your ways&rdquo;.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance donned his sackcloth and ashes and performed <Col N="1568" /> the most spectacular U-turn we have ever witnessed in this House.  In fact, yesterday's Budget Statement was not so much a U-turn as a hand-brake turn on an icy road.</P>
      <P>Any Member of this House would have envied the position of the Minister for Finance yesterday. No previous Minister for Finance was in such a fortunate and powerful position to impact on society for good.  He was, as we have read for several months, literally awash with money.  For the first time in the history of the State there was a real opportunity to make major reforms in our taxation and welfare systems which could begin to bring about true equality of opportunity for everyone.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's budget also provided an opportunity to improve housing, transport, water supply and roads.  Our infrastructure is crumbling under the pressure of a booming economy.  In a real sense we are like a developing country.  Our economy is booming but we simply do not have the modern infrastructure to bear it or to sustain it.  The real opportunity which presented itself yesterday to the Minister for Finance and to the Government to enable this country to sustain high levels of growth was simply missed.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's budget did not grasp the opportunities which had been staring this Government in the face for some time now.  Even a betting man would have assumed that most of these opportunities would have been grasped.  We all know the Minister for Finance is a betting man. The cost of yesterday's windfall for the betting industry is £24 million in a full year.  As Deputy Rabbitte pointed out to the House yesterday, that sum is more than the combined budget day allocation to deal with hospital waiting lists, mental handicap and physical disability.  Altogether they did not amount to the sum of tax relief for the betting industry.  That indicates skewed priorities. I read in one newspaper this morning &mdash; the spin doctors must have been doing well &mdash; that more than £300 million was provided to deal with waiting lists.  That is far from the reality.  The paltry sum allocated yesterday will make no meaningful impact on the 40,000 plus people who are waiting for surgical procedures up and down this country.</P>
      <P>We can also safely and sadly assume that in the coming year the housing lists in every local authority will continue to grow, the traffic congestion will continue to get worse and, most frighteningly and unacceptably of all, the gap between the rich and the poor will continue to widen.  We have real choices to make as our country becomes richer.  The most important of those choices is whether to create a society which is genuinely equal or to have a society where the bulk of our people get on very well and a growing minority are totally excluded and fall further and further behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget was touted by the Minister for Finance as one &ldquo;to benefit those who have not done as well as most of us in recent years&rdquo;.  Regretfully, because of this budget some people will be more excluded and, indeed, some frankly will be worse <Col N="1569" /> off.  In framing this budget a clear decision was taken by the Government to create a section in Irish society which it considers to be the undeserving poor.  The 1999 budget flies in the face of Partnership 2000 by reducing the number of training and employment places for the unemployed. If one was unsure of the logic behind that statement, it was revealed rather well in the comments on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning from the Tánaiste, who basically made it clear that there must be a nice prod for the unemployed to get back into a job.  There is a deliberate tactic to ensure that social welfare recipients would not benefit significantly in this budget lest, in the best Victorian tradition, they become indolent and not take the low paid jobs which are being created in this bountiful economy.</P>
    <P>The increase in the back to work allowance scheme this year stands at £2,000.  That is more than half the increase budgeted for in recent years.  While the Government may argue that the unemployment rate is falling and, consequently, there is a lesser need to invest in training and employment supports, this paring back of the back to work allowance scheme is a major regressive step.  The scheme is one of the most important measures in moving the group of very long-term unemployed back into the workforce &mdash; that core of people to whom it is important to reach out in the rising tide.  In any study of the age by duration live register count, the fall in the very long-term unemployed is largely attributed to the take-up in the back to work allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>The reduction in places on the community employment programme, as provided for in the Book of Estimates, is completely contrary to the commitments in Partnership 2000 to increase the scheme by 10,000 places.  To the third pillar of Partnership 2000, this budget is quite simply a kick in the teeth.</P>
    <P>There are good points in the budget which have been widely recognised in this morning's newspapers. How could it be any other way given the opportunities of historic proportions presented and available to the Minister for Finance yesterday?  The Minister went some significant way towards repairing the damage of his inequitable tax package delivered in last year's budget.  Targeting tax relief at the lowest paid was an essential move in improving the value of work for low earners.  It will also maximise the impact of the national minimum wage.  They are very progressive proposals which the Labour Party has no difficulty acknowledging and supporting.</P>
    <P>However, the reforms in taxation are a little sloppy and anomalies are created through the increase, for example, in the health levy.  In the Labour Party's view, the Minister had the opportunity yesterday, and the Government if it had the vision could have taken the opportunity, to introduce a full blown system of tax credit unashamedly targeted at low paid workers.  That would have provided a real and lasting structural reform in personal taxation.  The Minister said he <Col N="1570" /> went part of the way down that road after his Pauline conversion from moving fast in the other direction in last year's budget.  His reverse and movement towards focusing tax relief at the low paid is acknowledged and welcome.</P>
    <P>The taxation measures in the budget went some way to redress the mistakes of last year, but this budget will have a major impact on our society only if it represents the first of a series of budgets designed to redistribute income and give real opportunity.  The Minister touted yesterday that he would present three more budgets.  Maybe he will, but already it is seen that he is seeking to grasp defeat from the jaws of victory.  He said yesterday that his basic philosophy had not changed and that he still believes in a low tax, low spend economy.  He stated that the tax rate reductions in the programme for Government &mdash; those tax adjustments &mdash; remained his key goal in tax reform.  This is not a repentant Minister who has seen the error of his ways; it is a chastised Minister determined to sin again.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister may, this year at least, have got it nearly right on income tax, he got it wrong on corporation tax.  The concessions in corporation tax were clearly targeted to benefit the major financial institutions and the banks.  In a year in which the public has been badly let down by some of our banks, to reduce the standard rate of corporation tax for those institutions by 4 per cent, while freezing the low rate, is truly incomprehensible.</P>
    <P>The current labour shortage and the resultant demand for the participation of women in the workforce has at last brought the issue of child care to centre stage in our discussions.  In advance of the budget, it was made clear that investment in child care was crucial for maintaining our economic success.  For the first time in aeons, employers, trade unions and voluntary organisations sang from the same hymn sheet as regards child care provision.  However, no matter how loudly these groups sang in harmony, the Government was not listening.</P>
    <P>The only provision to stimulate the supply side of child care were concessions to the private sector to invest in child care facilities.  Are they concessions at all?  Was there any example of benefit in kind being charged for such facilities?  As a former dear colleague of mine used to say, &ldquo;I think the Minister was betting with other people's money on this.&rdquo; There is no commitment on the part of this Government to address this issue.  I put it to the Minister that this measure will not impact on child care provision and will have no impact on implementing the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>I am sure Fianna Fáil backbenchers were livid yesterday when the Minister disclosed this half-hearted provision on child care, if it can be described as a provision at all.  I am sure among those who were less than pleased was the Taoi-seach's constituency colleague, Deputy McGennis, who only a few weeks ago marched <Col N="1571" /> the streets of Dublin in a call for child care provision. Where does she stand today?</P>
    <P>The importance of child benefit in eliminating child poverty can never be overstated.</P>

      <P>In the run-up to this budget, the Combat Poverty Agency, among many others, made a clear-cut and unanswerable case for substantial increases in child benefit as a real anti-poverty measure.  It has been recognised as the most significant single thing a Government can do to give money to families who need it.  It is a policy which the previous Government honoured and delivered on.  The increase in child benefit, while a small step up on last year's disgraceful increase, can be described yet again as only paltry. Clearly, this Government does not understand the case for increased child benefit payments.</P>
      <P>Child benefit is the only payment which is directly administered and delivered to the parent who carries out the household and the child care duties.  Furthermore, child benefit does not create any unemployment or poverty traps.  That is very important at this stage of our economy when we are attempting to genuinely and socially provide an acceptable welfare to work infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Beyond this, the Government cannot stand over the increases delivered to social welfare recipients.  I do not believe the Taoiseach can stand over and defend a £3 increase in the full rate of the basic social welfare payment.  What will it mean in real terms?  It barely covers inflation.  Those dependent on social welfare will genuinely be worse off in 12 months' time.  The failure of the Minister for Finance to link in some way welfare increases with real wage increases is genuinely contributing to the widening of the gap between the rich and poor.  Whatever argument the Tánaiste makes in her Victorian attitude of prodding the indolent into work, a range of categories of people depend on our social welfare system to exist.  They have a right as citizens of this Republic to benefit in the growth and prosperity which is more than evident among certain categories of our citizens.</P>
      <P>The decision to freeze child dependant allowances is a travesty.  If the Government's strategy was to move from these allowances to increased support through substantially increased child benefit, there would be no argument from these benches.  However, the Minister has chosen to freeze child dependant allowances but not to provide the corollary of increased child benefit directly into the hands of mothers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a clear indication from the content of the budget of a lack of strategic thinking and direction in what now must be seen as a once-off budget.  This is the Minister's recognition of the requirement politically to get the new partnership programme agreed and to answer the great criticisms of inequity levelled against last year's <Col N="1572" /> budget.  However, his heart is not in it.  He does not believe in it and we can only expect him to return to his normal form when he next presents a budget.</P>
    <P>Last night I listened to the Government side promoting the merits of the budget.  The £6 increase in the old age pension was put forward by many as its main selling point.  However, people should not be deceived.  The £6 increase will only apply to the main pensioner.  The adult dependant, usually the woman, will get half that amount, a miserable £3 per week.</P>
    <P>The budget did nothing to address the issue of means testing of social welfare payments.  We have long been aware of the fear faced by many older people about the impact of small nest eggs on their social welfare payments.  How many of us are dealing with this problem?  Many old age pensioners put money away for their funeral so that nobody will be left with that burden when they are gone and they are paranoid about the impact that might have on their social welfare entitlements.  Previous Governments introduced saving disregards for people in that situation. However, the Minister chose to ignore that problem.</P>
    <P>This budget could have been an opportunity to address all the inequalities in our social welfare code which we recognised and to end long-standing discrimination, particularly against women. The money was there, uniquely and historically, but the opportunity was missed.</P>
    <P>Our system of tax incentives to the film industry has been a tremendous boost to this sector. We are all aware of the incredible growth in film making in Ireland in recent years and the substantial employment it brings.  This is due to the Herculean efforts of the dynamic former Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael Higgins, who brought the industry here from nothing to being a main player on the world stage.  That system is due to end next April.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to detailed studies and independent consultants.  However, he made no reference to what this Government intends to do post April next.  The Dáil will adjourn in a couple of weeks' time and it will be back at the end of January, which is not too far away.  Given the imminent lapsing of these reliefs, one would have expected the Government to indicate that it will renew or extend the scheme.  Perhaps it proposes to introduce an alternative scheme of supports for the film industry.  Unfortunately, the Minister could not provide any detail of the Government's policy on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is becoming increasingly clear the Government has no idea what it will do.  Any keen observer of the Government will not be surprised by this fact.  The absence of direction and strategic thinking is becoming a hallmark of this Administration.  There seems to be a propensity in the Government to fly kites high and then to ignore them.  Ministers propose things which the people believe will happen, but then they disappear without trace.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> Film making and production is a complex business. There is a huge financial outlay at the beginning of the process and each investor takes a substantial risk in financing it.  In order to commit this finance, film producers and investors need to know clearly in advance the tax regime that pertains. A huge advantage has been given to the film industry in recent years.  Our tax relief system has given confidence to investors and this has paid dividends for the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech yesterday compromised our success.  There is no doubt that a major cloud hangs over the future of the Irish film industry. Producers do not know the future direction of Government policy.  There is an obligation on the Government to move swiftly to retrieve this appalling situation, remove this uncertainty and outline Government policy on an industry which has been genuinely created in recent years under the tutelage of Deputy Michael Higgins.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton spoke about Ireland's commitment to deal with the issue of global warming.  People have moved away from the title &ldquo;global warming&rdquo; because it is more accurately reflected in the title &ldquo;climate change&rdquo;.  There are internationally binding obligations on Ireland to reduce greenhouse gases &mdash; the basket of gases which are impacting on our climate.  The European Union, being the most progressive, has set the standard and Ireland has negotiated a position within the European Union umbrella.</P>
    <P>These are not easy targets for this country, an expanding economy, to achieve.  I brought those targets to Government where we debated them fully and the minutes are there for the Taoiseach see.  The former Department of Transport, Energy and Communications raised its concern about the degree of effort required to change Irish practices in terms of the creation of carbondioxide and other greenhouse gases from cars, lorries, trucks, heavy industry and energy generation. However, we agreed to sign up and that decision is as binding on this Government as it was on the last.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has been involved in many kite flying exercises in the past 12 months, but the one in relation to the introduction of a fundamental policy on greenhouse gases was probably his most spectacular effort.  Nothing has been done to implement the policies that were all but agreed, if we believe the Sunday newspapers, on the proposition of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Time is running out.  The fundamental focus on greenhouse gas reductions will require structural changes in the economy.  Like the millennium problem, the Government seems to park it until it has time to deal with it.  Some £40 million was allocated yesterday to deal with the millennium bug which, months ago, the Taoiseach and his Ministers said was under control.  There is a degree of panic and we have to provide a huge sum of money next year to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the issue of greenhouse gases will <Col N="1574" /> present a huge problem if we do not have a strategy. I have repeatedly asked the Government to outline its policy.  This is not the exclusive responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government; it is the responsibility of the Government as a whole.  The Government should state the structural changes which will bring about the reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions to which we are committed.  Have we carried out an energy audit of every local authority and privatelyowned house?  What infrastructural changes in transport will bring about the required reductions in private vehicle usage?  We have no answers from the Government on this most critical issue. Deputy Bruton has rightly stated that this issue will not be solved by simply signing up in Kyoto, being positive in Buenos Aires and making commitments in the Council of Ministers, so long as no one asks for our money upfront or specifics of what we are doing.  Ultimately, we will be asked and we had better have a sustainable answer.</P>
    <P>There are three specific aspects of the budget that will haunt the Government when the dust settles.  These are the paltry, disgraceful increase in the majority of social welfare payments; the appalling cutback in overseas development aid, which was not mentioned in the Budget Statement; and the fact that this Government has not allocated any significant additional money to deal with the problem of affordable housing faced by huge numbers of people.  This is the biggest problem we face.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made a concrete decision, aided and abetted by his Cabinet colleagues, to bank £1 billion.  He did so in the context of 45,000 people on local authority waiting lists who urgently need the most basic right &mdash; a home, a roof over their heads.  Figures published in the past few weeks indicate that 6,000 people in this prosperous island are homeless and left to seek shelter on our streets.  Surely these are the measures of success, rather than some notional figure for GDP <i>per capita.</i>  How many people are on the streets for want of shelter?</P>
    <P>For the second time, the Minister for Finance announced the allocation published in the Book of Estimates.  Does he seriously believe that, in the face of the worst housing crisis in living memory, the provision of an additional £45 million will solve the problem?  He admitted that it would not do so in his Budget Statement.  With 45,000 people on local authority waiting lists, the Government has provided enough funding to begin an additional 600 houses this year.  This will bring the total figure to 4,500 to deal with a waiting list of 45,000 people.</P>
    <P>If the Government's response in the area of public housing has been pathetic, its response to those in need of purchasing a house on the open market is even worse.  There was no mention of the housing market in the Budget Statement.  Is it not odd that of the lack of affordable housing, one of the most serious social problems, does not merit a mention in the Budget Statement?  It is <Col N="1575" /> clear that the measures introduced by the Government in the wake of the Bacon report have not resolved the problem.  If the Government believes they have then it has lost touch with people.  Thousands of workers, particularly young couples seeking a home for the first time, are priced out of the market.  They have no option but to put pressure on local authorities.  This spiral is continuing.  It is estimated that an additional 2,000 people joined the local authority housing list in the past two months.  The Minister has turned his back on these people and washed his hands of the matter.  What was needed was a creative and imaginative response by the Government. For example, the removal of stamp duty for first time buyers of second-hand homes would have been a start.  The conversion of the first-time buyer's grant into a monthly mortgage subsidy, increased substantially, would have been a valuable initiative.  Either the Government's collective mind is incapable of understanding the extent of the crisis or it is unable to devise workable solutions to this huge challenge.  Either way, ordinary people are paying the price for Government inaction.</P>
    <P>The third point which will be remembered in the long term is the disgraceful decision concerning the Government's obligation on overseas development aid.  The Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid, Deputy O'Donnell, walked to the edge of the plank in full expectation that Deputy Harney, her party leader, and the Minister for Finance would help her back again.  They have not done so and she is stranded at the edge of the plank.  On national radio she gave an indication of what she would do in this situation.  It is time for her to live up to that indication.  She knows that being high on compassion and low on action compounds the insult to thousands of Irish people working in the developing world.</P>
    <P>In this House on 12 November 1998, when concluding the debate on overseas development aid, Deputy O'Donnell stated:</P>
    <P>I hope, in the context of a caring budget, the Government will address the concerns I expressed last week and again today in this regard.  Times are good in Ireland and it is imperative that we share our bounty with those people whose poverty has no parallel here.</P>
    <P>There was no mention of overseas development aid &mdash; good, bad or indifferent &mdash; in the Budget Statement.  Where now stands Deputy O'Donnell in her hope for a caring budget?  The extent of this year's cutback is astonishing and represents a real reduction in provision.  As Deputy McDowell stated, this is particularly repugnant given that Ireland remains a net recipient of external aid.  Genuinely, if words mean anything, Deputy O'Donnell has no option but to resign forthwith.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's budget was an aberration.  For low <Col N="1576" /> and middle income earners it is a welcome one. However, it is a budget which this Minister was clearly reluctant to introduce and into which he insisted on inserting a paragraph setting out his own political beliefs and priorities.  The stamp of the Minister's personal philosophy was evident nowhere else in the statement.  The budget is a slap down for the Minister for Finance.  It was forced on him by his colleagues because they know the political realities and what needs to be done. When he introduced his budget last year the Minister correctly pointed out that the public were getting what they voted for.  He was right. Today's U-turn has been forced upon him and the Government political necessity and the realisation that the public now know that a disgraceful sleight of hand was engaged in at the last general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated last night, this is the most socially progressive budget of recent years. While underpinning economic growth and social partnership our overriding objective is to give a boost to people on low incomes, to encourage those who want to take up a job and to assist those who have retired.  The sweeping tax reforms introduced in this budget allow us to target help at those who most need it.  We are doing not only what our economy requires but what our society requires at this time.  The jobs crisis today consists of the fact that we have thousands of job vacancies that need filling.  This budget is about ensuring that we have people to fill them.  The live register which has already fallen dramatically by 32,000 over the last 12 months will be further slashed, so that in 1999 it could plunge below 200,000 for the first time since 1983.</P>
      <P>Our economic success since the major turning point in 1987 has been based in large part on social partnership.  We have more than fulfilled our obligations on taxation under Partnership 2000.  We were committed to introducing personal tax reductions to the cumulative value over three years of £900 million on a full cost basis.  I calculate that the cumulative concessions amount to about £1.5 billion, or about 60 per cent above target, of which well over £1 billion will have been given back under the present Government.  As a result, the net income increase of up to 14 per cent for all those on average earnings envisaged under Partnership 2000 will turn out to be around 18 per cent to 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, we are taking 80,000 people out of the tax net, which is dramatic.  This is far beyond the 15,000 removed last year, and the 10,000 removed in Deputy Quinn's last budget.  It has long been recognised that the gap between the tax-free allowance and the tax exemption limit represents a major poverty trap.  This gap is being substantially reduced.  Exemption limits will now be relevant mainly for the over 65s.  The personal allowance, standard rated so that the benefit <Col N="1577" /> goes equally to all, is being increased by over £1,000, or over £2,000 for married couples, with an additional £200 added to the PAYE allowance. This means that for a single employee the first £100 earned will be tax free, compared to £79 at present.  It will also be PRSI free per full-rate contributions, as the threshold for both tax and PRSI is now the same.  While until now it has been the case that going off the dole meant pretty much going straight into the tax net, that will no longer be the position.  There is a clear gap between tax-free earnings and what can be received on the dole.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the vast majority of the unemployed are anxious to work.  I have always held that view.  Everyone who is able-bodied and mobile should be able to get a job.  They need access to education and training, and encouragement and support to get back into work.  This budget radically alters the morale-sapping disincentives to work.  There is no real excuse any more for young people to stay at home.  The days of the dependency culture are over.</P>
    <P>Last year, we concentrated on reducing tax rates.  This year, in terms of our programme, we are concentrating on giving people an incentive to take up work, as stated in the first sentence of An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Howlin has a difficult task this morning.  I listened to every word he said and I realise that our system of parliamentary democracy demands that an Opposition Member must come to the House and to the job he is doing.  I admire his effort.  However, a large part of what the Deputy has said is inaccurate.  He appears not even to have read the first line of An Action Programme for the Millennium.  I would forgive him for not reading all of it but I would have expected him at least to read the first line.  It refers to &ldquo;giving people an incentive to take up work&rdquo;.  That is what was done yesterday.  To say that the budget is not in line with the programme the Tánaiste and I agreed 18 months ago is incorrect.  The substantial increase in the personal allowance achieves this.</P>
    <P>After this budget, about 27 per cent of all people subject to income tax will have no tax to pay and only 32 per cent will pay tax at the top rate.  Parties opposite will no doubt want to claim, for want of anything to criticise, that this represents their policy.  I have heard this said in the past few days.  It certainly did not represent their policy in general, when there was an increase in personal allowances for a single person of only £150 a year in 1995 and 1996, and £250 in 1997, a figure that we matched incidentally in the last budget.  That tax-free allowance has now been quadrupled.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have gone far beyond anything that they had envisaged.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton did attempt to <Col N="1578" /> introduce a tax credit system in the 1982 budget which fell, but it did not feature in Fine Gael's more recent policies.  We have eliminated the employment and training levy introduced by Fine Gael in the early 1980s but we have increased the health levy, giving a net reduction of 0.25 per cent.</P>
      <P>The only party that wanted to put anything into the tax-free allowances at the last election was Democratic Left but it was in the context of limited tax relief overall.  The total relief figure of £1,500 million over five years was the rainbow target at that time.  I would point out that in just two budgets, and with three more to go, we have provided just under £1.1 billion in full year personal relief or over two-thirds of what the rainbow parties were prepared to contemplate over a five year period.  They showed by their record in Government that they did not regard reducing taxation as an important priority, except at election time.  They wanted to do only what was strictly required by social partnership.  Under this Govemment, real tax relief is not confined to election budgets once every five years.  The tax system is a vital aspect of competitiveness and jobs.  Lightening the tax burden makes it easier to create and fill jobs and to keep down inflation.  It is the only way to sustain social partnership and full employment is the best means of tackling social exclusion, even if it is not the full answer.</P>
      <P>For far too long the burden of funding public services fell on too few shoulders.  In 1986, we had 1,080,000 at work, of whom between one quarter and one fifth would not have been in the tax net. Today, close to 1.5 million people are at work, which makes it possible to spread the load and reduce it.</P>
      <P>After today's budget, the personal allowance together with the PAYE allowance will compare well with basic allowances in Britain, but at higher levels of income there is still a substantial gap in tax levels, especially for single people.  The width of the tax band and the rates are matters that we will have to return to in future budgets, particularly if we are to attract the skilled people we need into the workforce and to keep them here, given international mobility.</P>
      <P>This is a reforming budget.  I am glad it is being seen as such.  We have been focused in our approach.  We have moved to introduce a tax credit system, which is a major reform that has long been recommended in many important analyses of the tax system.  The tax credit system allows for better targeting and transparency of tax changes. That is the main justification for its introduction and our detailed analysis over a number of years has shown clearly that this system can target directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In years to come when Ministers for Finance have less money to spend, it will be possible to target that small amount of money directly into a particular area.  That will be a great benefit.  The benefit of the tax credit system will be more obvious in years when the Minister for Finance has very little to spend than in years of plenty <Col N="1579" /> such as this and, I hope, the years to come.  Previous Ministers for Finance were forced to spread Government spending too thinly and with very little effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This reform will change that this year and in the future.  That is the main justification.  Previously, when all funds were directed at raising personal allowances, the lion's share of the benefit went to those on higher incomes.  This forced Ministers for Finance who wanted to help those on low incomes to raise exemption limits.  However, that created poverty traps.  I have argued for many years about exemption limits.  They are misunderstood in this House because people think they solve the problems of low paid people whereas they do not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely, and the problem is then three times harder.  We have taken a strategic step to create a fairer and more socially progressive tax system.  We have moved beyond debating the theories of social inclusion to implementing radical reform.</P>
      <P>Higher earners did well in last year's budget. This year the benefits are more evenly spread.  A married couple on one income with four children taxed under PAYE at £40,000 a year will be £800 better off in tax terms compared to just over £900 last year, and this is approximately the same as in Deputy Quinn's last budget.  The net reduction in levies of 0.25 per cent will be of benefit across their entire income.  Taking the two budgets together, the higher earner has nothing to complain about and can look forward to future budgets under this Government which will ease a burden heavier than in most other countries.</P>
      <P>There is no significant clawback as far as indirect taxation is concerned, apart from 5p on a packet of cigarettes, which is the minimum which can be justified from a health point of view. There is no increase in excise on beer, spirits or petrol.</P>

      <P>Since 1987, in all the budgets in which Fianna Fáil has been involved, there have only been rare increases in the so-called old reliables.  This has helped keep inflation down and ensure that what is given with one hand is not taken back with the other.</P>
      <P>In the context of both EMU and social partnership, we are anxious to reduce inflation to 2 per cent in 1999 so that neither jobs nor living standards are put at risk.  Under EMU, higher inflation means now more than ever a loss of competitiveness and jobs, so it must be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are ready to use the tax system to promote environmentally friendly developments.  We are <Col N="1580" /> consciously increasing tax on less fuel efficient vehicles.  To promote public transport, we are encouraging the provision of park and ride facilities by a capital allowance scheme and freeing the provision of monthly travel passes from benefit-in-kind taxation.</P>
    <P>To relieve pressure on the housing rental market, and in response to representations from third level institutions, section 23 relief is being extended to cover the provision of student accommodation, an area highlighted this summer as likely to experience great difficulties with the enormous number of people seeking residential accommodation.  This is now the chance for all the developers who told the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, his Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and me at many meetings that, because the Bacon report forced them out of this area, they believed there was a capacity for huge investment.  We await their proposals.</P>
    <P>This is the largest social welfare and social inclusion package ever introduced.  For purposes of comparison, Deputy Quinn's social welfare package amounted to about £114 million in 1997. This year it came to £125 million.  Next year it will cost £155 million, also in the calendar year.  The full year cost of the budget's social welfare and social inclusion measures is £378 million.  I calculate that almost £1 billion has been spent on social inclusion measures or nearly double what was promised in Partnership 2000.  Not only has there been no slackening of the pace since the change of Government, the pace has accelerated. Providing effective help to the less well off has everything to do with good management of the economy and nothing to do with ideological labels.</P>
    <P>Excluding the old, the general social welfare increases are at the top end compared with the rainbow Government's budgets.  I listened carefully to Deputy Howlin's almost savage attack on the Government about the scandalous rates.  I remind him of what he was involved in not so long ago.</P>

The long-term unemployed in this budget receive an increase of 5.25 per cent or £3.60 per week to bring remaining payments up to the indexed minimum recorded by the Commission on Social Welfare and as promised in Partnership 2000. Others receive a £3 a week or 4 per cent increase, double the expected rate of inflation.</P>

      <P>While I know it is depressing, I remind Deputy Howlin that the increases under <Col N="1581" /> the rainbow Government were £1.50 in 1995 and £2 in 1996 and 1997, which is a total of £6.50 in the three years when economic growth was 6 to 7 per cent.  The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has given increases of £3 in 1998 and in 1999.  In two budgets he is only 50p short of what the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, gave in three budgets. When Deputy Howlin uses the word &ldquo;outrageous&rdquo;, he is obviously not criticising the Minister, Deputy Ahern.  If he is, he must feel Deputy Quinn's increases of £1.50 and £2.00 were absolutely outrageous.  I am glad he indirectly compliments the Minister, Deputy Ahern's, 5.25 per cent increase.</P>
      <P>The main focus of our entire budget package is the older citizen and the family.  The contributory old age pension is increased by £6 a week to £89 or by £9 for a couple, so we are on target to reach our goal of a pension of £100 pension a week for a single person in the lifetime of the Government. It represents a 7.25 per cent increase on top of the 6.4 per cent or £5 increase last year.  The total is now very close to 14 per cent.  In addition, we have given the largest increase in tax exemption this year.  By comparison, the exemption increases given in the rainbow Government's budgets for the 65-74 age group were £200 in 1995 and 1996, and a very generous £100 in 1997.  We raised it by £400 to £5,000 in 1998, almost as much as the three previous budgets.  For 1999 we have raised it by another £1,500 to £6,500 or £13,000.  This tax exemption level is now significantly above the UK age allowance level, especially for a married couple.</P>
      <P>Improvement and liberalisation in the carer's allowance and tax encouragement for the provision of convalescent homes are also for the benefit of old people.  We are also allowing those not in pension fund schemes to put more aside for their old age by greatly increasing the allowable size of tax-free contributions, particularly over the age of 50 when there are less likely to be a lot of children in the family and when people are beginning to worry about providing for their old age.</P>
      <P>The family and children are central concerns of this Government.  We have continued to raise child benefit weighted towards the larger family. We have improved the family income supplement. We are also encouraging employers to provide child care facilities by capital allowances and also by disregarding their use as benefit-in-kind. I recognise that this is only a limited response to the demand for help with the cost of child care.  We will study the report of the interdepartmental group when it is completed in February and it will form part of further deliberations on the subject.  It is a subject to which we will have to return and I look forward to doing so when we have the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also provided substantial further support for people suffering from disabilities with improved provision for carers, extra places and improved facilities to help those with learning disabilities <Col N="1582" /> and further help for the physically handicapped. There will be an 11 per cent increase in gross current health spending to target priorities, including waiting lists and services for older people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to target poor Deputy Howlin but I remind him that he was Minister for Health in 1994 when £10 million was spent on waiting lists.</P>

      <P>He was doing a good job, but he was spending half the amount of money the present Minister is spending on the waiting list initiative.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that education and science are in many ways the key to our future. The education capital programme for 1998 and 1999 is running at at least double the annual average of the years 1995 and 1997, and will amount to £239 million next year.  The increase in the current education budget at 9 per cent will be at least four times the rate of inflation with a heavy concentration on people with learning difficulties. Since we came to office, we have improved funding to scientific research and innovation, tapping sources of private funding with matching State aid.  We have provided tax relief in the budget for personal and corporate donations to our scientific and technological education investment fund as well as on a smaller scale to libraries.</P>
      <P>I question Deputy Bruton's claim that his priority is primary education.  The provision for first level education under the rainbow coalition Government increased by 4 per cent each year when he was Taoiseach.  It increased by 7 per cent in the two years that I have been Taoiseach.  The capital programme has increased from £34 million in 1997 to £55 million in 1999.  A comparison of those figures does not augur well for the priority Deputy Bruton attached to primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" /> Many non-commercial farmers have been having a very rough year.  We provided an income floor through the farm assist programme and also improved access to pensions.  We restored the farm installation aid scheme and the control of farm pollution scheme.  Farmers will also benefit from lower interest rates and tax reductions in the budget.</P>
    <P>Every budget has to have a lighter element.</P>
    <P>This year it is a budget for the punter.  Horseracing is a national sport enjoyed by all sectors of the population.  Keeping the bets in Ireland is another way of keeping the racecourses open.  I look forward to my next flutter at even keener odds and to there being a much higher tax take from this.  Anyone who knows about the industry will know that all the bigger bets have been going out of the country for many years.  This provision will ensure that our industry will expand and develop&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister and I have been instrumental in providing £300,000 to secure the family home of Pádraig Pearse, which is quite near Leinster House.  We are happy to give £300,000 to the Irish School of Ecumenics in recognition of its continuing contribution.  I thank it for its good work.</P>
      <P>Our ambition is to make Ireland one of the best countries in which to do business.  Small businesses will be pleased at the increase in the lower 25 per cent corporation tax threshold to £100,000 in fulfilment of our election manifesto pledge.  We are continuing the reduction of the standard rate of corporation tax by 4 per cent and mapping out the route whereby we will reach the standard rate of 12.5 per cent by the year 2003 in line with an agreement with the Commission last July.  Our corporate tax regime going back nearly 40 years was designed to offset our peripherality, while countries in the centre of Europe boomed.  Every important move since then has been negotiated with Brussels.  The question of unfair competition does not arise.  It seems some of our European partners are afraid not of unfair competition but simply of competition.  We account for a mere 1 per cent of inward investment in the EU, the vast majority of which comes from outside the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are isolated instances where firms relocate or rationalise from one part of the EU to another, and that has happened occasionally to our cost and to our benefit.  In general terms, manufacturing industries are not relocating from <Col N="1584" /> Germany to Ireland.  There is competition in the financial services area and some years ago we made special tax arrangements to meet certain German concerns.</P>
    <P>My understanding of a single market is that it is an arena in which companies and countries compete.  It is not a closed cartel, which protects inefficiency or high costs.  The high tax high spending route will do nothing for Ireland and we will not go back down that road.  We live in a global economy and Europe has to compete and work in partnership with low tax economies in the rest of the developed world and, notably, in North America.</P>
    <P>For the first time ever a Government is able to budget for a large surplus.  In 1998, the outturn is estimated to be £668 million and there is a surplus of £925 million budgeted for next year.  The general Government surplus is in each instance somewhat higher, but a constant 1.7 per cent of GDP.  We are observing the rules of the European Stability Pact.</P>
    <P>I note a sharp contradiction in the critique coming from left to right.  The Fine Gael Party seems to regard the budget as too expansionary, with dangers for inflation, although I note that this morning Deputy Bruton moved away from what Deputy Noonan said yesterday.</P>

I cannot quote what Deputy Noonan said yesterday, but he gave the impression that he was against this expansionary budget.  Deputy Bruton clarified that this morning, he has clarified it again now and there the matter rests.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand the mania for continuing to pay precious taxpayer's money to bankers, foreign and domestic, in perpetuity.  Why are Labour and Democratic Left so determined to be the international bankers' friend?  Why should we go on forever paying more than £2 billion a year to the bankers, when we could be spending it on improved services, providing a hedge against a downturn and lowering taxes on the PAYE sector?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If we spend the surplus we will <Col N="1585" /> go on forever paying such money.  This year, the figure is £2.74 billion.  We are spending 30 per cent &mdash; the increase in the capital programme. We are spending £2.5 billion on a capital programme. Others think we are mad to do that.  We do that because there is an infrastructural deficit. What the Deputy's party wants us to do is to spend 60 per cent of the surplus which would mean we would continue to have a huge interest burden when our children grow up.  That does not make sense.  It is a stupid policy which we need to move away from.</P>
      <P>The steady improvement in the national finances since 1987, about which some Opposition parties were not happy, has been one of the foundations of our present prosperity.  Our general Government debt-GDP ratio has more than halved since the late 1980s and it now stands at an estimated 59 per cent of GDP, just under the Maastricht criteria.  It is due to fall to 52 per cent in 1999 and by another ten points by the year 2001, if we consistently follow the Government's policies.  It is no accident that the wealthiest country in the EU is Luxembourg, a small country with virtually no public debt.</P>
      <P>We have increased spending for next year to the absolute limit of what is prudent.  The main concentration is on public investment, which will now rise by more than 30 per cent and its job is to tackle the bottlenecks in housing, transport and all the other needs of what is now a rapidly growing population, of which the most recent CSO estimate is 3.7 million.  It is legitimate to switch expenditure from unproductive debt servicing to current services, and that is what we have done within an overall average 4 per cent limit.  If we were not reducing our debt services expenditure at the same time, it would not be prudent to increase day to day expenditure by an average of 7.7 per cent over the next two years.</P>
      <P>All of us when we pause to reflect, are somewhat bemused by the rapid growth of the Irish economy in ways that seem to defy the laws of economics.  We could be scared by the opportunities, but the Government is determined to rise to the challenge.  The basic formula adopted since 1987 remains the right one and we will stick to it and try to make the best use of the fruits of growth for the benefit of all.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach and a former Minister for Finance, I am very proud of this year's budget.  I am very proud of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.  Some of the most deprived people live in my constituency, and I know it will help most of them, but it is also what the country needs at this time.  There will be a renewed sense of fairness.  There are priorities in our programme for Government that we have not yet been able to implement.  We have three more budgets in which to do that and we will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget will keep the economic success story going.  It honours Partnership 2000 commitments and provides a sound basis for the continuation and deepening of social partnership into the next millennium.  We promised lower taxes to <Col N="1586" /> individuals and businesses as well as a new deal for the old.  We are delivering the best set of economic conditions and the most prolonged ones that the Irish people have ever experienced.  I am proud, along with the Tánaiste, to be part of a Government that has introduced one of the best budgets ever in this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said repeatedly in the run up to the budget and in the debate that has taken place so far, but it deserves to be said again, that no Minister for Finance in the history of the State has been in the lucky position of preparing a budget in such favourable economic and fiscal circumstances as those which the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has been able to enjoy over recent months.  It is probably not an exaggeration to say that few Ministers for Finance anywhere in the developed world have had such a favourable background in which to prepare a budget, or have enjoyed such a range of positive options as those open to Deputy McCreevy.</P>
      <P>Never before has a Minister had such resources at his disposal.  Never before has a Minister had so many easy decisions to make.  It is against this unique background that this budget must be judged.  Comparisons with a budget three years ago, or even 12 months ago are irrelevant.  The economic picture has changed beyond recognition and it is understandable, therefore, that people's expectations have changed also.</P>
      <P>I will start by giving credit where credit is due. The changes in the tax system announced by the Minister are probably the most significant to have been made since the introduction of the PAYE system.  It is not so much the extra money in people's pockets this year &mdash; an extra £6 or £10 will not make anyone rich &mdash; but if they are built on in the years to come, these changes will provide the basis for a much fairer and more equitable system of taxation.</P>
      <P>The question that must be asked, however, is why were these changes not made a year ago?  Why did Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats insist on flying in the face of the national consensus that existed last year &mdash; that the correct way to proceed was to increase allowances and widen the bands &mdash; and concentrate instead on reducing rates in such a lop-sided way that the benefits went disproportionately to high earners?  Whatever way the Minister tries to depict it, this is one of the most dramatic U-turns in the history of Irish politics but, let it be said, a U-turn that is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is entitled to credit for the tax changes, he deserves contempt for the way in which he has turned his back on the poorest and most disadvantaged in our society.  The poor have never been high on the Minister's list of priorities. His brief period as Minister for Social Welfare is still recalled with dread by the most disadvantaged. The contemptuous way in which the Minister dismisses those who work to highlight the plight of the poor, often for very little financial reward and in circumstances of great difficulty, as <Col N="1587" />&ldquo;the poverty industry&rdquo;, serves only to highlight his own arrogance and indifference to those most in need.</P>
    <P>With the resources at his disposal the Minister had the opportunity, never open to anyone in that position before, to declare war on want.  He had an opportunity to make a real difference to those who have to subsist on minimal incomes and to take on the deprivation in many urban blackspots.</P>
    <P>The Minister's political and economic conservatism is highlighted by his decision to allow for a current budget surplus in excess of £2.3 billion next year.  He has basically decided to tuck £2.3 billion into the national mattress when housing, health, education and child care are crying out for additional resources.  On every occasion over recent years the budget outturn has been better than expected, so it is quite likely that the surplus will actually be greater than £2.3 billion.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone will be impressed by the Minister's folksy parable, with which he ended his speech yesterday, about putting money away for a rainy day.  Every family knows that if the roof is leaking, if a child needs new shoes, if the baby needs medical treatment, they will spend the money on those priorities and will not put it away for a rainy day.</P>
    <P>While there are a number of improvements in social welfare that are welcome and while certainly nobody will begrudge the elderly their few extra bob, the general increase of £3 per week is pathetic, given the resources available.  Claims of the biggest social welfare package have to be viewed against the reality of the greatest ever resources available to a Minister for Finance.  It is not only the unemployed who have been limited to £3 per week, as many journalists and commentators seem to think.  Other than old age pensioners, more than 600,000 people are dependent on social welfare who are limited to the £3 increase, including the bulk of the 212,000 unemployed, 120,000 widows, 130,000 disabled and 74,000 lone parents.  Not for the first time the message to the poor from this Minister is: &ldquo;You are on your own&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The changes in the tax system are genuinely radical, but there has been no similarly radical approach to those who are marginalised.  Given that most of those at work will benefit from tax changes to a far greater extent than £3, those on social welfare will generally fall behind and the gap between wage earners and non-wage earners will be widened even further.</P>
    <P>In many cases much of the £3 increase will be clawed back in other ways.  For instance, I received a telephone call this morning from a woman in a low paid job, whose husband is on disability benefit because of a serious heart problem. She is low paid, but is still over the limit for eligibility for a medical card for her husband.  She makes the point that her husband will get £12 extra per month through the increase in disability benefit, but that he will have to pay an extra £10 <Col N="1588" /> per month for medication as a result of the changes announced by the Minister for Health in the drugs refund scheme &mdash; a net gain of £2 per month for that family.  What sort of justice is that?  What kind of equity is that?</P>
    <P>There are some who have done well, some who apparently have an inside track to the Minister's office.  I read somewhere that the only delegations the Minister received prior to the budget were from the bloodstock industry and the Irish Bookmakers' Association.  The bookies certainly have had considerable success in their lobbying, winning tax concessions amounting to £24 million in a full year.  I suspect they were pushing an open door, in that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, long before he was a Minister, was quite happy to go on RTE to discuss how he evaded betting taxes.  Regardless of whatever problem there was about telephone betting to the Isle of Man, those who will benefit from these tax changes include some of the wealthiest people in the country; people who, no doubt, benefited from the Minister's largess last year in cutting capital gains tax in half.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer will hand back to the bookies £24 million in a full year &mdash; more than the extra money allocated to reduce hospital waiting lists, more than the extra money allocated for carers, more than the allocation for the needs of those with mental or physical handicaps and more than the cost of additional initiatives for educational disadvantage.  People at the bottom of the ladder, who have been told time after time that they must wait until economic conditions are better for their situations to improve, were entitled to expect their needs would move to the top of the political agenda.  They have been largely ignored in this budget.</P>
    <P>I am in politics to try and bring about a fairer, more equal and more democratic society.  A prerequisite for this is a more equal distribution of wealth.  For as long as I can recall, we have been told by conservative politicians and economists that this could not be done, that we were a poor country with an underdeveloped economy, that we did not have the wealth or resources and that any attempts at redistribution would cripple the economy and create economic chaos.  None of these excuses now apply.  We have a booming economy with growth rates that are the envy of much of the developed world.  We have a level of <i>per capita</i> income that is approaching the EU average.  We have an overall tax burden that is low by EU standards.</P>
    <P>We have a boom, but what is beyond dispute is that the benefits of the boom are not being shared out equally.  Companies are making huge profits.  The £500 million profits reported by the Bank of Ireland for the first six months of the year were only exceptional in their size.  Multi-national companies are repatriating profits on a scale never experienced before.  Land speculators and builders are making vast sums at the expense of those who need housing.  The halving of capital <Col N="1589" /> gains tax in last year's budget brought even greater fortunes to profiteers.</P>
    <P>The picture for the rest, however, is very different. The vast majority of people are, at best, treading water and, despite the welcome changes made in the tax system, will continue to struggle to survive.  Even worse, a substantial minority &mdash; concentrated by and large in about a dozen urban black spots &mdash; is falling further and further behind.  The recent United Nations Development Report for 1998, which showed that Ireland had some of the highest levels of poverty in the industrialised world, should bring a dose of realism to all the hype about the Celtic tiger.  The statistics in the report showing that Irish women are worse off economically and that we have the highest level of functional illiteracy amongst the industrialised states surveyed, are particularly alarming.</P>
    <P>The report confirmed what I indicated earlier &mdash; that substantial sections of the population are not benefiting from the unprecedented economic growth and amid a sea of plenty, there are islands of deprivation that are in danger of being totally swamped.  The real period of economic recovery started during the term of office of the Rainbow Government.  As Minister for Social Welfare in that Government, I was very conscious that, despite the hugely improved economic situation, there was a real danger that many of the poor would be left behind.</P>
    <P>One of the achievements of my time in office of which I am proudest, was the establishment of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.  This was an initiative designed to place the needs of the poor and the socially excluded at the top of the national agenda in terms of Government policy development and action.  One of the key objectives was to ensure that the battle against poverty would be a priority, not just of the Department of Social Welfare, but across all key Government departments.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, apart from adopting the rhetoric of social inclusion there is not a strategic approach evident from this Government that indicates a seriousness about tackling poverty, and there has been a complete failure to work towards the targets set out in the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>
    <P>Another issue which has raised serious questions about this Government's commitment to fighting poverty, and which must be considered in tandem with this week's budget, is the disastrous way in which it has handled the preparations for the next round of EU Structural Funds.  The decision by the Government to draw an artificial line through the heart of the country and to create two totally artificial regions, was a cynical move that has more to do with the perceived political needs of the Government than the economic requirements of the country as a whole.  The Government has spurned an opportunity to ensure that the benefits of economic growth will, in future, be spread more evenly throughout every community in every corner of the country and effectively turned its back on <Col N="1590" /> some of our poorest and most deprived communities and abandoned the 70 per cent of the unemployed who live outside the area singled out for preferential treatment.  The Government has made a nonsense of its own claims to have a coherent policy on regionalisation by creating, purely for party-political expediency, a totally artificial region that leaps over the Shannon estuary and bypasses impoverished communities in the City of Limerick.  There is every chance that the EU will recognise this proposal for the political &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; it is and reject it, thus damaging the standing of Ireland in the Community.  The Government has persisted with this strategy despite the explicit warning from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies that there is no guarantee that dividing the country in two will deliver a single extra ecu or that securing Objective One Status will result in any preferential treatment for this area in the period after 2006.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the various figures on which the Government has been making a case to the EU for preferential treatment for some parts of the country are virtually meaningless.  I urge the Taoiseach to use the opportunity presented by the December summit to urge other EU leaders to agree to a more rational and logical measure of need.  In the meantime, the Government should withdraw the damaging proposal to divide the country into two so-called rich and poor regions.</P>
    <P>The variety of figures floating around simply confirm that it is not possible to measure wealth or need in this way, especially in the context of the unique characteristics of the Irish economy. Just take the county by county figures produced by the CSO a week ago.  Does anyone seriously believe that Tipperary South Riding produces almost twice as much wealth at Tipperary North Riding, as these figures suggest?</P>
    <P>It defies logic that a case should be made to Brussels for preferential treatment for certain areas on the basis of figures that include the profits of multi-national companies, which are almost always repatriated out of the region, but excludes many farm grants, such as headage payments, which are almost certainly spent within the area. It would make as much sense to base a case to the EU for additional resources on the number of garden gnomes or colour televisions in a region.</P>
    <P>What is now very clear is that the Government has made a mess of this whole process.  The Government, on the basis of very doubtful figures, has decided to divide the country into two artificial economic regions.  This is a false and damaging basis on which to construct a national plan for the next six years.  We must plan on the basis of real income and disadvantage and not on the clearly discredited GVA basis being used by the EU.</P>
    <P>Even at this stage, I appeal to the Government to go back to the drawing board.  There are many more satisfactory ways to measure wealth than those being used in the current debate, such as the Household Budget Survey, which reflects much more accurately the wealth of people in the <Col N="1591" /> various areas.  These should be the figures on which national policy in regard to the next round of EU Structural Funds should be based.</P>
    <P>This debate has been depicted as a case of the west versus Dublin or a new urban-rural conflict. It is not.  It is about recognising that disadvantage is a country-wide problem and that it is just as severe in Ballymun as in Belmullet.  If we are serious about ending disadvantage, economic help to improve living standards and enhance employability must be aimed at clusters of people and not areas of land or parts of maps.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the problems of rural poverty, and that a number of farmers are experiencing very real problems.  Attempts have been made, especially by Fianna Fáil, to demonise me with regard to the farming community, because I have questioned the level of tax paid by many farmers and have queried the consistently dismal picture of farm incomes being painted by some of the leaders of the farming organisations.  I am a farm labourer's son.  Later in my life my father started a family business as a potato merchant, and I ran the business for a number of years, so I know quite a good deal about farmers and the farming sector at first hand, good and bad.  As Minister for Social Welfare I took many farm family-friendly initiatives, such as easing the means test for non-contributory pensions, introducing easier and better conditions for seasonal workers, and enabling income for the rural environment protection scheme to be disregarded in assessing entitlement to smallholders allowances.</P>
    <P>I also introduced the security for the elderly scheme which provided grants for voluntary organisations throughout the country to improve security in the homes of vulnerable elderly people.  Tens of thousands of people have benefited from the scheme, mostly in rural areas, many of them farmers or retired farmers.</P>
    <P>I am proud of my record, but that does not mean I will not ask the awkward questions that need to be asked, and the questions that continue to puzzle many PAYE workers.  During the big farmer demonstration in Dublin, the IFA President, Mr. Tom Parlon, asked for &ldquo;the understanding of the wider community for the crisis facing farmers&rdquo;.  It was understandable if this met with no more than a conditional response from PAYE workers, given the failure of the farming organisations to paint a full picture of the growth in farm incomes over the past decade or to acknowledge the inexplicably small tax contribution the farming community continues to make to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>If the wider public are sceptical about the current difficulties, it is because they have heard Mr. Parlon's predecessors year after year forecast doom after every wet day and disaster with every temporary fall in the price of cattle.  Agriculture is, of its nature, cyclical, but a look at the figures produced by independent bodies like the CSO and Teagasc suggest that farmers have done very well over the last decade and that the rate of <Col N="1592" /> growth in farm incomes has been well ahead of the increase in the average industrial wage. Alongside this growth in income is the inexplicable gap between the tax paid by farmers and PAYE workers.  In 1987 the average PAYE worker paid £2,904 more in tax than the average farmer.  By 1997 the gap had grown to £3,552.</P>
    <P>These statistics will be of little comfort to farmers, especially those with small holdings, who are now facing genuine difficulties.  However, these difficulties will not be overcome by raiding the coffers of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs under the guise of extending family income supplement to farmers and the self-employed.  I am glad the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has declined to go down this road.</P>
    <P>Given the undoubted evidence that is there that some farmers are facing acute difficulties, I find it surprising that farmers in need have not been applying for the various social welfare supports that are already there for them and for everyone else in need.  For instance, under existing arrangements, self-employed people, including smallholders, whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  The Minister, Deputy Ahern, told me last week, in reply to a question, that a number of initiatives are being introduced to increase access to the scheme by low-income farmers.  However, he added that there had been no upsurge in new claims or in requests for re-assessment in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>I had also asked the Minister the number of farmers who had applied for and received supplementary welfare allowance and special needs payments since 1 August &mdash; payments which are available to farmers on the same basis as to everyone else.  He told me that just 12 farmers &mdash; 40,000 marched in Dublin &mdash; had applied for and received supplementary allowance and special needs payments since 1 August at a cost of £1,586.  These figures appear to suggest that either the income crisis is not as severe as we have been led to believe or farmers in need have not been made aware of the supports that are available.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance yesterday announced provision for a revamp of the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme at a full year cost of £15 million.  However, no details of this proposal have been given so far.  Perhaps the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will elaborate.  I acknowledge the problems facing a number of farmers and appreciate the need for assistance for those most in need. However, are we to understand from the Minister for Finance's announcement that there is to be a two tier form of unemployment assistance, with easier access to this form of benefit for farmers than applies to non-farmers?  If that is so, it would be a disgracefully discriminatory and retrograde step.</P>
    <P>As the numbers on the live register decrease and the numbers at work increase, housing now <Col N="1593" /> threatens to overtake unemployment as the country's main social problem.  The housing crisis is now so severe that it is affecting all types of people for whom housing would never have been a problem previously.  The local authority housing lists have reached levels never before experienced and the failure of the Government to provide sufficient extra resources for housing in 1999 inevitably means they will be longer in 12 months' time.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether the additional money allocated to the Department of the Environment and Local Government is sufficient for 200 houses, as has been claimed by a prominent economist, or 600 houses, as the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy claims, what is beyond dispute is that it will have no more than a marginal impact on the numbers on local authority lists.  They now total almost 46,000.  Nothing in the budget or the Estimates adequately reflects the seriousness of the housing problem facing the country.  With the escalating price of housing &mdash; up 23 per cent in the first nine months of this year &mdash; and the failure of the Government to do anything to control prices, more and more people are being driven out of the private market and onto local authority housing lists.</P>
    <P>Local authorities cannot meet the current demand with the resources available to them and more families have to spend even longer periods in inadequate private housing, often in cramped and insanitary conditions.  With unprecedented resources at the disposal of the Government, it had been hoped that 1999 would see a serious assault on the housing crisis.  Even at this late stage I appeal to the Government to recognise the real hardship involved and to considerably increase the allocation for housing for 1999.  The quality of life for thousands of young families will be diminished if it does not do so.</P>
    <P>The failure, despite the pre-budget hype, to do anything about child care is also disappointing.  I have always been doubtful about the wisdom of tax allowances for certain categories of children to pay for child care outside the home.  This procedure would, for example, ignore the needs of thousands of parents who are married to social welfare recipients, those who stay at home to mind their children, families below the tax threshold and parents who live with taxpayers but are not married to them.</P>
    <P>The best way to recognise the work of parents who stay at home to mind children and to help with the child care costs of those who work outside the home is to increase child benefit.  This payment goes to all parents, regardless of whether they work outside the home.  If child benefit is to help meet child care needs, it would have to be increased by a much greater amount than the £3 granted by the Minister for Finance. With fewer resources at my disposal in 1995 I increased child benefit by £5.</P>
    <P>Apart from the child care dimension, child benefit has long been recognised as a crucial element in combating poverty, as families with <Col N="1594" /> large numbers of children tend to be on the lowest incomes.  Despite the resources at his disposal, the Minister ran away from an opportunity to make a real assault on child poverty.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a distinct shift in strategy, which the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs can confirm, by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  It involves putting major resources into income for the elderly and thereby reducing the resources that are available for other people on social welfare. Not all these people are unemployed.  Many simply cannot access work for a range of reasons. This is a major change in the strategy introduced by the previous Government, which was to concentrate on seeking to eliminate poverty in families.</P>
    <P>No matter what size budget the Minister can claim he secured this year, there is always an outer limit on what can be achieved in terms of acquiring money from, or permission to spend money by, the Department of Finance.  There are always, therefore, choices to be made about how that money will be spent.  It can be spent either by scattering it across all categories of recipients or the Minister can decide to concentrate it on one.</P>
    <P>I suspect, rightly or wrongly, that a conscious decision was made by this Government to concentrate these resources on increasing payments to the elderly, a demographic element in our society that is growing steadily and in terms of its capacity to be heard.  It is also the section of the population whose members are most likely to vote.  Children do not have votes.  I do not deny that the elderly need resources, but choices must be made and the elderly appear to be the focus of this Government's choices in the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>Another area that attracted considerable attention in the period before the Budget Statement is Ireland's contribution to overseas development aid.  A number of factors have contributed to increased public consciousness in this regard. There has been the undoubted impact of the terrible trail of destruction left by hurricane Mitch in Central America last month.  There has also been increased awareness of our moral and political obligations to the developing world at a time when our economy is booming, but when we also continue to look to Europe for assistance.</P>
    <P>The Government package for overseas development aid can only be regarded as miserable given the scale of need in the developing world.  It is clear that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, won the political battle with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell.  She, correctly, objected to Department of Finance plans to freeze the level of ODA for 1999, even suggesting that it was a matter on which she would consider resignation.  She blinked and ODA is effectively frozen at this year's level.  The poor of the Third World have been told to wait and accountancy has won over humanitarianism.</P>
    <P>At a time when a number of parts of the world <Col N="1595" /> are facing continuing famine and when countries such as Nicaragua and Honduras are facing a frightening battle to recover from the impact of hurricane Mitch, the freezing of ODA is unforgivable, especially given the most favourable economic situation ever faced by a Minister for Finance.  Despite the promised three year package, it is now extremely unlikely that the Government will meet its ODA target of 0.45 per cent of GNP by 2002.</P>
    <P>No other sector has a comparable case for front loading an aid package rather than deferring payments, as the Minister of State now proposes to do.  For some people in the developing world this decision will mean the difference between life and death, between health and illness and between nourishment and hunger.  According to the development agency Concern, yesterday's budget means that in 1999, payments for grant-in-aid for development will be reduced from £70.8 million in 1998 to £66.174 million in 1999, a 7 per cent reduction.  Funding for humanitarian assistance will be reduced from £6 million in 1998 to £5 million in 1999, a 17 per cent reduction.  This is a shameful decision and, even at this late stage, it should be reversed to ensure, at a minimum, a substantial increase in the 1999 ODA allocation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern) Dermot Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In setting out the social, community and family affairs aspects of this budget, I am tempted to expound on the spend, the increases and the amounts.  However, that would be to miss a vital point &mdash; that this budget is setting out, as no previous budget did, to turn Ireland into a country where nobody is left out. As of now, many people are left out.  There are people reading the headlines about growth, about the booming economy, about industry and thinking &ldquo;What is that to me?  How is my life improved?&rdquo;.  There are people watching the cranes moving over almost every town and city, watching Ireland being reconstructed for a new millennium and wondering if they will be as lost, as left out and as under-valued in the new millennium as in this one.</P>
      <P>Social exclusion is a phrase that hides hopelessness and worse than hopelessness.  To have the feeling that no matter what one does or how hard one tries one will always be left out, will never have an influence, will never be in full control of one's own life &mdash; that is the reality of social exclusion. To have the sense that age or disability is limiting one's freedom, constraining one's options, reducing one's possibilities &mdash; that too is the reality of social exclusion.  To hear oneself categorised &mdash; sometimes with contempt &mdash; as &ldquo;long-term unemployed&rdquo; or worse, as &ldquo;unemployable&rdquo;&mdash; that undoubtedly is the reality of social exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is absolutely committed to bringing people in from the cold of social exclusion and this budget is a powerful statement in that regard.  It invests over £305 million, in a <Col N="1596" /> full year, in social inclusion measures.  It is an unprecedented investment, a gesture of confidence in the value of all our citizens.  Even though the amounts of money are unprecedented &mdash; that is acknowledged by all &mdash; what is of more fundamental significance is the strategy within which the expenditure fits.  To put it another way, the moneys are unprecedented but the method is pivotal.</P>
    <P>We are pulling together in a new way.  We are pulling all Departments and public bodies together.  Instead of putting £X here and £Y there we are co-ordinating the output and creating synergies that have not previously existed.  Ireland has changed, developed and grown more in the past ten years than at any time in the past.  Industries we never imagined have sprung up.  The economic boom gives us a chance to invest in the future through the PRSI system, to put away money now as an act of social solidarity for future pension costs, to pay for the time when we have more older people who will need decent pensions and decent care provision.  As a Government we must focus relentlessly on ensuring all our citizens have the opportunity and incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of this country and, just as important, to share in the benefits of economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Our older people must be able to share in the benefits of growth.  They have made this country what it is today.  We must make it a good country for them The budget contains a package of measures designed to improve the position of older people in society.  In An Action Programme for the Millennium, we said we would ensure the contribution made to society by older people would be recognised.  The Government is fulfilling that commitment.  We said we would bring the old age pension up to £100 over the lifetime of this Government.  We are emphatically delivering on that commitment.  The budget provides for a £6 increase in the personal rate of pension for people over 66 and for those over 65 on retirement and invalidity pension.  Deputy Howlin suggested not all people would get that £6. That is the case.  He implied that was not the case when he was in Government.  The fact is that not all people are on the maximum personal rate but 271,000 will receive the extra £6 and 56,800 will receive a slightly lesser sum, depending on the contributions made.  We have also provided for an increase of £3 in the qualified adult allowance payable with old age, retirement and invalidity pensions.  That is an increase from £1.50 last year. This follows on the unprecedented £5 increase provided in last year's budget.</P>
    <P>The effect of these increases is that the old age contributory pension will now stand at £89 per week, a 14 per cent increase on the rate payable when we came into office 18 months ago.  Under the rainbow Government, old age pensions stood still compared to the growth in earnings.  We have increased them well above the increase in average earnings.  A couple in receipt of the old age contributory pension will be £9 per week better off <Col N="1597" /> as a result of the increases provided for in the budget and £15.50 per week better off since we came into office.</P>
    <P>In our election commitments last year we promised to address the issue of people who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension, essentially self-employed people who were aged 56 or over when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in April 1998 and who therefore could not satisfy the condition of having entered insurance at least ten years before pension age. The Government is introducing a special old age (contributory) pension for those who have paid at least five years contributions since 6 April 1988.  They will be entitled to a new pension from 6 April 1999.  This group of pensioners will have access to all the free schemes.  It is expect that up to 10,000 pensioners &mdash; approximately 8,000 pensioners and 2,000 qualified adults &mdash; will benefit under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Once off payments will be made to certain pensioners who applied for contributory pensions prior to 1 January 1997 but who were late in applying.  These once off payments which will cost £10 million will benefit some 4,000-5,000 people; on average individuals will receive £2,000.  Those pensioners who have already made inquiries to my Department on the matter will be contacted in connection with this good news immediately. These two issues &mdash; which relate to self-employed pensioners and arrears of late claims for pensions &mdash; were on the agenda of the previous Government but it did little or nothing on them.  We are delivering on these issues because, apart from the general increases for old age pensioners, we considered they affect the elderly in society who, through no fault of their own, missed out.</P>
    <P>My Department will carry out a comprehensive review next year of the qualifying conditions for old age (contributory) and retirement pensions. This review will pay particular attention to the operation of the yearly average qualifying condition, including the possibility of using contributions paid prior to 1953.  This is a matter on which many Deputies have made representations. It will seek to provide a mechanism to allow women who take time out for family reasons to continue contributions for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Another area due for examination is the free schemes provided by my Department.  Originally they were designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance.  It is timely to institute a fundamental review of the schemes to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved. This review will be undertaken in 1999 and will involve a wide consultation process.</P>
    <P>I have commented before on the practice of &ldquo;integrating&rdquo; social welfare pensions with occupational pensions.  In this process, account is taken of the person's old age contributory pension entitlements so that the occupational pension effectively tops up the social welfare pension to provide the total pension specified in the private <Col N="1598" /> pension scheme rules.  In the vast majority of pension schemes, this process is carried out once only at the point of retirement and it enables employers to provide their employees with an earnings related pension.</P>
    <P>However, in a small number of instances the integration process is continued after retirement, thus depriving the pensioner of the full benefit of the increases in the social welfare pension.  This practice is unconscionable.  I call on trustees of pension schemes to ensure pensioners are not disadvantaged. I propose to bring forward in the 1999 Social Welfare Bill the necessary amendment to the Pensions Act, as recommended in the national pensions policy initiative, to prohibit reductions in occupational pensions already in payment, arising from increases in social welfare pensions.  There is no reason why, when the Government gives increases of £5 and £6 of taxpayers' money to old age pensioners, it should be clawed back by arrangements made under private pension schemes.  I propose to bring forward that amendment in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>The objective of bringing all social welfare rates up to the minimum rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare has been reached during my tenure as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  However the job is still not complete.  The Government will continue to further enhance the position of those who rely on the social welfare system for their income.</P>
    <P>The personal rate for all social welfare payments other than those for older people is being increased by at least £3 per week which is twice the rate of inflation.  The lowest payments, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, will be increased by £3.60 which means that these payments will reach the minimum rate recommended by the CSW.  All other payments are now in excess of that rate.  I already stated that the qualified adult allowance is being increased by £3 for all old age, retirement and invalidity pensioners.  The budget provides a £2 increase in the qualified adult allowance in respect of all other welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The difficulties facing farm families as a result of the recent poor season have been well aired in this House and outside it in recent weeks.  The Government is committed to supporting the maximum number of family farms and intends to establish a separate scheme which will be known as farm assist, to distribute income support among farmers in genuine need.  This new scheme, which will come into effect in mid-1999, will replace the smallholder's assistance scheme. It will include income disregards of £100 for each of the first two children and £200 for each subsequent child.  Under the current arrangements for the smallholder's assistance scheme income is assessed at 100 per cent &mdash; in other words there is a pound for pound withdrawal rate once income exceeds the rate appropriate to the family size. Under the new scheme, income will be assessed <Col N="1599" /> at 80 per cent, thus providing an incentive to claimants to increase their income from farming and other sources.  An additional full-year provision of £15 million over and above the £30 million being paid under the smallholder's assistance scheme is being provided in the budget for the new farm assist scheme.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to use words such as &ldquo;generous&rdquo; when describing the supports the budget provides for older people, carers and people with disabilities. I am reluctant because the word &ldquo;generous&rdquo; implies in some ways that the State is the giver. The State is the gainer, not the giver when it provides proper supports for its people.</P>
    <P>There is a great zest and enthusiasm about living in Ireland at this time among those in employment, particularly for those involved with the success stories.  However, there is a danger in the current success, or rather, a danger involved in our handling of that success.  The danger is that we may lose some of the concern, care and kindness that distinguished society in less affluent times.  That concern, care and kindness was part of a rich mixture of civilised living.  In that context, when we spoke of &ldquo;mé féiners&rdquo; we did not want to be counted as one of that bunch.  At present, to be a &ldquo;mé féiner&rdquo; is not always regarded as a bad thing.  Some people subscribe to the philosophy that you should grab what is going and show off what you have gained.  We see a tendency to assume that it is the State's job to take care of old people or those with disabilities. There is also a tendency to assume there is no real poverty or deprivation any more and that there are systems to take care of everything.  No system can take the place of a human being who gives to another the priceless gift of attention, who gives time and respect to someone who is sick or disabled or who puts aside their urgent hopes and ambitions to take care of another.</P>
    <P>In the budget, greatly increased provision for carers has been delivered.  The Government is pointing to the contribution of immeasurable value to the nation made by carers.  That contribution is an education and a reminder to everyone. In its Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can avail of it and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.  I am introducing a range of measures at an additional annual cost of more than £18 million to improve and develop the position of carers.</P>
    <P>To allow more carers qualify for carer's allowance, I am extending the scope of the scheme in two important areas.  This will take effect from August 1999.  The first of these extensions will mean that all carers who are caring for someone between the ages of 16 and 65 will be able to apply for carer's allowance, even where the person being cared for is not in receipt of a social welfare qualifying payment.  I am also extending the scheme to cater for carers who look after children <Col N="1600" /> in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance from health boards.  What is the difference between what they do in terms of effort or quality of care and what is done by someone caring for an adult?  I see no difference, that is why I have extended the allowance to those in receipt of domiciliary care allowance at a cost of approximately £9.5 million.</P>
    <P>From my discussions with carers, it is clear that one of the key things they need for survival is respite care.  Regular planned breaks are vital in managing the stress of caring and I am introducing a new annual payment of £200 for all qualified carers as a contribution towards respite care.  The review of the carer's allowance launched in October proposed a once-off payment of £100 for this purpose but I decided to increase this to £200, a figure on which I hope to build in future years. This payment will be introduced in June 1999 and it will be awarded to all qualified carers in payment at that time to use as they see fit.</P>
    <P>Significant isolation and emotional stress are often the pay off for carers.  In recognition of the need for contact with vital services and as an important source of social contact with family, friends and support groups, I am providing, with effect from August 1999, that all qualified carers will be entitled to free telephone rental allowance regardless of their household composition.  Last year I extended free travel to all qualified carers.</P>
    <P>I am relaxing the residency and full-time care and attention qualifying conditions to introduce greater flexibility into the scheme, while safeguarding the needs and interests of care recipients. The residency requirements will be relaxed to allow for carers who are broadly &ldquo;living next door&rdquo; to qualify.  The full-time care and attention requirements will be relaxed to allow carers to work for approximately ten hours per week.  The psychological, economic and social benefits of work are important to carers and they should be encouraged to remain active in the community.  I support their wishes and as part the changes to the means test, carers will be able to earn up to £75 per week without affecting their eligibility for full carer's allowance.  A number of other measures designed to remove inconsistencies in the operation of the carer's allowance are listed in the appendix to my statement which has been circulated.</P>
    <P>I have already signalled the Government's establishment of a working group to examine the proposal to introduce a needs assessment of all carers and care recipients.  This group will begin its work in January 1999 under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt.</P>
    <P>A new carer's benefit scheme to allow carers to leave the workforce on a temporary basis will be examined by a consultany project in my Department in 1999.  The report &ldquo;Financing Long-Term Care in Ireland&rdquo;, published today by the Irish Association of Pension Funds, the Irish Insurance Federation and the Society of Actuaries <Col N="1601" /> in Ireland is an important contribution to the debate in this area.</P>
    <P>All 11,500 existing recipients of carer's allowance will benefit from the measures outlined while we estimate that an additional 3,500 new carer's will qualify for the allowance.  The total package for carers amounts to more than £18 million extra annually.  This is a considerable increase on the £45 million spent on carers in 1998 and it indicates my commitment and that of the Government to carers and the appreciation we have for the valuable role they play in society.</P>
    <P>With regard to people with disabilities, as a result of the budget, my Department will spend an additional £20 million in 1999.  All payments to people with disabilities are over the level recommended by the CSW.  The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities highlighted the need for a number of major equality measures &mdash; some of them funding, some of them not funding based.  We are taking action in respect of as many of those measures as possible.</P>
    <P>The provision of support services for people with disabilities is a critical area of concern.  The commission recommended the establishment of a disability support service as a single point of contact for information, advice, support and advocacy for people with disabilities.  The Government has decided that such a service should be put in place through a merger into a new organisation of the National Social Services Board, which supports a national network of citizen's information centres, and the NRB network of information centres.  This new organisation will provide a single information support service and will operate under the aegis of my Department.  I will bring forward the necessary legislation early in the new year.</P>
    <P>In the budget I have also taken an important step in the direction of another of the commission's main recommendations.  The commission stated that disability allowance should be paid to people living in institutions and health care facilities.  At present, people on disability allowance lose their entitlement if they enter long-term institutional care.  Their maintenance costs and an element of pocket money are then met through funding from the Department of Health and Children.  I am currently in discussions with that Department regarding the wider implications of this, but as an immediate step I have decided that from August 1999 entitlement to disability allowance will be continued where an existing recipient enters hospital or institutional care.  This matter will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that people with disabilities have access to educational opportunities and improve their chances of securing employment. Therefore, I am lowering the qualifying age limit for the back to education scheme for people with disabilities from 21 to 18.</P>
    <P>It makes no sense to pay people to be unemployed. It makes perfect sense to invest to make people employable.  Last year I set a target of <Col N="1602" /> pushing the proportion of unemployment spending on active employability measures to 20 per cent.  This target will be exceeded in 1999 with total investment in employment supports of £200 million.  There is a programme of measures in place targeted primarily at the long-term unemployed, designed specifically to provide them with the opportunity and incentive to take up employment and training.</P>
    <P>The budget provides for a number of enhancements to that programme.  The number of places under the back-to-work allowance scheme is being increased by 2,000 to 29,000, reflecting its success in giving the long-term unemployed a secure source of income as they seek to re-enter the world of work.  A further 1,000 places will be created and confined to participants in a new pilot scheme aimed at those who have been unemployed for five years or more.  This group faces particular difficulties in re-integrating into the labour force and employers are sometimes reluctant to offer them employment opportunities. Under this scheme participants will be placed with employers for five to six weeks while continuing to receive their full social welfare entitlements with a special allowance of £25 a week towards travel and meal costs.  At the end of the trial period they can proceed automatically to the back-to-work allowance.</P>
    <P>In November 1997 I introduced a tapered qualified adult allowance to provide an incentive for the unemployed to avail of employment opportunities.  Under these arrangements a reduced allowance continues to be payable where the income of the qualified adult ranges from £60 to £90.  The budget provides for an extension of this income range to £105.  This will increase the incentive for such persons, normally women in the home, to enter the workforce.</P>
    <P>On family income supplement, the budget provides for an increase of £8 in the weekly income thresholds at each point.  The effect will be to provide an increase of almost £5 a week for all claimants.</P>
    <P>Other elements of the employment support services are being improved.  The back-to-education allowance scheme is being enhanced with an increase of £50 in the cost-of-education allowance paid to participants at the commencement of the academic year.  The allowance will now be £200.</P>
    <P>The family is at the heart of society.  It must also be at the centre of all Government policies. An extra £40 million is being invested in the family through major increases in child benefit.  It appears people have incredibly short memories. Deputy Howlin castigated the increase in child benefit of £3 per month for the first two children to £34.50 and £4 for subsequent children to £46. This means a family with four children will now receive £161 per month or more than £37 a week. The figure of £40 million compares favourably with the figure of £25 million provided for by the rainbow coalition Government in its final budget. In 1996 it provided for a figure of £26 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1603" /> Deputy Howlin suggested that the Government has frozen CDAs.  It has done no more than the rainbow coalition Government.  CDAs were considered a disincentive to work as they were withdrawn once a person entered employment, unlike child benefit which continues to be paid.  The qualified adult allowance is being increased by £3 for old age pensioners and £2 for others.  This compares with a figure of £1.50 last year.  It ill behoves Deputy Howlin, therefore, to castigate the Government.  As a result of the investment of an extra £40 million, in the region of £480 million will be available for child benefit next year.</P>
    <P>An extra £1.8 million is being provided in 1999 for the continued development of marriage and child counselling, bereavement counselling and marriage preparation, the family mediation service, and the development of the network of family and community centres.  An extra £2.55 million is being provided for supporting voluntary and community activity.  An additional challenge grant of £300,000 is being provided for the Foundation for Investing in Communities which I launched recently, bringing total support to more than £1 million.  Funding is being provided in fulfilment of the commitment in Partnership 2000 to establish an additional ten community development projects.</P>
    <P>I listened recently to a group of young people with disabilities discuss discrimination, prejudice and other problems.  The comment that most annoyed one of the group was, &ldquo;You do not need to worry about that&rdquo;.  On the face of it, it is kind and helpful, but that is not the way he saw it.  He believed he was being told, &ldquo;We will take care of you.  We will solve your problems.  Leave that to us&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the way we thought in the past about groups such as the long-term unemployed, older people and people with disabilities.  It was a compassionate and pitying response.  It is redundant and time to give it the P45.  Older people, people with disabilities and those who have been out of the workforce for a long time do not want compassion or pity, they want equality and respect; to dream dreams and see possibilities; to belong to a society that includes them in its culture; to be heard, seen and inform our thinking; and to control their lives and contribute to the lives of others.</P>
    <P>I would not pretend this or any other budget could achieve such fundamental change, but I claim with confidence that this budget is a strong indicator of the Government's passion to include and its determination to make the structures and systems of the State serve all the people.</P>

      <P>The economy continues to <Col N="1604" /> enjoy unprecedented growth and the public finances were rarely, if ever, in better shape.  Most parties have contributed to its success.  It is disingenuous to claim this is due to the efforts of the Government.  Any fair-minded individual will accept that the basis for our prosperity was laid during the two and a half years the rainbow coalition Government was in office.  That Government initiated the process of tax reform.</P>
      <P>In this budget there has been a reverting back to the philosophy of the rainbow coalition Government of targeting the lower paid by increasing allowances, broadening tax bands and introducing targeted tax credits.  This is the policy that evoked that infamous headline in one of our main national newspapers &ldquo;Payback time&rdquo; before the 1997 general election.  I am convinced it is the reason the Minister's party is on the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>The rainbow Government gave £450 million in the 1997 budget to lower and middle income groups, in less favourable financial circumstances than we enjoy today &mdash; something which is overlooked.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister repeatedly state in this House and in committee that his idea of tax reform was to cut rates, the tax provisions in this budget represents a welcome departure and a U-turn by the Minister.  The Government's stated intention is to reduce the top income tax rate to 42 per cent and the standard rate to 20 per cent during its term of office.  Thankfully, the Minister has departed from this objective in this budget.  The tax concessions in this budget were in line with the policy of the rainbow Government, as outlined in its manifesto before the last election.</P>
      <P>This budget could be the last opportunity for the Minister to put his unique imprint on the economy.  I am sure we will be able to face into the new Europe better prepared for the new era of competition which will confront us.  How will the Estimates, published two weeks ago, and this budget address the factors that threaten to stunt or derail our current economic buoyancy and prosperity?</P>
      <P>We are facing many problems.  The country's infrastructure is seriously strained.  Labour shortages and skills deficits are now more apparent and wage inflation is increasing.  We can see the effect of the collapse of the Asian economy on the US economy and the resulting job losses.  In time that could have a negative effect on our economy.  We must be prepared for all these eventualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget is one of contrasts &mdash; good for some people and very bad for others.  It is good for the corporate sector and it contains a welcome departure for the lower and middle income groups &mdash; we must accept that.  However, it fails abysmally in tackling poverty.  As a result of the <Col N="1605" /> budget, there will be no significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty.  Housing and hospital waiting lists will persist at totally unacceptable levels and may even increase.  Adult illiteracy will remain largely untackled and rural exclusion will continue as before.</P>
    <P>The budget exhibits an extraordinary failure to understand the severe struggle of those who live on social welfare.  This has been outlined by all the Opposition spokespersons, including the leaders of the main parties.  Thankfully, the minimum payment rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986 have now been reached.  However, the number living in poverty is not declining.  Social welfare payments have not kept pace with growth in average industrial wages.  This budget will not effectively tackle poverty.</P>
    <P>The increases in the old age pension, both contributory and non-contributory, the widow's allowance and unemployment benefit will not keep pace with the cost of living and the rising cost of consumer products such as fuel, food and other necessities.  At the end of next year, these people will be worse off as a result of this budget. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, accepted this to some degree.</P>
    <P>I will put the budget in context by citing some examples.  There are more people with incomes below the poverty line than there were a decade ago.  There were 172,000 people unemployed in 1990.  This number was the same in November 1997.  By May 1998 the number of unemployed had fallen to 126,000.  However, this number excludes everyone who was unemployed even for one hour in the course of a week.  The numbers employed grew by 95,000 up to May 1998. However, this figure includes 60,000 part-time jobs.  There are 26,000 more people on schemes, such as the community employment scheme, compared with 1990.  These people are listed as employed in the labour force survey.  A net gain of about 35,000 jobs is needed to eliminate unemployment. The figures are distorted at the moment.  I would like clarification from Ministers as regards the figures I cited.  People who are working on a part-time basis cannot be regarded as being full-time employed.</P>
    <P>In 1996 more than 33,000 households were on waiting lists for housing.  This will rise to more than 50,000 in 1999.  Last week in one of the national newspapers, I saw a distribution of the waiting list per county which showed a remarkable increase in all counties.  The principal reason for this is the rise in the cost of housing across the country.  Private housing is no longer affordable for many lower and middle income groups. As a result they are forced to go on the public housing waiting list.  Although there is an increase in the number of houses being built this year, nevertheless, it will take nearly ten years to eliminate the waiting list, not counting the numbers being added to it.  The Government cannot be complacent about poverty and housing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> I would like to discuss some aspects of the budget, especially the motor industry, which got an unfair rap.  Judging by reports in the newspapers today, the main representatives of the motor industry are disappointed and unhappy with the budget.  In the past five years they have created jobs and turned the industry around.  This is the thanks it gets for the great efforts it has made.  The motor industry fears that the increases in VRT will have a negative impact on its growth.</P>
    <P>In the past four years the industry has provided about 6,000 new jobs and employs more than 46,000 people.  It will provide the Exchequer with £2.2 billion from motor related taxation in 1998. The Society of the Irish Motor Industry sought a reduction in VRT to a single rate of 20 per cent. The response of the Minister was to increase VRT on cars with an engine capacity of 1.4 to 2 litres from 22.5 per cent to 25 per cent, on cars of 2 litres to 2.5 litres from 22.5 per cent to 30 per cent and on cars over 2.5 litres from 28 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>This increase in VRT is estimated to raise £43 million.  However, in a press release this morning, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, said it found the increases totally unacceptable and it will oppose them vigorously.  The press release states:</P>
    <P>Prices of family cars from 1.4 litres to 2 litres will rise by 3.5 per cent, from 2 litres to 2.5 litres by a horrific 11 per cent and over 2.5 litres by 3 per cent.  The measures will in fact impact negatively on motor industry jobs, increase emissions and ultimately reduce Government revenue by up to £100 million and not raise £43 million as the Minister claims.</P>
    <P>I remind the Tánaiste that the Irish motor industry lobbied for a 20 per cent rate of VRT.  Instead this is the response.</P>
    <P>Because of the exceptionally high rate of VRT, Irish consumers pay 25 per cent more than the average in main European markets for a new car. Each year 40,000 used cars are being imported into Ireland yet none are being exported because of the residual element of VRT in the price of used cars in Ireland.  The 6,000 jobs created since 1993 could be vulnerable because of the threat of large volumes of second-hand imports.  The recent VRT reductions since 1993 and the scrappage scheme have helped to keep down the numbers of used imports.  These job gains and the lower level of used imports may not be maintained.</P>
    <P>I want to mention some of the points which were raised today in this morning's media.  The tax increases will lead to a rise of £550 to £600 in the price of the average 1.6 litre family car.  On this matter alone, even if the Government raised the level from 1.4 litre to 1.6 litre for the bottom rate of VRT, it would be of some help to the industry.  Through my party's spokesperson on Finance, Deputy Noonan, I will table an amendment to this effect in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>It was stated in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning <Col N="1607" /> that &ldquo;A few weeks ago, most motor industry observers were predicting new car sales next year of around 140,000 &mdash; approximately the same as this year.  Last night, those predictions had fallen to around 115,000 or less&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It further stated that Mr. Dave Shannon, managing director of Toyota Ireland, estimated that the price of a 1.6 litre Avensis, currently retailing at about £16,350, would increase to about £16,925.  That is a considerable increase.  Mr. Shannon stated: &ldquo;This is crazy.  Where's the logic of these increases when we are supposed to have tax harmonisation?  This makes no sense with us going into the euro currency.  I hope we can do something in Brussels about it&rdquo;.  Another lobby group is going to Brussels to complain about the actions of the Government.</P>
    <P>Mr. Eddie Nolan, chairman and managing director of Ford Ireland, saw the budget as &ldquo;deeply disappointing&rdquo;. He pointed out that cars like the 1.6 litre Mondeo were also used in many company fleets.  &ldquo;That £550 to £600 increase will also have a serious impact on the cost of doing business here.  It will have to be passed on.&rdquo;, he said.  &ldquo;When VRT was introduced in 1993 we were told that there would be a genuine effort made to harmonise car prices with those in Europe.  Today's budget totally flies in the face of that promise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ironically, cars over 2.5 litres, which are in the luxury category like Jaguar, Lexus, etc., escape with the lightest increase in tax.  The tax increase is just 2 per cent, from the current rate of 28 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is further bad news in the budget for many people who drive to work.  Most people in rural areas must drive long distances to work basically because there is no employment locally in their villages and towns.  They drive 40 and 50 miles to work and they need a good car because of the condition of the roads.  The Minister announced that people with car parking spaces provided by their employers may be required to pay benefit-in-kind tax as a result of a review which he has ordered.  He said that he had asked the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to undertake a review in order to produce a &ldquo;fair and workable system&rdquo; of applying BIK to parking spaces provided by employers. That is totally contrary to the policy of encouraging people to take their cars to work and I ask the Minister to clarify that statement when he is addressing the various issues raised.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the child care crisis.  Certainly there is a labour shortage at present and there is a skills deficit.  One way of releasing many married women into the workforce is to provide proper child care facilities.  There are people with expertise whom the country needs.  However, they cannot leave their children because of the lack of child care facilities and also in many instances because of the cost of paying somebody to look after them at home if they go to work.  This is something which must be looked at seriously from the point of allowing these people, many of <Col N="1608" /> whom are professionals, to realise their potential. Whereas they want to be good mothers and rear their families, at the same time they want to realise their potential, up-date their skills, etc. There is nothing in this budget, apart from one paragraph about child car facilities provided by employers which relates to BIK, which will in any way enhance the provision of child care facilities for many women.</P>
    <P>Yesterday one of my colleagues, Deputy Clune, stated in a press statement that there is a crisis developing in the child care industry whereby quality child care is becoming more difficult for parents to access and afford.  Irish parents are spending 20 per cent of their income on child care, yet European parents pay on average only 8 per cent.  This anomaly must be addressed if we are to encourage more women to enter and rejoin the work force.</P>
    <P>Recently all Deputies were circulated with a good publication by IBEC on this issue.  In that briefing document IBEC stated that up to 70 per cent of employers are experiencing recruitment difficulties.  Much of this problem could be alleviated if the Government addressed the problems which the parents of young children are experiencing in accessing child care facilities.  It is unacceptable that the work skills and experience of so many women should be locked up.  It does not make sense that there are women with the necessary skills who want to work and there are employers who want to employ them, yet the State has not addressed their problems in accessing quality affordable child care facilities. This is certainly an area at which the Government must look carefully in view of labour shortages, etc.  The IBEC document states that Ireland has one of the lowest labour market female participation rates in Europe.  Of the current labour force of 1.5 million workers, approximately 600,000 are female.  There are currently 400,000 mothers in Ireland with children under 15 years of age.  Less than 30 per cent of these mothers are in full-time employment while approximately 10 per cent are in part-time employment.  Clearly, responsibility for child care arrangements rests with both parents but, in practice, this responsibility continues to fall predominantly on women. In this context, it is time the Government looked seriously at this question.</P>
    <P>I would like to say to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Agriculture and Food that agriculture is collapsing, as is the whole fabric of rural Ireland.  If that change is to be arrested, it needs to be managed.  The Government is adopting a <i>laissez-faire</i> market driven approach to the farming crisis in rural Ireland.  There is nothing in this budget to deal with the problems facing many farmers.  I have never seen less reference to the farming issue than in this budget.  It reflects present thinking within the Government on this crisis; it just does not care about it.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear the two farming leaders welcome aspects of this budget last night.  They are certainly not representing their membership <Col N="1609" /> throughout the length and breath of Ireland. They will get a reaction to their response to this budget, at a time when the Minister had £1.4 billion to spend, but all he could give to help with the worst fodder crisis in the history of the State was a measly £10 million.  He said last night this amount would be increased to £20 million which, in terms of the overall give-away, is derisory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had a unique opportunity yesterday, instead of the usual situation where Governments had to borrow to balance the budget.  On this occasion the Minister was in the enviable position of having a £1.4 billion surplus.  Despite this outstanding surplus, the budget must come as a grave disappointment to those on low pay and on social welfare.  As a result of this budget low paid workers will get an average of £6 per week, pensioners will get £6 a week in seven or eight months' time and others on social welfare will get £3 per week.  That is the reality of the budget for them.  There is nothing in it to dampen house prices.  What good is an increase of £6 per week in a person's wages if a couple is saving for a deposit on a house?</P>
      <P>There are significant changes in the tax code, but no corresponding improvement in social welfare allowances.  I have often spoken about the carer's allowance and an annual provision of £200 per week was made.  The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs made great play of this £200 and said regular planned breaks can be of great assistance in reducing the stress for carers.  I agree with him, but what good is £200 per week to the carer at the intense end of caring who works up to 365 days a year for a bed-ridden and perhaps incontinent patient?  That carer could not get a person to work for £200 per week, it would cover only two or three days respite care in a year.  That is not good enough for carers who provide an intense level of care.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to a personal allowance for carers.  This will be of no benefit to the full-time carer.  It is no good claiming carers may earn £75 per week if they are caring for somebody 365 day per year who is bed-ridden or incontinent.  The carer who must provide that level of care cannot go out and earn £75 per week.  While it may be of benefit to those who do not provide full-time care while qualifying for the carer's allowance, it will not benefit those who provide an intense level of care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another anomaly which I am almost blue in the face raising with the Minister over the past year and a half.  He told me to write to him personally, which I did.  He then told me a review group was dealing with the carer's allowance and was due to report in January, then in May but which finally reported in October.  I made submissions to that review group.  I came across this anomaly in my constituency work and many TDs will have come across similar ones.  In the case with which I was dealing, the woman's husband, a small farmer, was killed on the road on a tractor. She cared, and continues to care, for her husband's <Col N="1610" /> relative who lives in the house.  She applied for the widow's pension when she became a widow to compensate her on the loss of her husband's income because she must pay somebody to do farm work.  She got the widow's pension, but immediately lost the carer's allowance. I asked for that anomaly to be rectified but nothing was done in this budget despite the modest increases in the regulations concerning the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>When I rang the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs I was told nobody can get two social welfare allowances.  Will the Minister make provision for such a case?  There cannot be many carers who become widows while continuing to work as carers.  It is a scandal that when this woman's husband was alive he could earn up to £150 and she could get a carer's allowance, but now that she gets a widow's pensions of £73 per week she is denied the carer's allowance.  That anomaly must be corrected.</P>
    <P>There is another anomaly in this area.  If people who live in local authority houses become carers, they qualify for the full carer's allowance of £73.50 because they care for people 365 days a year, who may be bed-ridden, in their homes. However, when the next rent review is carried out, the local authority takes 20 per cent of the carer's allowance back because the household income has increased by £73.50 per week &mdash; in other words, the local authority is stealing £17 or £18 from that person's carer's allowance.  That anomaly should also be corrected.</P>
    <P>The Minister also dealt with health issues and indicated that he saved £24 million on the drugs refund scheme.  What will we get for the £24 million saved?  One third, or £8 million, of the £24 million will go towards the waiting list initiative. That is no good because £12 million was provided last year to reduce waiting lists in hospitals but, in the meantime, they increased.  I will quote figures from my local hospital.  In June 1997, for example, the waiting list at University College Hospital Galway was 2,079 while a year later, in June 1998, it was 2,891 &mdash; an increase of 812 or 39 per cent. Worse still, from June to the end of September, the last time for which figures are available, the waiting list increased by 626 to 3,517, a 21 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>Over the first 15 months of this Government there has been a phenomenal 69 per cent increase in the waiting list at University College Hospital Galway which is currently facing a crisis, as the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and the Tánaiste well know.  We are looking for £1 million to keep two wards and a theatre open in the hospital and to keep the staff employed.  There is now a divide and conquer situation, where the management has satisfied one union but not the other.  That has nothing to do with keeping the wards open, but with a staff decision on whether or not to work to rule.</P>
    <P>I appealed to the Minister for Health and Children to provide £1 million for our hospital when the Supplementary Estimate was introduced earlier <Col N="1611" /> this week, but that appeal fell on deaf ears.  It is no good telling me about a waiting list initiative for next year and that £8 million will be provided on top of last year's £12 million.  That will not reduce the waiting lists, as I have proved by those figures.  I am sure the numbers on the waiting lists will increase substantially from September to December.  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, to encourage the Minister for Health and Children to concede the £1 million budget that will keep the wards open and help to control the waiting lists at University College Hospital Galway.</P>

      <P>I do not seem to be living in the same country as Deputies Deenihan and McCormack because what we have heard for the past half an hour is gloom, doom and crisis everywhere.  It is worth mentioning that just over a decade ago when the Fine Gael Labour Government left office in 1987 this country had a national debt the equivalent of 125 per cent of GNP and rising rapidly.  At the time it took all the income tax revenue to service it.  Today that national debt stands at approximately 55 per cent of GNP, is declining rapidly and it consumes less than half the income tax take.</P>
      <P>We were also running huge budget deficits during that period.  In the 1980s, 60 per cent of the population left through emigration. As we saw from the statistics published on Monday, 44,000 people came to this country over the past 12 months.  We had net emigration of approximately 22,000 people.  People are coming back to better opportunities at home than they had abroad.</P>
      <P>I want to clarify something Deputy McCormack said about the carer's allowance.  The carer's allowance is not being increased to £200 a week, although I wish it could be.  The £200 is being provided for respite care annually so that the carer can have an opportunity to take a holiday or a break while alternative care is provided for the person being cared for.</P>

      <P>Yesterday the Minister announced a relaxation in the qualifying conditions for the carer's allowance, particularly for people who do not reside with a carer.  That will make a huge difference to many people who require full-time care.</P>
      <P>I will respond to Deputy Howlin's call on the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, to resign because of the 1999 Estimates for overseas development aid. The Minister of State has negotiated with the Minister for Finance a multi-annual budget for the next three years which will increase the amount of discretionary aid by approximately 66 per cent.  It will give us £400 million in direct aid, excluding administration and staff costs associated with administering the overseas development aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs. That is a substantial sum and it puts the target within reach.  It will take Ireland from being twelfth in the league of 21 donor countries to eighth position.</P>
      <P>That is quite an achievement and the Minister of State must be congratulated rather than asked to resign.  I do not know how many times Ministers are called on to resign.  One does not achieve many things by resigning but by staying and effecting change, which is what the Minister of State has done.</P>
      <P>As leader of the Progressive Democrats, I am proud that this is the most radical and reforming budget this country has seen in a long time.  It effects the biggest transformation of our income tax system in a generation and it delivers the biggest package of tax reductions ever for working people.  In addition, it makes substantial resources available to improve living standards for older people, addresses the needs of people with disabilities and promotes social inclusion.  It is based on a clear political philosophy, the belief that by reducing the burden of taxation we will stimulate increased economic activity which will generate the extra revenue needed to fund additional spending on social services.</P>
      <P>Budgets should spell out clear economic signals and no budget has ever sent a clearer signal than this one.  There has been a massive increase in tax free allowances, sufficient to take the first £100 of weekly income for a single person completely out of the tax net.  The Progressive Democrats have always stood for real tax reductions and that amounts to real tax reduction in anyone's language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is sending a clear and unmistakable signal that working people are entitled to their dividend from this country's economic success. They are entitled to their reward for guaranteeing the pay moderation and the industrial harmony that have underpinned our economic growth for the past ten years.  We are also sending an equally clear signal to those who are not working. We are telling them that it is now worth their <Col N="1613" /> while to work, to come off the dole and move into paid employment.</P>
    <P>In recent times the Labour Party has posed a phoney choice between raising allowances and cutting rates.  In Government, it made little progress on either front.  Last year the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Government took four points off tax rates in one budget.  Over the past decade, 17 of the 18 points taken off the tax rates have been taken off by Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Governments.  Labour could only manage one point in five budgets.  The Progressive Democrats have now delivered in one budget a bigger increase in tax free allowances than Labour could manage in five.</P>
    <P>Under Labour, years were spent tinkering with allowances without delivering any significant improvement to people on modest incomes. When Labour left Government in 1997, a single person was still entering the tax net at £77 a week. This budget addresses the needs of those on low to middle incomes in a way that Labour and its allies in Democratic Left were never prepared to do when they were in power.  The needs of those people have been definitely addressed by this year's budget.</P>
    <P>It is hard to keep up with developments in tax policy these days.  Last Sunday we heard the Leader of Fine Gael on RTE radio denying that his party campaigned for a cut in the top rate of tax in last year's general election.  Picking up the newspaper the following morning, one was confronted with the amazing revelation that Deputy McDowell of the Labour Party was calling for a cut of 4 per cent in the top rate of tax in this year's budget.  For a moment I thought <i>The Irish Times</i> might have got its McDowells confused, particularly as the Labour Party went almost apoplectic at a cut of 2 per cent in the top rate last year.  Labour's official policy is now apparently 4 per cent off the top rate.  I am delighted that Deputy Michael Higgins and Deputy Stagg have been converted to the Progressive Democrats policy position.  I hope they will be able to bring Deputy De Rossa with them next February.</P>
    <P>It seems the only people in this House who are now opposed to rate cuts are Deputy Joe Higgins and Deputy John Bruton.  It was Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Finance, who set out the policy of cutting the standard rate of corporation tax to 12.5 per cent.  He was right to do so and he deserves great credit for it.  It would be completely illogical for the Labour Party to argue now that the banks should have their tax rate cut to 12.5 per cent but that their employees should have no reduction at all in the 46 per cent rate at which they are taxed.</P>
    <P>The rates are not being cut this year because all available resources have been devoted to the massive increase in allowances.  However, I assure Deputy Quinn and the Labour Party that the Government will deliver on its rate cutting commitments over the next three budgets.  I look forward to their support on those occasions.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats gave a clear commitment <Col N="1614" /> in last year's general election to move to tax credits, which would effect a major reform of our personal tax system.  The experts told us it could not be done or that it would take years to achieve.  However, after 18 months in Government we have delivered fully on that commitment. Others talk about tax reform, but we do it.</P>
    <P>The switch to tax credits represents a dramatic overhaul of our income tax system.  It makes it fairer.  Up to now a £1,000 increase in the basic allowance was worth £240 to one person on £10,000 a year but £460 to a person on £100,000 a year.  None of the social engineers in the rainbow coalition bothered to do anything about this.</P>
    <P>Under a tax credits system, an increase in allowances, or credits as they now are, will be worth the same to all taxpayers, regardless of income.  The move to tax credits also makes it easier to target resources at those on modest incomes.  The cost of delivering the equivalent of a £100 increase in the basic allowance was £53 million under the old system.  Under the new system of tax credits it will fall to £39 million.  This will make it more affordable to take people out of the tax net at the bottom end.  This Government is firmly committed to controlling inflation and this budget is part of that process.  I reject suggestions from the other side of the House, particularly from Fine Gael, that yesterday's package will be inflationary.  If putting an extra £6 a week in a pensioner's pocket is inflationary then we can all give up.</P>
    <P>Budget day normally produces a strong policy debate on taxation and spending.  However, this was not the case this year.  When the Minister for Finance sat down yesterday the Opposition parties had little of substance to say.  The basic pitch from Labour and Fine Gael appeared to be the same.  The tax package was too big, but yet too small.  Public spending was too high but still not high enough.  One would have heard a more rounded critique of the budget in an undergraduate debating society.  In any event, lectures from Fine Gael on the need to control public spending are a bit rich, coming from the party that wanted to pay kids for going to school.</P>
    <P>One of the Government's main objectives in this budget was to improve the lot of older people.  Pensioners have made an enormous contribution to our current economic prosperity. They worked hard and saved hard to build the Ireland of today.  Our current good fortune owes a lot to their sacrifices and efforts and it is only right that we should afford them the recognition they deserve.</P>
    <P>The increase of £6 in the old age pension is the biggest in any budget.  It takes the value of the contributory old age pension to almost £90 and brings us within sight of the £100 per week mark which was a key commitment in the Progressive Democrats' election manifesto.  We are well on course to delivering on that commitment within the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>This year's increase is in stark contrast to what was done by the previous Government.  The <Col N="1615" /> Rainbow Government managed an extra £3 in 1997, just £2.20 in 1996 and only £1.80 in 1995. These were miserable increases at a time of rapid economic growth.  So much for the Labour Party's commitment to older people.</P>
    <P>The Government has also taken decisive action to reduce the tax burden on pensioners.  The generous increases in the exemption limits will give a significant tax break to the over-65s and will take thousands of them out of the tax net altogether. The budget makes provision for the relaxation of the qualification requirements for medical card for people over 70 and this will be a significant benefit to many older people.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that my Department will be able to fund a pilot programme for training older people in information technology.  This is an imaginative project which should help to open up the world of computers and computing to the older generation.  The budget will deliver very substantial benefits to older people next year, which is particularly fitting given that 1999 is the International Year of Older Persons.</P>
    <P>For many years we did not have enough jobs for our people; today we do not have enough people for our jobs.  That is a problem, but it is the kind of problem we always wanted to have, the kind of problem that comes with prosperity and economic success.  Labour shortages are causing difficulties in many sectors of the economy. Many employers are now going abroad to recruit staff.  Others are finding it impossible to fill vacancies. One manufacturing company told me recently that it could hire another 500 people if it could find them.</P>
    <P>What is truly remarkable is that, alongside this labour shortage, we still have over 120,000 people unemployed.  This is the great economic paradox of Ireland today.  The budget offers a real solution to this paradox.  It sends out the clearest signal that it is worthwhile to work and that one is better off working than on the dole.  The message is simple: one pays no tax on the first £100 of one's weekly earnings.  Thanks to last year's budget, the first £100 is also free of PRSI.  These are the kinds of radical changes that will make a real difference to the welfare to work equation, that will deal with our new jobs crisis, measures that will put people into the jobs that are available.</P>
    <P>We are making enormous strides in solving the unemployment problem.  CSO figures released earlier this week show that unemployment fell by 32,000 in the 12 months to last April.  The numbers on the live register have fallen by more than 30,000 since this Government took office, and a further significant fall will be seen when the November figures are released tomorrow.  Our unemployment rate now stands at 7.8 per cent, one of the lowest levels in Europe.  This is hardly surprising as we are generating additional jobs at a rate of 2,000 per week.</P>
    <P>Our national objective now must be the achievement of full employment; in other words, a job for everybody in this country that wants to <Col N="1616" /> work.  That objective would have seemed like pie in the sky only a few years ago.  It is now a realisable if ambitious target, but one that we may credibly aim for.</P>
    <P>Full employment can be achieved only if the problem of structural, long-term unemployment is dealt with.  I am pleased that the Government is successfully dealing with long-term unemployment. We are always told that the Celtic tiger is by-passing the long-term jobless.  However, the CSO figures released earlier this week tell a different story.</P>
    <P>CSO data show that the number of long-term unemployed fell by a third in twelve months and that there are now just 63,500 people in this category. It is worth noting that long-term unemployment has fallen even more rapidly than overall unemployment since 1994 &mdash; down from 9 per cent to 3.9 per cent.  That means that over 80 per cent of the total fall in unemployment in recent years has been accounted for by the fall in long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>None of this should suggest complacency.  The current positive economic situation provides the best opportunity ever to prevent further inflows into long-term unemployment and to reintegrate those who have been out of work for a long time. From a labour-market perspective the key issues facing the Government are preventing another generation from drifting into long-term unemployment and helping those who are long-term unemployed into jobs.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's employment action plan I have given a new orientation and impetus to FÁS as the major labour market delivery agency.  It is becoming the primary gateway from welfare to work for many unemployed people.  Working in close harmony with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, we have launched a programme which offers supports to young people under 25 who cross the six-month unemployment threshold. Our objective is to help them get a job or to offer them appropriate training or education which will enhance their employment prospects.  We have ring-fenced 7,000 skills training places to meet their needs.  It is early days but the signs are encouraging.  Of 900 young people referred for interview in September, more than 40 per cent had signed off the live register by the end of October.  This is twice the normal rate after the six month period.  This process will prevent people drifting aimlessly into a life of unemployment and unemployability.  We are committed to rolling out the same process during the new year to cover older age groups crossing the twelve-month unemployment threshold.</P>
    <P>This Government does not believe in a passive approach to the unemployment problem.  We believe in dealing with it through active intervention. The relationship between the State and those who are unemployed is a form of social contract.  The State has a responsibility to the unemployed which goes beyond handing out a dole cheque.  It must provide them with real help <Col N="1617" /> and guidance to smooth the path from welfare to work.  Equally, those who are unemployed also have responsibilities.  They must be prepared to take up reasonable offers of work, training or education.</P>
    <P>Cutting taxes has been the key to Ireland's tremendous economic performance.  We have cut taxes on labour, capital and companies.  We have given huge tax breaks for investment in films, urban renewal and the development of tourism. Socialists do not believe in low taxes; they believe in high taxes.  The biggest threat to our continued economic prosperity comes from European socialists who are envious of our low tax regime and who want to foist on us the kind of punitive tax rates that have saddled them with massive unemployment.  Socialism has never been very popular in this country and the last thing we want is to import it from Europe.  This budget is another major step on the road to tax reduction and tax reform.  As long as we in Ireland keep on that road we will continue to prosper.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that over the past decade tax rates have fallen substantially on corporations, capital and income yet the tax take has doubled.  Low taxes and high volume suit the Irish economic experience.  As the Taoiseach stated yesterday, it is better to get 5 per cent of something than 10 per cent of nothing.  In its three remaining budgets, the Government will continue its tax reduction strategy as it is the most successful way to encourage economic activity, to generate new job opportunities, reward those who work and to show that there is a real incentive if one makes an effort.  This is a caring, radical and reforming budget.  The elderly, carers, those with disabilities, those at work and those who wish to move from welfare to work were the Government's priorities when framing this budget and we got our priorities right.</P>
    <P>Much reference was made this morning to the issue of child care.  This is not an easy issue to resolve and Governments cannot solve every problem that arises in society.  However, the tax breaks which have been given to employers and the removal of benefit in kind tax from child care facilities which employers provide will encourage them to provide such facilities for their workers. Deputy Deenihan spoke about the need to give women who work the opportunity to have child care facilities provided through a tax allowance. Equally, women at home may feel that if women in paid employment get a break, they should get one too.  Tax breaks will give no help to the 25 per cent of families who are at the lowest income level.  The recent Commission on the Family recommended that the Government use child benefit and not the tax system to help families with children.  There is merit in that recommendation.</P>

      <P>This year we have made a start in encouraging employers to provide child care facilities and it will be interesting to see the response to this measure.  I expect a good one.  It is not true to say that only big businesses will avail of this facility.  Small businesses can group together, as they have already done in one part of the country, to provide child care facilities for their staff.  The removal of tax liability from this benefit in kind will encourage employers to do so.  In the short-term this is the most effective way of dealing with some of the problems which have arisen in this area.  Child care is a problem in many areas of the country, particularly in poorer areas and different strategies need to be applied in different areas.  It would be wrong of the Government, in advance of receiving the report from the expert working group on child care, to make decisions in this regard.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly take over responsibility for training people with disabilities. Because of that FÁS is obliged to make major changes in many of its training centres and £7 million is provided in the budget to enable it do so over the next 12 months.  In addition, employers will now receive a tax relief on double the cost of employing someone with a disability and disabled people will receive the same benefits which were introduced last year for long-term unemployed people to allow them to return to the workforce.  This will encourage employers to give the employment opportunities, which are being created by our economic progress, to people with disabilities.  It is right that the training of people with disabilities should become a mainstream issue and that the buoyant economy which has been providing large numbers of jobs in recent years should also provide opportunities for disabled people in society.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Bernard Durkan and tá mé buíoch de as sin.  Tabharfaidh mé stracfhéachaint leathan ar an mbuiséad agus ba mhaith liom féachaint ar an bpobal ina iomlán agus ar an bpobal taobh amuigh den tír seo chomh maith.</P>
      <P>The American Jesuit priest and environmentalist, Thomas Berry, in a lecture in UCD some years ago remarked that, in economics the discontinuity between the human economy and the earth economy has been disastrous beyond measure, that a rising gross human product with a declining gross earth product is surely an absurdity and to preserve the integrity of the earth economy should be the first purpose of any economic programme.  In so far as the budget sets out an economic programme, or rather sets out to adjust the economic programme established by the Government's first budget, it is appropriate to stand back and look at the budget in the wider context that Berry suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the budget environmentally friendly?  It <Col N="1619" /> clearly is not.  The opportunity to introduce meaningful reform in taxation policy was talked about, but passed over.  There is a measure of welcome reform with regard to personal taxation, indicating that the Government is prepared to accede to public and political pressure and to change its strategy in this area from the course it charted for itself in the earlier budget.  However, the general flow of income to the Exchequer, which is what taxation amounts to, still comes too heavily from taxes levied on personal income and not enough from taxes levied on environmentally damaging processes.  We are still waiting for an incentive to discontinue the use of that symbol of our throwaway consumer boom, the plastic bag.  The ESRI, as well as the European Commission, has cast the cold eye of accountancy on the subject of green taxes and concluded that the replacement of a large proportion of PAYE with green taxes would enhance competitiveness.  What further arguments are needed to persuade us to set about the unilateral task of reforming our tax regime?</P>
    <P>Will the budget improve the quality of life of the poor?  This question must be considered in the context of the poor, and it is difficult to see how it does.  According to the 1998 United Nations human development report, poverty in Ireland is ranked second only to the United States within the OECD while Irish women are among the worst off of the 16 countries surveyed. Is a £3 per month child benefit increase a meaningful response to the documented prevalence of child poverty?  I do not believe it is.  Yet another budget has neglected to increase the child dependant increases for social welfare claimants. Is the Minister aware of the incidence of child poverty throughout the country?  It is difficult to believe he is.  Is he aware of hospital waiting lists?  He says he is, yet I receive letters every day from people who cannot get treatment although expensive medical machinery lies unused because of a lack of resources.</P>
    <P>Does the budget reflect the application of sustainability indicators?  This question was also talked about, but not acted upon.  Catastrophes such as those that befell Honduras and Nicaragua remind us of the necessity to develop sustainability indicators which, like poverty proofing measures, could be built into the process of creating the annual Budget Statement.  The absence of sustainability indicators in the framework of this budget is especially unforgivable, given Ireland's commitments with regard to greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    <P>Even without such indicators, let us take a reality check on the lot of Irish people.  The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, referred last evening to the movement of people from the west to the east of the country <Col N="1620" /> where congestion is leading to social and environmental problems.  Rural Resettlement, a voluntary group, is doing its best to redress this imbalance.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, when they were together, had a mandate to develop local economies and to maintain people on the land, but that mandate has not been honoured.  Children no longer go without shoes but they go without supervision, love or a sense of meaning and home.  The budget has failed to recognise issues of this sort, much less address them.  We must examine radical measures such as guaranteed basic income and value the kind of community work which has been taken for granted for too long. This budget has failed to take that reality check which needs to be undertaken urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This, like all budgets, has positive and negative aspects.  Governments tend to concentrate on a budget's positive aspects while Oppositions home in on the less positive ones. One of the most glaring omissions in the budget is the failure to deal with the housing problem.  I mention, particularly, the aspect of this question which will affect future Government policy.  It is generally recognised that the lack of access to affordable housing by a large sector of the community will drive wage claims upward and will fuel inflation.  If this trend continues we will face a serious problem.  The Government has done nothing to address or even recognise this issue. References have been made to previous Administrations, but there is no sense in speaking of what happened two years ago.  We are now in a different era with a different population.  The Government is more than one year in office.  This is the time for the Administration to address the issues presented to it and not as they were presented to its predecessors.  It should be remembered that it is at a great advantage which is neither accidental nor relates solely to the change of Government.</P>

      <P>The current staffing level in the agency is 1,078 including legal and national metrology staff who will transfer to the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  I have decided that 25 staff will transfer to Enterprise Ireland/Shannon Development, as appropriate, from the services to business section of FÁS.  The process for deciding who will transfer and when is currently being finalised.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is currently reviewing its organisation and structure within the policy framework I established for it.  The Enterprise Ireland joint council, representing staff, management and unions, has been closely involved in the process.  No decisions have as yet been reached on the total number of staff which the agency will require to carry out its mandate or whether this will result in a possible change in overall staff numbers.  I understand from Enterprise Ireland that no discussions have taken place with unions about voluntary staff redundancies.</P>
      <P>In the course of restructuring any organisation, the issue of changes in the status and role of staff inevitably arises as functions are redefined and personnel are transferred and/or promoted. Enterprise Ireland is having ongoing discussions with trade unions on a wide range of industrial relations issues.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the speed with which she wanted to establish Enterprise Ireland is now one of the problems affecting its staffing?  Is she aware that morale is extremely low and that there has been little or no progress in dealing with staffing issues, either grading or the possibility of voluntary redundancies?  Is the Minister aware that even the internal management structures for Enterprise Ireland are still not fully established?  Is it the case that there will be an announcement on that matter today?  When will the Minister ensure meaningful negotiations take place with staff as opposed to what was referred to as &ldquo;the slow bicycle race&rdquo; which is happening at the moment &mdash; half hearted consultation and inadequate, informal focus groups which are not working?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what Deputy Owen said.  Merging two agencies with many staff overseas and adding an element of the FÁS training to business section takes time.  I was anxious to enact the legislation as quickly as possible so a chief executive and a board could be appointed because it is their responsibility to put the new structure and organisation in place.  That has been happening.</P>
      <P>An extraordinary situation exists whereby there are 45 different pay levels or grades in the new organisation.  To rationalise and marry some of those and deal with the industrial relations issues which arise takes time and must be done through negotiation, discussion and dialogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the management team, the seven directors are in place and other changes are being <Col N="1622" /> made.  Of the directors appointed, two came from An Bord Tráchtála, four from Forbairt and one from Forfás through an open competition.  Other changes will be announced.  The board, under Pat Molloy and chief executive, Dan Flinter, have worked extremely hard and I am very grateful to them.  They have put an enormous effort into this task.  We want to get it right from the outset to have the right professional structure to help and support indigenous industry.  Had the legislation not been in place, the board could not have set about the task of doing this.</P>
    <P>One of the lessons we learned about restructuring following the Culliton report was that the long gap between the decision to do something and the subsequent enactment of the legislation caused a great deal of uncertainty and problems. It would have been better if An Bord Tráchtála had not been separated from the then Department of Enterprise and Employment in 1994.  If that had not happened, the type of structure we are now trying to establish would have been established then.  I accept an organisation which had to undergo changes in 1994 also has to undergo the same type of structural changes now and that adds to the difficulties.</P>

The need for proper consultation and consideration of the issues involved will be appreciated.  I have been informed the arrangements for the transfer are proceeding satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that there is more than just some uncertainty among staff?  Why in the four and a half months since the establishment of Enterprise Ireland, when a commitment was given that the National Metrology Laboratory would be transferred to NSAI, is it still under the aegis of Enterprise Ireland?  I do not accept the discussions are not proceeding quickly enough.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State also aware the National Metrology Laboratory was unable to participate in a recent Industry Ireland exhibition because of the uncertainty of its future and under what name it would operate?  Staff could not prepare any materials under the name Enterprise Ireland because they did not know if the next week they would be operating under the name NSAI.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?</P>
      <P>Is he further aware that, regarding the National Metrology Laboratory's involvement in the Euro-net system, the European network of metrology laboratories, it is being embarrassed and in danger of having its status diminished because it does not know under what name it will operate?  It has operated under the names IIRS, Eolas and Forbairt.  It now operates under Enterprise Ireland and will only for a short while.  Why is it not moved in the same manner as the legal metrology service?</P>

      <P>The key matter is that the National Metrology Laboratory has a job to do.  It provides <Col N="1624" /> a large range of services to meet today's measurement and calibration demands.  Change is happening and, while Enterprise Ireland is a new organisation, the National Metrology Laboratory is carrying out its job.</P>
      <P>It is intended to transfer it to the National Standards Authority of Ireland and negotiations are being held to this end.  The NSAI, like the National Metrology Laboratory, is an outstanding organisation with an international focus as well as a national delivery of service.  We have major plans for NSAI and the National Metrology Laboratory. Four and a half months is a short period in this regard.  There is no impediment to the delivery of this service to the people and we will ensure that continues to be the position.  We want to get this right and to ensure no obstacle will be put in the way of a smooth transfer of this service. No difficulty has been created in the delivery of this service, and ensuring the delivery of it is my key responsibility.  We will ensure, through the negotiation process, dialogue, communication and engagement, that there will be a smooth conclusion to the transfer of this service as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>That is correct.  Enterprise Ireland is involved in this and we want to make sure that everything is in order.  Enterprise Ireland has a contribution to make.  It is a new macro organisation which, as the Tánaiste pointed out, has brought streams of funding from three areas of activity.  This is not a simple matter.  We must get the budgets right, take account of human resources and ensure that there is not an adverse effect on the delivery of professional services across a range of areas of activities that are vital to the country.  The process is progressing satisfactorily and it will conclude positively.</P>

      <askee>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>the progress, if any, made on the issue of administrative simplification within Partnership 2000 commitments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitment in Partnership 2000 to introduce a national strategy on administrative simplification is being progressed through the Strategic Management Initiative.  A working group on regulatory reform prepared a report setting out the essentials of a national strategy on administrative simplification.  The Department of the Taoiseach, in co-operation with my Department, is formulating proposals regarding implementation of such a strategy and the Taoiseach will bring these proposals to Government for decision in early 1999.</P>
      <P>Progress has also been made on a number of the specific issues which Partnership 2000 included under the national strategy.  For example, on the commitment to remove the statutory audit, the Government has approved a draft scheme to amend the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, including the removal of the statutory audit from companies with a turnover below £100,000.</P>
      <P>On the commitment to establish a consultative forum, a small business users panel has been set up to explore how the administration of PAYE and social welfare by small businesses can be simplified.</P>
      <P>My Department has also been pursuing the recommendations in the report of the Task Force on Small Business relating to the reduction of administrative burdens.  To date, of the 37 recommendations relating to this issue contained in the report, 60 per cent have been fully or partially implemented.  In view of the passage of time since the task force reported I have asked the Small Business and Services Forum to review the outstanding recommendations in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that an interdepartmental committee in her Department has a report on this issue, which has not been published?  Will she also confirm that the administrative and regulatory environment in which small businesses operate is a critical component of competitiveness and that over-regulation stifles a great deal of business?  A business person wishing to comply with the essential aspects of Government imposed regulatory and legislative <Col N="1626" /> requirements relating to PAYE, PRSI, VAT, corporation tax, social insurance and employment legislation must comply with the 27 legislative provisions.  An employer in a small company employing eight people would have to spend 1,000 hours dealing with regulations to comply with the essential requirements laid down by the Government and such a business must meet certain requirements if it has a turnover in excess of £100,000.  That is a very low turnover for a small business and very few small businesses that employ any staff would have such a minimum turnover figure.  It is necessary that this matter is examined by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Perry.  The burden of implementing many of the laws we pass in this House is much greater on small businesses than on large businesses.  The taskforce report shows that the PAYE-PRSI system involves a burden on payroll costs that is four times higher on a small business relative to a large business. That is why this recommendation was made in chapter 6 of Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>A draft memorandum is being prepared on the various recommendations.  One of the key issues is whether we should establish a central unit attached to some Department with responsibility for this area.  The Taoiseach will bring that memorandum to Government in line with the agreement under the Strategic Management Initiative. I expect that will be done in early 1999 after which decisions and recommendations will be made and the report will be published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various groups meeting to discuss this matter.  My briefing notes do not refer to an internal report.  I am not aware of nor have I seen one, but if there is one I would be delighted to ensure it is published and made available to the committee of which the Deputy is a member or to any Member of the House.  We have the view of the Department on how we should move forward on this area and a review of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in this regard.  There are a number of Departments involved, including the Department of Finance. Each Department has its perspective on what it would like done in this area.</P>
      <P>We made a decision recently in the context of the forthcoming amendment to the Companies Act to change the audit requirement for small businesses.  There are many other issues that need to be dealt with.  Ideally we need an integrated tax and social welfare system, which would be a more simplified system.  Some of the decisions made yesterday will help in that regard.  A simplified system would help small businesses.  I will check if there is an internal report, and if there is one, I will report back to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider setting <Col N="1627" /> up a business test panel on which small business practitioners would be represented to examine the administrative consequences of new legislation on small businesses?  The results of such a process could be included in relevant memos to Government.  The administrative consequences of further legislation for small business could be discussed and such a process could be effective in simplifying the code of change in this area.  The SMI report is required and should be published as soon as possible.</P>

The users panel considers all these matters and advises accordingly.  We will publish the SMI report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to takes Questions Nos. 4 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that in my reply of 30 June 1998 to his question regarding a forum on the Amsterdam Treaty, I confirmed my intention to hold such a forum, which would debate how the enhanced protection in the Amsterdam Treaty could be translated into an action programme which will benefit European consumers. I am glad to report that the forum took place in October 1998 and was a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate regarding the development and enhancement of consumer protection.  A report of the proceedings of the forum is currently being prepared by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs, I am particularly interested in the enhanced commitment to consumer rights in Article 153 of the Amsterdam Treaty.  The treaty strengthens the provisions in the Treaty of Maastricht, <Col N="1628" /> which set &ldquo;a high level of consumer protection&rdquo; as an EU goal.  The new treaty specifically addresses protection and interests of consumers through the following commitments: protection of the health, safety and economic interests of consumers; promoting their right to information and education; and enshrining their right to representation.</P>
    <P>While these advances are very significant in themselves, a more important breakthrough has occurred in that consumer protection requirements must now be taken into account in defining and implementing all other Community policies. This will include trade, agriculture, food, and commercial policy, each of which in turn impacts on the lives and well-being of consumers.  This approach which, in effect, requires a consumer proofing of policies across a wide range of public policy, accords closely with my thinking, as Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs, on the way forward for consumer protection in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved by successive Governments in the area of consumer protection over the past 25 years.  A great deal of the activity has stemmed from our membership of the EU which has adopted a substantial body of consumer protection legislation, including directives on consumer credit, misleading advertising, product liability and food labelling.</P>
    <P>We have participated actively in the work at EU level during that time.  However, much remains to be done to ensure that consumer interests assume their proper place on the policy agenda and that our laws, structures and procedures are adequate to the task of defending and promoting the consumer across the full range of Government activity.</P>
    <P>Over the next two years a number of directives will be implemented on subjects such as food labelling, the protection of consumers' interests abroad, unit pricing and distant selling of goods and services.  Further proposals are in draft form, including an amendment to the product liability directive to include primary agricultural products, further food labelling proposals and a proposal on the distant selling of financial services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that, whereas redress concerning health, safety and economic interests is important, these matters are quite useless if the consumer is not in possession of information and education?  Would the Minister agree that it is important to have a truly financially independent body to supply information to consumers and to carry out research?  This is not the case at present and the Minister of State has not given any financial help to the Consumers' Association of Ireland, which is the only organisation that has such a role.  Can the Minister of State confirm my information that a half-hearted offer was made earlier in the year to give some help, but that strings were attached?  Has the Minister of State any plans to redress this problem, which is like a car with three wheels?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has quite rightly pointed out that I met the Consumers' Association of Ireland, at my request, earlier this year to see if I could assist it in any way.  I would not describe my involvement with them as having strings attached.  I simply outlined what stage we were at in the particular year and what was available through working with the European Commission. I subsequently wrote to Commissioner Bonino and raised the question of support for the CAI.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, I have already answered parliamentary questions on this matter.  I am anxious to see consumer organisations being strengthened and the voice of the consumer being assisted at that level.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Bonino addressed the forum on consumer issues in Dublin, which I initiated.  The voice of the consumer was one of the most important issues raised at that forum.  I agree with the Deputy that the position of consumers should be strengthened.  As Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs, my position would be strengthened if a strong voice was raised on behalf of consumers concerning the many issues I have mentioned.  I can assure the Deputy that whatever support mechanisms exist, particularly in working with the European Commission, will receive my backing.  The question of support for consumer organisations is likely to be a feature of the Commission's next three year action plan.</P>

We have had replies to parliamentary questions over the past 12 months, yet nothing has happened concerning consumer associations, which are not being supported by the Government.  They are in financial straits, but is the Minister of State aware of the danger?  Does he recall that he told me in reply to a parliamentary question that the Consumers' Association of Ireland has staff shortages?  What will the Minister of State do in the short-term so that it can survive?</P>

      <P>Much of the responsibility will lie with the organisation itself, which has come forward with certain proposals.  The Deputy is right in saying that it is my responsibility to try to find appropriate funding at EU level.  We have ensured a budget for five years, which has been agreed at 12.5 million ECU.  I met with the Consumers' Association of Ireland and I am anxious to meet with its members again whenever they wish to meet me.  I am anxious to support the association, but it must put its plans together as an independent organisation.  We have a newly appointed Director of Consumer Affairs also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many changes are taking place in this area and there is a large agenda for us to pursue.  This <Col N="1630" /> includes the question of the euro and a national code of practice on dual pricing.  Within Government I have also put forward a proposal to ensure that the new national agreement will have particular reference to a consumers' chapter.  There are many new proposals.</P>

      <Quest>the number of farm accidents on record for the first six months of 1998; the way in which this figure corresponds to the same period in 1997; the steps, if any, she has taken to improve farm safety; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with responsibility for the day-to-day enforcement of workplace health and safety legislation.</P>
      <P>A total of 13 fatalities in the agricultural sector were reported to the authority for the first six months of 1998.  For the same period in 1997 there were six reported agricultural fatalities. In relation to non-fatal accidents, 24 such incidences were reported to the authority for the first six months of 1998, while there were 17 reported non-fatal accidents for the same period in 1997.</P>
      <P>I should point out to the Deputy, however, that according to the authority, there is a significant and considerable under-reporting of non-fatal accidents in the agricultural sector and this fact should be borne in mind when examining the figures.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal concern, and that of the authority, at this increase in farm fatalities and accidents which is especially worrying given the improvements that had been made in recent years in this sector. It is also particularly tragic and poignant to see that six of the total fatalities so far this year have been children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture has always been a priority area of activity for the authority which carries out approximately 800 inspections per year in the <Col N="1631" /> agricultural sector.  gives talks to farm groups up and down the country, and makes its staff available to farmers through attendance at farm shows and exhibitions, including the national ploughing championships.</P>
    <P>In addition, the authority provides an extensive range of guidance literature and information on the control of farm hazards.  The authority has also established an agricultural safety task force, the members of which are drawn from the farming community itself and who are, therefore, best placed to offer guidance to the authority and to spearhead safety promotion activities.</P>
    <P>In human terms, the cost of farm accidents is enormous.  What must be remembered is that despite farming being a family business and the farm containing the family residence, a farm is still a high risk place of work and must be regarded with the utmost care and caution.</P>
    <P>It is essential that farmers assess all the risks before undertaking farm tasks and then put in place the necessary safety measures before attempting these tasks.  I would like to take this opportunity to urge all farmers who have not done so to draw up a safety statement identifying all the hazards, risks and appropriate safety measures and, where such safety statements exist, to keep them under regular review.</P>
    <P>In statistical terms significant improvements had been made both in 1996 and 1997 in relation to the number of farm fatalities.  However, 1998 has not been a good year so far and this serves to remind us that there is a constant need for vigilance and the continued promotion of farm safety. I would urge all farmers and farm workers to treat their work as the high risk activity it actually is, and to exercise constant care and vigilance in their work practices, especially so where there are children on the farm.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy to all the families who have suffered a bereavement through a farm accident this year.  My thoughts are especially with the families of the six children who so tragically lost their lives.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply on farm accidents and fatalities. There has been an incredible rise in accidents this year, involving a doubling of fatalities to 13, along with other non-fatal accidents.  Does the Minister agree it is specially appalling that six of these were children?  I remember hopping up on tractors, combine harvesters and so on as a child and helping out generally, but surely the Minister has an absolute responsibility to ensure these appalling figures relating to farm accidents and fatalities are dealt with much more vigorously.  It is part of his general remit in relation to health and safety, but so far, over 18 months, he has failed to get the resources he needed.  I did not notice any mention in the budget yesterday of extra facilities for the Department the three Ministers represent for more inspectors and a more vigorous approach generally.  In the past previous Governments mounted more successful and vigorous campaigns on farm safety.  Perhaps the three Ministers here have a responsibility to travel around the country to bring to the attention of people, particularly those in the farming industry, the importance of safety.  In the farming community, 800 inspections in the context of 140,000 units is derisory &mdash; it is not even 1 per cent.</P>

      <P>I reject the Deputy's case on resources.  He should compare the figures from my predecessor's time with the current figures and deal with facts.  We are dealing with a very tragic situation.  I have expressed my deepest sympathy particularly in respect of the loss of young children in farming accidents.  However, the facts are that I have secured an additional 20 staff for the Health and Safety Authority during my period in office.  I thank the Tánaiste in particular for her support in that area.  That was done by hard negotiation with the Minister for Finance in particular. I thank him also for his support.  It was possible to do that because of increased economic activity in general.  We must ensure adequate resources for the Health and Safety Authority which has responsibility for this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the agricultural sector, additional staff meant increased inspections for <Col N="1633" /> that sector proportionate to the situation in the past.  I state categorically that my involvement in getting increased resources was greater than that of my predecessor.  That is not to take away from the work of any former Minister with responsibility for health and safety.  Much of our work involves a hands-on approach and visiting parts of the country. I have worked closely with the agricultural community and with representatives of the IFA and other organisations to increase awareness.  As a former primary teacher I have also been involved in a number of programmes.  One was a competition on farm safety for school children which attracted 10,000 to 12,000 entries.  We have to get the message across to children on farms.</P>
    <P>A special agricultural safety task force has a number of schemes in place, and it is constantly looking for new ways of getting the message across.  I am helping it to get that message across. It is looking at safety statements on farms, a code of practice for children's safety on farms, tractor driving skills, training programmes and machinery safety courses.  There are ongoing discussions between myself and the chairman of the authority. I assure the Deputy of my personal interest in this.  If we can save one life, if we can prevent one accident, we will be doing a great service.</P>
    <P>There is much work to be done.  I join with the Deputy in highlighting the need to get the message across to all concerned that extra vigilance is required because a farm, like any other place of business, is a very dangerous place with all sorts of potential accidents waiting to happen.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.</P>
      <P>I share with Deputy Broughan and the Minister a horror at the increase in the number of accidents on farms, having only recently attended the funeral of a wonderful woman who got caught in a machine and was killed.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister have a breakdown of the causes of the 13 fatalities and injuries?  Is it possible to zone in on the most serious area of danger in farming?  Is it tractor accidents, falls into slurry tanks or some other type of accident?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the specifics on file but I can give the Deputy that information from recollection, because a report is sent to the Health and Safety Authority and to the Minister of the day.  The Deputy mentioned slurry pits. Many of those fatal accidents involved tractors.  I remember in particular the case in Wexford where two children sadly died in an accident involving a tractor.  The Deputy is right in saying there is a need to focus on specific dangers on the farm.  That is being done.  The IFA and other organisations, for example, the ICMSA, the ICA, Teagasc, ICOS, Macra na Feirme, Mitchelstown Creamery and many other organisations are involved in trying to get the message across.  I take this opportunity to thank them for that.  That type of co-ordinated effort, particularly to get the message across to children, is very important.  I <Col N="1634" /> will get a breakdown for the Deputy of the unfortunate circumstances in which people have died.</P>

      <P>My Department is represented on the steering committee which was established by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to oversee the examination of all of the planning issues arising in relation to large-scale retail development.  The principal tasks remaining for the committee are to liaise with the consultants, monitor progress and ensure the study and draft planning guidelines are presented to it within the agreed deadline.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances it was not necessary for my Department to make a submission to the committee. My Department's representation is keeping me informed of progress, particularly in so far as my Department's interests are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed to hear that news.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have a major input into this. It is critical that the Department should address all the issues relating to large-scale retail development, to identify in particular the amount and location of supermarket development, including proposed development in excess of 2,000 square metres.  Is the Minister aware, for instance, that Tesco in the UK is getting £22 per square foot and that here it is £11 per square foot, which shows the huge capacity that is here?  There is planned investment of £100 million by Tesco here.  Is the Minister aware that below-cost selling, which was banned under the 1987 directive which prevented &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; being operated, could be introduced as a trade-off for the reduction in planning size?  Tesco has stated that it will take only three years to bring its Irish supply chain into line with the UK model, and the UK model is certainly worth studying.  The Minister should have a major input into this study because it has serious implications for the creation of jobs.  She should identify in particular the areas for job creation.  There is a huge risk of jobs being lost.  In the context of a related question, own brand labelling, the Minister has a huge role.  I would ask her to look at this in a more serious manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands.  My Department is represented on the steering committee which assessed the various consultancies that made a submission to carry out the study under the terms of reference which essentially have to do with planning.  On foot of the recommendations planning guidelines will be introduced if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> My responsibilities in this area clearly relate to employment, to competition and to the rights of consumers.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and I have responsibility for consumer protection, for employment and for competition.  These are the issues that concern me.  Matters to do with planning regulations clearly are the responsibility of a different Minister.  However, under the existing legislation the Minister for the Environment and Local Government does have the power to restrict the scale and development of superstores or shopping facilities of this kind.  That is what he has done pending the outcome of this consultancy. When the consultancy report is available it will be referred to the steering committee. At that point I intend to make known my views about the matters that concern me.</P>
    <P>However, the terms of reference relate to planning, environmental issues, traffic and the viability of centres from the point of view of towns and urban renewal.  These issues come within the transport and physical planning responsibilities of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  Clearly, planning laws cannot be used to deal with consumer or competition issues.  If and when those issues arise, they must be dealt with through appropriate legislation either in the context of competition law or consumers' rights.  However, the planning legislation can be used to restrict largescale developments that have huge environmental, planning, transport and car parking implications.  Deputy Perry is aware of these implications.</P>
    <P>There are different interests involved.  In some places people want more choice and more branded products while in others they want to maintain the <i>status quo</i> of the local shop.  We must try to resolve those issues without interfering with competition or the rights of consumers. The most effective way to do that is to await the recommendations on planning and if they have implications for competition, consumers or employment, it will be my responsibility at that stage to take whatever action is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister honestly expect Members to believe she is so unaware of the implications of what the planning group is examining that she does not believe her Department should have an input at this stage, before any decisions are made about planning?  Her Department is responsible for enterprise, trade and employment.  If this committee makes a decision about planning regulations, it might be too late for an input from her Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister assure the House that she will tell her representative on this committee to take a more hands on and proactive approach?  If the decision on planning is made, there will not be an opportunity to do anything about the wider implications of superstores.  The horse will already have bolted.  Is the Minister not aware that her Department made the decision to allow <Col N="1636" /> Tesco, the first of the superstore companies to locate in Ireland, to trade here?  Is she aware that there are still many complaints about the fact that Irish jobs will be lost, Irish products are being removed from the shelves and that Tesco is not living up to the commitments it gave under EU regulations when it first arrived in Ireland?  The Minister must assure me that she has not lost the run of herself and forgotten what her Department is supposed to be doing.</P>

      <P>I am not disowning it.  However, the Minister, not the Department, made the decision.  He made the decision on the basis of the considerations I mentioned earlier.</P>
      <P>My Department is involved in the steering group but this is a consultancy of experts in planning, transport and roads.  My Department does not have such expertise.  The experts will carry out the study and will report to the steering committee on which my Department is represented. After that it will be a matter for political decision. The consultants will not make decisions; they will make recommendations.</P>
      <P>It is an international consultancy with widespread experience abroad and it has been asked to carry out a study within seven terms of reference. The next meeting between the steering committee and the consultants will take place on 15 December.  When the study is completed it will be discussed by the steering committee.  I will be involved at that stage because of my particular responsibility.  However, planning, transport and car parks are not the responsibility of my Department and we do not have expertise in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I sympathise with some of my colleagues' comments, I am glad the Minister will have direct involvement.  A number of recent surveys compared prices in retail multiple stores in Britain with those in countries such as France and Belgium.  The prices in France and Belgium were a great deal lower than British prices while in the United States they were even lower.  Retail prices in this country appear to be similar to those in Britain which, in many cases, appear to indicate outrageous profiteering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a competition point of view, is it constitutional to deem that stores can only be, for example, 3,000 square metres?  Is there not an onus on the Minister to consider competition and to ensure there is the maximum degree of competition?  When the current supermarkets developed <Col N="1637" /> about 30 years ago, they wiped out many local shops but there was movement on prices.  It is the Minister's responsibility to consider the retail pricing system from a competitive point of view and particularly to ensure that Irish consumers get the best possible deal and are not ripped off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, we wish to ensure that Irish consumers get a wide choice of high quality products at competitive prices.  The intense competition in the supermarket sector in the Republic has helped to keep inflation down.</P>
      <P>This issue is not so simple that it can be dealt with by restricting it to floor area.  Floor area is one of the elements being discussed in the context of trying to define how one can tax passive income.  One of the suggestions made by many people is to define it in terms of floor area.  That would encompass retail banks and other such institutions which nobody intended should benefit from 12.5 per cent tax.  Clearly they must benefit, because it is a standard rate, unless we can define passive income in these terms.</P>
      <P>However, there are enormous difficulties in taking that route.  Does it, for example, relate only to floor area that is available to the public or where shopping occurs?  Does it include warehousing where goods are stored or cafeterias or other such facilities?  Can one have a slight gap between the clothing or hardware sections and the supermarket section?  There are huge difficulties in defining this according to floor area.</P>
      <P>Every reasonable person wants competition and choice.  However, we do not want extremely large superstores which simply put others out of business or destroy the fabric of some of our medium sized or small towns.  One of the main issues is how to balance competition and consumer rights with the socio-economic issues that arise.  When the consultants examine it from a planning, transport, environmental and urban renewal point of view, it might be useful to refer the matter to a committee of this House.  The issues are extremely complex.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry has one perspective while others have a different one.  Some of the larger units in this city, such as Blanchardstown, Quarryvale, The Square in Tallaght and Cornelscourt, are among the busiest and most popular with consumers. It is not always easy to balance the various conflicts in this area.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government's decision to take the planning route is appropriate.  When Deputy Dempsey made his decision there were about 20 applications for large superstore developments throughout the country.  It would have been premature for the local authorities to have made decisions on them before the implications could be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the local authorities in Cork are objecting to each other with regard to superstore development?  Did she say she does not favour superstores or did I hear her correctly?  Has her Department carried <Col N="1638" /> out any studies on retail capacity, long-term consumer interest or the impact on long-term competitiveness of proposed superstore development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a study would be useful.  If one accepted the British definition of superstores, only one store would be necessary for our entire population.  Some of these stores have a population catchment of up to five million people. Clearly, I am not in favour of only one, two or three such stores around the country.  However, I am in favour of choice, variety, keeping inflation down and balancing the factors I mentioned earlier in the most realistic way possible.</P>
      <P>It probably would be a good idea to carry out such a study.  A study of the retail sector was carried out in the past and it might be a good idea to update it, in the context of the developments that are now occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is important to estimate the amount of retail development needed in Ireland during the next ten years?  Tesco's projected turnover for next year is £1.73 billion.  Given that £11 per square foot equals 25 per cent of the retail market, if it was increased to £16.50 per square foot this would mean an increase of up to 36 per cent of the Irish retail market.  The amount of floor space is adequate to serve and provide choice, variety and competitiveness as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>To be fair, my predecessor negotiated a deal with Tesco on behalf of Irish suppliers which it has implemented and we have been able to build on it.  Some Irish suppliers have got into the wider international Tesco chain. Sometimes one loses in one area and gains in another.  One of the terms of reference of the consultancy study will be what is needed from a planning, environmental and urban renewal point of view.  The best way to proceed is to await the outcome of that consultancy review and, following publication, to have consultations on its recommendations with all interested parties, including Deputy Perry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Although priority on access to FÁS programmes is given to long-term unemployed persons and the socially excluded, a wide range of FÁS programmes are generally available to anyone looking for a job.  For women, and men, who want to return to paid work after time <Col N="1639" /> spent working in the home, FÁS runs return to work courses in each of its regions.</P>
      <P>Within the range of FÁS programmes community employment is targeted at a particularly disadvantaged group of people, those whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or one parent family payment.</P>
      <P>The recent review of community employment by Deloitte &amp; Touche did not make any recommendations regarding expansion of eligibility to participate in the programme.  However, a Partnership 2000 working group composed of all the social partners and chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is considering access by women to labour market opportunities.  I have requested that access by widows to training and to jobs should be one of the issues considered by that group.</P>

      <P>Given the labour shortage, will the Minister agree &mdash; in view of recent figures supplied by the Minister and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on the number of women between the ages of 16 and 65 now in the active workforce &mdash; that by comparison with Scandinavia and other countries where 55 per cent or 56 per cent of women are available for work, we are talking about a relatively small group, some of whom may be lone parents, who are denied the opportunity to take up community employment schemes?  Will the Minister address this anomaly and ensure that whatever CE reform structure is adopted will cater for these women?  Will she address also the dependent wives who are not on the live register.  This issue was highlighted yesterday by the provision in the budget of £3 for senior women, the dependant allowances and so on.  Should not those women who do not have stamps have the opportunity, through community employment, to enter full-time employment?  The Minister has an obligation to do something about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy for what Deputy Broughan has said.  The most effective way to deal with dependent spouses would be through the individualisation of payments. Unfortunately we are a long way from that because of cost implications.  If the stay at home wife or dependent spouse takes up a job or goes into training her husband, as is frequently the case, has to pay more tax.  I am aware from my work at constituency level that this can become a source of anger in the family.  The only way round that issue is through the individualisation of payments. Moving down a tax credit route makes that achievable.  I am not saying it will be achieved in the lifetime of this Government, but that is what we should aim for on the tax and welfare side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community employment was introduced at a time of high unemployment.  Labour market conditions have changed enormously in recent years. <Col N="1640" /> The recent review by Deloitte &amp; Touche provides the focus for making some changes.  We should make some changes.  Obviously we want to continue to target the long-term unemployed.  Community employment, in addition to the experience it gives the long-term unemployed and lone parents, permits worthwhile work in the community to be done in schools and with voluntary bodies.  We are committed also to developing the social economy and to allocating 5,000 community employment places during the next year. I intend to enter into discussions, if not before Christmas, shortly thereafter, with various interested parties.  I would like to be more flexible about people who have been at home for years and who are aggrieved they cannot get involved in community employment.  Obviously this includes widows and widowers.  I would like to facilitate change with a view to bringing those on board.  However, I cannot give a commitment on this until we see what changes can be made.  As the Deputy is aware we are reducing community employment to about 37,500 places next year. The challenge is how to turn this around and how to concentrate our efforts over and above the long-term unemployed.  There are difficult issues to be addressed in that context.  I hope Deputies opposite will support the endeavours we will engage in shortly after Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister undertake to have discussions with her colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to look at the conditions for entry into community employment schemes, FÁS training and the plethora of back to work schemes, given that the conditions always specify that a person must have been unemployed for a fixed period, whether six months, 12 months or longer?  Women working in the home will never qualify once that is the condition.  Will the Minister make a recommendation whereby a certain number of years worked in the home would be the equivalent of 12 months being unemployed.  I suggest six months given that six months working in the home is a great deal harder than many of the periods of unemployment which men have to endure.  The problem will not be solved without taking a courageous step to change the conditions whereby women can re-enter training and community employment schemes.  Will the Minister examine this area to ensure we meet the needs for more employees.  It has been estimated we will need some 100,000 new employees.  The only catchment for such employees is from women not already in the workplace.</P>

In the context of community employment, on which we spend more than £300 million, we have an active labour market and an unprecedented number of requests for work permits from abroad.  Some 96 per cent of applications for work permits have been approved in the past year.  Employers are experiencing difficulty in finding employees either in Ireland or in the EU. There are opportunities to change and community employment is one resource.  In the context of making decisions on the Deloitte &amp; Touche report I would like to examine how we can encourage those women in the home who want to return to work, to access, as a short-term measure, community employment opportunities.</P>

The figure of 96,000 refers to people working outside the community employment sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are scaling back the numbers of people on community employment schemes in order to invest more money in training schemes and encourage people to enter such schemes so that they can access the opportunities that are being created.  The current situation in this area is very different to that which obtained when commitments were made under Partnership 2000 to create 41,000 places.  We must respond to changing circumstances and it would be unrealistic not to do so.  In light of changes that have occurred, we have an opportunity to revamp the scheme and redirect some of those involved into other <Col N="1642" /> areas of the social economy.  We must learn from our experience in recent years in terms of the output from community employment.  Up to 80 per cent of the participants on schemes have accessed jobs while in other schemes the take-up rate is very low.  Community employment was always intended to be a bridge between unemployment and gaining a job.  If it is not fulfilling that role for some categories of participants, it must be changed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any changes in community employment until we put together the total package. Because of commitments made in Partnership 2000, that will involve discussions with the social partners, particularly CORI and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I have had informal discussions with both groups and I look forward to more formal discussions in the near future.  When that happens, we will be able to make changes.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 44,000 widows and widowers in Ireland but I am not sure how many of them &mdash; I imagine it is relatively few &mdash; would like to access an opportunity of the sort to which Deputy Rabbitte referred.  However, the few who might wish to do so should not be prohibited under the strict criteria in place at present.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies and the House will be aware from replies to previous questions on this issue that detailed discussions have been ongoing for some time, involving our Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Attorney Generals office in particular, which are aimed at developing proposals for addressing the problems arising from the use of Irish registered non-resident companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his budget speech, the Minister for Finance clearly indicated that a package of measures under both company law and tax law, to deal <Col N="1643" /> effectively with this problem, is now close to finalisation.  This package will be submitted by us to the Government and it is envisaged that it will be announced with the publication of the companies amendment Bill, currently nearing completion, in the near future.  As indicated in reply to previous questions, the company law legislative proposals contained in the package will include provisions on directorships and improved enforcement-strike-off procedures.</P>

Will he inform the House whether he has in his possession more refined information in respect of the extent of this phenomenon?  Has the strengthening of the Companies Registration Office, in terms of the provision of new offices, the appointment of additional staff, significant investment in information technology, etc., enabled the office to diminish the extent of this phenomenon in this jurisdiction?</P>

      <P>With regard to the other questions posed by Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; a predecessor of mine in office &mdash; I must point out that the investment made and decisions taken to provide human resources, IT services and additional resources in the Companies Registration Office have proven of major benefit, not only in terms of managing indigenous companies but also in being able to focus on the issue in question and come to terms with it.  As a result of our efforts, we are pleased that the authorities in Britain are also focusing on this matter.  The actions taken in this jurisdiction and the actions proposed to be taken in Britain will assist in ensuring that we can expose, diminish and eliminate this problem in so far as is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a complex area and great efforts are being made in respect of it.  The package of measures to be put to Government will be vital and it will take an in-depth critical analysis on the Government's part to ensure that we get it right. <Col N="1644" /> Ultimately, the House will be involved in ensuring that proper legislation is introduced in this area.

      <P>I am always concerned by those who seek to use this country to use companies for illegal purposes, such as laundering money, etc. Public representatives, Members of the Oireachtas and anyone who has served in Government and had dealings with Europe know that Ireland is regarded as a country which operates a strict regime in terms of the law on taxation, etc.  In terms of our dealings with the International Financial Services Centre and the provision of State aids to it, the European Commission accepts that Ireland carries out its business in a straightforward manner.  The Commission has been flexible with us and has confidence in our ability to discharge our obligations. No one wants the country's reputation to be tainted.  We are pleased that the UK authorities have issued a directive to the authorities in Guernsey that action should be taken.  This will help minimise the problem here.  The Government is committed to tackling it in the legislation which is extremely complex.  I hope we will get it right.</P>

Deputy Broughan mentioned Guernsey and Sark on which there are 575 people some of whom hold 3,000 directorships.  We are trying to ensure that does not happen here.  I have only been dealing with this matter for 12 months in co-operation with the Tánaiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and with the tremendous support of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Attorney General and their officials.

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Last month I met representatives of the principal retail multiples to discuss growing concern among consumers at the perceived failure of the retail trade to reduce the price of meat on the shelves to reflect the historically low prices paid to farmers.  I made clear the Government's concern and stressed that profiteering at any point in the supply chain, either at retail level or at the processing stage, would be wholly unacceptable to me as Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs.  I also made it clear that the multiples must move quickly to restore consumer confidence in the value they are getting for meat and demonstrate that prices in the shops reflect the reduction at farm-gate level.</P>
      <P>The representatives whom I met pointed out that prices had come down to some extent and some envisaged further reductions.  I said that I would be monitoring the situation to see tangible proof that prices were on the way down.  I am pleased to note that food prices decreased in October due, <i>inter alia</i>, to falling beef, lamb and pork prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is Government policy to encourage competition and promote greater price awareness among consumers.  I have drawn the attention of the Director of Competition Enforcement to a recent debate in this House on the issue of food prices and have asked him to take such action as he considers appropriate.  I encourage consumers <Col N="1647" /> to be aware of competing prices and make the market work by making informed purchasing choices.</P>
    <P>I have conveyed my views on the role of the processing sector to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and I am awaiting a response from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister of State seek information from the representatives of the retail multiples on how they convey to consumers the profit content?  Senator Quinn indicated at the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that at least one company was prepared to do this.  In a recent survey of prices in France, Belgium, the United States, etc., <i>The Sunday Times</i> found significant evidence of massive profiteering on the part of the large British retail multiples.  Some of the prices were not much different.  Is it the case that the Irish consumer is being ripped off?  When the farming organisations protested in Dublin recently about the fall in farm incomes it appeared to me and many others that they had an unanswerable case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to each of the companies involved to get the message across.  They indicated that their margins had not increased, that the price of the less expensive cuts of meat had dropped more than the price of the more expensive cuts, and that processors were not passing on the full reductions.  I made the point forcefully that the difference in price at farm-gate level and on the shelves presented a problem.  They argued, however, that account had to be taken of other costs, including transport costs.  When Minister, Deputy Yates referred a complaint about processors to the Competition Authority.  I have asked it to examine the role of retailers.  If anyone has information they should pass it on to the authority which is independent in the exercise of its functions.  The CSO figures point to a reduction in October.  I am convinced from my study of this, and I have listened to all the parties, that the fall in prices will continue.  That is my hope.  It is a huge job for all of us to increase awareness and I will continue my efforts on this issue.</P>

      <P>For people watching Teilifís na Gaeilge &mdash; boring and dull as we are, because we are the best entertainment on in comparison to rival channels &mdash; I ask the Minister what has he done?  What has happened as a result of all of this?  That was not clear from the Minister of State's answer.  I was relieved like the rest of consumers when I read the headline &ldquo;Kitt Calls in Supermarket Chiefs&rdquo;.  What did the Minister do when he called them in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any recognition that we are in danger of pricing ourselves out of competition, in this city at least, for which I can talk best?  Prices are spiralling.  It is not just a danger to inflation but to our attractiveness as a location for visitors. <Col N="1648" /> This is an extremely expensive place.  What is the answer to the farmers' question?  They are selling the raw material at a certain price and yet there does not seem to be any serious diminution of the price in butcher shops and supermarkets.</P>
    <P>The Minister must forgive me for being facetious &mdash; I know it is easier to talk about it than to do something about it.  Is there any hope?  Is there any real expectation for the consumer that prices will come down?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not do any differently to what Deputy Rabbitte did as Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs.  I recall when he called in various interested parties and I know he had occasion to speak to multiples in his time. As a Minister of State with responsibility for consumer affairs what does one do but represent the interests of the consumer?  I put the case, which was evident to me and I am convinced it has not changed, that there was a huge disparity between the farm gate price and the price on the shelves.</P>
      <P>Certain issues were raised during those discussions which I referred to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh.  Both of us have responsibility &mdash; he on the processor side, which he is looking at.  The Competition Authority is also involved and I referred the debate in this House to it.  The trend shows a drop in prices.  Special offers are put in place by the various retailers, one of which was referred to by Deputy Broughan who recently spoke in committee about what his organisation was doing about this.</P>
      <P>The bottom line is competition.  We have no control in this area since we abolished statutory price control &mdash; we never had any on the price of meat, with the exception of chickens.  I must inform the public as best I can.  I make no apologies for doing that or for bringing in multiples.  I will do so again if necessary.  In the meantime, my Department is closely monitoring this, as is the new Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>

      <P>At the adjournment I was about to illustrate the areas the Government seem to have forgotten in the budget.  There are approximately 50,000 extra people in this country who are of economic import and have a huge beneficial economic impact.  This is the number of returning emigrants who have jobs in Ireland, particularly in technological areas.  The result of this is that they need houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather peculiar that at a time when the Government should be able to plan for the next five years, it completely ignored the existence of such people and that they need housing.  The Government should have included some benefits in the budget which would have given such <Col N="1650" /> people an indication that their plight had been recognised by those in power.  This did not happen. It is ridiculous for the Government to crow that it has increased last year's local authority housing allocation by 20 per cent.  That means nothing.</P>
    <P>There is no sense in referring to what took place here two, three, four or ten years ago.  We must recognise what is happening now.  There are about 50,000 people on various waiting lists.  The Minister would do well to listen carefully as there is a price to be paid for not listening.  Unless the Government does something about this in the course of the year, we will have the ridiculous situation of people emigrating because they cannot find a house &mdash; unless people live in trees which will happen unless the Government does something.</P>
    <P>What can the Government do?  It can provide more local authority accommodation which looks after one part of the market.  About 55,000 to 65,000 people are receiving rent assistance or are registered, by one means or another, as in need of housing.  There is no sense in the Government saying the family structure has changed and it cannot cater for that.  We have a duty to cater for it and it must be catered for now.  There was a daft example in my constituency in the last year where a husband and wife earning £20,000 per year were living in caravans.  This is completely wrong.</P>
    <P>The Government needs to look at itself in the cold, hard light of reality.  While the budget may have been good from a public relations point of view, with £3 given to the old age pensioners, £3.50 to the adult dependant, etc.</P>

      <P>That was good PR.  However, many people have serious problems which are not being addressed.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that in the coming year, the number of housing starts will be in the region of 4,000 or 5,000.  I do not know what kind of mathematics the Government used.  However, if one stretches it any way one likes, one does not have to be an Einstein to figure out the housing requirement will not be met in ten years, at the present rate. The Government has completely underestimated the impact of the increasing population.  That has been the case last year and this year.  Last year the budget concentrated totally on the upper income groups and they decided on a huge give away in that area.  I said at the time that if it succeeded, it would be the first time.</P>
      <P>A factor to which little recognition has been given is that inflation has risen considerably in the past 12 months.  The rate of inflation has almost doubled.  It is a serious problem.  This is the country with the highest inflation rate in the euro zone.  It has risen by 30 per cent.  The Minister for Education and Science must be alarmed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not want to hear these facts.</P>
      <P>In this budget nothing has been done to address the housing needs of the people in the average income area, with the exception of a tax concession which works out at about £6 per week net.  There are serious problems to be addressed in that regard about which the Government does not know or care.  I will leave that up to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Education has been much talked about in this House in recent years.  It is true that in the past investment was made in the educational sector in a way which paid dividends over a long period.  It is imperative that Government takes account now of the investment needs of education ten, 15 or 20 years down the road.  I have not seen evidence of that.  In fact, the evidence to date is that the number of teachers in certain towns and villages is being reduced in line with the decline in the number of children.  The Department of Education and Science sees that as an opportunity for reducing the number of teachers and redeploying them.  The Minister needs to look again at that policy.  The dividend to be reaped is not a positive but a negative one.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to lecture the Minister on educational issues but I regard myself as being reasonably capable of recognising what is happening around me and of listening to what I hear from teachers and parents.  There needs to be a careful evaluation of the areas deemed to be disadvantaged, both urban and rural, with a view to ensuring that the educational requirements of the people of those areas is being met fully, and that the children from those areas have a reasonable chance of having their further educational needs met and a chance of employment at later stage. That is not being addressed.</P>
      <P>There are still plenty of schools which are substandard in terms of their facilities, the number of prefabs, the number of children who are confined within a narrow space, and the failure to comply with health and safety requirements and fire regulations.  I do not wish to burden, upset or annoy the Minister with this unfortunate litany but his reaction does not worry me.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Minister needs to recognise that his party was also in Government before.  He should not blame somebody else.  He must accept responsibility at some time for something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand how a budget could have come before this House with so little emphasis on health requirements.  Perhaps the Minister for Health and Children had been put in a trance by the Minister for Finance, the rest of the Government or somebody else.  He certainly must not <Col N="1652" /> have been concentrating on what was happening. He continually falls into the same trap into which the Minister for Education and Science fell a moment ago, referring to what was there last year and an increase of perhaps 10 per cent or 20 per cent.  He is forgetting that the demands have increased and he is not preparing for the requirements of today or tomorrow.  It is difficult but I feel sorry for the Minister for Health and Children because he must surely begin to recognise that he is surrounded by people who do not have his best interests at heart, namely his Government colleagues.  They have let him down, they have failed to recognised his existence.  The long waiting lists are getting longer and the miserable amounts of extra money provided in the Estimates this year are totally inadequate to deal with the requirement.  I need not evaluate the various needs in the health area.  The Minister for Education and Science knows full well about it from his constituency.  I spent a little time in that area recently and I was appalled at the health needs there.  I presume he is shocked that I should say that to him but if he is not aware of the problems, then I have even more serious worries.</P>

      <P>We are ready at all times.  He should not assume that the budget will see him through an election campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As someone who spent 16 or 17 years as a member of a health board and a short time as Opposition health spokesman, I see serious problems in terms of the failure to address requirements in the health area.  It relates to the increased need arising from the growing population. Everybody talks about the changing demography but there are other factors.  There is an increased need for services in the hospital and caring areas and for medical services generally and that need is not being met.  That is why there are 3,000 or 4,000 or 5,000 on waiting lists all of the time.  It is unfair that people should have to wait a year, two years or three years.  The Minister seems stunned that people should have to wait for two or three years but it is a fact.  It is a sad reflection on a country which is supposed to be the breeding ground of the Celtic tiger.  I am amazed that no recognition was given to this factor in the preparation of the budget because there is no chance that the kind of moneys made available will address the problems of waiting lists and the needs of carers for people who have physical or sensory disabilities.  One can get little <Col N="1653" /> relief for £200 &mdash; it amounts to a couple of days. I do not know whether the Government is trying cod itself or cod the rest of us but somebody is being codded.  The Government is far short of identifying the market and meeting the needs in that area.  I respectfully suggest that somebody as a matter of extreme urgency should look carefully at the hospital bed requirements and the care requirements, that is institutional care, respite care and back up for carers.</P>
    <P>These areas need to be looked at individually and collectively and a package needs to be put together which will provide some degree of hope for people.  We must acknowledge that society is changing.  People who previously became dependent, docile, remained at home.  We now have an enlightened society and people who want to participate, to get out and help themselves and others.  There is no reason the Government should not be prepared to do that.  I would give this budget one out of ten in this area &mdash; a bad performance.  In fairness, I hope the people give the Government time to improve in this area. God help it if it intends to improve in ten years time because it will be long gone.</P>
    <P>I would like to introduce the issue of child care which I know is an embarrassing one and where a great deal of expectation and hype was created. While on the other side of the House I listened to lectures from this side on how imperative it was to address that issue.  That was two years ago. I thought those who gave those lectures knew what they were talking about and would do something about it when they got into Government, which they did not expect to happen.</P>
    <P>Now they are in Government they seem to have lost their way and do not intend to address the issue which required such attention in the past.  What is the problem?  Will another review group spend a few years looking at the issue after which time they will get another election out of it?  I would not depend on getting another election out of it.  The people can get very volatile on such issues and are annoyed about it at present.</P>
    <P>The reason for this change is that people's lifestyles are changing and more people are going out to work.  With the price of houses, they will have to go to work well into the future.  It is imperative from the point of view of the Government relating to the people, that it acts instead of taking all the glory for what it sees as the positive elements in the budget.  It should address that issue.</P>
    <P>Agriculture does not feature very high on the agenda under the present Administration because it did not feature very much in the budget.  It provided nothing for the food producing sector which is in serious danger and threatened with extinction.  I assume someone in Government was inspired and said the best way to treat that problem is to ignore it because that is what happened in the budget.  No recognition was given to agriculture in the budget.  I presume the Government has decided agriculture does not have a future because it is not adopting a positive attitude to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> I often wonder what way a Government operates. I have come to the conclusion it operates on the basis of a decoy in that it flies a kite to distract people's attention from the real issues.  I am not sure what the decoy is in this case.  A week ago much attention was given to rejoining the Commonwealth. Does that not conjure up great images for Fianna Fáil?  I can imagine the grandson of the former leader and founder of the party all dressed up at the Court of St. James returning to the fold.  I can imagine the assembled multitudes there and the grins on their faces.  What a shock it would be for the unfortunate people in the Court of St. James.  Worse still, the poor Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, would have to dress up in full regalia with silk and satin pantaloons and all the trappings which go with it as he enters the court.  I look forward to that day and would like to be a fly on the wall to see what it would be like.  What about the poor Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen?  Imagine the humiliation of having to enter the court in that garb.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen some reference in the Budget Statement or the Financial Statement for the year of the Government's intentions as regards the Commonwealth and its future relations with it.  I recall when there was a certain antipathy towards the Commonwealth from that quarter.  Perhaps the budget was the decoy and the Commonwealth was the real issue, or maybe it was the other way around.  Perhaps the Commonwealth was the decoy to deflect people's attention away from a budget which recognises some people but refuses to recognise the needs of a large group of people who are looking to Government for support, particularly those in the housing, education, health and agricultural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I enjoyed Deputy Durkan's contribution, but I assure him there was no need for a decoy in terms of this budget.  We want people to focus on it because it is perhaps the most historic budget in a long time, particularly in terms of personal taxation.  It is an historic, reforming and radical budget, as most objective commentators described it, particularly on the tax front where a significant change has taken place.  The move towards tax credits will be more egalitarian and will facilitate future Governments in targeting resources in a more effective manner, particularly at those on low incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Minister for Finance on an outstanding budget, for using the opportunity well to effect radical change on the tax front, for bringing in a comprehensive social inclusion package which embraces <Col N="1655" /> health, education and social welfare and for keeping strong fiscal control over the situation and moving to reduce the national debt in a substantial way.  Future generations will pay tribute to the Minister for that particular initiative because it gives us sustainability over the years in terms of social progress and the many social inclusion programmes we are promoting.  If times get bad or if there is reduced economic growth, it will be better to have to pay back less in debt repayments on an ongoing annual basis.  That is perhaps the best guarantee of keeping our social services in tact and of growing them on a gradual basis.  In terms of the health budget, I refute Deputy Durkan's remarks.  There has been substantial investment in health which will facilitate considerable investment in the waiting list initiatives.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to outline to the House the impact of the budget on education policy, particularly in terms of educational disadvantage. The issue of educational disadvantage was mentioned by the Minister and I am pleased to outline the details of the extra resources available to tackle educational disadvantage over the next two years.</P>
    <P>On top of the Estimates volume published last month, yesterday education was allocated an additional £10 million in 1999 and £19 million in the year 2000 specifically to target educational disadvantage.  This funding, combined with the other extra funding already provided for in the Book of Estimates, means I am in a position to announce a total of £57.2 million in new expenditure targeted solely at disadvantage over the next two years.</P>
    <P>This is a comprehensive plan which far outstrips any comparable allocations previously provided. I will outline the details of the initiatives which this extra funding will enable us to implement.  I hope to be able to add further to this package in the context of future budgetary discussion.  As a result of this extra funding, 450 new teachers will be appointed effective from next September, split evenly between first and second levels.  They will all be used to address issues of educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>While other allocations have yet to be decided, two priority areas will be addressed.  Every school at primary and second level will have a remedial teaching service available to it from next September. Every disadvantaged school at first and second level will have a home-school community liaison service available to it from next September. A total of 225 new primary teachers will be appointed as a result of this programme.  In addition, extra funding will be provided to schools for part-time teaching hours.  These extra teachers are separate from the demographic dividend for 1999, which will be allocated during next year.</P>
    <P>From next September a remedial teacher service will be available to all primary schools.  All schools currently without a service will receive a <Col N="1656" /> service in line with the recommendation that each teacher should deal with approximately 30 pupils in need of the service.  Mainstream schools with a pupil teacher ratio of below 10:1 and which currently have no service may apply for a service where they can demonstrate the needs of their pupils.</P>
    <P>Home-school-community liaison teachers provide a valuable service in many schools serving disadvantaged areas.  The allocation of additional teaching posts as part of this programme, shared in the case of smaller schools, will ensure that every disadvantaged school will have access to this service from next September.  That service was established by the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, in 1991.  It was not consistently supported over recent years with the result that there are still many disadvantaged schools without a home-school liaison service.  We must get the fundamentals right in terms of tackling educational disadvantage.  The home-school liaison programme is one of the key programmes to do that, in conjunction with the remedial service.</P>
    <P>A total of 225 new second level teachers will also be appointed as a result of this programme. Combined with a significant change to the manner of dealing with over quota staffing in secondary schools, these new teachers will enable the move towards the provision of an automatic remedial resource in all schools and home-school-community liaison in all disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>The new package will be resourced by allocating an additional teaching provision to schools which are within quota and lack the appropriate remedial and home-school provision.  In the case of schools with over quota teachers who might otherwise be re-deployed, this resource will be utilised in the first instance to meet the remedial and home-school needs of the school.</P>
    <P>Following the implementation of the above package, some schools will have on their staff over quota permanent teachers.  In deciding on whether these teachers come within the redeployment scheme, a ratio of 18:1 will be utilised.  The impact of this is that schools will be allowed to retain teachers who might otherwise have been placed on the redeployment panel.  This will give schools greater certainty in relation to the utilisation of these permanent teachers pending the occurrence of retirements.</P>
    <P>I have already announced the major package of automatic entitlements for many children with disabilities.  This package, which will cost £8 million over the next two years, deals comprehensively with resource teaching and child care assistance. It is now intended to go further and to provide for escorts and safety harnesses for all children with disabilities travelling on school buses.  This move will cost £3.4 million in the next two years.  I cannot believe this funding was not provided in recent years for children with disabilities travelling on school buses.  It should have been done a long time ago and I am glad this budget has provided the resources to enable us <Col N="1657" /> to do it.  I am also glad the budget provided an additional £50,000, over and above that provided for in the published Estimates, for the Association for Children with Learning Difficulties which does such effective work for children with dyslexia throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Government has placed a high priority on the establishment of a national educational psychology service.  This service will play a vital role in helping to identify the special educational needs of children.  Some £1.5 million is being allocated for the establishment and initial staffing of the service over the next two years.  This is in line with the recommendations made by a steering committee which I established last year to report on the feasibility of establishing a national educational psychology service.  It recommended the appointment of 30 psychologists per annum over the next four years to meet the needs throughout the country.  This funding will meet those needs over the next two years.</P>
    <P>To help schools in disadvantaged areas to more effectively meet the needs of their students, an initiative will be put in place to assist them in developing the school plans and to provide for additional support for teachers.  This will cost £2 million over the next two years.  The feedback from many of the pilot projects introduced, such as Breaking the Cycle and Youthstart, shows that the key issues, apart from pupil-teacher ratios, are planning and in-service for all teachers in schools.  We must provide comprehensive resources for teachers and schools, particularly designated disadvantaged schools, so they can plan their approaches and strategies properly.</P>
    <P>An effective programme in substance abuse education for primary schools has already been piloted.  This should now be introduced into all primary schools and, as a result, I am providing £1 million for this purpose.  Some £400,000 is being provided for the purchase of equipment for special needs teachers.</P>
    <P>The Government's full policy on early education will be contained in a White Paper which I will publish next year.  I have already received the report of the National Forum for Early Childhood Education which I established earlier this year.  For the first time ever in the history of the State, we brought all the various players together under the one roof.  As a result, we have a comprehensive report which will lead to the publication of a White Paper.  In the interim, I will provide £1.2 million for special initiatives on early education.  It is intended that these will focus on early education for children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>It is a key policy aim of mine to increase the number of traveller children benefiting from education provision.  I have already established a representative group to advise me on this area.  As an encouragement to second level schools to meet the needs of local traveller children, a new capitation payment similar to that available at primary level will be introduced from January. This will cost £300,000 over the next two years.</P>
    <P>Increasing the number of children who complete <Col N="1658" /> the senior cycle is a key policy objective of the Government.  On top of already announced initiatives, special targeted interventions in areas with particularly low completion rates will be implemented.  Some £1.5 million has been allocated for this purpose.  The Department has undertaken considerable research in this area. We know where the retention rates are low and where there is a need for specific targeted intervention in areas of educational disadvantage to increase the retention and completion rates in those second level schools.</P>
    <P>The high level of functional illiteracy among adults is of major concern to the Government. Having doubled funding for literacy programmes in 1998, a further £3.2 million has been allocated for the next two years.  Last year there was a £2 million increase on the £2 million already available. Comprehensive funding is now being provided for adult literacy.  In addition, we are providing £1.6 million for new part-time options in Youthreach and VTOS programmes to facilitate both young people and adults, who are outside the mainstream system, to return to education on a modular or part-time basis to secure badly needed qualifications.</P>
    <P>A number of innovative capital projects focused at areas of significant disadvantage will be funded over the next two years.  The details of these projects, which will cost £7 million, will be announced in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Total additional funding of £6.9 million will be allocated over the next two years to tackle issues of educational disadvantage in third level.  This will have three key elements.  Some £1.5 million will be targeted at addressing the issue of non-completion of courses in important parts of the third level system.  This problem is believed to be particularly experienced by students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  We will work with third level institutions to plan the appropriate strategies and to make the relevant resources available so that we have an impact on attrition rates in third level.</P>
    <P>Some £2.4 million will be provided to fund an extension of the maintenance grants scheme so that all independent mature students will now qualify for the higher, non-adjacent, rate of grant from the next academic year.  That is an important initiative for mature students.  It was an anomaly and a discrimination which was there for some time and was creating an obstacle to independent mature students returning to third level education.</P>
    <P>Some £3 million will be allocated to promote access to third level among students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including people with disabilities. This programme will have an impact in terms of added supports and initiatives which some third level institutions have already embarked upon by encouraging second level students in disadvantaged areas to enrol in and become familiar with third level programmes.  We will also increase hardship funds in a number of institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> Within the next ten days, I will announce the details of a once-off special initiative in the area of educational disadvantage which will cost £6.5 million.  As an essential part of the implementation process, my Department will put in place a new co-ordination structure to ensure the effectiveness of our initiatives on educational disadvantage. This package represents the largest ever concentrated funding for tackling educational disadvantage. It comprehensively covers areas from early education to adult literacy and will put major resources into employing more teachers, the most important educational resource available. I pay tribute to Deputy McCreevy who has made a huge commitment to education since his appointment and made possible many major initiatives over the past 15 months by the provision of substantial resources.</P>
    <P>This began with the educational and technology investment fund of more than £250 million. There have also been a number of significant increases in the primary capital programme which now stands at £55 million, it was £27 million in 1997.  The Minister increased the second level capital programme to £60 million this year, compared with £33 million in 1997.  Likewise, two weeks ago we announced an historic research and development package totalling £180 million which will put Ireland at the cutting edge of research and innovation and have a significant impact on economic competitiveness.  There is also a significant investment package in educational disadvantage over and above many of the other initiatives I announced in terms of investment in education.</P>
    <P>Through the extra allocation of funds, combined with the resources allocated in the Estimates, this budget goes a long way to meeting many of the needs within the education system.  I acknowledge that we will continue to have some distance to travel.  However, most objective analysts would agree that the Minister for Finance has shown a genuine and sincere commitment to education in terms of the priority he has given it and through the provision of resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Martin for sharing his time.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This is a positive and progressive budget which will build for the future.  The principle aims of the budget are: to sustain a viable economy; to effect major personal tax reform and to plan for the longer term.  As the Minister pointed out, he is the first Minister for Finance in more than 50 years to bring in an overall budget surplus and he has availed of the opportunity to benefit those who have not done as well as most in recent years, particularly the old and the low paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In delivering fairness, the Minister did not abandon prudence.  The world economy is in a volatile state and the open nature of our economy and the high level of foreign investment are reminders that economic booms do not last forever. <Col N="1660" /> Our success should not blind us to the fact that we still have a large national debt.  For this reason, it would be foolish not to use this opportunity to reverse our habit of adding to that debt year after year.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget the Minister announced substantial increases in personal social welfare rates for older people.  In this budget he announced an increase of £9 per week for a couple in receipt of an old age pension.  This will comprise an increase of £6 per week in the full personal rate of old age pensions and £3 per qualified adult.  As a result, the weekly payment to a couple over 66 years of age and in receipt of a contributory old age pension will increase to £148.90, an increase of £15.50 in two budgets.</P>
    <P>Other personal social welfare rates will be increased by £3 per week and qualified adult allowance will be increased by £2 per week. Additional increases are being provided on personal rates for those in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.  From next September, child benefit rates will be increased by £3 per month for the first two children, and by £4 for the third and subsequent children.  These increases will result in payments of £161 for families with four children.</P>
    <P>The carers allowance scheme is being improved.  An additional payment of £200 will be paid each year as a contribution to respite care and the free telephone rental allowance will be extended to all recipients.  The scheme will be extended to cover carers of children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  Members are aware of the representations made on this issue over recent years and I welcome these new measures.</P>
    <P>The scope of this scheme will be extended to include recipients between 16 and 65 years of age who are in receipt of a qualified social welfare payment.  The absolute requirement that carers live in the same house as those being cared for will be modified, as will the full-time care and attention conditions.  This is a step in the right direction.  We have seen cases where people caring for old people were living next door or close by.  Hopefully, this will now be modified.</P>
    <P>The weekly income limits for family income supplement, a valuable support for families in low paid work, will be increased by £8.  Many farm incomes have been badly affected by bad weather and falling prices.  The budget is providing for a revamping of the smallholders unemployment assistance scheme at a yearly cost of, approximately, £15 million.  Full particulars will be included in the 1999 Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>An additional £25 million has been allocated for on-farm investment programmes and £110 million was made available for headage payments next year.  There has also been an allocation of £2 million to allow for the reopening on the installation aid scheme.  This is welcome as many young farmers were looking forward to the extra money which would help them.</P>
    <P>The Government has made £10 million available <Col N="1661" /> to deal with fodder difficulties being experienced by some farmers.  The details of the scheme are being finalised by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Payments will be directed at sheep farmers with mountain grassings, suckler cow producers and small dairy farmers in the worst affected areas based on a Teagasc survey published in September.</P>
    <P>At present, more than 7,000 farmers are in receipt of £33 million annually under the smallholders assistance scheme available to all farmers on low incomes.  The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will intensify its information initiatives at local level to increase awareness of the scheme and to emphasise its applicability to farmers.  In addition, the scheme is being examined with a view to increasing its relevance to farming families.  In this context, due account will be taken of the difficult income situation on certain farms arising from weather and market-related conditions.</P>
    <P>Direct income payments accounted for 48 per cent of agricultural income in 1997.  These payments play a significant role in supporting farm incomes and will do so again in 1998.  This is sometimes forgotten when comparisons are made with previous difficulties in agriculture.  The fact that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, secured Commission agreement to the advance payment of 80 per cent of the suckler cow and special beef premia in 1998, will provide a significant boost to direct payments this year.</P>
    <P>Already in 1998, outstanding progress has been made in delivering payments to farmers.  Some £653 million has been paid under the various headage and premium schemes, of which £353 million relates to payments made under the 1998 schemes.  Payments under REPS and the early retirement schemes amount to £108 million and almost £50 million, respectively, so far this year.</P>
    <P>The charter of rights for farmers sets very specific targets for the payment of grants under headage and premium schemes.  It is the Government's intention to meet those deadlines in 1998.</P>
    <P>Live exports from Ireland to EU and third countries are vital to maintaining competition in the cattle trade and sustaining farm incomes.  The seasonality of the livestock trade in Ireland makes market access for live exports particularly critical during the back end of the year when large numbers of weanlings come off farms. Deputy Walsh is to be congratulated for consistently recognising the importance of promoting live exports and has delivered in a number of areas to ensure market access for our cattle to EU and third country markets.</P>
    <P>The availability of shipping services to transport cattle and other livestock to export markets is a critical factor and it is worth recalling the difficulties experienced in 1997.  The VAT rebate is being increased from 3.6 per cent to 4 per cent from 1 March 1999.  The rate change will ensure <Col N="1662" /> that farmers continue to be compensated in full for the VAT they bear on their business inputs. The change will be worth almost £11 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The general stock relief for farmers which is set at 25 per cent per annum without clawback is due to expire on 5 April 1999.  It is being renewed at the same level for a further two years to 5 April 2001.  The stock relief for young trained farmers which is available at 100 per cent without clawback for a two year period to qualifying farmers is due to expire on 5 April 1999.  It is also being renewed for a further two years to 5 April 2001. Both measures will cost £1.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The measures to re-open farm investment schemes are on top of a net increase of 19 per cent for agriculture in the Book of Estimates for 1999 which includes a significant increase in the REPS allocation which is increased by 21 per cent to £176 million in 1999 and the reopening of the control of farmyard pollution, dairy hygiene and installation aid schemes.  In excess of £40 million is being allocated to farm investment schemes next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>All these measures taken together acknowledge the key significance placed by the Government on our largest indigenous industry. This high level of support will help restore confidence among the farming community after what is accepted as a very difficult year for the sector.</P>
    <P>Capital spending of £15 million has been allocated for the provision and upgrading of FÁS training and community enterprise facilities in areas of urban unemployment, bringing the total to £21.7 million this year.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the forthcoming UN International Year of Older Persons, the income guidelines used to establish qualification for medical cards for persons aged 70 years and over will be doubled over the next three years, beginning with an increase of one third in the coming year.  The Government is providing £1.5 million for the development of youth services on top of the published provision of £13.3 million.</P>
    <P>In view of the difficulties many people, especially those on low incomes, are facing in relation to housing, local authority and social housing programmes were set at £269 million in 1999.  This is an increase of £45 million or 20 per cent on this year.  The increased funding will allow 600 extra local authority starts to bring the number of units to 4,500, the highest level of local authority houses since 1986.  A special allocation has been made available to local authorities for hostels for the homeless by raising the £2 million already allocated to £4 million from the previous year's Estimate.  An extra £3 million has been provided for the disabled person's grant which will bring the spending on this scheme to £8.5 million next year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> I also welcome the changes in tax allowances. The single person's rate will now be increased from £3,150 to £4,200, the married person's allowance from £6,300 to £8,400 and the PAYE allowance from £800 to £1,000.  The changes in these allowances will result in a standard rate personal allowance for a single person on PAYE of £5,200. This is a very welcome change.  Other budget features include the removal of more than 80,000 taxpayers from the tax net and the reduction of the number of taxpayers on the marginal relief system from the current level of 82,000 to just over 24,000.  The budget changes mean that an individual will pay no tax on any income below £100 per week.</P>
    <P>This budget is a landmark one in Irish history. It marks a fundamental departure in the area of personal taxation.  A major step has been taken towards a full tax credit system.  The changeover will be completed in the Minister's future budgets.</P>
    <P>The back to work allowance scheme will be increased by 2,000 from 27,000 to 29,000 and there will be special pilot schemes for the very long-term unemployed.  There will be 1,000 additional ring-fenced places on back to work schemes.  FÁS will provide 1,500 special places to give basic skills to long-term unemployed people. A sum of £15 million will be provided in 1999 and £10 million in the year 2000 for training infrastructure. The job initiative element of community employment schemes for people who have been unemployed for more than five years will be given 875 extra places.  This will cost £9.8 million in a full year.  The special exemption from unemployment benefit taxation for systematic short-time workers is to be continued.  Public-private partnerships are to be established to bring new high capacity Internet connections to Ireland at a cost of £12 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>The allowance payable to back to education allowance participants is to be increased from £150 to £200.  An additional £10 million will target educational disadvantage including adult illiteracy and the encouragement of young people to complete the senior cycle.</P>
    <P>The special Section 23 tax relief for rented accommodation is to be extended to cover residences for third level students and £100,000 is being made available to tackle the problem of litter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>With other Opposition Deputies I was very disappointed that my priority question on this matter was ruled out of order. When I spoke earlier I made strong remarks about the questions office staff and said that I felt they had misunderstood the issue.  I now withdraw those remarks.  Like all Deputies I find the staff of the Houses extremely helpful and supportive and many of them have become my friends.</P>
      <P>However, although the report is dated October 1998, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in a previous question said she would publish it.  We had no chance to read the document before today's Question Time and to ask the Tánaiste to comment.  I was justified, therefore, in raising the question.</P>
      <P>The issue of the delay in the introduction of a national minimum wage remains unresolved and is of deep concern.  The Labour Party and I strongly support the campaign of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Dublin Council of Trade Unions to have the national minimum wage implemented as soon as possible.  I ask the Minister why this demand, articulated yesterday by the secretary if the ICTU, Mr. Peter Cassells, cannot be accepted.  The Government could introduce a national minimum wage at 75 per cent of median earnings immediately.  Nothing I have read in this report would prevent this measure being introduced in the spring of 1999 at the latest if the Government wished.  The basis of the legislation is laid down.  I could introduce a Bill to this effect based, for example, on the British Bill and it could be implemented after Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Finance introduced major tax cuts for companies while our low-paid employees receive no such bounty or protection. The scandal of low pay remains throughout the economy.  A survey conducted by third level students in Dublin found the following rates of pay: secretary, £3.50 per hour; waiting staff, £2.50 per hour; restaurant staff, £3.90 per hour; shop assistants, £3.46 an hour, forecourt attendants, £3 an hour, factory workers in a meat factory in Kildare, £4 an hour, shop staff in a petrol station, £4.25 an hour, factory work in a chocolate factory <Col N="1665" /> in East Wall, £4 an hour, shop assistants in a shop in Santry, £3.50 an hour, and so on.  I have lists of jobs in my possession and I will not embarrass the entrepreneurs and businesses concerned by reading their names into the record.  As recently as a few months ago scandalous rates of £2 to £2.50 were being paid in a number of restaurants.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and his colleagues gave a commitment in the general election that they would emulate the Labour Government in the UK and introduce a national minimum wage.  The Minister of State said he was a year in power.  In fact, the Government has been in power for a year and a half and we are still waiting.  I fear the real strategy is to retain this issue as a topic of debate over the next few years by which stage the Government could be out of office.  In that case it would be the responsibility of the Labour Party and others coming into office to implement the national minimum wage.  Perhaps the Minister of State had some intention of introducing it but the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and the Progressive Democrats definitely did not and that is the major issue.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the timetable of this interim report.  It is unnecessary to wait until next spring for legislation and then have a further 18 months of preparation for the introduction of the minimum wage.  I appeal to the Minister of State to introduce the legislation and implement the minimum wage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify what I said on Question Time.  I had been in office one year, since 9 October 1997.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter on the Adjournment and apologise on behalf of the Tánaiste that she could not reply due to other commitments.  Yesterday's budget was the most radical and reforming the country has seen in many years.  It reflected the most significant transformation of the income tax system in a generation and delivered the largest package of tax reductions ever for workers, especially the low paid.  More than 80,000 employees will be removed from the tax net in one fell swoop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal aims of the budget is to maintain social inclusiveness, and its social inclusion provisions deliver and exceed the Government's commitments under Partnership 2000.  The budget provisions have been warmly welcomed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and many other representative groups.  The introduction of a national minimum hourly wage is a key priority of the Government as part of its assault on exclusion, marginalisation and poverty. This is an issue on which the Government acted immediately on coming into office.  In fairness to the Tánaiste and her colleagues in Government, she has been enthusiastic about this, has taken ownership of it and driven it strongly, and credit is due to her.  The Government appointed the National Minimum Wage Commission in July 1997 to advise it on the best way to implement its <Col N="1666" /> commitment in the programme for Government and the report of the National Minimum Wage Commission was published in April this year.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental group of officials was established by the Government following the report of the National Minimum Wage Commission with the remit to formulate proposals and a plan of action on implementation of a national minimum wage.  The Tánaiste recently received the interim report of the interdepartmental group which she has had published, and welcomed its comprehensive examination of the practical issues to be addressed in the implementation of the national minimum wage, especially the enabling legislation.  The work of this group is building on the valuable work of the National Minimum Wage Commission.</P>
    <P>The group was of the view that its main task was to undertake a technical assessment of the consequential implications and effects of the implementation of the commission's recommendations and to identify solutions to any problems which may arise.  It did not consider its function to repeat the inquiries and investigations undertaken by the commission.</P>
    <P>The interim report of the group outlines its progress to date and identifies a range of issues requiring further consideration.  These issues include the role of the social partners in implementing the minimum wage, the scope and exceptions of the minimum wage and variations and options for enforcement.  One of the important steps taken by the group has been to commission the ESRI to undertake an impact study on those sectors of the economy most affected by the recommended national minimum wage and on the economy as a whole.  This study will be completed in March 1999 and the information obtained will allow the group to assess the recommendation of the commission, that the initial rate set should take into account employment, overall economic conditions and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The report highlights the need to ensure claims for the restoration of relative pay differentials following the introduction of a national minimum wage are not entertained.  It welcomed the ICTU suggestion that a joint statement be agreed with IBEC and Government to this effect.  This is an extremely critical issue and further discussions with the social partners will be necessary in an attempt to identify an effective mechanism to ensure compliance with such a statement.</P>
    <P>The interim report has been widely circulated and the group has invited submissions from interested parties.  The issues identified in the report provide a sound basis for ongoing consultations with the social partners.  The Tánaiste expects to receive the final report from the inter-departmental group in May 1999.  The group regarded the outcome of the impact study as critical to determining the final shape of the minimum wage provisions.  However, it considered that drafting of the primary legislation could be progressed substantially in the interim.  The detailed <Col N="1667" /> work of the interdepartmental group is important to ensure the introduction of a national minimum wage benefits workers while minimising any negative impact on employment and competitiveness which is vital for sustainability in our economy.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste intends to have a statutory national minimum wage in place by the target timescale recommended by the National Minimum Wage Commission on the expiry of Partnership 2000 beginning in April 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for a rural tax designation scheme to be extended to County Limerick outside the city environs so that local investment resources are retained in the area and targeted at job creation and population retention initiatives in County Limerick.  At present, the county is facing serious decline and the change in Objective One status has created considerable concern within the county.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine the proposal which I put forward for the following reasons.  The population decline in County Limerick, especially in towns, villages and the open countryside, has been considerable over a number of decades.  Towns such as Rathkeale, Newcastlewest, Askeaton, Kilmallock and others have seriously declined.  There is a high economic dependency ratio in the county.  There is serious dereliction in the towns with many houses unoccupied or derelict, as well as dereliction of houses in the countryside.  There is a lack of quality accommodation to either rent or buy in the county.  That does not make it attractive for people to move to live in the county.  The local infrastructure is poor.  The N69 is the main route along the Shannon.  There are excellent opportunities for development in Askeaton and for marine development in Foynes, but the condition of access road to those towns is unacceptable.  If works are not carried out to improve it, an opportunity will be lost for the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is high unemployment, outward migration and under-employment in small businesses and on farms in the county.  The dependency rate on agriculture is high.  A total of 62 per cent of those employed in the county are employed in agriculture or in agricultural services. A total of 15,600 people are employed in this sector.  There has been a serious decline in agriculture and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will have a further impact on services. The best case scenario is that 3,000 of the <Col N="1668" /> 15,600 people dependent on agriculture will lose their jobs by the year 2005.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of graduate and high skills employment and an under-development of tourism in the region.  There is a major lack of enterprise space and there are no advance factories. There is a 200 acre serviced industrial development site in Askeaton, but no factories have moved into it.  There is an outflow of capital from the county and a lack of local or inward investment.  Granting the county the status of a rural tax designation would have a positive impact.</P>
    <P>The positive developments in Limerick City and its hinterland contrast with decline throughout the county.  None of the towns in County Limerick has a population in excess of 6,000.  Despite perceived prosperity, the mid-west region generated the third worst regional level of average household disposable income in Ireland in 1994 and 1995.  Mid-west household incomes dropped by 10 per cent from 1987-94, the highest fall in household income in any region at that time.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister examine this proposal and give a positive response to it?  The county should be granted the status of a rural tax designation to counteract the changes that may follow the granting of Objective One status to other areas and to halt and reverse the serious decline in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1998 Finance Act, the Minister for Finance introduced a pilot rural renewal scheme for the upper Shannon area subject to EU approval in the hope that this would ameliorate the process of decline in the areas covered by the scheme.  The area covered by the scheme comprises of all of Counties Leitrim and Longford, north County Roscommon, the western part of County Cavan and a large part of County Sligo.</P>
      <P>Since the announcement of the pilot rural renewal scheme in the last budget, the Department of Finance has been inundated with requests on behalf of areas seeking inclusion in it.  It has continually been stressed that this is a pilot initiative and it is not possible to designate every part of the country.  However, in his budget speech yesterday, the Minister for Finance announced that when EU clearance for the business tax incentives is given he would look at the possibility of extending the pilot rural renewal scheme on a targeted basis to other rural areas. It is not possible to indicate which area or areas will be involved in any extension and Deputies must be mindful that any such extension would also be subject to EU approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties in securing EU approval for various tax incentive schemes should by now be very familiar having been mentioned in several replies by the Minister for Finance to Parliamentary Questions over the past month as well as in a press release last June and in another Adjournment Debate last October.  It is a long, arduous <Col N="1669" /> and resource consuming process, but as an EU member state it is our duty to fulfil this requirement.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the rural renewal scheme residential incentive commenced on 1 June as EU Commission approval is not required for residential tax incentives.  With regard to the business incentive element of the scheme, the Commission's view is that the double rent relief and the rates remission are operating aids, in other words, they reduce the annual profits of the enterprise for ten years for tax purposes.  The Commission contends, in general, that these two reliefs should no longer apply for new projects for ten years because Ireland has moved from a country coming under Article 92(3)(a) of the EU Treaties to one coming under Article 92(3)(c) as a result of the recent very significant improvement in the Irish economy.  The relevant Commission officials have so far not objected to the accelerated capital allowances for the constriction or refurbishment of commercial and industrial buildings because these are considered to be investment aids rather than operating aids.</P>
    <P>On a more positive note, I am sure Deputies will have welcomed the Minister for Finance's announcement of an extension of the deadlines for various designated schemes in yesterday's budget.  This has been done in response to representations received from several parts of the country where certain projects commenced under these schemes could not be completed within the existing timeframes.  The present general urban renewal scheme deadline is being extended in the case of residential projects from 31 December 1998 to 30 April 1999 where 50 per cent of the expenditure is incurred by 31 December 1998.  The Temple Bar scheme deadline is being extended from 5 April 1999 to 31 December 1999 in the case of residential projects where 50 per cent of the expenditure is incurred by 5 April 1999.  The designated seaside resorts scheme deadline is being extended from 30 June 1999 to 31 December 1999 in the case of projects where 50 per cent of the construction expenditure is incurred by 30 June 1999.  The designated islands scheme deadline is being extended from 31 July 1999 to 31 December 1999 in the case of projects where 50 per cent of the construction expenditure is incurred by 31 July 1999.  The capital allowances for the construction of multi-storey car parks will be continued for a further year from 30 June 1999 to 30 June 2000 in the case of projects located outside the Dublin urban area and the Cork urban area where 15 per cent of the total cost of the project has been incurred by 30 June 1998.  The extension of the residential element of the urban renewal scheme and the multi-storey car park scheme will benefit pipeline projects under these schemes in Limerick.  I am pleased to announce that these extensions will also impact favourably on my city of Waterford as well as on Tramore and Dungarvan.</P>

      <P>Chuir mise ceist i mí Márta 1993 faoin Acht um Fhiadhúlra a leasú.  Tugadh geallúint dom go mbeadh sé ann roimh dheireadh na bliana.  Idir an dá linn tá scrios as cuimse déanta ar na portaigh, ar cheantair in aice leis an gcósta agus in a lán áiteanna a bhfuilimid in ainm is a bheith ag cosaint.</P>
      <P>Five years on we have come to the end of another year with still no sign that the Minister has expended the necessary effort to publish this Bill.  Instead of positive and hopeful signs, is the Minister presiding over an unprecedented wave of wildlife destruction, habitat loss and the degradation of natural landscapes?  This wave of destruction is particularly affecting coastal areas, sand dunes and wetlands.  Boglands, raised and blanket, are equally under threat and are disappearing at a fast pace all over the country.</P>
      <P>Hedgerows are also a target for destruction, in particular, in areas where measure 5 of REPS is being implemented under the disastrous interpretation of the Department of Agriculture and Food, a different Department from the one dealing with this matter, but worthy of attention in the wildlife Bill.  Hedgerows in Ireland create a unique habitat for wildlife.  The hedgerow provides the food and shelter for species without which the country would be seriously deprived. Ironically, hedgerows are under threat from a measure that was put in place to contribute to the protection of our environment.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the practical and campaigning work done on this issue by the CRANN organisation and, in particular, the local hedgerow project in County Leitrim.  The absurdity of encouraging and financing the destruction of a natural feature of the natural landscape under the rural environment protection scheme is striking.  In 1950, when many of the Ministers opposite were very young, we had more than 300,000 hectares of raised boglands.  Today the number has dwindled to 20,000 hectares.  The remaining bogs represent the best examples of such peatland left in Europe, but the lack of protection and legislation will again see the continued destruction of this important part of our national heritage.</P>
      <P>In July 1916, Roger Casement wrote of his landing at Banna Strand and of the impression he had of the sandhills &ldquo;full of skylarks arising in the dawn&rdquo;.  They are a sad sight today.  Banna Strand is under serious threat from destruction, despite strong representations from the Banna-Carrahane environment protection group to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of positive action to protect these characteristic features of the unique Irish landscape, we have destructive inaction.  The loss of political will, direction or nerve that has delayed the introduction of the Wildlife (Amendment) <Col N="1671" /> Bill is not only showing disregard for our natural environment, but also demonstrates a failure to comply with its commitments under EU law to implement the bird directive and the habitat directive.  These are commitments which will land us in court and for which the Government will have to answer on behalf of the people.  If the Government is not in a position to introduce this long awaited Bill, will the Minister &mdash; and this is the point of my raising this matter on the Adjournment &mdash; at least acknowledge that interim measures are required to stop the unprecedented destruction of wetland, dune and hedgerow habitats which are unique to our country?</P>
    <P>In relation to that interim arrangement and the moratorium on measures which will further destroy these areas, may I ask that the appeals board, arising from the implementation of the habitat directive, which it seems is something like a vandals charter, not just accept appeals with material interests, but also with wider ecological interests at stake?  It should be allowed to increase areas, rather than being restricted, as at present, to reducing areas of interest.  That will obviously encourage people who are interested in destroying these areas to appeal their cases so that such areas can be less protected.  Ireland is the worst EU member state, the vandals of Europe, when it comes to habitat protection.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure the Government introduces interim measures for a moratorium on the destruction of wetlands and other important habitats pending the introduction of the legislation.</P>

    <P>With regard to the EU Birds Directive, more than 100 special protection areas, or SPAs as they are commonly called, have to date been designated under the directive.  These designations provide protection for bird species and their habitats. Furthermore, the EU Habitats Directive, which requires the conservation of natural habitats and wildlife species through the designation of special areas of conservation, commonly known as SACs, was transposed into Irish law on 26 February 1997 by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997.  Those regulations provide protection for both SACs and <Col N="1672" /> SPAs as important wildlife areas.  The process of designating SACs in accordance with the regulations is well under way, in that the main part of what will be Ireland's SAC network &mdash; that includes more than 200 sites amounting to some 550,000 hectares, including wetland and dune habitats &mdash; has already been publicly proposed for designation.</P>
    <P>Of the 207 proposed candidate SACs publicly notified to date, my Department has formally transmitted 48 to the EU Commission.  An additional ten sites will be transmitted in the next few weeks.  Further sites will be transmitted as the objections to the inclusion of private lands in them are dealt with.  I emphasise, however, that all of those proposed candidate SACs are already afforded protection under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997.  It must be acknowledged that it has not been possible to meet the timeframe set out in the habitats directive concerning the submission of the full list of candidate SACs to the European Commission. This was initially because of the delay in transposing the directive into national legislation and, subsequently, because the regulations provide all land owners and land users with an opportunity to object, on scientific grounds, to the inclusion of their lands in SACs.  However, practical and effective conservation is already taking place in practice on the land included in the publicly notified sites and the non-transmission of the list has had no damaging conservation impact on those sites.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an mBille um Fhiadhúlra (Leasú), tuigfidh an Teachta go bhfuil an Bille sin geallta ag Rialtais éagsúla le breis agus dhá bhliain déag. Tá an ceart ag an Teachta maidir leis an méid sin, tá sé seo píosa fada ar bun.  Mar a cuireadh in iúl don Teach seo cheana féin, in ainneoin na tuisceana a bhí tugtha go raibh an Bille geall is a bheith réidh le foilsiú sular tháinig deireadh le tréimhse oifige an Rialtais deiridh, ní hamhlaidh a bhí an scéil.</P>
    <P>It was apparent to me and to the Minister, on consideration of the draft Bill, that the sections of it relating to the designation of natural heritage areas needed to be revisited, particularly in the context of the level of protection proposed in the draft legislation.  In addition, significant sections of the Bill required examination and revision in the light of experience gained from the process of preparing the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997.  A number of issues which had been raised by the parliamentary draftsman's office also remained to be resolved.</P>
    <P>In the light of these requirements, a working group was established within my Department for the purpose of comprehensively re-evaluating the draft provisions of the Bill and finalising all outstanding issues, some of which required the agreement of other Departments.  The task faced by the working group was an onerous one, but I am pleased to inform the Deputy that very considerable progress has been achieved, most particularly in relation to issues which required <Col N="1673" /> the agreement of other Departments.  It is only fair to point out, however, that some of the technical issues in the Bill proved more difficult to resolve than anticipated and other significant issues arose in the interim.</P>

      <P>I emphasise that Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has an ongoing wildlife monitoring programme in place which carries out regular surveys on all aspects of our wildlife, both flora and fauna.

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the case of Josephine Hayden, formerly general secretary of Republican Sinn Féin and now a prisoner in Limerick Prison.</P>
      <P>In January 1996, Josephine Hayden and five men were jailed for possessing a sawn-off shotgun, a revolver and some ammunition.  The court heard that the revolver was not capable of being fired.  Josephine was a front-seat passenger in a van carrying six people.  She had no previous convictions, but was sentenced to six years' imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Before her imprisonment she had no apparent health problems.  On 30 May last year, in prison, she suffered a heart attack.  The ambulance taking her to hospital was delayed for approximately 20 minutes until an armed escort could be summoned. Limerick Regional Hospital has not accepted responsibility for the decision to return her to prison after seven days.  In July of 1997 and March of this year, she was again in hospital with angina.</P>
      <P>The journalist who wrote about her case in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on 29 November 1998, and who visited her in Limerick, described Limerick Prison as a place straight from the pages of Charles Dickens&mdash;</P>
      <P>C-Wing, where Josephine is held on the third floor, was closed for 17 years at one stage, before being re-opened for women prisoners. The prison governor said on Radio Limerick that conditions there are &ldquo;the worst we have&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A Council of Europe report published in 1994 said that conditions there were &ldquo;a cause of particular concern to the delegation. A cell of five square metres is scarcely adequate as a living area for one person&rdquo;.  The wing is frequently over-crowded, with prisoners being held two to a cell: on Thursday 29 October there were 15 prisoners in 11 cells (one cell is unusable, because of a fire).</P>
      <P>The journalist described conditions there as follows:</P>
      <P>Sanitary and hygiene conditions are poor: at night, prisoners must keep chamber-pots in their cells.  There are only two showers, one of which malfunctions.  There is a sluice (into which the chamber-pots are emptied) beside the showers, and no air-conditioning.  One of the two toilets is in bad condition..</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The room in which the women are served their food also contains a partitioned-off toilet <Col N="1675" /> in the corner. .In this room the dishes are also washed.  It contains the washing machine which the prisoners use for their clothes and it is used for recreation..</P>
    <P>The cells are damp.  Natural light isn't adequate, so artificial light is needed all the time.  Many panes in the windows are broken, and must be stuffed with toilet paper.  The exercise yard is the size of a large room, about 15 &mdash; 20 paces long, and surrounded by twelve-foot high steel walls..</P>
    <P>Alan Kavanagh of the Prison Officers' Association is quoted by the <i>Limerick Leader</i> as calling for C-wing to be closed.  It is supposedly due to be closed next year and replaced by a new wing.</P>
    <P>These conditions must pose a threat to the health of a frail 52 year old woman with a recurring heart condition.  I believe there is a strong case to release her on compassionate grounds.</P>
    <P>Josephine Hayden has been led to understand that she would be released were she to support the British-Irish Agreement, or if the Continuity IRA were on ceasefire.  Josephine Hayden is not a member of the Continuity IRA and, as the journalist pointed out, this organisation has not caused a single death in nearly 12 years of existence. For nearly a year it has been on effective cessation.</P>
    <P>Members of the Government and the Minister's party have an excellent record of visiting Irish prisoners in British prisons, expressing concern and seeking the release of prisoners such as Róisín McAliskey.  One could contrast this case with the Róisín McAliskey case.  I do not have time to do so here, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I am asking the Minister, at the very least, to consider the release of this woman for Christmas parole. There is an overwhelming case, based on her general health and heart condition, the unsatisfactory prison conditions where she is held, and the reality that she poses no threat to this State, that she should be granted a conditional release on compassionate grounds.</P>
    <P>I could contrast her case against that of others who are being released, but I will not.  There is no need.  I ask the Minister to consider what I have had to say on behalf of Josephine Hayden and review her case before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Josephine Hayden was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for the possession of firearms in suspicious circumstances by the Special Criminal Court in January 1996 and is not due for release, with remission, until July 2000.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on Ms Hayden's medical condition.  I can assure the House, however, that she receives any appropriate medical attention she requires within the prison, and attends specialist clinics in outside hospitals, as appropriate, to have her condition monitored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> There has been no recent change in her medical condition and I have been assured by the director of the Prison Medical Service that there is no medical reason why she cannot continue to be held in prison.  The medical officer visits the female prison daily and psychiatric and psychological treatment is provided to all prisoners as required.</P>
    <P>The governor of Limerick Prison offered Ms Hayden a transfer from her third-floor cell to a lower level when she was discharged from Limerick Regional Hospital last year.  Ms Hayden declined this offer, saying that she was quite happy where she was.  The food servery, chapel, recreation hall and laundry facilities are located on the third floor.</P>
    <P>In common with the other inmates, Ms Hayden has daily access to outdoor recreation.  She has received special attention since her arrival in Limerick, in particular since she has suffered her illness.  Her diet receives special attention, she receives special telephone calls for family reasons, and has visiting facilities with her partner.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the women's section of Limerick Prison is an old building, it is wrong to suggest or imply that any individual female prisoner's health is endangered by conditions at the prison.  It is maintained in a clean and hygienic condition.  In addition, a comprehensive range of medical, psychiatric and psychological services are available to prisoners as required.</P>
    <P>It is policy to have single cell occupancy only, but increased numbers from time to time necessitate doubling up.  Occasionally prisoners seek to double up to avoid being lonely, especially if they are in prison for the first time.  Ms Hayden is, however, accommodated in a single cell.</P>
    <P>There are two showers for ten to 12 prisoners. This ratio of prisoners to showers is above the norm and should be more than sufficient to provide for the number in question.  Education is provided in two rooms, a domestic science room and a general purpose room which contains computer equipment.  There is also a fully heated room with a television and video.  There is a sub-library supplied from the main library and prisoners can also order reading material from the main library or from Limerick city library.</P>
    <P>I recognise, however, that the present accommodation is not adequate and plans to provide replacement accommodation are at an advanced stage.  This new facility will be self-contained and will, in so far as is feasible, be separated from the male prison.  The new facility will have the following features: single cell accommodation with attention to prisoner safety features, integral sanitation in all cells, medical surgery, visiting facilities, shower facilities, a full range of education, work training and physical education facilities and indoor and outdoor recreation.  The new accommodation will meet with current statutory regulations in respect of hygiene, health and safety, including fire safety.</P>
    <P>This new facility is envisaged as a short to <Col N="1677" /> medium term solution for accommodating females at Limerick Prison, pending development plans for a new purpose built unit on the prison site to be constructed when financial resources permit.  I am satisfied that Ms Hayden is receiving all appropriate medical care and attention in Limerick Prison and that there are no medical or compassionate grounds to warrant her release at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory asked if it would be possible for me to consider Christmas parole for Ms Hayden.  I have received many representations from Members, including Deputy Gregory, in <Col N="1678" /> connection with Ms Hayden.  I also received representations from Deputy Conor Lenihan who is present for this debate.  I will consider Ms Hayden, along with all other prisoners, for Christmas parole in due course.  I will give the matter careful consideration and take into account the representations by Members of the House and Deputy Gregory's comments in this debate.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 8 December 1998.</P>

      <P>A total of 7,500 FAS places are reserved for young persons referred for available supports.

      <P>The economy is currently generating very considerable levels of employment and the challenge facing us over the next few years is not simply one of employment generation but also one of ensuring that those marginalised can avail of the new employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Government resources for enterprise development are demand led.  The level of demand depends on decisions by individual Irish and foreign owned enterprises on where to establish or expand their business in Ireland.  In practice, there is no shortage of public funds to support worthwhile projects, within the limits set out in the Industrial Development Act, 1986, and the EU state aid guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be stressed that grants are only one element in the supports provided for development <Col N="1681" /> in the different regions and factors such as a plentiful and skilled labour force, good infrastructure and efficient and effective public utilities may be just as important in individual cases. The present National Development Plan 1994-99 is addressing deficiencies in these areas and it is the intention of the Government that the next national development plan will have a very strong and distinct regional focus.</P>

      <P>The number of company investigations being carried out &mdash; and recently carried out &mdash; by my Department is 13. The cost so far of these inquiries to my Department amounts to about £205,000.  This figure includes costs of about £28,000 incurred in 1997. While it is not yet possible to quantify what the final cost will be, I expect the outturn for 1998 to be about £272,000, and the 1999 Estimate allocated to my Department for company investigations is £250,000 These figures do not include the normal salary costs of my Department's staff who are involved in progressing these inquiries.</P>
      <P>Ten of the 13 investigations relate to examinations of company books and documents being conducted under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990.  Under section 21 of the 1990 Act, section 19 reports may only be published with the previous consent in writing of the body concerned, save in certain specified circumstances. Until these reports have been completed and until contact has been made with each of the companies involved, I will not be in a position to know the extent to which I will be able to report on these investigations.  I hope, however, to have a number of them completed in the first quarter of 1999.</P>
      <P>The inquiry under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, into Bula Resources (Holdings) Ltd. was concluded last July, and copies of the inspector's report were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 4 August 1998.

The cost of these inquiries &mdash; amounting to £615,000 to date &mdash; is being met from the Vote of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality <Col N="1682" /> and Law Reform.  As the outcome of a Supreme Court appeal is awaited on the conduct of the inspector's inquiries, it is not possible to indicate when these will conclude.  It is usual for such reports to be published, although this is entirely a matter for High Court decision in individual cases.</P>

      <P>I am informed by IDA Ireland that Bausch and Lomb Inc., New York, USA, announced on 18 November 1998 that it plans to divest itself of its premium fashion eyewear business.  The US company has hired an investment firm to advise on the options available for the eyewear business, including its sale, spin-off into other divisions, or forming a joint venture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" /> The decision is based on the company's plan to focus on expanding its core eye-care products business, including contact lenses, which are manufactured in Waterford and afford employment to 1400 people.  In addition, 350 people are employed in the company's Ray-Ban sunglasses Waterford plant.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is closely monitoring developments with a view to ensuring that employment at the Waterford plants is maintained at the maximum level possible.</P>

      <P>The communication of May 1998 from the EU Commission, entitled the Statutory Audit in the European Union: the Way Forward, draws attention to the different regulatory frameworks underlying the statutory audit at EU level and refers <i>inter alia</i> to the need to review the existing international standards on auditing for possible application in the EU.  The Commission has accordingly instituted discussions on these issues through a committee on auditing representative of member states and the auditing profession.</P>
      <P>We welcome the Commission's communication and its establishment of the committee on auditing. Ireland is, of course, contributing to the work of the committee.  It is unclear at this stage if legislation will be necessary at EU level in due course because this will obviously depend on the nature of the recommendations that emerge from the committee's future work.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that we have received the submission from the <i>Federation Des Experts Compatibles Europeens</i> which proposes the adoption of a set of specific principles to safeguard audit independence and objectivity.  We are at present examining the submission which is due to be considered by the committee on auditing in mid-1999.</P>

The Deputies will appreciate that the initiative has an extensive work programme which, in addition to the immediate need to put programmes in place for those recently made redundant, also covers issues such as promoting Donegal as a location for foreign direct investment, reviewing the county's infrastructural needs, especially in relation to access transport and telecommunications, promoting indigenous investment, and developing an education and skills database.</P>

      <P>The scheme, by which a company may apply to our Department for a licence to be registered without the addition of the word limited or teoranta in its name, was established in legislation prior to the Companies Act, 1963 and was continued by section 24 of that Act.  The scheme operates in much the same fashion as described in paragraph 6.1 and 6.2 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, 1992, which considered the statutory and related administrative requirements pertaining to charitable organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before deciding to grant a licence, we must be satisfied that the company or proposed company was formed or is being formed for the purpose of promoting commerce, art, science, religion, charity or any other useful object, that it intends to apply its income or profits, if any, in promoting its objects, and that it intends to prohibit the payment of any dividend to its members.  Such companies <Col N="1685" /> are normally formed as guaranteed companies without a share capital.  A recent examination of these companies on the companies office register, indicated that there are some 636 companies, including about 82 dissolved companies, registered without the word limited or teoranta.</P>
    <P>A company with a licence to omit the word limited or teoranta from its name is subject to the same compliance requirements as a guarantee company without a share capital which does not have a licence, including the requirement that such companies comply with sections 126, 127, 128 and 157 of the Companies Act, 1963 in relation to the filing of annual returns and accounts with the Companies Registration Office. The statutory requirement on companies to file documents is monitored by the Companies Registration Office.  While this statutory requirement is placed on all companies, further spot checks of section 24 licence holders are carried out in relation to the conditions attaching to their licence.</P>
    <P>A company which has a licence to omit the word limited or teoranta from its name must show on its business letters and order forms that it is a limited company.</P>

      <P>I replied to a similar question from Deputy Broughan on 3 November last.  There is no change in the position as outlined to the House on that date.  Enterprise Ireland continues its activities in raising awareness among its clients regarding the need for planning and preparation for the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>Currency fluctuations are a constant feature of international trade and Enterprise Ireland works with individual companies engaged in international trade to ensure that they have taken the necessary steps to cover themselves against possible losses.</P>
      <P>A report prepared by Forfás in April 1998 outlines specifically the actions businesses can take to cope with sterling fluctuations outside of the euro and an abbreviated version has been distributed as part of the Euro Awareness campaign.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland is a member of the EMU Inter-Agency Committee which agrees the initiatives to be taken and co-ordinates the approach and the activities of the development agencies in their dealings with client companies and business sectors on EMU.  Given that ongoing survey results indicate that small companies are under prepared, the focus of this group is regionally-based small business.</P>
      <P>A number of specific initiatives have been introduced by Enterprise Ireland to help companies with their EMU preparations.  These include the provision of a euromentor through which a trained mentor is allocated to a company to work through the issues and advise on strategic and operational problems, the development of a software tool to ascertain companies sensitivity to sterling-other currency fluctuations and the former Irish Trade Board publication on EMU for exporters has been widely circulated.  A review of activities to date is currently under way and new initiatives as appropriate will be introduced in 1999.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland will continue through its network of overseas offices the process of identifying opportunities in key overseas markets, including the United Kingdom, the United States and other non-euro areas and to help Irish companies to exploit these.</P>

      <P>My policy, in relation to employment generally, is to ensure <Col N="1687" /> that job opportunities which arise in this country are, as far as possible, filled by Irish or other European economic area nationals.  Where this is not possible or practicable, however, my policy is to issue work permits to employers to employ non EEA nationals where they can demonstrate that a genuine effort has already been made by them to recruit from the existing workforce and where the relevant immigration requirements and legislation have been complied with in respect of the application concerned.</P>
      <P>Since taking up office, I have been extremely liberal in facilitating employers who wish to employ non-EEA nationals.  Approximately 95 per cent of the applications made to my Department for work permits are, ultimately, granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the findings of the evaluation and have referred it to the officials in my Department for consideration. It is worth making the point that the programmes examined by the ESF evaluation unit were designed at a time of higher unemployment and poor prospects for long-term unemployed persons.  That being said I note with interest that the evaluation comes to the same conclusion as the Deloitte &amp; Touche review of community employment &mdash; that spending on active labour market programmes, while very substantial, 4.1 per cent of GDP in 1996, for example, has not been strategically focused.  Community employment has been by far the biggest ALMP, with end 1998 participation of 40,000 places, yet among such programmes it has a lower outcome in terms of progression.</P>
      <P>I very much agree with the finding in the evaluation that &ldquo;there is a need to adopt an approach with two strategies: to bring more long-term unemployed people with low skills level into quality training and education programmes and also to increase the amount and improve the quality of training on those programmes which long-term unemployed may choose for a variety of reasons&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This approach very much reflects the strategic thrust of the measures set in place both in the 1999 Estimates and the budget, where the emphasis has been on developing targeted programmes with good labour market linkages, likely to result in good progression rates into jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate the Government's commitment to reintegrating into employment persons who are currently long-term unemployed while ensuring, through the employment action plan, that other persons do not drift into long-term unemployment. <Col N="1688" /> The Government has provided a very substantial social inclusion package in the 1998 budget in order to achieve this.  In my Department alone there is provision for an additional 10,000 places on targeted active labour market programmes during the coming year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 28 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>There are a number of Government committees on year 2000 and they have met on a total of 40 times.</P>
      <P>In April and May of this year, I invited and received the commitment of representatives of a broad range of relevant business organisations and State agencies to support the Government's campaign and take part in a year 2000 awareness committee to oversee the campaign and advise me on an appropriate campaign strategy to counter the problem.</P>
      <P>With the help of the committee, a second comprehensive brochure was prepared outlining the nature and implications of the problem and giving advice on how to go about dealing with it.  This brochure has been circulated to over 100,000 businesses throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a series of seven regional public meetings have been held to highlight awareness of the problem where I personally, along with <Col N="1689" /> committee representatives, have impressed on participants at these meetings the urgency of the need to address the issue.  These regional meetings and a subsequent national conference in Dublin received wide media coverage.  I have also addressed numerous professional gatherings on the year 2000 issue, many of which involved members of the national committee.</P>
    <P>With regard to the internal workings of the campaign committee, its role has been mainly twofold &mdash; to advise me on campaign strategy and to report on the progress within the bodies represented and in the wider business community.  Its members include groups which interact with small business on a daily basis, for example, the banks, the accounting/auditing profession and the insurance industry.  The committee has met on four official occasions since its formation.  Several members of the committee have attended many other meetings on this issue throughout the year. It is not intended that the committee will produce a report as its role is mainly of an advisory nature as well as taking an active part in the awareness campaign.</P>
    <P>Some recent research carried out by the chambers of commerce of Ireland, in conjunction with the Irish Computer Society, on the level of compliance of Irish businesses has found that, while the business awareness campaign has resulted in a high level of awareness of the problem, the level of corrective action, particularly among SMEs, still falls below what is required.  Along with my advisers, I am considering what further measures could be taken to encourage Irish business, particularly small businesses, to actively engage this problem.  I hope to make an announcement on this matter within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 60 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>Indications of the state of euro-readiness of Irish firms have been ascertained from the ongoing surveys that have been conducted as part of the EMU business awareness campaign, which is managed on behalf of the Government by Forfás.</P>
      <P>Two surveys have been conduced to date, a benchmark study in July 1997 with a follow-up study completed in March of this year.  Field work has commenced on a third survey to be completed by mid December.  These surveys have been undertaken on an ongoing basis to determine not only the prevailing levels of awareness among Irish enterprises for EMU but to assess the degree of progress which firms have made with their preparations over the intervening period.</P>
      <P>The key findings of the most recent survey, carried out in March last, are that 50 per cent of firms surveyed have appointed an individual to steer the company's planning and to gather information, approaching twice the levels recorded at the benchmark stage, 28 per cent; 27 per cent have performed a business impact analysis, an increase from 18 per cent; 51 per cent of the companies have identified the functional implications previously 34 per cent; 27 per cent have prepared functional work plans for the changeover &mdash; previously 16 per cent; 12 per cent have designed tests for the practical implementation of change, up from 8 per cent in July last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect a further substantial improvement in <Col N="1691" /> these figures when the survey planned for later this month is completed.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, is currently preparing a national code of practice on dual pricing, in the context of the introduction of the euro, and it is expected that this code will be ready shortly.  The code will incorporate the European Commission's recommendations on dual pricing and dual display and will require that dual displays of prices be unambiguous, easily identifiable and clearly legible.  The code will form part of this Department's strategy to protect consumers in the changeover process, and will assist businesses to prepare for dual display during the changeover period.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am encouraged that so many firms appear to be making adequate and timely preparations, although I would strongly encourage firms that have not as yet addressed the key issues for their business to prepare now for EMU and the changeover to the euro.</P>

      <P>Since my last reply, the Director of Public Prosecutions, <i>via</i> the Garda Síochána, and the Revenue Commissioners have sought additional documentation and information from my Department's authorised officer.

      <P>On 30 March 1998, the High Court appointed Messrs.  John Blayney and Tom Grace as inspectors to National Irish Bank Limited and the same persons as inspectors to National Irish Bank Financial Services Ltd.  on 15 June 1998.  Certain staff of National Irish Bank have appealed the ruling of the High Court made on 13 July last, which inter alia determined that the staff were obliged to answer such questions as were put to them by the inspectors.  As the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal in this matter is awaited, it is not possible to indicate when the final report of the inspectors will be completed.  I should add that the inspectors are answerable to the court for the performance of their duties.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to a question which I answered on 3 November 1998.</P>
      <P>The changing patterns of competition for mobile international investment projects are reviewed on a regular basis.  Ireland's main competitors for foreign direct investment are other countries in Europe.  Policies are being pursued to maximise the attractiveness of Ireland as a continuing desirable location for foreign and indigenous investment and to ensure that existing industry is competitive.  In this context, particular emphasis with appropriate initiatives is being placed on addressing key competitiveness factors such as skills, costs, telecommunications and the information society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is particularly strong in the pharmaceuticals, electronics and software sectors.  Our main <Col N="1694" /> competitive advantage here is our highly educated English-speaking workforce.  Because of its conviction that development of our workforce is the best way to both attract and safeguard long-term investment for Ireland, the Government recently announced an additional £250 million investment in education.  The development of information technology and language skills are particular aims of that investment.  In addition, the recently concluded agreement between the Government and the European Commission which safeguards Ireland's low tax regime beyond the year 2010 will contribute substantially to maintaining Ireland's competitiveness for investment moving into Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 44 of the Credit Union Act, 1997, allows a credit union to establish special funds for social, cultural or charitable purposes &mdash; including community development.  If all of the credit unions in the State were to establish the permitted funds at the maximum levels allowed in section 44(3) and 44(4) in 1998, I estimate that the value of these would be in the region of £11 million.  Such an investment would have a positive employment impact in the social economy, although the resultant levels of employment would clearly be related to the nature of any such projects.</P>
      <P>Under section 44(1), the establishment of such a special fund is entirely a matter for the decision by the majority of the members of each individual credit union attending and voting at its general meeting.  I have consulted with the Registrar for Friendly Societies, and he is not aware of any uptake of these enabling provisions in 1998 among individual credit unions.  As I indicated on 30 June 1998, in a reply to a PQ on this matter, the Irish League of Credit Unions has promised to encourage its member credit unions to avail of the facility allowed by section 44 of the 1997 Act to establish these special funds for community development purposes.</P>

Accordingly, no initiative is necessary on my part at this time.</P>

      <P>The Local Employment Service does benefit from some modest EU Structural Funds support through the local area partnerships funded under the local urban and rural development OP.  However, the vast majority of funding comes from the Vote for my Department; this year, for example, £8.2 million is provided for the Local Employment Service by my Department while £780,000 in match-funded EU support is provided through the partnerships. The relative priority and resource needs of this area will be addressed by Government in the context of framing the National Development Plan for 2000-2006 and of meeting our commitments in this area under the national employment action plan.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Department of Finance earlier this year, my Department submitted proposals for the next round of EU Structural Funds across the various areas in my responsibility.  This included a range of activities related to the employment and placement services.  I understand that the totality of proposals put forward by all Departments, the regional authorities and a range of social partner bodies are at present being assessed by consultants acting on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  When we get to the stage, well into next year, when the most suitable proposals for the next round of EU Structural Funding are decided by Government, I will then be in a position to detail my plans for this area in that context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The social economy working group was set up <Col N="1697" /> on foot of the commitment in Partnership 2000 to undertake a detailed examination of the potential of the social economy, in the context that appropriate support mechanisms to facilitate the achievement of the full potential of the social economy will be established, in the light of recommendations of the working group.  The four social partner pillars, relevant Government Departments, FÁS and Area Development Management Limited were represented on this working group, which met from October 1997 to July 1998.</P>
    <P>In its report the working group decided to focus on an element of the social economy between the private and public sector which engages in economic activity in order to meet social objectives.  This part of the social economy has two main objectives; to provide services to disadvantaged communities and to generate employment opportunities and experience for long-term unemployed people.</P>
    <P>I have fully accepted and have started to implement the recommendations contained in the final report of this working group.  There is provision in my Departments 1999 Estimate for additional Exchequer resources of £1 million to assist social economy enterprises and I will shortly be inviting the four pillars of the social partnership to nominate representatives to the national monitoring committee, which will oversee the introduction of the new social economy programme, as recommended in the working group report.</P>
    <P>The working group was concerned to ensure that to the optimal extent existing resources, both financial and institutional, would be used to support the social economy programme.  As a consequence the group recommended that funding for the programme be sourced primarily through a reallocation of a proportion of funding currently committed to community employment and that the dedicated social economy programme should be managed at national and local level by FÁS, in partnership with relevant interest groups. The involvement of the social partners, partnerships and the community/voluntary sector more generally, at national and local level, is an integral element of the approach adopted by the working group.  This is to ensure that ideas and activities in relation to the social economy, emerging in the context of local development initiatives, are provided with both technical and financial support to allow social economy enterprises fulfill their potential to deliver services and provide employment for disadvantaged people.  The programme will have a strong development focus.  The intention is that it will support imaginative, locally based initiatives.  It is not about institutionalising existing activities loosely defined as in the social economy.</P>
    <P>Refocusing an element of existing community employment funding to a social economy programme, as agreed by all the social partners, represents a strategic decision to shift the focus from an employment scheme to a community reintegration <Col N="1698" /> programme focusing on the development of social economy enterprises as a tool for social and economic regeneration.  The dedicated social economy programme will operate alongside the range of active labour market programmes including community employment.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the National Development Plan for the period 2000 to 2006 will maintain the existing focus of structural fund assistance on promoting growth and tackling social exclusion. Developing the social economy can contribute to these objectives.  The EU Commission has also indicated that they would like the priorities in the 1999 employment guidelines, which include a guideline to promote employment in the social economy, to be considered when drawing up plans for structural fund assistance post-2000.  Due attention will be paid to the importance the Commission attaches to this matter at that stage.</P>

      <P>Since its establishment in February 1998, the policy review group has met on eight occasions.  The group was formed to develop and oversee the implementation of a revised strategy for the future of the clothing sector.  Since the establishment of the group, a number of supportive initiatives have already been taken including: publication of a clothing industry sectoral study by FÁS; compilation of an up-to-date schedule of agency programmes available to the clothing sector, which has been circulated to companies by the Irish Clothing Manufacturers Federation &mdash; ICMF; development of a clothing traineeship project by FÁS and the ICMF; consideration of design requirements of the sector and initiation of discussions with design colleges; provision of funding under the retex programme to the National College of Art and Design for computer-aided design equipment; implementation of a student placement programme by the National College of Art and Design, FÁS and the ICMF; submission of a proposal to include the clothing sector within a new industry-led training networks programme; commissioning of a clothing industry labour shortage study by FÁS; and organisation of a benchmarking study visit to Denmark by the Irish Clothing Manufacturers Federation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has, in the light of these developments, been considering a wide range of areas relevant to the clothing sector, including business development supports, training, development of design capability, marketing-exporting, labour shortage, benchmarking, competitiveness and <Col N="1699" /> outsourcing.  Specific issues to be addressed within these areas have been identified and will form part of a revised strategy document which should be finalised early in the new year.  The group's aim is to give a stronger focus to the industry's competitive drive and it will complete its work when agreement is reached on a revised strategy document.</P>

      <P>Objective One is a Structural Funds classification.  For purposes of regional State aid limitations, such an area would most likely have what is known as Article 92(3)(a) status and the ceiling on assistance would be 40 per cent of investment costs, plus a top-up of up to 15 per cent for SMEs.  The balance of the State would continue to have the 92(3)(c) status already proposed under the EU regional aid guidelines and the ceiling would be 20 per cent of investment costs, plus a top-up of up to 10 per cent for SMEs.  Each of the five &ldquo;c&rdquo; regions would have its own limit on permitted aid intensity, subject to the ceiling of 20 per cent.  I should stress that these are ceilings in each case and the individual aid intensity limits are to be agreed with the EU Commission by March 1999. In practice, the agencies will continue to operate on a value for money basis and offer assistance at the appropriate level in each case.</P>

      <P>A new code of practice on Sunday working in the retail sector, prepared at my request by the Labour Relations Commission, was declared by order signed by me on 19 November 1998, to be a code of practice for purposes of the Sunday working supplemental provisions of section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.  Copies of the code of practice were lodged in the Oireachtas Library on 23 November last and publication of the code was formally launched on 25 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither I nor my Department have received any complaints alleging lack of consultation with the trade union movement in regard to preparation <Col N="1700" /> of the code.  Contrary to the implication in the Deputy's question, throughout the entire process leading to publication of the code both I and the Labour Relations Commission ensured consistent and comprehensive consultations with all interested parties, both on the employer and on the union-worker sides.</P>
    <P>The code of practice was the eventual culmination of a discussion process which I initiated in January last between IBEC and trade union interests, including the unions primarily concerned, SIPTU and MANDATE, under an agreed independent chairman to address the difficulties on the employment front associated with the growing practice of Sunday trading.  In that process the sides accepted &mdash; and this was reflected in the chairman's report to me &mdash; that a code of practice along lines proposed by the chairman's could, without prejudicing the fundamental position of either side, form the basis of a common and voluntary approach to practice in relation to retail sector Sunday working.  Given this spirit of partnership and co-operation between the sides, I am confident that the code of practice which has only just been put in place will have a beneficial impact in the workplace as employers and employees apply its provisions to the operational arrangements relating to Sunday working in the retail trade.  Accordingly, I have no plans at present to carry out a review of the code.</P>

      <P>I would share the concern of the Deputy if the number of persons in Dublin signing on was growing or even static. Happily that is not the case.  There have been continuing substantial falls in the live register in recent months.  The monthly fall of 11,230 in September 1998, was the largest monthly fall on record.  The annual fall in the live register, to October 1998, of 31,502, is the largest on record. We have now reached a stage where the live register is at its lowest level in 14 years.  In the Dublin area, covered by 16 local offices, there has been a fall year on year to end October of about 25 per cent with a fall recorded in each local office.</P>

    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the CSO's Quarterly National Household Survey, published 30 November 1998, which showed the unemployment rate to have fallen to 7.8 per cent and the long-term unemployment rate to have fallen to 3.8 per cent.  I assure the Deputy that despite these very positive figures the Government is not at all complacent about the need to prevent long-term employment and to deal with its consequences, <Col N="1701" /> as witnessed by the pro-employment thrust of the budget.</P>

      <P>The Government agreed in principle on 20 October 1998 to the establishment of a financial services regulatory authority at the earliest date possible and agreed to the immediate establishment of an implementation group to progress the necessary work.  The implementation group is to advise the Government on: (a) the role and functions of the financial services regulatory authority &mdash; namely &mdash; prudential supervision, the maintenance of orderly markets, safeguarding of clients funds, consumer protection, the development and regulation of conduct of business rules &mdash; including consideration of the issues arising from combining the functions of monetary policy and prudential regulation; (b) the range of financial service providers to be overseen by the authority &mdash; namely, banks, building societies, the Post Office Savings Bank, insurance companies and brokers, investment intermediaries &mdash; including lawyers and accountants in as much as they handle clients funds &mdash; exchanges, credit unions, friendly societies, finance companies, moneylenders etc. &mdash; also taking account of the development of electronic commerce which may involve new types of service providers; (c) the extent to which, if any, existing regulators &mdash; namely, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment &mdash; would continue to have functions in relation to the regulation of the financial services sector and the extent to which any alteration to the status quo would impinge on the non-regulatory functions of the Central Bank; (d) the organisational structure for the authority including the manner of its public accountability; (e) the funding, resourcing and staffing of the authority &mdash; and issues arising in a transition to a new structure, including staffing and industrial relations, and the extent to which the authority could be self-financing; (f) the legislative changes necessary for the establishment of the authority; and (g) the time schedule &mdash; including, in so far as necessary, a phased implementation for achieving the objective of a fully operational financial services regulatory authority at the earliest date possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation group, consisting of nine members in all, under the Chairmanship of Michael McDowell SC, is to report jointly to me and to the Minister for Finance by end February, 1999.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>In its examination of the utilisation of community employment by statutory bodies the Deloitte &amp; Touche review found linkages to the open labour market to be weak with few of the participants finding employment subsequently. For that reason the report recommended the gradual phasing out of community employment places in the statutory sector with the onus for delivery of the relevant service resting with the appropriate Government Department or statutory body.  This was one of a number of recommendations in the review and already in the P2000 process some discussion has taken place with the social partners on the recommendations overall.</P>
      <P>With regard to community employment in statutory bodies, I will obviously wish to discuss the issue with the relevant Ministers before making proposals for change.  I will do this shortly.  In any event I would wish to discuss the phasing in of any changes with the social partners.  That said, the Government is acting to refine our active labour market programmes and attune them more to the principle of employability in the interest both of jobseekers and employers.</P>
      <P>The 1999 Estimate for community employment in my Department's Vote provided for 37,500 places during the year as compared with an activity of 40,000 places in 1998 and was agreed with the Department of Finance against a background of dynamic jobs growth, falling unemployment, including a sharp fall in long-term unemployment, labour shortages in some sectors and claims by employers that they cannot fill vacancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> The CSO Quarterly National Household Survey published earlier on this week confirms this picture, indicating that employment has grown by 95,000 in the year to May 1998, the highest rise ever recorded, and that the unemployment rate has fallen from 10.3 per cent to 7.8 per cent, over two thirds of this drop being accounted for by persons who are long-term unemployed.  The long-term unemployment rate now stands at 3.9 per cent, having fallen from 9 per cent in 1994. This is the context in which the Government has responded to fulfill the commitment at paragraph 4.24 of P2000 that the range of labour market integration measures will be reviewed to ensure that priority is given to those most disadvantaged. The objective will be to meet their needs through a greater choice of full or part-time options.  As resources permit, there will be an increase of 10,000 places, with particular provision for those unemployed for more than five years.</P>
    <P>The Government has met this commitment and more.  In programmes run under the aegis of my Department alone there is provision for an additional 10,000 places next year, delivering on the key objectives of tackling disadvantage, flexibility, and particular focus on the long-term unemployed.  The key point is that these places are in targeted programmes focused at particular groups among the long-term unemployed and socially excluded and are closely linked to the labour market.</P>
    <P>Community employment is still a very substantial programme.  Between the integration option, the rate for the job option and job initiative there is provision for more than 40,000 places during 1999.  Putting this in context the Quarterly National Household Survey shows a figure of 63,000 persons as long-term unemployed.  For every three persons who are long-term unemployed there is a provision of almost two places on community employment, not to mention other opportunities under the aegis of my Department, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science.  The Government has a very substantial social inclusion package in the 1999 budget and it is our aim to continue with that momentum consistent with the need to match labour market instruments with ongoing developments in the labour market.</P>

      <P>The emergence and development of electronic commerce in the economy is being monitored and planned for in a strategic way by my Department and the development agencies.  A significant body of policy research and analysis has been undertaken, by Forfás in particular.  This work has focused on the development of the information society, the electronics industry and its impact on other sectors of the economy and the infrastructure required for the development of e-commerce in key areas of skills, telecommunications and the regulatory environment.</P>
      <P>Electronic commerce is rapidly developing and I am keenly aware that it will be increasingly important to the competitiveness of all sectors of the economy and is likely to impact on the dynamics of competition in all markets.  Over the last 18 months a number of key studies and actions were undertaken to assess the impact of its growth.  I am committed, as is the Government, to ensuring that we put in place the infrastructure and policy framework required for home-based enterprises and the economy to secure the full benefits of e-commerce for wealth creation and employment growth.</P>
      <P>The development agencies have been targeting new business and employment opportunities in the key information technologies sectors and the development of new IT enabled sectors such as call centres since the late 1980s and they continue to target projects in new and emerging e-commerce sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the establishment of Enterprise Ireland in July, I expanded the list of designated services sectors eligible for State assistance to explicitly include electronic commerce activities.

      <P>Government support for enterprise must conform to the limits set by the EU regional aid guidelines, the latest version of which will come into effect, generally, in January 2000.</P>
      <P>Currently the development agencies can offer assistance to enterprises of up to 57 per cent of investment costs in the non-designated areas, up to 71 per cent in the designated areas and up to 75 per cent in Gaeltacht areas.  In practice, the assistance offered is well below these limits.</P>
      <P>Under the latest EU regulations, Ireland will be treated as comprising eight Article 92(3)(c) regions &mdash; our regional authority areas &mdash; and each will have a ceiling on the aid which can be offered to enterprise.  The limit for each area will depend on its GDP-unemployment rate, but may not exceed 20 per cent of investment costs, with a top-up of up to 10 per cent for SMEs.  Not only is the Commission limiting aid payable across the European Union to curb harmful competitive bidding between member states, but the new rules reflect Ireland's much improved economic status, that is, we are no longer one of the poorest areas of the EU.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that, regardless of the eventual decision on our application for a new Objective One region in the three poorest of our eight sub-regions, plus Clare and Kerry, which would qualify for that status on the basis of objective economic criteria, the new rules on regional aid do mean that there will be an element of regional differentiation for aid purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is to be a new Objective One region in the area comprising the three sub-regions of the west, midlands and Border, plus Clare and Kerry, that area will also qualify for the highest regional aid status, known as Article 92(3)(a), at present enjoyed by the whole State.  The aid limit in this case would probably be in the region of up to 40 <Col N="1706" /> per cent of investment costs, with a top-up of up to 15 per cent for SMEs.</P>

      <P>The inter-agency task force set up to deal with the impact of the closure of Krupps is now in full operation and focusing on securing alternative jobs for the workers and addressing their retraining needs. Finding a replacement industry for Limerick is also a key priority.</P>
      <P>I am aware that FÁS has held a series of meetings with the company and a strategy has been agreed to undertake a training requirement analysis with a view to identifying job placement opportunities.  IDA Ireland has commenced an intensive marketing programme of Limerick and its resources and I expect to see the beginning of a response to this campaign in the coming months.  The company is undertaking a detailed evaluation of the site and buildings so as to be able to make the best possible options available to any prospective industries which IDA Ireland may bring to visit the facility.</P>
      <P>With regard to job creation generally in the Limerick area, fortunately, the region has shared in and contributed to economic growth and seen tremendous development across a range of sectors and activities.  Manufacturing employment in the region has increased by over 20 per cent since 1993.  The area has a quality infrastructure and its proximity to Shannon Airport and the University of Limerick is a strong attraction for overseas investment.</P>
      <P>On 18 November, I was pleased to announced that HADCO Corporation of the USA is to establish an operation at the national technological park, Limerick.  The company will initially establish its customer and engineering services centre, with 70 jobs, to meet the design and support the needs of its customers.  Once the centre is operational HADCO will seek to establish a manufacturing facility, which would account for up to 80 new jobs.  Recruitment of the employees is to begin immediately.</P>
      <P>These latest job opportunities for the region are in addition to substantial numbers of new jobs being provided by companies such as Dell Computer, PKS Systems, Martin Dawes and Fullerton, which are continuing to build up their employment in the Limerick area.  Shannon Development and the IDA Ireland are committed to ensuring that these advances in job creation continue.</P>

      <P>Following the Avonmore Waterford Group announcement of its rationalisation programme involving major job losses, two task forces were established by the group in December, 1997 with representation from the group, State agencies, local authority and other interests.  The objectives of the task forces, that is the south-east task force and the Dublin north-east task force, may be summarised as follows: attracting replacement industry and new employment into the areas affected; and assisting the employees faced with redundancy to find alternative employment.</P>
      <P>Investment and development funds totalling £7.5 million and funded by the Avonmore Waterford Group and the European Union were established to encourage the development of new enterprises and infrastructure to support job creation activities in the areas affected by the group's rationalisation programme.  The group set up a job centre in Dungarvan in response to the needs of displaced employees and has been fully supported by the industrial development agencies in finding alternative employment.</P>
      <P>The south-east task force submitted an interim report in May.  It contained a wide range of recommendations which are being implemented or pursued.  These covered areas such as the attraction of new industrial and other investment, training and infrastructure.  A number of major new projects have been announced for the Dungarvan area, for example, expansions by Stafford and Miller, and Radley Engineering, and new greenfield projects by Century Homes and Microbrush Incorporated.  The job potential involved in these projects is over 350.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to supporting the development of the indigenous sector by providing assistance to help companies grow their sales, exports and employment.  That commitment was given new impetus by the establishment this year of Enterprise Ireland which brings together the key marketing, technology, enterprise development, business training and science and innovation initiatives through which the Government <Col N="1708" /> supports the growth of industry.  It combines the resources of the former Irish Trade Board, Forbairt, and will include the in-company training division of FÁS.</P>
      <P>The 1997 export performance of indigenous industry was strong in all markets and sectors, with an overall increase of 17 per cent over 1996, and all indications are that export growth is similarly impressive in 1998.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to react to the needs of its clients and to developments in world markets.  In 1997 and 1998, new representatives have been appointed in China, Brazil, Germany and the US west coast.  In the sub-supply sector, where Irish companies are now recognised as having the capacity and flair to supply high-quality competitive products on the global stage, the agency has targeted a doubling, to over £1 billion a year, of overseas sales by indigenous industry in the period 1998-2001.  It is committed to innovative use of the Internet to promote Irish companies. Its recently restructured web site, which gives international buyers comprehensive access to the sourcing capabilities of Irish companies, is attracting over 20,000 consultations a week.  Its programme for new exporters continues to be a notable success, with 73 companies assisted in becoming first-time exporters in 1997 and 100 companies targeted to increase their annual sales in Britain beyond £300,000 in 1998.</P>
      <P>Irish companies, which demonstrate the capability to expand and develop sales in world markets, will continue to receive support and assistance from the Government, through the industrial development agencies.</P>

      <P>Science, technology and innovation policy is an important element of Ireland's broader industrial and economic policy.

    <P>A concern raised, regarding the expropriation <Col N="1710" /> provisions in the draft text of the MAI, was that foreign companies might be able to sue a host government in a case where environmental regulations had the effect of reducing the value of a particular company's assets.  This problem was under discussion at the time the MAI negotiations ceased.  Delegations were working to ensure the provisions on expropriation could not be used to interfere with environment regulations. In the absence of further negotiations, the issue will not be resolved in the MAI context.  It will undoubtedly be a feature in any future multilateral discussions on investment.</P>

      <P>The main elements of IDA Ireland industrial property policy are: IDA Ireland has a central role in ensuring there is adequate land zoned and developed for industrial purposes in specific locations; the private sector should be encouraged to take a much more active role in the provision of industrial property; the State should minimise its involvement in ownership of individual buildings and should, as far as is practical, dispose of its holdings of industrial property.</P>
      <P>The management of the industrial property portfolio of IDA Ireland is a statutory function of the agency as laid out in section 16 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986.  Under section 13, (2) I am precluded from giving directives to IDA Ireland which apply to an individual industrial undertaking.  I have not given a policy directive in relation to the Citywest business campus or the proposed Fingal business park.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate of £7.6 million is sought specifically for the development of a digital park at Citywest business campus.  The establishment of a digital park is seen as an essential ingredient in the drive to capitalise on the rapidly growing telecommunications sector.  IDA Ireland will take a 50 per cent share in the digital park at Citywest with the balance of the funding being provided by a private developer.</P>
      <P>The decision by IDA Ireland to provide a new 120 acre business park in the Fingal area is in response to the requirement to maintain a land bank for promotion in Dublin and is a natural extension of the existing Clonshaugh industrial estate in Coolock.</P>

The Act applies to undertakings, defined as a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated corporate body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service.</P>
    <P>The independent Competition Authority is responsible for enforcing the Competition Acts and in particular section 4 of the 1991 Act which prohibits, all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in the State, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the direct or indirect fixing of prices, trading conditions, limiting or controlling production, sharing markets or sources of supply.</P>
    <P>With the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, public enforcement powers in this regard were given to the Competition Authority, there are now two alternative ways for an individual-firm to pursue allegations of breaches of competition rules: (i) take civil action under Section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, or, (ii) make a complaint to the Director of Competition Enforcement requesting him to investigate alleged breach(s) of competition law.</P>
    <P>Any complaints therefore alleging collusion or price fixing are a matter for the Director of Competition Enforcement to investigate.</P>
    <P>The Director also has the power of investigation on his own initiative of any alleged contravention of competition rules that he suspects has occurred or may occur.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be reassured that our incentives for investment, be it domestic or from overseas, are demand driven.  In relation to domestic industry, location is determined by where businesses are being started or whether they are expanding.  These decisions are made by businesses, not by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of overseas investment, the agencies introduce companies to various locations with particular strengths or suitable conditions for the projects.  Grant levels available are negotiated based on the specifics of the project and on the location.  Again, the ultimate decision on where to locate is made by the individual enterprise and <Col N="1714" /> not by either the agency or the Government. Every effort is, of course, made to persuade enterprises to consider locating in areas lagging in development or experiencing particular problems of industrial restructuring.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that regional development is partly about ensuring a good quality of infrastructure everywhere.  In such circumstances, individual regions would then have a chance to demonstrate their own strengths and potential when attempting to attract or encourage enterprise development.  It is the Government's policy to ensure that the most appropriate support is made available, having regard to the need to secure the economic benefits that are the motive for giving exchequer grants, etc.</P>

      <P>I have no statutory power to control the interest rates charged by credit card providers.  However, as Minister for Consumer Affairs, naturally I am concerned that the rates charged by such providers should reflect the recent fall in interest rates generally.  The best way to ensure that providers behave in a responsible manner in this respect is for consumers to inform themselves of the significant variation in the rates charged by providers and be prepared to take their custom to those providers which pass on the benefits of base rate reductions to them.  Healthy competition is the best means of ensuring value for the consumer.  I welcome the arrival of new entrants to the market and I look forward to even greater competition following the introduction of the euro.</P>

I would also exhort consumers to be aware of competing prices and to make the market work by making informed purchasing choices.</P>
      <P>The most recent CSO consumer price index &mdash; October 1998 &mdash; indicates that in the twelve months since October 1997 the CPI rose by 2.9 per cent compared with 3 per cent in the 12 months to September 1998.  Food prices increased by 4.5 per cent during the October 1997 to October 1998 period compared with an increase of 4.6 per cent during the 12 month period ending September 1998.  The CPI also noted that food prices decreased during the month of October 1998 due to, <i>inter alia</i>, falling beef, mutton-lamb, pork and poultry prices.</P>

    <P>As this House will be aware, the general policy of successive Governments since the mid 1980s has been to ensure that there is true competition in the marketplace.  I have already drawn the attention of the Director of Competition Enforcement to a recent debate in this House on the differential between farm prices and retail prices and I have asked him to take such action as he considers appropriate.

      <P>I recently received the interim report of the interdepartmental group, which I have had published, and I welcome its comprehensive examination of the practical issues to be addressed in the implementation of the national minimum wage and particularly the enabling legislation.  The work of this group is building on the valuable work of the National Minimum Wage Commission.</P>
      <P>The interim report of the group dated October 1998 outlines its progress to date and identifies a range of issues that will require further consideration by the group.  In its report the group examined a wide range of issues including the rate to be applied and the implementation date, the scope of the national minimum wage, exceptions and variations, and options for enforcement.  The group has also commissioned the ESRI to undertake an impact study on those sectors of the economy most affected by the recommended national minimum wage and on the economy as a whole. I expect to receive the final report from the inter-departmental group in May 1999.</P>
      <P>The interim report has been widely circulated and the group has invited submissions from interested parties.  The report will provide a sound basis for ongoing consultations with the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My officials are undertaking the necessary preparatory work, including consultations with the social partners, on the details of the legislation although it will not be possible to finalise the legislative provisions prior to consideration of the final report of the group.  As I stated previously I intend to have a statutory national minimum <Col N="1717" /> wage in place by the target timescale recommended by the National Minimum Wage Commission, on the expiry of Partnership 2000, beginning in April 2000.  I have no plans to publish the legislation prior to receipt of the final report of the interdepartmental group.</P>

      <P>Negotiations on a Multilateral Agreement on Investment were held under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, in Paris.

      <P>In April 1998, governments decided to engage in a period of assessment and further consultation and to have no further negotiations for six months.</P>
      <P>France announced in October 1998 that it would not continue with the negotiations.  Negotiations on the MAI have ceased.</P>
      <P>There is a recognised need for a multilateral framework for investment.

Many other countries, including Ireland, have already expressed this view &mdash; see reply to Parliamentary Questions on 21 April 1998. However, there would need to be a consensus in the WTO before negotiations can commence there.</P>

I accepted that report and subsequently, under powers available to me under section 35 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, requested the Labour Relations Commission to prepare a code of practice accordingly.  The LRC, having consulted the relevant interested parties, <Col N="1720" /> duly submitted such a code to me which, by Order signed by me on 19 November 1998, I declared to be a code of practice for purposes of the Sunday work supplemental provisions set down in section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.

      <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, took full effect as and from 1 March 1998.  It provides statutory rights for employees in respect of rest, maximum working time and holidays and it implements EU Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993, concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time.</P>
      <P>The monitoring group on the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, held its first meeting in July 1998 and has met on three occasions since then.  The terms of reference for the group require it to review experience generally with regard to implementation of the Act and of statutory instruments made under it; to assess the effectiveness of the Act and of the statutory instruments made under it; to identify any significant or widespread difficulties in the workplace arising from implementation of the Act and of statutory instruments made under it and to make recommendations as to measures to solve such difficulties; to identify, examine and suggest solutions in relation to any specific difficulties that may be encountered by small enterprises arising from the implementation of the Act and the statutory instruments made under it and to assess the impact of, and identify any shortcomings in, the publicity in relation to the Act and statutory instruments made under it and to make recommendations as to future publicity activity.</P>
      <P>To date the group has identified a number of issues which are causing problems regarding the implementation of the Act and submissions in relation to these issues have been received from the parties concerned.  These submissions are currently being addressed by the group.</P>
      <P>The work of the group, as its terms of reference indicate, is expected to be ongoing.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996 came into operation on 2 January 1997. The purpose of the Act was to revise and extend the law relating to the protection of young persons in employment and to implement an EU Directive on the Protection of Young People at Work.</P>
      <P>At my initiative, a monitoring group was established to appraise the effectiveness of the protection of young persons legislation and to monitor its enforcement.  To date, the monitoring group has met on two occasions.  The terms of reference of the group are to review the operation of the Act to advise on how the Act might be better implemented.</P>
      <P>On the recommendation of the group, a questionnaire was issued in February last to over 50 organisations who might have been expected to have an interest in the operation of the legislation. While the response to the questionnaire was less than expected, in the main, those that did respond supported the suggestion that the provisions of the legislation be better publicised.  In furtherance of this suggestion and at the behest of the group, my officials, as a specific initiative, have contacted publicans in the Dublin area to remind them of their responsibilities as regards the provisions of the young persons legislation.</P>
      <P>A number of other issues are being considered by the group.  The work of the group, as its terms of reference indicate, is expected to be ongoing.</P>

      <P>The Credit Union Advisory Committee has met approximately 309 times since its establishment over 30 years ago under section 27 of the Credit Union Act, 1966.  The committee now operates under section 180 of the Credit Union Act, 1997. It consists of seven members who are active in the credit union movement and give substantial practical assistance to the work of the advisory committee.  The current committee was constituted in 1997 and appointed for a term of three years.</P>
      <P>The committee's statutory function is to advise the Minister for Commerce, and such other persons as the Minister thinks fit, in relation to the improvement of the management of credit unions; the protection of the interests of members and creditors of credit unions and other matters relating to credit unions upon which the Minister, the Registrar of Friendly Societies or such other persons may seek the advice of the committee.</P>
      <P>It is a statutory requirement that the Minister for Commerce consults the committee before making any regulations under the Credit Union Act, 1997.  The registrar is also empowered to consult with the committee on any matter relating to the exercise of his supervisory powers over credit unions under the 1997 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, the committee's work has included the preparation of a report on the training of credit union officers; providing views to the Minister on the adequacy of certain provisions in the published Credit Union Bill, 1996, prior to its enactment in 1997; providing comment to the Minister on the scope of the draft Credit Union Act (Commencement) Order, 1997, prior to its implementation; consulting with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, prior to his giving approval to the draft Standard Credit Union Rules document which was prepared by the Irish League of Credit Unions for its members and providing views to the Minister on the fees to be charged by the Registrar under the 1997 Act, prior to the implementation <Col N="1723" /> of the Credit Union Act (Fees) Regulations, 1998.</P>
    <P>It is my intention and that of the Registrar to seek the advice of the committee in advance of the commencement of the remaining sections of the 1997 Act.  I am also aware that the committee has recently been considering on its own initiative the planned installation of a centralised IT system for credit unions and I salute them on this excellent initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>The shape of Ireland's economy is rapidly changing.  Our gross domestic product, GDP, has grown at an annual average rate of just under 7 per cent per annum since 1990 and this has been translated into a massive increase in employment. Numbers employed have grown by just under 3 per cent per annum in the 1990s overall, and by more than 4 per cent per annum over the last three years.  The latest fall in unemployment to 7.8 per cent is further very encouraging news.</P>
      <P>The availability of a skilled pool of labour is one of the major factors underpinning the current economic boom.  However, given the rapid economic growth of recent years, it is inevitable that skills shortages are starting to emerge.</P>
      <P>The Government is being proactive in identifying where the shortages exist and in adopting strategies to address them.  Efforts in this area are being focused through the work of the Expert Group on Future Skill Needs chaired by Dr. Chris Horn.  The group has produced its first report dealing with skills needs in the high technology area.  In response, I am providing extra resources to FÁS in the 1999 Estimates to increase the number of people being trained in electronics and information technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert group is currently working on its examination of skills needs and labour availability in lower technology sectors, and the services industry.  Sectors being examined include construction, transport and distribution, call centres, contract cleaning, clothing and tourism. <Col N="1724" /> The group will be reporting on these areas in the first half of 1999.</P>
    <P>The work of the expert group is very much driven by industry and its focus is concentrated on areas where employers have reported concerns about skills and labour availability.  In addition to its work under the aegis of the expert group, FÁS is constantly monitoring the skills requirements of industry via its regional network and its sectoral consultative structures.</P>
    <P>As regards the strategies adopted to address identified skills needs, I have already mentioned the increase in training provision by FÁS in high technology sectors.  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the increased provision of apprenticeship training and to the ongoing development of the traineeship system involving collaboration between employers and FÁS.  The Deputy will, of course, also be aware of the responsibilities exercised by the Minister for Education and Science in addressing skills issues.</P>

      <P>Enterprise Ireland organised trade missions to Saudi Arabia, Austria and Russia in 1997 and to Saudi Arabia, Russia, Portugal and China in 1998.  The number of participants on each mission was between six and 25 companies.</P>
      <P>The trade missions were designed to help Irish companies achieve and increase business in selected target markets.  They provided a unique opportunity for companies to establish high level contacts relevant to the development of their business in the market in question.  Trade missions involving Irish companies active in particular markets allow Ireland to make a statement of its commitment to the development of business in those marketplaces.  The trade mission complements the continuous work carried on by companies at an individual level.  Trade missions are generally used in the early stages of market development and are repeated in those markets where the formula is found to be particularly suitable.</P>
      <P>The consolidation of commercial relationships, a key feature of the trade mission and an increased profile for Ireland as a competitive source of supply are the immediate results of such activity.  Participating companies are charged a fee by Enterprise Ireland and will only participate in the first instance if they perceive a benefit to themselves.  Trade missions will only be repeated where there is sufficient demand from Irish companies and this is the best indicator of their value to indigenous Irish industry as a market entry and development tool.</P>

Over the past five years the numbers of jobs lost annually has reduced from a figure of 18,383 in 1993 to just over 14,000 in 1997.  This reflects favourable economic conditions domestically and internationally, and is also due to measures taken by the Government, the social partners, the industrial development agencies and the private sector to reduce costs and improve competitiveness.</P>

      <P>The company named last applied to my Department in 1996 for road passenger licences to provide weekend bus services between Wexford and Dublin and between Wexford and Limerick.  Such licences are issued in accordance with the terms of the Road Transport Act, 1932.  In considering whether to grant or refuse an application for a passenger licence under that Act, my Department is required to have regard to the extent of authorised passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service.  In general, only one operator is licensed to provide a particular type of service over a specific route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the applications referred to by the Deputy, my Department was not in a position to give its approval in view of the existing level of authorised services on the routes in question at that time.  However, in view of the fact that two years have now elapsed since the original applications were received, I have now asked my Department to reconsider the applications in <Col N="1729" /> question and to liaise directly with the company concerned in the matter.</P>
    <P>As outlined in my Department's statement of strategy a review is under way of options for the effective regulation of the bus market which is currently governed by the Road Transport Act, 1932.  This review will focus on fair competition, generally improving customer service, effective enforcement and appropriate integration of services.</P>

      <P>The ewe supplementary measure 1998 is confined to the commonages in the counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo, Galway and Kerry as these were the commonages which were identified under REPS as degraded or in danger of becoming degraded.  It was agreed with the EU that special measures needed to be taken to address the problem of overgrazing in those counties.  As a result sheep farmers in the counties concerned are now required to reduce their mountain ewe numbers by at least 30 per cent of their 1998 quota.</P>

    <P>Commonages in west Cork, Waterford, Tipperary, Louth and Wicklow were excluded from the measure as they were not identified as being <Col N="1733" /> overgrazed.  However, sheep farmers in all areas who were paid headage in respect of mountain sheep in 1998 are eligible for aid under the 1998 winter fodder scheme, payment in respect of which will be made within the next two weeks.  In addition, sheep farmers in all commonage areas will now be able to apply for the new REPS measure which provides for a payment of £80 per acre on the first 100 acres, £8 per acre on the next 100 acres and £6 per acre on the next 100 acres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear on a number of occasions that I am disappointed with the current level of prices being paid by meat factories for cattle.  It seems to me that the meat factories have not fully passed on the benefits of the improved market support arrangements which I negotiated with the Commission earlier in the autumn.  In particular, the quantities offered into intervention have been significantly lower than expected and very little of the 9p per pound increase in export refunds has been passed back to producers in the form of higher cattle prices.</P>
      <P>Cattle prices on the EU market have remained strong throughout the autumn in spite of the Russian crisis.  The fact that the EU market generally has remained strong is due to the fact that beef production in the EU has fallen significantly this year as a result of the calf slaughtering measures adopted in October 1996.  Clearly, this fall in production has created market opportunities for Irish beef exporters and it is evident from the quantity of the export licences issued to Irish beef exporters that a significant quantity of Irish steer beef is currently being exported to EU markets. I believe that the higher prices available on these markets should enable meat factories to pay higher prices for cattle but, in the absence of detailed information on the prices being secured by the meat factories on their sales to EU markets, it is not possible for me to state precisely what additional amount should be paid by our meat factories for cattle.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached with a Libyan Government delegation in July last providing for the reopening of the Libyan market for Irish cattle and beef on the basis of agreed veterinary health conditions and terms of contracts.  This agreement was the culmination of extensive contacts with the Libyan authorities since early 1997.  The Libyan Government, through the General Peoples Committee, formally cleared the agreement before the end of September and written confirmation to this effect was received. Although the Libyan authorities indicated their wish to have the agreement implemented immediately, there have been delays in the conclusion of contracts for Irish cattle.  In order to establish the reasons for these delays, which were of concern both to myself and the Government, our ambassador in Rome, who is accredited to Libya, visited Tripoli again in mid-October.  The ambassador was assured that there was no political blockage to the agreement and that it was now a matter for the Irish exporters to pursue contracts with the purchasing agency in Libya. Ongoing contact is being maintained with the Libyan authorities through every possible channel with a view to ensuring that the July agreement is implemented in practice.  My position is that an official agreement has been reached with the Libyan authorities and that it should be honoured.</P>

      <P>To date this year over £776 million has been paid to farmers under the various EU headage and premium schemes of which almost £476 million relates to payments made under the 1998 schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payments will continue to be made as queries on the scheme applications and area aid applications are resolved so as to ensure that all eligible cases are paid their entitlements.  Furthermore, not all applicants will receive payment because some may be deemed ineligible for one reason or another while others may be subject to penalties because of breaches of the terms and conditions of the schemes concerned.  It should be noted also that payments do not conclude at the end of the calendar year.  For example, under the suckler cow premium scheme and the special beef <Col N="1735" /> premium scheme the regulation provide for advance payments in the year of application with balancing payments being made in the following year.  Payments to applicants under the October 1998 suckler cow premium scheme cannot commence until such time as the six month retention period expires in April 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition, over £122 million has been paid under REPS.  The total amount of annual payments made under the early retirement scheme is <Col N="1736" /> ing table sets out the details for the various schemes.  As a number of applications under the various schemes have outstanding queries it is not possible to determine the value of outstanding payments.</P>
    <P>However, payment targets under the charter of rights for farmers for the main headage and premium schemes are very specific and in 1998 the targets for the commencement of payments have been met or indeed surpassed under these schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120, 123 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The position as regards lamb imports is that as a member of the European Union, Ireland is part of a free trade area in which it is not possible to legally prohibit, restrict or inhibit the trade of lambs from another member state.  Imported ani mals must be accompanied by appropriate health certification.  Under bilateral arrangements trade to and from Northern Ireland does not, however, require health certification.</P>
      <P>All sheep presented for slaughter at an export approved plant are subject to the supervision and control of the Department veterinary office staff. I have satisfied myself that the veterinary inspec torate at the plants are fully discharging their responsibilities in this regard and that all the legal requirements regarding the health status and freedom from disease of these animals are being met.</P>
      <P>As well as being a significant exporter of beef and dairy products, Ireland exports three out of every four lambs produced in this country.  There fore, it would not be in our long-term interest to attempt to impose any unilateral measures to restrict trade in any agricultural commodity.  At the same time, experience has shown the need for, and the value of, long-term supply arrange ments between producers and processors where emphasis on regular supply and quality of prod uct should be of benefit to the sector as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of extensification pre mia, I have made strong representations on a number of occasions to the EU Commission for <Col N="1737" /> the introduction of an extensification premium in the sheepmeat sector.  However, the Commission has not accepted such a proposal on the grounds that the rural world premium, which was intro duced in the context of the 1992 CAP reform package, is of major benefit to the majority of extensive producers in the Union.  Neither have they agreed to the exclusion of sheep from the calculation of stocking density for the extens ification premium.  The Commission argues that to do so would introduce a new inequity between beef producers who also rear sheep and pro ducers who rear cattle only.</P>
    <P>I intend to continue to press the Commission on this issue and on the question of increased rural world premium and a fairer ewe premium scheme in the context of the current discussions on Agenda 2000.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the low level of sheep prices this autumn.  However, lowland lambs are mainly put on the market between May and Sep tember and this year satisfactory lamb prices were available in this period.  About 58 per cent of lambs were slaughtered during these months at prices averaging between 186 pence and 272p per pound.  When prices began to drop to their present levels the bulk of lowland lambs had been sold.  The lower prices later in the year mainly affected hill sheep producers.  The ewe premium is expected to be significantly higher in 1998 than in 1997 and this should help alleviate some of the difficulties on all farms, including those involved in lowland sheep production.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is pri marily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist <Col N="1740" /> in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>Medical cards are an entitlement to a service. The primary test is that the applicant must satisfy the board that his or her income is inadequate and that financial hardship would ensue if he or she had to make provision for certain medical ser vices.  The income guidelines, therefore, are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to indi vidual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>A joint Department of Health and Children health board working group was established early this year to clarify the guidelines on eligibility for medical cards, particularly as they relate to the budget 1996 provision in relation to persons who have been on the live register for 12 months and who take up paid insurable employment and also to participants on approved schemes aimed at the long-term unemployed.  Some difficulties and inconsistencies in the implementation of this pro vision had become apparent and the working group has addressed these.  Health board chief executive officers have agreed with the recom mendations made in the report of the group and have requested that revised guidelines be pre pared.  It is expected that this task will be com pleted shortly.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to payments such as blind welfare allowance, mobility allowance and disabled per son's rehabilitation allowance are subject to a medical examination and a means test.  Regu lations issued by my Department and the Depart ment of Social, Community and Family Affairs specify how entitlement should be assessed.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1998, provided for a single personal public service number, public ser vice card and for the sharing of information across Government departments and specified bodies, including health boards, for the purpose of determining entitlement to benefits.  This pro vision will be most helpful and will improve qual ity of service generally.</P>
      <P>My Department is continuing to work with the health board CEOs to ensure maximum co-ordi nation of means testing in relation to the benefits for which my Department is responsible. However, the benefits involved target in some cases income maintenance and in others eligi bility for health services, for example, the medical card.  These two differing objectives mean that it is very difficult to reach full co-ordination of means testing whilst still achieving the most effec tive outcome for the recipients of benefits &mdash; the primary overall objective with which I am most concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132, 133 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of personal assistance services in a matter for the health boards.  Any individual with a disability looking for such a service should contact the local health board.</P>
      <P>A personal assistance pilot project, funded under the EU Horizon Programme, was carried out by the Centre for Independent Living.  When this project ended in the latter half of 1994 the then Minister for Health agreed to fund the con tinuation of the service.  In 1995 the operation of the scheme was taken over by the Irish Wheel chair Association in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board.  Funding is provided through the Eastern Health Board and currently 38 persons with disabilities are receiving a personal assist ance service.  This model of service may be used by other health boards in providing such a ser vice.  A health board proposing to provide a per sonal assistance service to individuals in its func tional area may broker a service from the Irish Wheelchair Association or other agency which may wish to tender for the contract.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's reference to a service which may be of a temporary nature is not fully understood. However, I am assuming that he is referring to the personal assistance service being provided in various parts of the country by centres for inde pendent living.  The centres use FÁS trainees under the community employment scheme as personal assistants.  There are some problems experienced in the operation of a personal assist ance service by this means which are related to the fact that the community employment scheme is a scheme for the unemployed.  Such problems do not arise in the personal assistance service pro vided by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> The policy of my Department in relation to the personal assistance service is that the number of people with disabilities receiving a service will be gradually increased in accordance with the avail ability of the necessary funding.</P>
    <P>Funding for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities is dispensed through the eight regional health boards.  The allocation of the funding to particular services is carried out by the boards in partner ship with voluntary agencies and service users through the co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services in each board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 143 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All patients attending at accident and emer gency departments of acute hospitals, including those referred by their general practitioners, are examined and prioritised for treatment in accord ance with their medically assessed needs.  The Deputy will appreciate that the levels of attend ance at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict and in this regard periods of exceptional demand may be experienced <Col N="1743" /> and as a consequence waiting periods for treatment may vary.  Every effort is made to keep waiting times to an absolute minimum and it is important to note that patients received appropri ate medical treatment at all times.</P>
    <P>My Department is not considering any pro posals concerning private accident and emer gency units but are concentrating on enhancing the service provided in accident and emergency departments in acute general hospitals.  As the Deputy may be aware, I am providing additional funding of £2 million to be made available in 1999 for accident and emergency services in major acute hospitals including those based in paedi atric hospitals.  This extra funding will enable the hospitals to implement various initiatives in keep ing with the recommendations of the review group on the waiting list initiative.  These initiat ives include measures to free up beds for emer gency admissions through the provision, where appropriate, of alternative step down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods.  It will also allow for the pro vision of enhanced staffing levels, the develop ment of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment-observation areas in accident and emergency departments and an improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will provide an improved service for all patients attending accident and emergency departments.</P>

    <P>I have had inquiries made with An tArd Chláraitheoir and he has informed me that the death mentioned by the Deputy was referred to the coroner.  In these circumstances the Registrar for Births, Deaths and Marriages must await the coroner's decision before registering the death.  I also understand that the coroner has requested a postmortem examination, which has taken place and the result of the postmortem will be available to the coroner within about a week.  It will then be a matter for the coroner to decide whether or not an inquest should be held in this particular instance.  If the coroner determines that an inquest is necessary the Registrar must await the issue of a coroner's certificate before registering the death.  If the coroner decides that an inquest is not required, she will so advise the Registrar, <Col N="1744" /> in which case the death may be registered on foot of a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a registered medical practitioner.</P>

      <P>Of the 118 cases of E-coli 0157 reported by health boards during 1996, 1997 and 1998 to date, it has now been established by my Department that one case resulted in fatality.  This occurred in the Eastern Health Board region during 1997.</P>
      <P>My Department was not aware of this when I replied to the Deputy's question on this matter on 12 November 1998, and I regret this.</P>
      <P>The recently established national communi cable disease surveillance unit, which will provide a comprehensive broad based approach to the prevention of disease, including foodborne dis ease, is currently reviewing the whole area of dis ease notification and E-coli 0157 is being included in this review.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Food Safety Auth ority of Ireland has established an E-coli 0157 task force to examine the issue, and to advise on the appropriate response in terms of regulation, standards and education for consumers and pro ducers.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is pri marily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable without <Col N="1745" /> undue hardship, to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision, previous governments did not feel it was justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or, in the case of children, to their parents' means, as a general rule.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>I would also like to mention that under the long-term illness scheme persons suffering from a number of conditions including mental handicap, can obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition.  In addition children under 16 receiving treatment for mental handicap are exempt from public hospital statu tory charges.</P>

    <P>Details of the individual local authority six month returns for 1998 and 1997 are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Local authorities were instructed by my Department in June 1997 to make the necessary arrangements to provide local Garda superintendents with a sufficient quantity of books of on-the-spot fine notices, in relation to prescribed offences under section 28 of the Act for use by the Garda.  The Garda expressed satisfaction with these arrangements.  A further circular issued to local authorities in February 1998 requesting them to ensure that the necessary arrangements had been put in place.</P>
    <P>While improved performance, generally, may be attributed to the flexible and extensive powers <Col N="1751" /> available to local authorities under the 1997 Act, there is a continuing need for more responsible behaviour by the public as well as rigorous enforcement of the law by local authorities.  For this reason, my initiatives in support of litter pollution control address public education and awareness as well as performance on the enforcement of the Litter Pollution Act.</P>

In the interests of ensuring that the places available on the scheme are given to those who need them, applicants must apply prior to taking up employment &mdash; this is clearly indicated on the relevant application form and information leaflet.</P>

      <P>In assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed, such as free board and lodging in the family home, is also taken into account.  The purpose of including this item in the assessment of means is to ensure that, by taking account of different household circumstances, <Col N="1755" /> the available resources are targeted at those who are most in need.</P>
      <P>The abolition of this assessment, even in the limited manner suggested by the Deputy, would have the effect, therefore, of removing this targeting and would have cost implications.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I would not be disposed to introduce measures along the lines proposed.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for the administration of a wide range of schemes involving payments and supports to people in various circumstances and these require means testing on an individual basis to determine the extent of need and the appropriate level of entitlement.</P>
      <P>In my view there is a need to balance the desire for uniformity and consistency across all social welfare means tests with the need to ensure that the system is sufficiently flexible to be able to respond adequately to the specific needs of differing categories of customers.  The different methods of assessing earnings, for example, as between the various social assistance payment schemes reflect, in many instances, specific policies being pursued by the Department, which are aimed at targeting the needs of particular groups of recipients.</P>
      <P>Progress has been achieved over recent years in streamlining the assessment of capital across a number of schemes.  Any significant advance in the co-ordination of means testing, however, involves considerable costs to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I have concentrated my efforts, in this area, on bringing forward legislation earlier this year which provides for a single personal public service number, public service card and for the sharing of information across Government Departments and specified bodies, including the health boards, for the purpose of determining entitlement to benefits.  This significant development will enable the public service to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery and provide ease of access for the public to a wide range of services at single point of contact.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides for the exchange of means data between the various agencies and this will reduce considerably the need for people to undergo multiple means tests when claiming their entitlements.  It will be possible to have a central means database which, under specified circumstances, can be accessed by the various agencies where a customer has made a claim for an allowance, grant, etc.  This will result in improved and quicker service to customers dealing with public sector organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will, in addition, continue to seek to streamline the administration of means <Col N="1756" /> tests in the interests of improving the quality of service to customers and of ensuring that their specific needs are reflected in the nature of the means tests involved.</P>

Their claims were reviewed on 12 May 1998 and they were requested to submit certain documentation, specifically in relation to the building of their new house, so that their means could be reviewed.</P>
      <P>They failed to submit the required information and their claims were disallowed by a deciding officer, with effect from 1 July 1998, on the grounds that they had failed to fully disclose their means as required by the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>They were notified of the decision, and of their right to appeal, on 24 June 1998.  No appeals were received, nor have the persons concerned replied to correspondence issued to them in August and September of this year.  If, however, the necessary documentation and information is submitted at this stage, their claims will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>The commission to examine the role of the Irish language voluntary organisations, established by the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in January 1996, and which reported in January 1997, made a number of general recommendations and some specific recommendations on the voluntary Irish language organisations activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal recommendations of the report &mdash; Treo 2000 &mdash; related to the establishment of An Chomhairle Ghaeilge which would have responsibility for all Irish language affairs, for funding and for general policy direction on all aspects of the language.  An chomhairle would prepare a development programme for the language and would examine the need for a Language Equality Bill.  The report also recommended that the funding system for the voluntary Irish <Col N="1757" /> language organisations should be project based and that An Chomhairle Ghaeilge would assess and fund projects.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to establish An Chomhairle Ghaeilge.  The functions proposed for that body are appropriate to the Minister and to the Irish language State boards under the aegis of my Department, i.e., Bord na Gaeilge and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The Deputy is aware that work has commenced in my Department on the preparation of a language Bill.  As regards the funding of the voluntary Irish language organisations, the system now in place which is operated by my Department provides core annual financing for them and specific assistance for projects put forward by them which are accepted for funding.</P>
    <P>Certain recommendations in the report are directed at the voluntary Irish language organisations themselves, and to other bodies, and will be a matter for them to consider.</P>

      <Quest>if she will make a statement on the regulatory regime she favours for indigenous and community programme services as per her statement to the Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language on 29 September 1998; and the way in which this policy is facilitated or hindered by the fact that the issue of technical licences for digital services across all platforms is a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation rather than the proposed broadcasting regulator.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in my statement to the committee, the role and function of the Independent Radio and Television Commission will be expanded.  The new body will have the function of setting standards for broadcasting content and advertising.  Any indigenous provider of broadcast content will have to obtain authorisation from the broadcasting regulator.  The regulatory mechanism envisaged is a system of contracts between the expanded Independent Radio and Television Commission and the content providers.  Platform operators will be free to carry the services provided by those who have obtained content provider contracts and will be prohibited from carrying the services of an indigenous content provider where no contract is in place.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of clarity, I should say that this regime will not apply to the free to air services of RTE, Teilifís na Gaeilge or TV3.  These services will continue to operate under the terms of existing legislation in the case of RTE and TV3 and the provisions relating to Teilifís na Gaeilge which will be included in the forthcoming legislation.</P>

      <P>No agreements are in place with regard to reciprocal arrangements for access.  The proposed broadcasting legislation will provide a statutory structure whereby, if the expanded Independent Radio and Television Commission is satisfied that satisfactory reciprocal arrangements are in place for the carriage of RTÉ, Teilifís na Gaeilge and TV3 in Northern Ireland, DTT capacity for Northern Ireland broadcasters can be guaranteed on this side of the border.  I have in mind that terrestrial Northern Ireland broadcasters that have been traditionally available here will be embraced by these provisions. Before such arrangements could be put in place, a considerable amount of discussion will have to take place with and between broadcasters and between my Department and the British Department of Culture, Media and Sport.  If the British wish to proceed with this issue it may be necessary for them to make legislative provisions for it.</P>
      <P>I should say, of course, that nothing in the proposed legislation will prevent the carriage of Northern Ireland broadcasters on digital platforms here whether reciprocal arrangements are in place or not.</P>

The new grant scheme will be administered by the local authorities.

    <P>It can be seen from these figures that the personnel strength of Rathcoole Garda station has improved considerably in the recent past.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that Rathcoole Garda station is open to the public each day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. When the station is unmanned, the telephone call diversion system linked to the district headquarters at Ballyfermot comes into operation.  In addition, the Rathcoole patrol car provides mobile patrols for 22 hours out of each 24 hour period.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that the opening of Rathcoole Garda station on a 24 hour basis is not recommended at present as they are of the opinion that gardaí are better utilised on outdoor patrolling duties than engaged in the additional administrative duties which would be necessitated by increasing the opening hours of Rathcoole.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Department of the Environment and Local Government has issued the necessary instructions to the local authorities, who are responsible for publishing and distributing these notices to local Garda divisions but that five Garda divisions have not yet received the necessary documentation.

      <P>I have said on many occasions in the past, I believe that the most effective strategy in dealing with drug addicted offenders is a combination of appropriate treatment, education and rehabilitation.  Treatment for drug addicted prisoners is currently available in all prison institutions as part of the general medical services available to all inmates.  Any offender who is willing to make a real effort to stop abusing drugs and who shows the necessary commitment and motivation is supported by appropriate medical intervention and therapeutic counselling. It is, however, unfortunately the case that many offenders refuse to grasp the opportunities provided to address their addiction.</P>

    <P>Since taking up my appointment I have made it a priority to tackle the problem of drug abuse and addiction in the prison system.  My Department now has an agreed policy on substance abuse with the Eastern Health Board.  A plan is being drawn up at present to implement this policy. In addition to examining the feasibility of providing a drug free area in each prison and increased detoxification facilities, it is intended to consider the development of further educational and training courses suitable for addicts and <Col N="1765" /> which could be devised in conjunction with an aftercare programme.  Progress in developing drug treatment programmes and drug free areas is greatly hampered by overcrowding in the committal prisons.  However, this obstacle will be removed as the prison building programme progresses. The opening of the new women's prison at Mountjoy, a new male remand centre at Cloverhill and a new male prison in Portlaoise in 1999 will help alleviate this problem.</P>
    <P>During 1997, following medical assessment, approximately 1,650 inmates in Mountjoy Prison received the standard 14 day drug detoxification programme in the prison.  This programme is operated by the medical personnel in the prison and is aimed at weaning addicts off drugs by means of gradually reducing dosages of substitutes such as methadone.  More intensive treatment is available at the drug treatment unit which has been in operation in Mountjoy Prison's health care unit since July 1996.  The unit is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community. One hundred and fifty six inmates have been admitted to the drug treatment unit since it opened.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are weekly narcotics anonymous meetings in the unit.  Individual counselling is also available on request from the Probation Service and voluntary organisations such as Anna Liffey, Coolmine Therapeutic Community and the Merchant's Quay Project who visit the prison regularly.</P>
    <P>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling in and use of illegal drugs in the prisons.  These include video surveillance, improved visiting and searching facilities, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing.  It is my intention to continue efforts to reduce the level of drug abuse in the prison system.</P>
    <P>The Working Group on a Courts Commission has presented its fifth report on the establishment of drugs courts.  It is expected that the drugs courts when they are established will lead to a reduction in the number of treatment places needed in prisons as drug abusing offenders convicted for minor offences may be steered towards non-prison treatment options rather than be committed to prison in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the various treatment options available to drug addicts in prison are making a positive contribution to the fight against drug abuse generally in Irish society today.  I recognise, however, that more needs to be done and, as I have indicated, I am currently examining other options to improve the level of services available to drug addicted offenders.</P>

      <P>A grant of £300,000 was allocated in 1994 under the sports capital programme towards the development of an indoor track at the stadium in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1997, the executive committee of the <Col N="1767" /> stadium submitted a proposal for the development of an outdoor track and upgrading an existing building at a cost in the region of £660,000. They requested that the grant allocation of £300,000 be re-allocated for this proposal.</P>
    <P>I recently met with a representative from the committee and a number of representatives of the National Athletics and Cultural Association of Ireland where I pointed out that I am anxious to ensure that duplication of resources is kept to a minimum and that I would like to see all athletic organisations working together for the ultimate benefit of the sport in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that any development of an outdoor track at the stadium must be considered.  My particular concern in relation to athletics facilities is to ensure that Government funding for such facilities is well focused, that there is no unnecessary duplication or overlap and that arrangements are in place to ensure that utilisation of the facilities will be efficient and well co-ordinated.  Given, in particular, the level of investment involved, I am not therefore in a position to make a decision on assistance for the development proposed pending further developments on a unified athletics body, and an agreed strategy for the future development of the sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 181 together.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved.  The response may take the form of full or part-time special support teaching depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently considering all applications, including the application from Stradbally national school, for special support teaching in the context of these new arrangements. I expect that allocations of special support teaching will commence in the near future and continue through 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188, 189 and 191 together.</P>
      <P>Guidelines which were issued by my Department to primary schools in 1991 and to second level schools in 1992 set out the procedures to be followed in dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse.  The guidelines emphasised the obligation on school authorities to ensure that allegations or suspicions are reported to the health authorities.</P>
      <P>The procedures to be followed within my Department where an allegation of abuse is received are set out in an internal instruction which was issued in 1995.  Where an allegation relates to a teacher or other member of staff of a school, the procedure requires that the appropriate school authorities be notified by the Department. The response of the school is then monitored by an internal committee of the Department which is chaired by an assistant secretary. Where the allegation is the subject of a Garda investigation, my Department would expect school authorities to suspend the teacher in question pending the outcome of the enquiry. In such cases, my Department continues to pay the teacher's salary and also the cost of the substitute teacher.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Deputy Bruton's priority question yesterday, a letter of complaint relating to the case referred to by the Deputies was received by the Department in 1982.  This letter referred to the removal of a primary teacher from his position as principal of a primary school as a result of allegations of abuse of boys in his classes in the period 1965 to 1970.  There was no reference in the letter to the number of pupils involved.  The letter also indicated that the author had been in touch with the authorities of the secondary school in which the former principal was then teaching.</P>
      <P>As I stated yesterday, I regard as seriously lacking the manner in which the Department responded to this complaint and there can be absolutely no excuse by reference to the standards of the time.  The Department's papers on the matter were not forwarded to the health board or the Garda at that time, nor was any action taken in relation to any future employment of the teacher.  The Department's papers were, of course, made available to the Garda at their request during the course of their investigation earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present a working party representative of the education partners is examining the existing guidelines to ensure that they represent a comprehensive and fully updated response on this issue.  In addition, officials of my Department have liaised with a working group in the Department of Health and Children which is reviewing <Col N="1774" /> child abuse guidelines, and it is expected that updated guidelines will be issued to schools early in 1999.  These will place an obligation on school authorities to inform the Garda, the health boards and the Department, and will lay down strict guidelines relating to their duty of care.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is envisaged that the new Teaching Council Bill will provide for clear procedures relating to the de-registration of any teacher who is convicted of child abuse offences. I would also like to emphasise the value of preventative strategies in combating the evil of child abuse, and in this context initiatives such as the Stay Safe programme will continue to play a critical role in promoting an awareness among pupils of inappropriate behaviour on the part of figures in authority.</P>

      <Quest>if he has reassessed the need for an additional teacher at Pope John Paul II national school, Malahide, County Dublin, in view of the inspector's report and in view of the fact that there are three third year classes with an average of 39 pupils which is unacceptable to parents, pupils and teachers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The authorised staffing at John Paul II national school in Malahide in the current year is a principal and 18 teachers.  This staffing is based on the school's enrolment of 553 pupils in September 1997.  The school also has a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The inspector's report to which the Deputy refers does not appear to have been received within my Department.  However, the inspector has been requested to submit a report on the current situation in the school.  As soon as this has been received and assessed, the staffing allocation at the school will be reviewed and my officials will correspond with the board of management directly in this matter.</P>

      <P>The family to whom the Deputy refers reside 0.  8 miles from Barraduff national school, and 0.4 miles from the existing route of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1775" /> Children who do not qualify for free transport on age or distance grounds may be allowed farepaying transport, subject to spare seats being available after all eligible children have been catered for.  This is also subject to no extra cost being <Col N="1776" /> involved by way of altering or extending the route of the existing service.</P>
    <P>As the children in question are not eligible for free transport in the first instance, it is regretted that it would not be open to my Department to extend the service as requested.</P>
