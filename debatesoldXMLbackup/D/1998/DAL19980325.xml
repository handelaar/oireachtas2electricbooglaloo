      <P>It is proposed to take No. 9a, motion re Revised Estimates for the Public Service; No. 21, Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1998 &mdash; Committee Stage; No. 4, Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial and Court Offices (Amendment) Bill, 1998, Order for Second Stage and Second and Remaining Stages, with no time limit; and No. 2, Employment Equality Bill, 1997 [Seanad] &mdash; Second Stage.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) No. 9a shall be decided without debate and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; and (2) Private Members' Business shall be No. 35, Door Supervisors Bill, 1997 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed) and the proceedings on the Second Stage thereof shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>There are two proposals to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 9a agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Private Members' Business agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <P>When will the Defence (Amendment) Bill come before the House?  Will the Defence Acts require further amendment in view of the disquieting reports about the threat of anthrax in the UK?  Will we need to have discussions with our counterparts there to ensure such a threat does not involve this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Minister for Defence to note the Deputy's comments in that regard.  The Defence (Amendment) Bill is fairly short.  Its heads have been approved by the Government for drafting and it is hoped to bring it before the House in the middle of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to debate the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill tomorrow.  To prepare our spokesman, the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, submitted a number of questions on the legal advice available to the Taoiseach regarding his statements on the matter in the House, but they were ruled out of order.  In advance of tomorrow's <Col N="3" /> debate, will the Taoiseach answer the questions on the advice available to him and any other advice he received on the unamendable nature of the terms of reference without legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has been published and it is not the practice to state the advice given by the Attorney General.  If there are particular questions about which the Deputy is concerned, I will try to get answers for him, if it will help to brief his spokesperson for the debate on the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are clear issues involved. The Taoiseach informed the House that it was not possible to amend the terms of reference of an inquiry without amending the primary Act, but information in the media from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform last weekend stated that is not the case.  The Taoiseach said the advice of this and previous Attorneys General was that the terms of reference were unamendable. We simply want to know the basis of that advice before debating the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a great deal of my knowledge from the Irish media, for which I am very grateful, but I take my legal advice from the Attorney General.  On this issue we went by the Attorney General's advice, and we have made that absolutely clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will that advice be made available to us?  Will the Taoiseach's assertion that this was the view of successive Attorneys General be clarified in advance of the debate tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will clarify it again here.  That advice was the basis for the need to change the primary Act; the terms of reference of a tribunal of inquiry set up by statute and in session cannot be amended in any other way.  In this case, the chairman of the tribunal asked that they be amended and to do that we have to change the primary legislation.  The enabling legislation will be passed here tomorrow and we will then deal with the precise changes sought by the chairperson of the tribunal.</P>

      <P>Item No. 10 on the weekly Order Paper states that Dáil Éireann should note the commencement on 10 December 1997 of the United Nations Human Rights Year which will culminate on 10 December 1998, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.  That matter has been on the Order Paper for some time.  When is it proposed to debate that motion?  Is it intended to trawl the laws of the State to ensure they are in line with the declaration and that they are being fully implemented?  I am concerned in particular about the plight of the 1,000 or so people with a mental handicap who are currently being held in psychiatric hospitals where they should not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="4" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome a debate on the matter as soon as parliamentary time can be made available.  I hope most of our laws comply with the declaration.  It is always a matter of priority to ensure we comply with such declarations. Since independence we have always tried our best to comply with all declarations introduced by international bodies as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this matter a number of times.  There are people with a mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals who should not be there.  If they need to be in residential care, they should be in a different type of care.  It is not a psychiatric illness with which they are afflicted. We are breaching the UN Declaration on Human Rights by continuing this practice which has been going on for generations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is to be presented before the end of March to the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inquire about two items of promised legislation.  One is in the &ldquo;also entered&rdquo; list to transpose Article 3a of the European Union Directive designed to ensure coverage of major sporting events free to our television. In the light of the abuse of the exclusive purchase of coverage of sporting events I was informed, on the last occasion on which I raised this issue, it would be part of the broadcasting Bill.  There will be several other occasions between now and the end of the year when issues such as the coverage of rugby will arise.  This is promised legislation.  It is a simple Bill.  If the Minister introduced a Bill to implement the <Col N="5" /> European Directive it would probably have the support of all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessarily a simple Bill but the proposals are being developed in the Department and will be published later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The second item on promised legislation is a simpler question.  Will the Taoiseach indicate which of the Bills, the copyright and related rights Bill or the broadcasting Bill, will be introduced first?  If the copyrights Bill is first, will it take into account broadcasting issues that arise in relation to copyright, digitalisation and the music industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Bill will take account of those items and it will be ready in the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Which Bill will be introduced first?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The copyright Bill is shorter and will be introduced first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We were assured that issues of digitalisation and copyright would be dealt with in the broadcasting Bill at the end of the year.  Do I take it, therefore, that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has had consultations and taken into account the proposals that affect music, copyright which is affected by digital layout, and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two copyright Bills: a short copyright Bill and a copyright Bill of over 400 sections.  There is pressure from the United States and elsewhere to have the larger Bill completed. Given its importance it will receive priority and we hope it will also be ready in the summer.  Some of the digitalisation matters have to be addressed in that copyright Bill.  The issue of digitalisation, as it affects broadcasting, will be dealt with in the broadcasting Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very serious because on a previous Order of Business we were told that the lead Department, in introducing digitalisation as it affected broadcasting, multimedia and new services, would be the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  That legislation was promised and in fairness to the Minister it is complex legislation.  The reality is that the 400 section Bill to satisfy US copyright interests will have sold the pass for the second legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the 400 section Bill take into account the introduction of digitalisation as it affects broadcasting and multimedia or will the broadcasting Bill later in the year follow a large Bill introduced to exceed and sell the pass in relation to copyright to US interests?  We had a meeting yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking questions.  The only questions in order are when the Bill will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a consistency between the undertaking I got in this House, more than once with you presiding, that the broadcasting Bill would handle the issues of digitalisation?  We are now being told that under the US copyright Bill, which is extensive, in respect of a piece of music laid out in digital format, the original artist will lose copyright.  That will happen in June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going into detail which is not in order on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Some attempt should be made to clarify the inconsistency in the information given to the Dáil.  We were given an undertaking that the introduction of digitalisation and legislation required would be in the context of major broadcasting legislation.  In fact the broadcasting legislation was delayed in order to handle this. We are now being told our broadcasting legislation and digitalisation will come in after we have passed the US copyright legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot proceed in that manner.  Will the Deputy please resume his seat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three Departments involved in these issues: Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Public Enterprise and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  The broadcasting aspects are dealt with by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  The Department of Public Enterprise deals with the telecommunications aspect of the legislation.  The copyright legislation deals with issues affecting authors and producers.  We hope all three items of legislation will be ready this year.  The reason for this is that digitalisation is moving ahead apace, more than people in the European Community believed it would.  If we are to keep abreast of these issues it is important to update all our legislation in these areas to ensure we can deal with it successfully.  There will be two copyright Bills this year and a broadcasting Bill.  Two of those Bills will deal with the issue of digitalisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Government's intention to introduce legislation to prohibit advertising by solicitors in personal injuries cases and, if so, when?  In relation to the deafness cases before the courts, is it the Government's intention to introduce legislation to cap compensation awards or to present the expert group report to the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the second matter, we are awaiting the assessment of the report which will be available shortly.  No decision has been made in that area.  In relation to advertising <Col N="7" /> by solicitors, legislation is due in that area to restrict advertising in certain areas.</P>

Does the Government intend to bring legislation before the House as a result of the agreed protocol or is it envisaged that the House will debate the protocol?  Now that an agreement has been reached with the Chinese, will it be possible to put our own house in order? Anxious parents in the Southern Health Board area who wish to adopt Chinese children are currently faced with an 11 month delay in having assessments carried out by the health board.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In Part I, page 6, line 6, after &ldquo;a dhaingniú.  &rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Ní chuirfidh an daingniú seo as do bheartas an Stáit seo maidir le neodracht mhíleata.  &rdquo;,</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>In Part II, page 6, line 14, after &ldquo;1997.  &rdquo; to insert &ldquo;This ratification shall not compromise this State's policy of military neutrality.  &rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It seems the Green Party is now the only party recognised by the Dáil that supports Irish neutrality. I was in mischievous mood when tabling the amendment because I was aware it would put a spanner in the works.  It is up to the other parties to state where they stand on this important issue.  The parties which comprised the so-called rainbow coalition were involved in the negotiations on the Amsterdam Treaty.  This puts them in a difficult position.  Likewise, the parties which comprise the present coalition were also involved and probably now recognise that Irish neutrality is a lost cause so far as they are concerned.</P>
      <P>Had we been on the ball and really interested in Irish neutrality we would have done what the Danes did and sought the inclusion of a protocol.  Had the Labour Party been truly interested in neutrality it would have adhered to the promise made in its manifesto in 1992 to enshrine neutrality in the Constitution.  This was advocated by one of its leading members, Roger Cole of the Peace and Neutrality Alliance, but, like so many others in the Labour Party who advocated neutrality, he has been put to one side.  It seems the Labour Party cares more about the colour of Ruairi's tie than it does about neutrality.</P>
      <P>The position of the Fine Gael Party has always been clear.  It supports a European army, which is the stated aim of the Christian Democrats &mdash; the People's Party &mdash; of which it is part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many misleading statements during the debate.  The Green Party believes Irish <Col N="12" /> neutrality will be weakened and the European Union further militarised following the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty.  The common foreign and security policy is dealt with in Article 5.  Contrary to what has been said, the proposed changes will confer significant new powers.  The European Union will have an enhanced role at the expense of member states when it comes to a common foreign and security policy.  It is the Union, not the Union and its member states, as stated in the Maastricht Treaty, that will define and implement a common foreign and security policy.  The new Article J.2 allows the Union to define the principles and general guidelines for a common foreign and security policy and to decide on common strategies and adopt joint actions and common positions.</P>
    <P>Article J.3 states that the European Council shall define the principles and general guidelines for a common foreign and security policy, including matters with defence applications.  Article J.7 provides for the progressive rather than eventual &mdash; the word used in the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; framing of a common defence policy with the involvement of the Western European Union which, as we are aware, is a military group based on nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>The European Council will have the power to decide whether an EU common defence policy should be established, with the proviso that the decision must be referred back to member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.  This is an important issue to which I will return.</P>
    <P>More decisions will be taken by qualified majority voting.  I wish to deal with this matter in some detail because it is important that we deal with the facts.  We have often been accused of scaremongering on this important issue.  It will be extremely difficult for the ordinary person to come to terms with this complex treaty.  I hope the Commission will deal with it in some detail as people should know what is involved.</P>
    <P>A new high representative, the present secretary general of the Council, will be appointed and assisted by a new planning and early warning unit, the personnel of which will include individuals from the Western European Union.  This can be viewed as an embryo Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Western European Union will be further integrated into the European Union.  A protocol has been attached to Article 7 which provides for the drawing up of arrangements for enhanced co-operation between the Western European Union and the European Union within a year of ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty.  Article J.7.1 states that the progressive framing of a common defence policy will be supported, as member states consider appropriate, by co-operation between them in the field of armaments.  It can be seen, therefore, that we are being sucked into a military alliance and that the European Union is being further militarised.</P>
    <P>It is a significant development that the so-called <Col N="13" /> Petersberg Tasks have been included in Article J.7.2. These include not alone humanitarian and peacekeeping issues but also tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking, which is a euphemism for making war.  It seems we spent our time in negotiations trying to come up with a formula of words to give the impression that we were protecting Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that decisions made under a common foreign and security policy will have to be unanimous.  We have been informed that more decisions will be made by qualified majority voting but that unanimity will be required in respect of matters with military or defence implications. The important point is that everyone will not have to say yes.  There is a new constructive abstention provision which will allow a member state to qualify an abstention with a formal declaration. This means that it will not have to apply the decision but that it will accept that the decision commits the Union and will refrain from any action likely to conflict or impede Union action based on that decision and that the other member states shall respect its position.  I ask people, as we approach 22 May, to go through this in some detail and make themselves aware of what is involved.</P>
    <P>More than one third of the weighted votes of member states will be required to block a unanimous decision.  Ireland has three votes; Austria, four; Sweden, four; and Finland, three.  The total number of votes is 87.  We could vote no but there will be enormous pressure to allow a coalition of the willing to proceed.  This is a most important point.  We are witnessing the steady erosion of Irish neutrality and are gradually being sucked into a military alliance.  The Government like its predecessor is allowing this to happen.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Labour Party chose Adi Roche as its candidate in the presidential election.  I think it was John Waters who said this was a cynical exercise because Adi Roche's views on issues such as this are diametrically opposed to what the Labour Party stands for.</P>
    <P>On the issue of foreign policy, the European Council will be allowed to operate by qualified majority voting when adopting joint actions and common positions or taking any other decision on the basis of a common strategy and when adopting any decision, implementing a joint action or common position.  These joint actions are binding on all, although a form of emergency brake exists where a member state can declare that &ldquo;for important and stated reasons of national policy it opposes a decision taken by qualified majority voting&rdquo;.  It can then be referred to summit level where unanimity applies.  There will be enormous pressure to refrain from pulling any emergency brake cords.  Ireland's independent foreign policy will be increasingly overwhelmed by its larger partners.</P>
    <P>When considering any future referenda and common defence provisions, Article J.7 provides for the progressive framing of a common defence <Col N="14" /> policy which might lead to a common defence should the European Council so decide.  This will be accepted or rejected in accordance with the member states' constitutional requirements. There is controversy as to whether a referendum would be required in Ireland if the EU decided on a common defence.  I refer to the opinion put forward by an eminent barrister Dr. Diarmuid Rossa Phelan, Jean Monnet lecturer in European law at Trinity College who states:</P>
    <P>Although the position in European law is not crystal clear, it seems that as a matter of Irish constitutional law there would be no requirement for a referendum.  This is because if the Constitution is amended to license ratification of the proposed treaty which encompasses the competence to frame progressively a common defence, and to take a formal decision to institute a common defence, there will not necessarily be any development which would amend the treaties or add a new treaty competence for which a referendum would be required.  The new Article J arguably marks the end of the constitutional competence to remain neutral.  Neutrality itself is not constitutionally mandated.  However, there are constitutional provisions on sovereignty, independence, the common good and the designation of the organs of government which exercise the power delegated by the popular sovereign through the Constitution.  These provisions conflict with the extension of Union competence in this area.</P>
    <P>Dr. Rossa Phelan is also referred to in chapter 12, &ldquo;The Context of Ratification&rdquo;, of <i>Amsterdam: What the Treaty Means.</i></P>
    <P>Those who say Ireland's neutrality is safeguarded in the Maastricht Treaty and now in the Amsterdam Treaty also like to quote Article J.7.(3), which states:</P>
    <P>The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states and shall respect the obligations of certain member states, which see their common defence realised in NATO, under the north Atlantic Treaty, and be compatible with the Common Security and Defence Policy established within that framework.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that only the first half of the sentence was quoted in the Chamber.  It is often stated that &ldquo;certain member states&rdquo; means the neutral states in the first instance and the 11 NATO states in the second.  Taken as a whole, one can see that the second half of the sentence is contradictory.  Considering what has been happening in Article J.7, progressive framing of a common defence policy with the assistance of the Western European Union, which might lead to a common defence, it is difficult to see how anyone could be complacent about our neutrality not being prejudiced.  I know I am in a minority when I speak in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> Deputy Gay Mitchell's party is in favour of a European army.  He should look at his party's record and that of the European People's Party in the European Parliament.  I know the Deputy made a song and dance about what happened in Shannon but his party favours abolishing Irish neutrality.  I did not mention Fianna Fáil which advocates a policy of &ldquo;whatever you are having yourself&rdquo;.  People recognise Fianna Fáil for what it is and it is happy to see Irish neutrality going down the Swanee.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty will be a difficult battle and I suspect all the forces will be brought out.  I tabled this amendment to give the lie to the other parties' statement that they support Irish neutrality. The only parties which support it are the Green Party and, perhaps, the Socialist Party.  We will be in the minority during the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty.  I hope we are able to put forward our points of view in the media.  However, it will be difficult particularly when the other five parties are insincere and disingenuous.  The test will be if they accept my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision will be theirs to make because Article J.7, of which one selective part was quoted by Deputy Gormley and on which I will not rely for my argument, copperfastens Ireland's neutrality in the Constitution for the first time.  It does that not because of the general provision which Deputy Gormley quoted but because there are three other provisions in Article J.7 which replaces the old section J.4 in the Maastricht Treaty.  The first provision is that should a decision be made in the future to have a common defence or to merge the Western European Union with the EU, it would have to be taken unanimously by the European Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The second requirement is that the decision would have to be ratified in accordance with the constitutional requirements in each member state.  In the case of Ireland, that means there would have to be a referendum here post the Single European Act.  The Deputy's suggestion that this article compromises our neutrality is not correct and does not stand up to examination.  Every time there is a debate on membership of the European Union we have been told we are constantly compromising our neutrality.  That was said when we joined the European Union, after the implementation of the Single European Act, during the debate on the Maastricht Treaty and it is being said again now. In terms of those who seek closer co-operation in the area of common defence, Article J.7. represents a weakening of the old Article J.4. While it states there may be common defence at some time in the future, if there is a decision on that or if a merger of the Western European Union is considered, that would require the three steps I mentioned, a unanimous decision of the European Council and the holding of a referendum in each member state after an intergovernmental process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government of the day for whatever reason wanted this country to join NATO, there would be no need for any meeting of heads of State or Government to take a unanimous decision, for an intergovernmental conference over a prolonged period or for a referendum to be held by member states.  Post ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty this State will be able to join <Col N="17" /> NATO much more easily than it would be able to become a full member of the Western European Union or to take part in a common defence of the European Union.  That is because Article J.7. of the Amsterdam Treaty, if ratified, will enshrine Irish neutrality in our Constitution in the context of our membership of the European Union.</P>

The Cabinet and a sub-committee of it, of which I was a member, spent a long time considering it before we agreed to its contents.  The three provisions I mentioned are set out in Article J.7.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>They include a requirement that there be a unanimous decision by the European Council, an inter-governmental conference, similar to the reflection group and the intergovernmental conference process which lasted two years, and that proposal would have to be ratified by each member state in accordance with their constitutional requirements, which post the implementation of the Single European Act would require a referendum to be held in Ireland.  For the first time ever we are writing into the Constitution that a referendum must be held on a common defence or merger. That is in addition to a section of Article J.7. on which Deputy Gormley put such emphasis. We should stop adopting a bogeyman approach to this issue.</P>
      <P>I respect that some Members have a different view from mine on security and defence.  I would like to hear those different views without Members calling each other militarists or saying that those who support an alliance are holier than thou.  Hearing the views of other Members on this issue would help me to form my opinion.  I have ideas about what I would like to see in this area. If there were a fully integrated European Union, at some stage in the future our State might be asked to consider joining some common defence. However, if we enshrine Article J.7. in our Constitution, the State will not be able to join one unless the electorate of the day, most likely our children and grandchildren, decide to do so.  Their decision would be based on whether they considered that would be good or bad for the country. If they were to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that would not happen, because the decision must be ratified by each member state if it follows an intergovernmental conference.  We should not introduce a bogeyman approach to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a very different view from that contained in Deputy Gormley's amendment and his views on the Amsterdam Treaty.  It would be worthwhile if we had a debate on the security and defence issue.  Fine Gael has put forward a <Col N="18" /> document in my name proposing that Ireland should join Partnership for Peace.  Deputy O'Malley, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, has undertaken a process of discussion and debate on the broader issue at that committee.  That is a healthy development and I look forward to hearing different points of view in that debate because I could learn something from them.  We will not learn anything about this if we do not have an opportunity to exchange views.  I congratulate Deputy O'Malley on bringing this about.</P>

      <P>I will made a few brief remarks because on Committee Stage we are meant to direct our attention to a specific amendment, Deputy Gormley's in this case.  I will try not to engage in a slagging match with him although I find his tone quite offensive and I agree with Deputy Mitchell that he has an ignorance of the complexity of these matters and his views introduce the bogeyman approach to this matter yet again.  If Deputy Gormley were to spend a little more time considering these matters in this debate which is necessary and in the broader debate which, as Deputy Mitchell said, is also necessary, he would realise that under no circumstances will this constitutional amendment, which I am confident will be carried by the people on 22 May, pose a threat or a danger to the Government's position, and I believe the position of the majority of our people, on NATO membership or on the Western European Union.  That is a fact.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on his bicycle to tell the Irish people that Irish neutrality is yet again in danger. As Deputy Mitchell said and as I presume the Minister of State will say, the reality is we were very specific on our position in framing our contribution to this debate which took place over two years.  There can be no change in Ireland's position on neutrality unless there is a referendum specifically to deal with that.  I do not see one arising at present, but there may be one in ten or 15 years' time.  That is a fact of life.  If there is such a referendum and Deputy Gormley is still a <Col N="19" /> Member he will be able to put forward his view and look for support for his position from the people.  The reality is we need to have a rational debate on the architecture of European security. I called for that at the foreign affairs committee and there will now be a debate.  This is not the context for that to be discussed, but we in this House need to address a position on behalf of Ireland in relation to NATO.  The Western European Union and the OSCE and other things that are happening.  The foreign affairs committee has started that process.  There is no point in Deputy Gormley burying his head in the sand and pretending those organisations do not exist.</P>

      <P>My day is made and I thank Deputy De Rossa for his helpful intervention.  It is important that we stick to the facts in terms of the implications for the Amsterdam Treaty which I expect to be ratified by large numbers of people. We are only discussing one aspect of it and there are wider issues in terms of what it will do for Ireland and its participation in the EU.  The amendment tabled by Deputy Gormley is unnecessary and we will oppose it as a matter of principle, not policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty is being narrowed to the spurious question of neutrality.  That is a pity because there are many excellent developments in the treaty which take account of the reality of the world in which we live rather than that which existed in the 1920s, 1930s or 1940s.  There is increasing globalisation of economics, business and commerce and change in people's perceptions of who they are, their nationality and identity, etc.</P>
      <P>Ireland as a member of the EU is involved in an extraordinary project.  We are trying to create a federation of European states which share sovereignty with each other in the common interest and good of the people of Europe.  It is an exciting project which requires people to make a great deal of change in how they perceive themselves, Europe and the world.  We must share our power to govern ourselves with other states in Europe and it is in our interest that we do so because this State on its own cannot hope to control the forces at large in the world.  Examples of that are to be seen every day of the week.  When a multinational company decides it wants to move its operation from this State to another, nothing can be done but at some point, through our membership of the EU, standards could be applied to multinational companies that operate in Europe.  That is a bigger prize than the retention of an outdated power which can no longer be used to any effect.</P>
      <P>Sharing sovereignty inevitably will lead to sharing defence.  This will mean common defence because as long as Ireland remains a member of the EU it will become involved in common security and defence at some point and the Irish people have accepted this time after time since taking up membership.  Ireland has one of the smallest populations in Europe and when we enter negotiations we must make sure we argue for the best possible deal whatever evolves in economics, commerce, defence and security not just for the people of Ireland but for those of Europe and the world generally because the EU is about to become not only one of the most powerful trading blocs but political entities in the world.  We cannot continue to narrow the debate on Europe to the issue of whether we should hang on to traditional neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the debate on the issue of European <Col N="21" /> security and defence and the general question of its architecture which has already commenced at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  It is inevitable that there must be common European security and defence, but I disagree with Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party on its nature. That is what should be debated, not whether there will be common defence but what form it will take.  I have grave reservations about the way in which the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is evolving and I do not want Ireland to become a member of it.  That is not to say there should be no European defence mechanism or system.  This is the debate we should be involved in rather than the perennial whinge about losing something we probably never had in the first place except in name.  I recall a former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, saying we are neutral on the side of the West. That language is a pretence and I appeal for rational debate on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Green Party says it is opposed to the Amsterdam Treaty because it sells the pass on Irish neutrality but that is factually incorrect.  One does not have to be an expert to read the sections involved and compare them to the original section in the Maastricht Treaty.  One will find the traditional position of Ireland on defence is strengthened by the new treaty.  One must examine what is behind Green Party opposition to the issue of defence.  It is in strange company as Sinn Féin is the only other party of which I am aware who also oppose it for the same reason.  The root of it is a reversion to an ultra-nationalism.  One must also examine who else in Europe is adopting this position and by and large it is the ultra-right. The Tories in Great Britain and the unreconstructed Communist parties in Europe take this position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am glad I do.  We must examine the reason for this.  My argument is that it is an unwillingness to share with the rest of Europe and the desire to renationalise everything and bring everything back within the national boundaries.  The pretence that we can exist behind national boundaries and not share any of our power or sovereignty with the rest of Europe is not possible and to believe otherwise is to live in cloud-cuckoo-land.  We need a real debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was one of approximately 30 Deputies and Senators who recently visited Brussels to familiarise themselves with the thinking of the Commission and Parliament on the Amsterdam Treaty.  There was a Green Party representative on the delegation.  Deputy Higgins, who was also present, can confirm what I am about to say.  During our visit we met Mr. Tindemans, a former Prime Minister of Belgium.  He openly supported the idea of a European common defence and argued that it was in the blue print for Europe at the time of the establishment of the European <Col N="22" /> Economic Community.  However, it was not possible to do it at that time and it has not been possible to do it since in the way he would like.  He wants a European common defence, a European army and the arms industry in Europe to be made more competitive and modern.  A debate on the arms industry in Europe and what it will do would be more relevant.</P>
    <P>He outlined in considerable detail the European common defence he believes is necessary for Europe.  I asked him if he believed the Amsterdam Treaty brought us in the direction of a European common defence or a European army.  He said that it brought us in the other direction and that the veto provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty makes it next to impossible to achieve a European common defence or army. This man has no arguments about Irish neutrality, was not involved in the debate here and has no agenda other than that he wants a European common defence and European army.  Having been involved in the process from the very beginning, his view is that the Amsterdam Treaty takes us in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>Anyone who argues that the Amsterdam Treaty undermines the pre-existing position of Ireland in relation to neutrality either does not understand what is in the treaty or is deliberately misleading the House.  If they do not understand the treaty they should read it again and if they are deliberately misleading the House and the public they are doing no service to politics.  All they will do is generate apathy about Europe or create a debate about something that is not real.  The real debate is the nature of the European Union we are trying to create, the security we are trying to create and the defence mechanism which will clearly have to be created at some point in the future.</P>
    <P>I appeal for a broader debate on the Amsterdam Treaty which deals with important developments, for example, the control of policing across Europe.  One of my main problems with the Maastricht Treaty was that major sections were outside the direct control of the Parliament and Commission and involved interstate arrangements. This was true in the case of policing.  I am very pleased that this is dealt with in the treaty and is subject to accountability and whatever transparency currently exists.</P>
    <P>My other main problem with the Maastricht Treaty was the lack of transparency.  We still have not gone far enough in this regard, but it has been improved.  The social protocol, which was stymied in the Maastricht Treaty, has been brought into the Amsterdam Treaty.  The inclusion of employment as a key objective of the European Union is a major step forward.  The decision to include in the Amsterdam Treaty the power to deal with social exclusion is a major step forward for the poor, of which there are approximately 50 million in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty has also brought in a range of principles relating to equality, freedom, etc., which were not in previous Europe treaties. <Col N="23" /> These transform Europe into more than simply a trading bloc and attempt to create a new political entity which guarantees the rights of citizens.  Are the Green Party and Sinn Féin seriously arguing that we should throw all that out over a spurious argument about neutrality which has been copperfastened in the Amsterdam Treaty?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I strongly support Deputy Gormley's amendment.  The issues must be debated honestly and clearly.  We must rely not on the assurances given by Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael or anyone else but on the written word in the text of the Amsterdam Treaty.  I have studied the wording carefully, particularly section J which deals with military alliances and common defence and security, and there is no doubt that it is a giant step in the direction of a European army and a European armaments industry.  I am not saying that the minute the treaty is passed such an army will come into effect and start to roam the globe imposing its will.  That is not what is at stake. However, the thinking behind it and the provisions implied are very clear in their intent.</P>
      <P>I attended the high level briefing in Brussels by Commission and Parliament officials and representatives. I listened carefully to what was said and was alarmed by it.  There is no doubt that the thinking of leading bureaucrats and politicians of the major states in Europe is that they want to see an EU army and an EU armaments industry and the EU acting as a major economic power with a military wing.  It is clear that their thinking is influenced by the new world situation.  Previously it was the old Stalinist bloc versus the capitalist West and in that sense NATO and, in particular the US, was the military wing of the capitalist bloc.  Since the ignominious collapse of the corrupt dictatorships in the Stalinist world there is an entirely new world situation and the major states in the EU want to rival the United States both as an economic and military power in global terms.  Some of those who spoke were beside themselves with anger about, for instance, how the Middle East is developing politically. They see EU states putting in economic and diplomatic resources while the US walks away with the diplomatic kudos because it has military muscle, and those people believe that is what makes the difference.  They want to take over the role played by the US in such areas, especially those where the EU has an economic influence. The J paragraphs of the Amsterdam Treaty are designed to provide the means by which the EU can set up a military and armaments wing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference in the Amsterdam Treaty to the armaments industry is sinister.  It is not binding on all EU states to subscribe to this industry but we should consider the philosophy and thinking behind the treaty.  Even if our State never became involved in the armaments industry we would be moving in parallel with what is happening.  This country should not stand idly by while an armaments <Col N="24" /> industry is built up by a significant number of EU states.  The State should even object to a common army, because these developments are in the interests not of working or unemployed people but of the privileged élite and the political establishment.  Our objection should be on the basis of democracy.  It is reprehensible that any private company in the EU should provide arms or instruments of torture to other countries, including dictatorships.  We should not be silent because that is to acquiesce to it.  We should take the opportunity of the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty to condemn and work against such actions.</P>
    <P>The amendment deals with the letter of the agreement.  Members should turn to the text and explain it to the people if it does not mean what is on paper.  Paragraph J.1 states that the Union shall define and implement a common foreign and security policy, covering all areas of foreign and security policy, and then lays out the objectives. Paragraph J.1.2 provides that member states shall support the Union's external and security policy actively and unreservedly, in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity.  What do those words mean, if not what the public would understand by them?  I urge those who will vote on this issue not to read newspaper articles only but to read the Treaty, especially section J for the purposes of this debate.  It is readily understandable.</P>
    <P>To oppose the Treaty, as the Socialist Party and I will be doing, is not to retreat into a de Valera-like State behind walls of isolationism. Virtually no one wants that.  What is the alternative to what is proposed by the bureaucrats and the political and conservative establishment? European social democratic parties could have put forward an alternative but did not.  The drift of the social democratic and so-called socialist parties has been to become more conservative in their economic and political policies.  They are now mirror images of the conservative parties, so we cannot take guidance from them about a socialist or left view on the Amsterdam Treaty or military alliances.  The real alternative is an alliance of working people, trade unionists, the unemployed and the poor, working for a totally different agenda from that set out in the Treaty, under which the swords are beaten into ploughshares and the money wasted on military matters and armaments is put into social policy, social investment and transforming the lives of the millions condemned to poverty and homelessness even in privileged countries.  That is the alternative to taking a giant step towards a military alliance, which is undoubtedly what is involved in this treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt the sincerity of those opposed to the Amsterdam Treaty but I disagree fundamentally with them.  My memory does not stretch to the 1972 referendum but I do remember the subsequent building blocks towards closer integration, when the Irish people were consulted about the Single European Act in 1987 and the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.  We hear the same <Col N="25" /> argument again and again &mdash; in 1972 and 1987 we were selling our neutrality and in 1992 we were going to be conscripted into a European army which would lead to Armageddon.  I have heard no acknowledgement or apology from the quarters who pursued those arguments, because if we sold our neutrality once we cannot sell it again. Those people got it wrong in 1972, 1987 and 1997 and are getting it wrong today.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is about closer European integration, preparing for enlargement, taking cognisance of a changing world after the Cold War and the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and recognising that Europe is not just an economic trading bloc but also has political responsibilities which it has failed to live up to thus far.  The most contentious issue in the treaty is the common foreign and security policy.  How many times have the people of Ireland wrung their hands and hung their heads in shame when watching the genocide in Bosnia, the Tiananmen Square massacre, the reports from Algeria and other human rights abuses throughout the world?  We are a member state of the largest trading bloc in the world which has not followed through, politically speaking, on its moral responsibilities to other areas.</P>
      <P>The common foreign and security policy is concerned with facing up to those responsibilities and it does so without compromising our military neutrality.  In the past we have operated under UN auspices in peacekeeping and, in Somalia, in peacekeeping. As I understand the Amsterdam Treaty, under the general guidelines and principles of our United Nations membership we are extending those areas of activity to be carried out by the European Union.  That is the least we should be obliged to do and I fail to see how that conflicts with our neutrality or goes against the wishes of the vast majority of Irish people.  Any recollection of the shame and powerlessness we felt as a nation in light of some of the major international crises that have arisen would clearly bring that home to us.  We are virtually powerless in regard to areas like the Middle East.  In addition, there is an increasing reluctance on the part of the United States to repeatedly step into the trouble spots of the world.  There is a danger that if we do not face up to our responsibilities that vacuum will be filled by increased bloodshed and attacks on human rights in these trouble spots because there will not be an international police watchdog to carry out these duties.</P>
      <P>I regret that much of the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty is getting bogged down on this specific issue because it is not the most important element of the treaty.  Whole areas of it are of enormous importance to the ordinary citizens of Europe and this country yet they merit virtually no media coverage and do not generate much political debate because we have all been side-tracked by the debate on neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that there is not much public engagement in this whole debate, notwithstanding the efforts made arising out of the difficulty in <Col N="26" /> implementing the Maastricht Treaty and the fact that a very small proportion of the electorate turned out here.  It was defeated in Denmark on its first attempt and it was only marginally passed by the French.  There was a recognition that we had to be more open and transparent about how we did our business and that this was a treaty which would deal with issues that were more important to the ordinary citizens than the other major issues such as the Single European Act, creating the Internal Market, the Maastricht Treaty and paving the way for a single currency.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this treaty are far more focused on the needs and requirements of the ordinary citizens of the European Union.  It goes into great detail on matters such as proofing future policies so that the interest of the consumer is protected.  It refers also to protecting the environment and ensuring that all policies put forward by the Commission or the Council are proofed from an environmental view point.  It allows member states to have higher standards in environmental and consumer protection provided they do not militate against the interests of other member states.</P>
    <P>These issues are of major importance to the member states but they are not being mentioned in this debate.  There is a whole raft of provisions with regard to non-discrimination on a variety of grounds including sexual preference, membership of ethnic minorities, disability and equal pay for equal work.  These matters are of tangible importance to the ordinary citizens of the European Union but they are getting very little coverage.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that this country has always been pro-Europe, according to any opinion polls carried out, there is a danger that the issue will be confused on polling day if there is more than one referendum.  During the presidential election people were given a ballot paper on Cabinet confidentiality but they did not know that issue was being put to them.  If one examines the debates on Europe currently dominating the headlines, the question of neutrality arises if the debate is on the Amsterdam Treaty.  It is a red herring.  Other issues dominating the European headlines include reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and that the fact that our entitlement to Structural Funds will be significantly reduced.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that a significant proportion of the electorate will view this as being a plague on all their houses, that Articles 2 and 3 should not be watered down, that the gravy train has begun to slow down anyway and perhaps it is time to pull up the hand brake on the European movement towards closer integration.  If we confuse the issue by having more than one referendum to be determined on the same day, particularly if there is a referendum on Articles 2 and 3, there is a danger that an unholy alliance will combine to defeat the Amsterdam Treaty.  I urge the Government to reconsider that matter.</P>
    <P>I fully support the Amsterdam Treaty.  Neutrality is not an issue.  If anything, the Amsterdam <Col N="27" /> Treaty rows back somewhat from the provisions of Maastricht.  For that reason, I cannot support the amendment put forward by Deputy Gormley.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy will, because it is important that we have a debate in this House.  Deputy De Rossa said it was important that we have a broader debate.  We had a broader debate here on the Amsterdam Treaty and I went into a fair amount of detail on my party's position. We are dealing with my amendment which concerns neutrality.  Helmut Kohl, the great architect of European union &mdash; I do not know if he will be in power much longer &mdash; said that a European army lies at the end of the road of European union.  Deputy Mitchell's party is aligned to the Christian Democrats.  The people's party has made its position clear in Europe and rather than trying to distance himself from that position, Deputy Mitchell should embrace it.  We could then have an open and clear debate in this House.</P>

      <P>It is in order for me to respond to some of the criticisms made of me during the course of the debate.  Deputy De Rossa referred to his party's position and I see a real shift in that position.  I wonder does the former Deputy, Kathleen Lynch, agree with Deputy De Rossa when he says that he would now like to see a <Col N="28" /> common defence policy in Europe.  I doubt if she would.  Deputy Spring did not answer many of the points I made.  When the Labour Party was in Government its manifesto stated that it would enshrine Irish neutrality in the Constitution.  Why was that not done?  What was the position of the presidential candidate on this question?  Deputy Spring is accusing me of being emotive and not having my facts straight on this issue, but what was the position of the Labour Party presidential candidate on this matter?</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note that while I was called ungentlemanly and accused of every sort of thing when I was interrupting this morning, those gentlemen are now interrupting me. However, that is in the nature of democracy and the hurly burly of politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to the rise of the Right and tried to somehow lump the Greens in with the far Right, Sinn Féin and other parties. <Col N="29" /> That is fine and the sort of thing politicians do. However, as we move towards a more integrated and centralised Europe, it is very interesting to see the rise of the ultra Right.  Le Pen did very well in France last week as did Joerg Haider in Austria.  These groups are coming to the front because there is a vacuum and they feel power is being taken away from their countries.  The Maastricht criteria have caused huge increases in unemployment in these countries which has given rise to this mass disruption.  Those are the facts. The Deputy needs a deeper analysis of the problem. It is a very glib analysis to say this must be a good thing because those who oppose it are on the far Right.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed made a good point about the huge level of apathy.  However, apathy stems from ignorance.  The results of last week's surveys were quite scary in terms of the amount of people who did not understand the Amsterdam Treaty. About 70 per cent of those surveyed did not know the first thing about the Treaty.  If that is the situation as we enter the last few weeks of the campaign, there will be a very low turnout for the referendum.  The turnout could be higher if we had an honest and open debate on the issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give a few examples. Deputy Higgins referred to Article J.7 to which I will give the background.  Article J.7 brings arms co-operation into the body of the EU Treaty for the first time.  I covered this extensively earlier when I quoted from the Treaty.  It states &ldquo;the progressive framing of a common defence policy will be supported, as member states consider appropriate, by co-operation between them in the field of armaments&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Mitchell is aware of the European Commission report entitled &ldquo;The Challenges Facing the European Defence Industry&rdquo;. This seeks closer co-operation with NATO, the Western European Union and the Western European Armaments Group and for Structural Funds <Col N="30" /> to be challenged into what it calls &ldquo;dual use&rdquo;, which is civilian and military research projects.</P>
    <P>The argument was reiterated by the EU Industry Commissioner, Martin Bangemann, a former member of the FDP in Germany.  He argued last November that the EU had to get its armaments act together it if was to compete successfully for the lucrative contracts now on offer thanks to NATO expansion which means that Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic must update their weaponry.</P>
    <P>I am giving further background on this issue because I have been accused of not going into enough detail.  I will go into as much detail as people want.  A 1997 report to the European Parliament called on the negotiators at Amsterdam to give a decisive boost to the development of a common armaments policy by incorporating this objective into the Treaty.  We know the background and what the Treaty states.  Unfortunately, Deputy Mitchell was not here when I spoke about the decision making and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the so-called unanimous way in which these decisions will be made.  That will not happen in reality.  I take the chairman's point about not repeating what I said in the body of the debate, but if Deputy Mitchell wishes he can read it in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>We have an opportunity today, if people are sincere about it, to protect Irish neutrality.  It will be interesting to see who supports this amendment. I am disappointed, but not surprised, the Labour Party has decided not to support it. However, Deputy Spring got one thing right &mdash; I came to the House this morning on my bicycle and I am proud to have done so.  His new Party Leader, Deputy Quinn, also now rides a bicycle so there must be something in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is unnecessary; if I thought it necessary I would have tabled it.  I believe in the Maastricht Treaty and that the Amsterdam Treaty has copperfastened the position of this State in regard to its freedom to opt in or out of common security or defence.  That is in the Treaty.  It is a matter for this House, and subsequently the people, to make that decision.  We live in a democracy and it is the people's decision at the end of the day, regardless of what Deputy Gormley or anybody else thinks. The amendment is unnecessary and will not be agreed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask Deputy Gormley to address the question of what alternative he proposes.  We have heard Deputy Higgins's alternative, which is some alliance between trade unionists and the ordinary people across Europe.  However, in what way would that affect anything or create a situation in which the people of Europe, through their elected representatives, could create institutions and constitutions to govern Europe and its international relations in a rational and civilised way?  Deputy <Col N="32" /> Higgins has offered a non alternative &mdash; it is not anything.</P>
    <P>What is the alternative to ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty?  The alternative to carrying the Amsterdam Treaty is the Maastricht Treaty.  We would lose all the advantages made in the Amsterdam Treaty, which this country played an important part in achieving, because of a wrong headed view on neutrality.  I am not surprised at the position taken by the Green Party; it does not have a consistent position on anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Totally consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe so. However, I am surprised at the view taken by Deputy Joe Higgins.  He ignores everything on the social and economic front, including unemployment, social exclusion, human rights, equality and non discrimination.  Everything is ignored in the interest of the pursuit of a non issue.  This is not to say that the arms industry and defence are non issues.  The argument that in some way the Amsterdam Treaty undermines the Irish right to choose to enter or not to enter a defence or any other kind of alliance is wrong.  I have outlined the issue we should debate.</P>
      <P>My argument that the position taken by the Green Party and the party represented by Deputy Higgins is closer to that of the extreme right and left in Europe is valid.  That is not to say they are aligned to them politically but their analysis brings them into the same ground.  If we do not have an EU where states co-ordinate, co-operate and share their sovereignty we have a situation where they retain their own powers, including the right to say yes or no, and each state would have the right to do or say anything it chooses on arms. For example, there would be nothing to stop France, Germany and Britain from co-operating and co-ordinating their arms industries in tandem with the US.  By contrast, if the EU takes some control in this area there would be at least some power to restrain that development.  If we opt out we have no control and that is true of any area outside the control of the EU Commission, the EU Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty represents a significant step forward on the Maastricht Treaty.  The debate for the Green Party, the socialist parties and other parties of the left should be about the next phase of the development of the EU.  What form should European defence take?  What controls should there be on the arms industry? Should we not argue for control of the development of nuclear weapons in Europe?  We can have a say on that not as an independent country on its own but as part of the EU, arguing within the councils of the Union, the European Parliament and the EU Commission.  That is where we have power.  We are a small island state of approximately 3.5 million people with an Army of approximately 11,000 and a few aeroplanes. What power do we have outside the EU to argue <Col N="33" /> about the arms industry or the nature of European or world defence?  We have no clout outside the EU.</P>
    <P>In ending up on the same terrain as the extreme right and the unreconstructed left the Green Party and the Socialist Party are inevitably lining up with those who want a renationalisation of Europe, the withdrawal behind state boundaries and isolationism, which this country went through, much to our sorrow, in the 1930s, 1940s and the early 1950s.  I do not want this or future generations to go through that.  It was a waste of a generation and a mistake.  We need to argue for greater democracy and transparency and for the rights of citizens in Europe.  Some progress has been made on that in the Amsterdam Treaty, but not enough.</P>
    <P>In recent times there has been much concern about Iraq and the proposal by the US, supported by Britain, to launch a war against Iraq.  I raised this in the House and opposed the idea, arguing that diplomacy was the way forward.  While I did not have any influence on the matter I was delighted that Kofi Annan and the UN succeeded in averting a war through diplomacy.  If a war had taken place and if the terms of the Amsterdam Treaty were in place, enabling the EU to address the issue, does Deputy Gormley or Deputy Higgins believe that this country would have been obliged to participate in a war against Iraq?  If the answer is no there is no basis for their fears.  I believe this to be the case because, under the terms of the treaty, for as long as this country says no we are not involved.  That is the nub of the issue.  Under the terms of the treaty we cannot be obliged to be involved in a war against our wishes.  To argue otherwise on the basis of the intention behind something which may become manifest in ten or 20 years is the wrong approach. The practical effect of the treaty must be considered as it is applied to real situations.</P>

      <P>Let me remind Deputy Gormley that I am no more responsible for what individual Christian Democrats say throughout Europe than he is for what individual Greens say. Members of the Deputy's party have opposed the transfer of funds to Ireland to build much needed infrastructure, funds which create jobs and help the economy to become productive.  I do not hold the Deputy personally responsible for their comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Institute of European Affairs has published a report entitled Legal and Constitutional Implications of the Amsterdam Treaty.  In the section dealing with a common foreign and security policy, Mr. Eugene Regan, barrister, undertakes an assessment of the situation.  On the implications for Ireland in connection with our neutrality and defence commitments he argues <Col N="34" /> that no obligations arise under the treaty.  In his assessment, following the intergovernmental negotiations the Amsterdam Treaty consists of a mixture of constitutional provisions, legislative commitments, policy clarifications and modifications of procedures.  He says that, in a strict sense, the Intergovernmental Conference did not constitute a constitutional convention devoted purely to constitutional issues in the treaty.  He goes on to say that, in the case of CFSP, it is essentially a modification of procedures with the same policy objectives.  There is no great leap forward, no widening of objectives or hard and fast commitments to any policies.  He points out that any individual member state has the right to say no to participation and can block other member states adopting a particular policy.  He concludes that in both policy areas, Ireland has the right to say no which, according to our Supreme Court, is the ultimate measure of sovereignty.  That is his assessment of flexibility and the common foreign and security policy published by the Institute of European Affairs in 1998.  Mr. Regan has given a fair, balanced and impartial assessment of the situation.</P>
    <P>Article J.7 is the article which covers all of this area.  I am surprised that neither of the Deputies who have spoken in favour of this amendment has sought to quote that article in its entirety.  It is a very long article which contains five separate sections.  It is clear from the article that the three requirements I mentioned earlier, the requirements of an intergovernmental conference, a unanimous European Council decision and a referendum in accordance with the Single European Act, copperfasten Irish neutrality.  Frankly, I am not too sure whether I favour this section of the Amsterdam Treaty.  Article J.4, which has a looser interpretation, might be a more favourable section to give effect to in the Constitution.  That is going to be changed now by Article J.7 and will require three specific, clear steps at some stage in the future if the question is ever to be decided upon.</P>
    <P>The argument which is being put is something of a red herring.  I am not too disappointed by that.  Deputies do a service in a debate of this kind by putting an alternative point of view, but they might at least have based their point on something contained in the treaty proposals.  I see nothing to support any of the arguments they have made.  In Article J.7 it is clear that the position as explained by Mr. Regan in Legal and Constitutional Implications of the Amsterdam Treaty is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  This will be my last intervention because we are in danger of flogging this horse beyond existence.  We are talking about perhaps 2 per cent of what is contained in the Amsterdam Treaty.  It is important in the wider debate to remind the public that we are consolidating each of the three so-called pillars of the European Union based on the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gormley has levelled some charges at the Labour Party this morning.  I do not claim, <Col N="35" /> and I never did, either as leader of the party or as a member of it, to speak for all the membership of the party.  We are a democratic organisation. There are very different views within the Labour Party, as there are in other parties in this House in relation to common foreign and security policy.  The Labour Party's position is that we are not committed to membership of either the Western European Union or NATO and, unless that is changed by party conference, it is the position we will be maintaining.  I have expressed views in this House in relation to Partnership for Peace.  It does not arise in the context of this amendment, but I have strong views about the propriety of our joining Partnership for Peace.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley addressed the question of common foreign and security policy as if it were a venial sin for us to be discussing common foreign and security policy in the European Union. On the contrary, it is very important for us to discuss and develop common foreign and security policy.  I welcome the provision in the treaty whereby the Secretary General of the Council will become the high representative in relation to foreign and security policy and we will have, for the first time, a planning cell in the European Union &mdash; we remember the great frustrations in the 1970s and the 1980s and the much quoted Kissinger remark &ldquo;who do you call in Europe?&rdquo; We had another example quite recently when the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cooke, was speaking in relation to Iraq.  When asked whether he was speaking for the European Union &mdash; he is currently President of the Council &mdash; or for the UK, sadly he had to say he was speaking only for the UK.  While not being in any way militaristic, we have responsibilities in relation to the Middle East, in relation to the Gulf region and in relation to Africa, and we are going to have more and more responsibilities.  If we are to be serious about making a worthwhile contribution to world politics on behalf of the European Union and on behalf of the Irish people through the European Union, we need to develop as quickly as possible a sophisticated common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa mentioned the armaments industry.  Sweden has a huge armaments industry and it is a neutral country.  It makes its contribution at our debates the same as everybody else. I have had very difficult debates with my French counterparts in relation to the nuclear industry, but they have their points of view.  They remind us that if we had been trampled on in the late 1930s and 1940s we might have a different view on the nuclear industry.  That is their view, and we have ours.  I am not a supporter of the nuclear industry and never have been, nor do I intend to be.  However, we have to argue our point at the table in an articulate and well informed way.</P>
    <P>I genuinely believe this amendment is not necessary because the legal position is as outlined by Deputy Mitchell.  I subscribe to that legal position in relation to the Amsterdam Treaty and in <Col N="36" /> relation to our neutrality.  The position is enhanced rather than weakened by virtue of the amendment which will be put before the people on 22 May.</P>

      <P>The Deputy quoted Mr. Eugene Regan.  We can all quote scripture for our own purposes.  I would like to quote again from the article by Mr. Diarmuid Rossa Phelan, barrister, Jean Monnet Lecturer in European Law at Trinity College Dublin.  This quotation is from the document Amsterdam, What The Treaty Means, Chapter 12, p. 167 entitled &ldquo;The Context of Ratification&rdquo;.  Mr. Rossa Phelan states:</P>
      <P>.although the position is not crystal clear, it seems that as a matter of Irish constitutional law there would be no requirement for a referendum. This is because if the Constitution is amended to licence ratification of the proposed treaty which encompasses the competence to frame progressively a common defence, and to take a formal decision to institute a common defence, there will not necessarily be any development which would amend the treaties or add a new treaty competence for which a referendum would be required..  The new Article J. arguably marks the end of the constitutional competence to remain neutral.  Neutrality itself. is not constitutionally mandated. However, there are constitutional provisions on sovereignty, independence, the common good, and the designation of the organs of government which exercise the power delegated by the popular sovereign through the Constitution.  These provisions conflict with the extension of Union competence in this area.</P>
      <P>Who does one believe?  Deputies Spring and Mitchell have decided to go with Mr. Regan.  I am going with Mr. Rossa Phelan.  I believe that Mr. Rossa Phelan is impartial &mdash; and this is the important point.  He has no agenda.  Those people in the institute do have an agenda, and it is a very clear agenda.  If we are to have a proper debate we must have objective opinion, not people who are signed up to the whole European architecture, people who believe we must have a centralised Europe, that we have to have a European Union and a European Army.  I have no doubt that that is where it is heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Deputy about decision making on CFSP.  Deputy Mitchell said Ireland can opt out and that decisions can be made unanimously. However, unanimity does not mean that every country must say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  There is a new constructive abstention provision which allows a member state to qualify an abstention with a formal declaration. <Col N="37" /> This means it does not have to apply the decision but shall accept that it commits the Union.  The treaty states that the country shall refrain from any action likely to conflict with or impede Union action based on that decision and the other member states shall respect its position.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputy Mitchell to read the treaty and then justify his view that it will not have any effect on Ireland's neutral position.  Obviously, it will have an effect and this is why I tabled the amendment.  I believe passionately that we must protect our neutrality.  It is interesting to observe the co-operation between the various parties and Deputies Mitchell, De Rossa and Spring today.  I do not know if they have guilty consciences or they know they are pulling the wool over the people's eyes, but it is obvious they argued for this measure and feel they must defend it.  It is interesting that we are only now dealing with the details of the matter.  Generalities were discussed previously but now we are dealing with the nitty gritty of the treaty and we can see for the first time what will be put before the people.  It will mean that neutrality will be severely watered down.  This is regrettable and I hope the people will be properly informed about the Amsterdam Treaty.  It is most important but, unfortunately, I fear there will be a low turnout as in previous referenda and that apathy will reign once more.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Anxiety was expressed by a number of speakers that the issue of neutrality and the military alliance could confuse the electorate in the debate and the vote on the Amsterdam Treaty.  However, that is the fault of all the major conservative parties in the House which agree with the way the matter will be put before the people.  They will be asked in one question based on a few lines to agree to the massively complex treaty which covers a huge number of different aspects of life in the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> It would have been easy for the Government and the parties which support it to divide the issues and put a number of different questions to the people in the referendum.  For example, the sections dealing with common foreign and security policy could have been the subject of a separate question.  This would have allowed the issue to be dealt with more clearly.  It is an impossible task for the people to deal with this massive tome on the basis of one question to which they must answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It is totally unfair and undemocratic.  Undoubtedly, people who feel obliged to support the Amsterdam Treaty on the basis of economic concerns will cover their doubts on the military and neutrality issue.  Their vote will be based primarily on the economic issues.</P>
    <P>I raised the date of the referendum with the Taoiseach yesterday and asked if the referendum relating to the Northern Ireland talks should be held on the same day.  This matter should be considered in more depth in the coming days.  It would be disastrous to hold the referenda on the Amsterdam Treaty and issues arising from the Northern Ireland talks on the same day.  I hope the Government will not take that course.  Both referenda involve massively complex issues.  It would be extremely unsatisfactory to expect that comprehensive debates would be possible in the few months before the referenda are held on the same day.  It would not allow for a thorough and democratic debate on either issue.  If 22 May has been set for the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  I advise the Government to opt for a later date for a referendum on matters relating to the Northern talks.  There is nothing to be gained from pushing that matter to ensure that a referendum can be held on 22 May in conjunction with the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>It is an old smear tactic to put the Green Party and the Socialist Workers' Party in one camp with the Fascist right in Europe and Deputy De Rossa should refrain from using it.  It is rich of him to adopt that tactic when he was put in certain company by a particular newspaper and was forced to take legal action as a result.  The Deputy should not go down the road of using a cheap debating tactic because it does not address the arguments. If one considers any political party and its policies, one will find points of agreement with the most rabid, right wing and Fascist parties in Europe.  However, this does not mean the substantial policy or issue is wrong.  It is a totally invalid argument and should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>What is the alternative to the current proposals in relation to military alliances?  The alternative is that Ireland should state categorically that a military alliance, an EU army and an EU armaments industry are not in the interests of the millions of citizens of Europe.  We should take a stand on this matter and take all actions possible to oppose it.  This is the alternative to agreeing to the relevant Articles.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell relied on Article J.7. He should reread it because his view was obviously <Col N="39" /> already coloured before he read it the first time and put across his thoughts to his electorate.  He said the Articles were not in any sense a challenge to non-participation in a military alliance. However, J.7.2 states that questions referred to in the Article shall include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management.  What are combat forces in crisis management if not an army involving European states&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i>&mdash;&mdash;interfering in issues outside the borders of the EU?  Such forces will always act under the guise that it is in the interests of the people on whose side they are interfering.  That has always been the case.  The Americans went into Vietnam to support democracy and to save the people, but that type of cover does not deal with the real problem.</P>
      <P>What is the alternative to the EU?  Deputy De Rossa knows it is a big business dominated institution. Much of what is written about social policy and the issues to which Deputy De Rossa referred is flannel.  It is like the flannel of talking about partnership between so-called social partners here.  What does that mean to the 18 million plus unemployed or the millions of poor people in the European Union?  What does it mean to the low-paid and exploited sections of the population in every country of the EU?  They are fine sounding sentiments that will not be implemented by the big business conglomerates that dominate the EU and small business.  In what way do those social policy documents relate to the three workers of Ryanair who are grievously discriminated against and victimised?  Who does EU policy benefit most in that case, the three workers or Ryanair management?</P>
      <P>It is obvious who has benefited most from the EU.  At one time Deputy De Rossa knew the answers to those questions, but he no longer does. From a socialist and left point of view, we are talking about international socialism and the ideas of Karl Marx and James Connolly that were the foundation of all the parties which claim to be on the left.  One should stand out and fight for a different society and not capitulate to the big business domination as in the case of the EU. That is what I meant when I said we stand for a Europe where the big business conglomerates are taken into the hands of ordinary people and where production and security matters are controlled by and in the interests of the ordinary people, not military industrial complexes and the big business dominated conglomerates.  We know what a baleful influence the military industrial complex had in the United States.  Do Members agree the vision of some of the bigger states in the EU and the powerful conglomerates is to create a military industrial complex that will rival the United States?  The Amsterdam Treaty will put in place the structures to enable them to do so.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> International socialism does not mean retreating behind barriers or walls such as de Valera's islands, whitewashed cottages, dancing colleens and so on.  It means positive engagement, but not on the basis of exploitation.  In referring to the 1930s and the 1940s Deputy de Rossa should clarify whether he agrees with the policy on neutrality adopted by this country during the Second World War.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, I have an obvious interest in the debate.  We appear to be rehashing some of the scare tactics that surrounded the Maastricht debate.  Without being disrespectful to new Members, we had this debate on a previous occasion and the roof did not fall down as a result of passing the referendum on Maastricht.  We are discussing an amendment to protect our neutrality. There is nothing in the Amsterdam Treaty that attacks our neutrality.  When Leo Tindemans was asked if Amsterdam was committing us to militarism or military engagement, he said &ldquo;unfortunately not&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins that we do not wish to go back to the good old days of dancing colleens, comely maidens and so on.  We live in a time of change and with change comes responsibility. All parties have taken their responsibilities on European integration seriously.  What is wrong with European integration?  It is essential.  It has opened up many opportunities for us.  The alternative is easy to talk about, but difficult to handle.  Should we revert to renationalisation of the various economies or cherrypick from the agenda?  Should we accept the measures from which we will benefit and cast aside all others even though they may benefit other member states?</P>
      <P>We are in the European Union for better or for worse.  However, if in the future we are not getting what we want from it we can opt out.  We are not compelled to stay in the Union, but those who decide to opt out would have to give it serious consideration.  We must give careful consideration to the options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Mitchell, said a number of times that the question of neutrality and what it means in an Irish context may have to be examined again in the future.  Does it mean we can expect the protection of the European Union in all circumstances?  Does it mean that if at some <Col N="41" /> time in the future a force made a military attack on this island, the European Union would stand idly by on the basis that we are neutral?  Does it mean we can have the protection of the European Union without recognising that at some stage in the future we might be expected to make a constructive commitment?  I do not believe that is what the question of neutrality means.  I am not suggesting we should go down the road of emotionalism and body bags, the quick reaction that covers all eventualities.</P>
    <P>I can recall distinctly the circumstances leading up to the Vietnam War.  President Diem was allegedly controlled by his sister-in-law, Lady Nhua, who was supposed to be a hard hitting lady who did not give any rights, human, civil or otherwise, to anybody.  The Americans and the rest of the free world thought it was a good idea to get involved and Henry Cabot Lodge was sent by the late President Kennedy to intervene on behalf of the rest of the free world.  As everyone knows, it was a useless intervention and 60,000 Americans lost their lives there.  The French had intervened prior to that and were criticised for their failure in Dien Bien Phu.  That is not a useful comparison in this debate.</P>
    <P>We must decide whether we are committed to the European concept and whether European integration is in our interest.  I believe it is.  It has been proven to be in our interest.  Our economy, our people, our quality of life and our standard of living have improved immensely.  There is no point in harping back to the good old days when we did not have such involvement.  At that time we were totally committed to and reliant on the British economy.  We should spread our net, look at the wider market and the opportunities, and influence it from within, if necessary.  As Deputies De Rossa, Spring and Mitchell said, it is better to influence from within than to cry and wring our hands from the outside and complain about what should be done and what other people should do. From the inside we can influence &mdash; just as other small nations can influence &mdash; in a positive and constructive manner.</P>
    <P>The reference to the rise of the right in Germany is unhelpful.  I do not wish to see the rise of the right in Germany or elsewhere.  This is something that has happened with the rise and fall of the tide over the centuries as we will read in history. We can also influence that from within.  It is important that we as committed Europeans are within that arena doing just that.  In the 1930s many people opted out in Europe and throughout the world and even in the United States.  The warning by a number of people of the constant rise was ignored by people who were equally influential and in a position to do something about it.  When looking at history and the conflict we need to look at what could have been done. The way to influence is from within.</P>
    <P>I hope the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty will be passed as a result of major participation by the people on the basis that there is no <Col N="42" /> threat to our neutrality.  We have to look at that in the future and ask ourselves whether, given that we have been involved in peacekeeping and may be involved in the future in peacemaking throughout Europe, we have a responsibility.</P>
    <P>When the atrocities took place in central Europe we all saw on our television screens what was happening and condemned it and said somebody should do something about it.  Who was supposed to do something about it in those circumstances? If everybody adopted the same attitude as us, then everybody would opt out and nobody would do anything.  Hence the Americans have to resolve the internal wars in Europe.  There is something wrong with that concept and we complain that the Americans become involved.  There is another side to the argument that needs to be looked at which is not being dealt with in the context of the Amsterdam Treaty.  It will have to be looked at if we are to take our responsibilities, in relation to all matters pertaining to Europe, seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief.  A number of points need to be clarified.  Deputy Gormley expressed surprise at the position I expressed this morning.  The position I expressed is that of Democratic Left since its foundation, as incorporated in our constitution and founding documents.  I am proud that as a party we have the greatest foresight on this issue on the left in Ireland and in some sectors of the left in Europe.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley said Democratic Left favour more decisions being taken in Brussels.  That is a distortion of what is true in one sense and untrue in another.  We very much favour the principle of subsidiarity: decisions that can be made at local level should be made at local level and decisions that cannot be made there have to be made at a higher level but it is even more than that.  There are circumstances in which the State can no longer exercise power.  To an extent the frustration of people who support right wing parties is because they sense this loss of power: it is not that the power has been lost to Brussels, although some has been transferred there, but the failure of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission, to exercise some power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has no control over currency speculation.  It cannot have in the world today. The greatest benefit of EMU, which I understand the Green Party opposes, is that it will eliminate speculation between the various European Union currencies.  As I understand it, the Green Party supports the idea of a tax on currency speculation. Certainly that is the view of the European Parliament of which the Greens are a member and I am not aware they have opposed it.  The Greens in Germany, Holland, France and elsewhere support the idea of a tax on currency speculation.  We cannot apply that tax in Ireland nor can Britain apply it in Britain, it has to be applied at European level.  Applying a tax is a fundamental duty which the State has always retained to itself as a sovereign power.  In order <Col N="43" /> to have a tax on currency speculation it is necessary to have a central power.  That means the State and all the other European states must cede control over an element of taxation.  That is not an environmental obligation.  It is fundamental if we are to have order in relation to how economies are run.  The point I made earlier &mdash; and it was not made in a smart-alecky way &mdash; is that there is a fundamental lack of consistency in many of the positions adopted by the Green Party.  We do not have the time or the opportunity to debate that today.  There is a lack of consistency in the Green Party's position, even on the environment. What does it mean to say Brussels should have power in relation to the environment?  It means it should have power in relation to controlling what industry does.  That is a fundamental issue.  It is not only a question of emissions from industry because that is only one aspect of protecting the environment.  What does industry manufacture? How and from where does it extract its raw materials?  Does industry also include the arms industry?  Clearly the arms industry has a major environmental impact on the world.  One has only to look at Vietnam, Cambodia, Iraq and so on to recognise that the impact of the arms industry is enormous.  Yet we are being told the European Union should not aspire to any control over the arms industry.  There is a fundamental lack of consistency in the argument today.</P>
    <P>I am not attempting to be a smart alec or to smear any party, but the stance taken by the Socialist Party and the Green Party although not based on the same analysis, has positioned them on the same terrain, as the extreme right.  The extreme right argues strongly that the State should retain total control within national boundaries. However, today's world does not allow a State to do that.  Taking the road advocated by these parties will lead to wholesale alienation from politics because politics at national level will not have sufficient control over what is happening in the world without some centralised powers.  I am not referring to all powers but to recovering the powers which have been lost by the nation state at central, European or even United Nations level so that the citizens of the world can exercise control over the forces operating in the world, for example, the exercise of capital and the choices being made by capital with regard to how it exploits the resources and people of this earth.</P>
    <P>The Green Party and the Socialist Party should examine the impulses behind their statements. They are appealing to chauvinism in Ireland in the same way as elements in France and Britain appeal to chauvinism.  There is an idea that Ireland and the Irish people are unique and that no decision should be made about them unless it is made by themselves.  In today's world we must be able to share decision making about what should happen in the world.</P>
    <P>My statement about those parties sharing the same terrain as the extreme right is not an attempt to smear.  I ask the two parties to examine <Col N="44" /> why they are on that terrain.  What is wrong with their analysis that it has brought them to the terrain of the extreme right in Europe?  That is a valid and legitimate question, not an attack or smear.  If they examine logically and carefully why they find themselves on that terrain they will discover their analysis is wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins said European social policy is just flannel.  That is not true although it is not as good as it ought to be and much more must be done.  I have argued as much for a long period.  I do not claim that what has been achieved in the Amsterdam Treaty is the end of the road.  It is a tiny step forward.  However, in terms of what was in the Maastricht Treaty and in terms of the direction Europe is taking, it is a major step forward. Deputy Higgins and Deputy Gormley should line up with members of the Labour Party and Democratic Left who are seeking even more from social policy instead of trying to force us back into a nationalistic pose.</P>
    <P>The equality directive is an example of the value of social policy in Europe.  As a result of that directive married women in Ireland were paid £260 million when the last Government was in office because the European Court had found that they had been unfairly treated.  There are many other such examples.  The equality issue is a concrete example of the power of the European Union and the European Court to defend the rights of Irish citizens against the actions of their Government.  That is real power over social policy, not simply flannel.</P>
    <P>Some people tend to ignore the fact that whether we agree or disagree with the choices of the people of this country or others &mdash; I do not like the choice the Irish people made in electing the current Government last June &mdash; we must accept them.  In the same way I accept the right of the German and French people to elect their governments and the right of those governments to make decisions and to negotiate in the European Union on behalf of their people.  There is a need for a deepening of democracy in Europe and for greater involvement by the citizens of Europe.  I have argued and will continue to argue for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins and I are socialists.  Deputy Gormley does not describe himself as a socialist and claims to be neither right nor left&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One tends to fall between two stools when one is neither left nor right. However, Deputy Higgins and I, as declared socialists, should co-operate in arguing not for less European power but for greater democracy in Europe.  We should argue for more power for the European Parliament and for more openness and transparency in how the European Council and the Commission do their business.  We should argue for a greater role for this Parliament in the European Union.  Except at times such as now, this Parliament has virtually no control over what <Col N="45" /> happens in Europe.  There are many issues on which we should become engaged.</P>
      <P>This debate about neutrality is a diversion from the real issues of Europe.  The Green Party has a great deal to contribute if it would just get off its hobbyhorse of being against everything.  It should look at what is and could be positive in Europe and work to improve Europe rather than seek to dismantle it, which would be the outcome if the Amsterdam Treaty was defeated.  If we do not continue to develop Europe and the European Union, it will start to disintegrate and that would not be in the interests of the environment, which is the main concern of the Green Party.  It certainly would not be in the interests of the ordinary citizens of Europe.  That is my final word on this matter today.</P>

We do not put our fingers in the air to see which way the political wind is blowing, which appears to be the case with other political parties as they move towards the centre.  Deputy De Rossa described himself as a socialist.  However, I wonder what Mr. Jim Larkin's opinion would be. Socialist parties today are unrecognisable and bear no resemblance to what they and socialism were supposed to be.  The exception is, perhaps, Deputy Higgins's party.</P>

      <P>Not all of them.  Many people will not vote but a substantial number will believe us.  We might not win but at least we are on the right side.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa was disingenuous in his comments about the right.  He claimed he did not wish to smear our parties and then proceeded to do so by associating us with elements of the extreme right.  Why are we seeing the rise of the extreme right?  Deputy Durkan claims it is a cyclical phenomenon and simply happens at certain times.  Whenever there is a political vacuum and people feel powerless the right emerges.  People feel powerless because there is a centralisation of power.  That is what is happening progressively within the European Union.  People should realise what is happening.  We will witness the rise of individuals like Le Pen as well as the right in Germany, particularly at a time of rising unemployment. I would welcome a debate on these issues.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to my party's stance on EMU.  Mr. Tietmeyer of the German Central Bank described what was likely to happen if there was an asymmetric shock.  Deputy Noonan referred to this when we debated the issue.  The fact is we are on our own.  We cannot devalue. The only option &mdash; this is being discussed by economists here who believe EMU is a bad idea &mdash; is wage cuts.  Does Deputy De Rossa support wage cuts?  There are many issues on which he is confusing people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The treaty promotes co-operation in the field of armaments.  A report produced by an Irish NGO, AfrI, demonstrates that there are many Irish companies involved in the international arms trade.  A total of 35 licences were approved by the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1996 for the production of purely military <Col N="47" /> items.  Arms were exported to countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, countries which do not have a good human rights record. As we ratify the Amsterdam Treaty, we are entering a new phase in European development where there will be co-operation in the field of armaments.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa asked what is the alternative. The Green Party believes European security issues should be addressed through the United Nations and its regional grouping, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, rather than the militarised, nuclear based Western European Union.  I do not know where Democratic Left stands on this issue.  It seems to be slightly confused.  From what I can garner from the debate, it supports the Western European Union which is based on nuclear weapons. Deputy Spring said he does not support the use of nuclear weapons.  Yet, he supports the Western European Union.  That is a contradiction.  It is clear the five parties which reject the amendment do not support Irish neutrality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need a constitutional amendment for Ireland to be involved in crisis management.  The House is quite capable of approving this as in the case of Somalia to which troops were sent to enforce the peace.  None of us should have any doubts about our responsibilities in that regard.  This was not the position in the case of Bosnia where large numbers of people had their eyes gouged out and limbs severed while still alive and thousands upon thousands were murdered while we stood back and did nothing.  If provision had been made for crisis management, humanitarian aid could have been supplied.</P>
      <P>On the decision-making process, the White Paper on the Amsterdam Treaty &mdash; it is not a political document, rather it is a fair and balanced assessment by the civil servants who put it together &mdash; states at paragraph 15.18, 15.19, 15.20, 15.21 and 15.22:</P>
      <P>The procedure for taking decisions under the CFSP will, however, be revised.  The principle that decisions under the CFSP should be taken by unanimity, as is appropriate to inter-governmental cooperation, is still retained but it will be modified in a number of ways.</P>
      <P>In the first place it is made explicit that abstentions shall not prevent unanimity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, a new provision for what could be called &ldquo;<i>constructive abstention</i>&rdquo; has been added (This term is not used in the Treaty).  This will allow a Member State when a proposal is being adopted to make a formal declaration.  The effect will be that the Member State concerned permits the proposal to be adopted and accepts it as a decision committing the Union but that it will not itself be bound to apply it.  If, however, the number of Member States seeking to avail of this &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; provision for constructive <Col N="48" /> abstention amounts to more than one third of the weighted votes, the proposal is not adopted.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, and by way of exception to the general rule of unanimity, the Council will, normally, act by qualified majority in two cases:</P>
    <P>(a) when taking a decision on the basis of a common strategy already adopted by the European Council;</P>
    <P>(b) when adopting any decision implementing a joint action or a common position.</P>
    <P>This provision for the use of qualified majority voting in certain circumstances will itself, however, be subject to two qualifications:</P>
    <P>(a) qualified majority voting will not apply to decisions having military or defence implications. Such decisions will continue to be taken by unanimity.  &ldquo;Constructive abstention&rdquo; as explained in paragraph 15.20 above may be availed of.</P>
    <P>(b) voting by qualified majority will be subject to what has been described loosely as &ldquo;an emergency break&rdquo; procedure.</P>

All the arguments made in favour of the amendment are red herrings.

      <P>The second Asia Europe Summit or ASEM II will be held in London on 2 to 4 April and will be attended by the heads of state <Col N="49" /> or government of ten Asian and the 15 EU member states together with the President of the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The summit will provide an ideal opportunity to strengthen political, economic, cultural and scientific ties between Europe and Asia.  While the final agenda has not yet been agreed, it is expected that the current economic conditions prevailing in Asia, the strengthening of trade and investment links, as well as issues of current political concern to the participating countries will form the basis of discussions.</P>
      <P>I also intend during the course of the summit to improve our relations with the Asian states. In particular, during the course of any bilateral contacts which may take place, I will underline the attractions of Ireland as an investment location and express our desire to improve trade, economic and cultural relations at every level.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  When the Taoiseach says he wants to improve relations and trade with the Asian countries, will he raise concerns about the way in which some governments in Asia govern their people?  I am particularly concerned about Indonesia which is in control of East Timor where the abuse of civil and democratic rights is appalling.  Will he seek a bilateral meeting with the vice-president of Indonesia, Mr. Habibie, who I understand may be attending the summit, to impress on him our concerns about the way in which the people of East Timor are being treated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do so if given the opportunity. I have sought a number of bilateral meetings, some of which have been confirmed.  I am not sure if President Suharto will be at the summit. If I am given the opportunity, I will restate our position and view on human rights in East Timor which remain a matter of serious concern to this House.  That concern has been communicated to the Indonesian Government on numerous occasions and it will continue to be expressed at every appropriate opportunity.  Unfortunately, human rights abuses are continuing in East Timor.  I had a number of meetings recently with the Australians and others during which I raised East Timor and I will do so again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there is considerable unease among the non-governmental organisations in Asia and Europe about the collapse of the so-called Asian tiger economies and the fear that the people will be asked to bear the brunt of their reorganisation?  Is he aware that a non-governmental coalition of organisations from Asia and Europe will meet in London prior to the ASEM II conference at which it hopes to <Col N="50" /> present its concerns?  Will the Taoiseach agree to meet this coalition and to support its demands to be heard by the ASEM II conference?  It is important that the concerns of the people in these countries are heard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the president or vice-president will attend the summit but I have sought a meeting with them.  I am aware of the concerns of the non-governmental organisations and I agree with much of what they have said about human rights and economic issues.  Those organising the summit must decide if they can address it.  I do not know what arrangements have been requested or made, but I have not been asked to meet them.</P>
      <P>As regards the economic crisis, the European Union has continued to work to try to assist these groups.  Some 29 per cent of the overall funding given to these countries to deal with the financial and economic crisis has been extended by the European members to the International Monetary Fund.  Most of those resources have gone to Thailand, Korea and Indonesia.  There are many other issues on the agenda for next week.  The NGOs and other organisations want to know how the International Monetary Fund will reinforce the global response to this crisis.  There is concern that the people will bear the brunt of the crisis which would be totally unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I support calls to strengthen the IMF global surveillance which is complemented by the Asian regional surveillance mechanism.  This issue has been highlighted by many people in the countries which have suffered greatly.  European Union countries want to assist at technical, financial and other levels as appropriate.  These matters will be discussed at the summit and Ireland will adopt a positive attitude.  This summit is the first opportunity since the Asian crisis in September to hear how bad the situation is and to address some of the issues.  As the Deputy is aware, various bleak reports have been published about how the people are handling the situation and trying to work their way out of it.</P>

If he has arranged a bilateral meeting with representatives of Thailand will he take that opportunity to inform them of the passage through this House during the past two years of legislation on sexual exploitation of underage children which is now on the Statute Book?  During the last ASEM conference the issues of money laundering and drug trafficking were raised.  Does the Taoiseach intend to raise those issues in the context of advances made in the European Union with regard to Europol and other initiatives that have been taken?  I urge the Taoiseach to meet representatives of the Indonesian Government to express our concern about the continuing ongoing lack of human rights in Indonesia and East Timor.</P>

The summit will last almost two and a half days and I hope to have an opportunity to raise those matters.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has organised the meetings and I am not sure with which countries they have been arranged.  I was anxious to meet the Premier of China and that meeting has been confirmed.  I wish to raise the issue of the lack of human rights in Indonesia and regardless of who is representing Indonesia, whether President Suharto or the Vice-President, I will convey the views of this House on that matter.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that item will be on the agenda.  I have seen the extensive brief of the various issues we are trying to raise with these countries and I will avail of whatever opportunities there are to raise that matter.  It is not often we have an opportunity to meet senior representatives of those countries.  The Deputy is aware we have many opportunities for investment in them and that many of our pension and other resources are in long-term investments in those countries.  Our strategy must be to ensure we build on the wise investments we have made, most probably mainly in infrastructure, and that we use our position and the support we have given to many of those countries to promote our trade and other opportunities.  There are different analyses of how long those countries will be in recession, but there is a view that in the medium term of a few years most of them will move on from that.  It is in our interests to be as supportive of them as possible, to promote as many of the investment opportunities we have as possible and to ensure we maintain good bilateral relations with them while remembering we must stress strongly our views on civil and human rights.</P>

      <P>Given that the conference is being held under the auspices of the Presidency of the European Union currently held by the British Government and its laudable policy is to consult its people as often and as effectively as it can, will the Taoiseach take the opportunity <Col N="52" /> between now and next week to contact the British Government to seek to ensure that non-governmental organisations have access directly to the conference or to various delegations who will attend it?  It is essential the voices of those representing NGOs, particularly those from Asian countries, are heard.  A number of Asian countries do not allow their people to speak openly. That is the case in Indonesia and East Timor which it currently occupies.  It is essential those people's voices are heard by the representatives of the European member states who will attend that conference.  Will the Taoiseach consider contacting the British Prime Minister or ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to contact the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Cook, to seek to ensure that NGOs have access directly to the conference or to delegates?</P>
      <P>The IMF is notorious for imposing conditions, even on well developed countries, which have an appalling impact on the ordinary people.  Will the Taoiseach express concern about the nature of the conditions applied by the IMF to redevelopment in those countries?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of Government Departments represented on the forum as are the Dublin local authorities and the representatives of the national taxi organisations.  The Deputy is correct when she says that the regulation function has been passed on to the local authorities.  I am sure she is aware that other issues arise which cross departmental boundaries and the forum is a very useful vehicle for resolving them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forum is chaired by the Chairman of the <Col N="53" /> Steering Committee of the Dublin Transportation Office.  I have a very keen interest in Dublin's traffic problems and taxis are an essential ingredient in any solution to those problems.  For that reason I established the taxi forum.  There is a representative from my Department attending the forum to keep me informed of developments. The time spent is approximately one half day per month.</P>

The statutory responsibility for regulating the taxi industry lies with the four Dublin local authorities. I am bemused by the Taoiseach's role in this matter.  Surely it is against the principles of subsidiarity, SMI and local agenda 21 and democracy for the Taoiseach to feel he must interfere in this way.

      <P>The importance of the Agenda 2000 negotiations is such that key decisions in regard to them will be taken by the entire Government.  The Ministers and Secretaries General group on EU policy is responsible for overseeing the negotiations.  The group, which I chair, includes the Ministers dealing with the main areas covered by the negotiations and the Secretaries General of the Departments.  Interdepartmental structures at official level have been put in place specifically to deal with the Agenda 2000 negotiations, including interdepartmental groups on Agenda 2000 and enlargement which are chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am satisfied that, taken together, these structures are adequate to meet the challenge posed by the negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the first challenges which faced a member of Government was at the York meeting last week and the newspaper headlines indicate the Minister for Finance surrendered Structural Funds, although he has not given a comprehensive report yet.  If that is the opening gambit in the thinking and action of the Government in terms of preserving maximum benefit for Ireland, a change of tack is required.  Will the Taoiseach outline what plans he has to ensure Ireland maintains maximum benefit into the new millennium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for newspaper headlines but, as I stated, the Ministers and Secretaries General group will deal with the negotiations as we move forward.  Any major aspects of policy will be dealt with by the entire Cabinet.  The Agriculture Council meets next <Col N="56" /> week while the Minister for Agriculture and Food will also meet Commissioner Fischler.</P>
      <P>This item was not discussed at the ECOFIN meeting as the General Affairs Council is dealing with Agenda 2000.  The structure to be followed as outlined last week is that the various groupings and bodies will deal with this.  The General Affairs Council has overall responsibility.  The COREPER 2 document of last week states:</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council will have overall responsibility for the Agenda 2000 dossier, in general for the interim report which will be prepared for the Cardiff European Council; the ECOFIN and Agriculture Councils will be called on to provide input on aspects of the package which concern them.  In doing so, it is recalled that the Agriculture Council will, as in the past, examine the detailed aspects of the proposed agricultural reforms; the Presidency will also ensure that, where appropriate, any other relevant Council formations are kept informed about proceedings; COREPER 2 will have the usual responsibility for preparing the General Affairs Council in the normal way for Cardiff; and the next one and COREPER will be assisted by &ldquo;Friends of the Presidency&rdquo; Group for which the proposed remit is attached.</P>
      <P>I referred to how that will operate through the Department of Foreign Affairs.  These discussions are likely to be lengthy, detailed and evolving over the remainder of the year.  We will continue to press during the negotiations for a level of funding for Ireland which takes fully into account the needs of our less prosperous regions.  We accept we have long since gone past the 75 per cent criterion for objective 1 status but I am very pleased with the transitional arrangements.  The next period will cover seven years from 2000-6. These arrangements are a good opening position. Of course, there are aspects with which we entirely disagree, many of which are in the agricultural area as outlined by the Minister for Agriculture and Food last week.  I am sure he will answer questions in the House in due course. There are other issues involving Cohesion Funding on which we will also fight robustly to get the best deal we can.  The negotiating position is a useful opening that will be built on in the months ahead.</P>

      <P>While the Taoiseach has comforting words for the future, last week's newspaper headlines were not generated out of thin air.  The Minister for Finance was quoted subsequent to the York meeting and indicated he, if not the entire Government, conceded Ireland will get reduced supports on a range of issues.  The General Affairs Council is the controlling council but the Agriculture Council and ECOFIN are very important in terms of finalising proposals.  If the attitude of the Minister for Finance is indicative of that of the Government, we should be very <Col N="57" /> worried.  Has the Taoiseach plans to take direct control to ensure a more robust defence of Irish interests is mounted than the one we saw last week?  Is Ireland represented on the Friends of the Presidency group which, as is clear from what the Taoiseach said, will be influential in formulating the final proposals?</P>

      <P>I am loath to become involved in the argument about duty free sales but it seems as if Deputy Owen has a one item agenda.  Every time she gets an opportunity she raises the issue of duty free sales.  However, I understand why she is miffed as I secured a seven and a half year extension, although the Labour Party recently tried to take credit for that away from me.

      <P>I hope we can retain objective I status under Agenda 2000.  The main point is the best position for us to hold in the discussions so that we draw down the maximum amount of funds.  If it becomes clear during the negotiations that there is a preferred way of doing this then we can pursue that course.  The decision at this stage is that countries like Ireland which have surpassed the 75 per cent requirement for objective I status will retain this status for the transitional period.  However, we must take fully into account that it is the weaker sections of the community which must benefit.  How this is played out during the coming year is a matter for discussion.</P>

      <P>My question highlights to some extent how Deputies in Government can make accusations about what should have been raised without anyone being in a position to check the facts apart from the person in office. This indicates the lack of transparency on how council meetings are run and the matters raised at them.  Does the Taoiseach propose to put in place a mechanism which will enable this House to maintain a watching brief over, and have an input into, the discussions on Agenda 2000?  The negotiations are far reaching in terms of their impact on the funding we receive from Europe and it is important that all Members know what is going on and have an opportunity to put forward <Col N="59" /> their opinion.  This is how the democratic process should operate.</P>
      <P>Will the European Parliament have a role in the negotiation process?  If so, this Parliament should have a role in monitoring and overseeing how the process in relation to Agenda 2000 proceeds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions will take place in the Council and there is no need for me to repeat them.  Some of what happens will be public knowledge, while negotiation positions will remain confidential to the Departments involved. During the previous negotiations I answered questions in the House on various aspects.  Naturally one does not give away one's negotiating position as this would not be of benefit.</P>
      <P>The Parliament is involved in that Commissioners make reports to it.  The Parliament has more powers in this area, but not in terms of the negotiations.  The Commission will set out its negotiating position and, as the discussions proceed, it will give more details.  It has already done this in that it has set out its proposals on the various sectors, something it did not do on the previous occasions.  It has stated there will be cuts in the beef, dairy and cereal sectors and outlined the areas where there will be negotiation.  This has enabled us, the social partners and other groups involved to co-operate.  There is no longer the same level of secrecy.  I welcome this as these negotiations are very important from the point of view of the national interest.  We must try to retain the maximum amount of Structural and Cohesion Funds possible.  There is a general view that there will not be much action until the autumn, apart from the preparation of the detail for negotiation.  This will be our last opportunity to get substantial Structural Funding.  It will be a totally different ball game after 2006.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put questions to the Taoiseach in the House but it is not an appropriate form in that we cannot debate the issue or put forward policy statements. The Government should outline its approach at the Joint Committee on European Affairs, listen to the alternative approaches put forward by Opposition parties and construct its approach bearing these in mind.  This is the democratic way to deal with the issues.</P>
      <P>One would be forgiven for believing that the only thing at risk in the negotiations on Agenda 2000 is the Common Agricultural Policy.  The worst case scenario is that there will be cuts of approximately £300 million out of a total figure of billions of pounds, whereas the cuts in Social and Cohesion Funding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To reassure the Deputy, we will still be a significant net beneficiary of the funds but it is important that we fight on all fronts, so all relevant Ministers will be defending their corners. There are cuts in all areas which will affect the Regional Fund, the European Social Fund and the CAP, all of which must be defended.  If the old rules had been applied &mdash; those which prevailed when I was last involved &mdash; this would have been the end of funding and we should not lose sight of that.  We signed up to the position that once a country exceeded 75 per cent of GNP it lost objective I status.  We have won a significant victory in securing transitional funds and that is what should have been in last week's headlines.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said one of the guiding principles in the negotiations would be to protect the weaker areas of the country.  How does that tie in with the Minister, Deputy McCreevy's remarks last week that it may be necessary to divide the country for the purposes of future funding?  I accept that this may be a good thing in that European thinking is moving from sectoral programmes towards integrated, spatially-based programmes but is dividing the country merely a euphemism for ring-fencing Dublin?  I am sure the Taoiseach shares my feelings as a Dublin Deputy that it would be totally unacceptable that Dublin paid the price while the rest of the country benefited from European funds.  Could that be clarified?</P>

      <P>The overall strategy is first, to draw down the maximum level of funds, and second, to take into account the less prosperous regions.  As I said earlier, that has yet to be worked out precisely and as of now objective I status remains for everywhere.  If in the course of discussions an alternative is seen to be possible we would have to examine it.  Having been involved in these discussions on two previous occasions, I think there could be great difficulties in working out the statistical data required to pick out the regions and localities which were under 75 per cent of EU average income.  It may be possible to do that in a large country like Germany but I do not think it is possible here.  We must still be conscious of what happens during negotiations and how matters will progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to a pilot project on whole school evaluation, the first phase of which has just commenced in a small number of primary and second level schools.  The main focus of whole school evaluation, or WSE, is on the development of the individual school being evaluated.  The report on a school will include advice on how best this may be accomplished.  The WSE process views each school as the most powerful agent in its own development.  Detailed draft evaluation criteria have been prepared in order to ensure a reliable and consistent approach to whole school evaluation throughout the system.  These criteria cover all aspects of WSE including learning, teaching, planning and management.  The draft evaluation criteria have been made available to the schools in the pilot project.  Schools can, therefore, use these objective criteria for self-evaluation and to compare their own internal judgments with the external WSE evaluation.  The use of agreed evaluation criteria also has potential to yield objective and dependable data on the broad functioning of the education system at national level.</P>
      <P>In comparing schools there is an implicit assumption that like will be compared with like in a fair and consistent manner.  However, schools may differ significantly one from another in terms of their pupil enrolment, in the range of abilities and personal characteristics of their pupils, in their staffing and in their academic organisation and teaching approaches.  Such variable school context factors can account for differences in outcomes among schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparisons made between schools generally refer only to differences in outcomes and rarely to the underlying explanatory causes of these differences, and this in turn leads to incorrect assumptions being made about the effectiveness of schools.  In addition, comparisons between schools' outcomes always focus on those aspects of schooling which are most easily measured and ultimately lead to calls for the formation of league tables.  These comparisons and league <Col N="63" /> tables have potentially negative consequences for schools.  Important areas of schooling less amenable to measurement and quantification, such as the development of pupil attitudes or the expressive and affective side of learning, may not receive sufficient emphasis in curriculum design and implementation in schools.</P>
    <P>The model of whole school evaluation being developed in consultation with the partners has the capacity to encourage and support schools and to promote effective school development. While schools will be able to measure their education achievements against national evaluation criteria, the crude and superficial nature of league tables has no place in my policy for school improvement.  WSE will be an important element in the inspectorate's supportive and advisory role in relation to quality development in schools. Many schools currently engage in development practices, such as whole-school planning and school self-review, aimed at improving the quality of education they offer.  The WSE process will affirm existing good practice in this area and will assist and support all schools in their quality improvement efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that to say comparison is not central to the process of evaluation flies in the face of the experience of virtually every other organisation?  Is he not aware that the total quality management procedures in place in other organisations examine how one organisation compares to another and asks why they differ?  Does he agree also that the stimulus derived from comparison with what is happening outside is essentially a stimulus to perform better?  For example, a crucial question in comparing how schools are doing is the resources available to them.  We should compare how schools differ in regard to access to psychological, remedial or other resources.  Will the Minister agree that if we want to examine the way different schools perform using different methods and whether some methods are more successful we would have to compare what is happening in one school with another?  In short, is the Minister not throwing out the baby with the bath water in that his resistance to league tables, which have a bad reputation for good reason, will result in him disregarding the whole concept of comparison which is a fatal flaw in his proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject that.  We are resolutely opposed to league tables because in comparing schools one is not comparing like with like.  The concept of comparison is part of the whole school evaluation pilot project we are embarking upon, but it is comparison with national objective data and criteria developed by the inspectorate.  That is the crucial point.  We are not going down the road of comparing one school in one community with another school in another community because the context can vary dramatically from area to area in terms of pupil enrolment and the <Col N="64" /> student profile of any given school.  That would lead, as it has in other countries, to crude comparisons and to the development of league tables which can have a negative impact on schools, the pupils attending those schools and the communities the schools serve.</P>
      <P>The fundamental objective of school evaluation is to help schools improve and to enable them undertake root and branch examinations of their own planning and development.  Schools can compare with national criteria that have been developed, and many are already engaged in self-evaluation. There would be comparisons, for example, between self-evaluation processes and the external evaluation process under this pilot project.  We also anticipate that as the pilot develops and with the agreement of the partners, a national picture will emerge in terms of models of best practice from which schools can learn lessons and advance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to pursue this point.  It seems incredible that the Minister would decide to set up a pilot project and in advance of that decide the most crucial issue it is designed to test, namely, whether evaluation and comparison of schools will result in quality improvement? Every other organisation examining quality improvement compares itself to others facing similar difficulties.  The Minister has closed his mind to the idea of comparing a school facing certain difficulties in Dublin to a similar school facing similar difficulties in Cork.  That is extremely short-sighted.  Will he ensure that the pilot project will test the issue of comparison of schools and not disregard from the outset the notion of comparing the evaluations in different schools facing similar problems?  I ask the Minister to reconsider that aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Schools are unique and socially complex institutions.  They do not lend themselves to easy comparison with the industrial world or organisations in the business world.  It <Col N="66" /> is a simplistic notion that businesses can develop quality assurances in certain ways.  I have attended many ISO 9000 presentations and even in those evaluation processes, the fundamental issue is that the individual entity is anxious to develop and improve in the way it wants to proceed. The fundamental issue for the teacher doing a higher diploma or teacher training at primary level is self-evaluation.  One must continue to evaluate how one is doing against set criteria. That is the fundamental principle underlying our school evaluation pilot project and I am delighted that the partners, including the parents in terms of the boards of management, and the teachers have come on board.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
      <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour.  This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated, while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption free environment.  The code should also include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>Social attitudes and parental approaches to discipline vary from one school community to another, and it would be impractical and even undesirable for the Minister to set out a formal and detailed code of behaviour for all schools.</P>
      <P>The report on discipline, which was commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin, deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools and sets out models of best practice in this area.  A copy of the report has been made available to all schools and will, I am sure, be a very valuable resource for school authorities.  The findings of the report are being considered in the context of planning for the establishment of a support service for school management.  I intend to put this service in place in the next school year and I am confident that it will greatly assist school management in dealing with vital areas such as school management and discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the teaching counsellor scheme, which is currently in <Col N="67" /> place on a pilot basis.  The functions of the teaching counsellor are to co-ordinate a whole school approach to devising and implementing good practice and strategies which will help to prevent the occurrence of disruptive behaviour, and to teach and counsel small groups and individuals who exhibit persistent behaviour difficulties in the classroom.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that potentially disruptive pupils frequently are in need of psychological evaluation as a first step to appropriate assistance.  An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to set up a national psychological service.  I have established a planning group to prepare proposals for the development of this service and I expect to receive the group's report very shortly.  In the meantime, I have arranged for the immediate extension of the psychological service to primary schools through the recruitment of an additional 15 psychologists who will be assigned to various locations throughout the country.  The recruitment process has been completed and I expect the new psychologists will take up duty over the next few months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the initiatives mentioned by the Minister, I am hearing widespread reports of highly disruptive children in primary schools.  Those children cannot be expelled, although in some situations something comparable with expulsion occurs, which is roll-over suspension. There is a significant number of highly disruptive children who make it impossible to provide any kind of quality teaching.  On the one hand, these children are obtaining no benefit from attending school; on the other hand, they are interfering with the rights of other children to an education.  This problem is urgent and must be addressed on a widespread and structured basis. The solution in many of these cases lies in the better co-ordination of State resources and services.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider providing an officer who could share some of the responsibilities for these children where families are failing in their duties?  Families may not be able to provide the parenting and other supports needed by these children because of neglect, incompetence, stress or ill health.  This is a large and growing problem, the full extent of which is not really appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little difficulty with what the Deputy said and I am largely in agreement with the manner in which he outlined the situation. We must be extremely proactive in dealing with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, it is critical to put in place a comprehensive national educational psychological service so that children who display disruptive tendencies at an early stage and who are not served by the conventional, traditional curriculum can be quickly assessed.  I am endeavouring to do that. There has been an historic deficit in terms of psychological provision in the education system <Col N="68" /> but we are moving quickly to set up the necessary structure and appoint additional psychologists. We are about to appoint 15 additional psychologists who will be located around the country.</P>
    <P>There will also be an expansion of the home-school liaison scheme which has been particularly important in terms of linkage between schools and parents.  In that context, I would be glad to explore with the Deputy the idea of appointing an officer or utilising the home-school liaison programme with psychologists so that we could get an early assessment of children in difficulty and a proper diagnosis of those difficulties.  We could then intervene in terms of putting in place a proper programme for the children concerned.  I have seen this work in some area partnerships where a good combination of psychological assessment, the utilisation of a teacher counsellor in the classroom with the normal teacher and the application and utilisation of the home-school liaison scheme have worked together effectively to help disruptive children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an undertaking to the House to fully assess the situation between now and his next Question Time in terms of, first, those children at primary level who are effectively expelled through the use of roll-over suspension and, second, those children who cause major disruption in classes because there is nothing else to do and who interfere substantially with the quality of the education obtained by other children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give commitments which might not be realised in such a short space of time as my next Question Time could be within six weeks.  However, as I have already outlined, we are committed to establishing a tracking system so that we can track every primary level pupil.  It is regrettable there is no such tracking system or database at present.  We are determined to put that in place in the context of the scheme for eight to 15 year olds I recently announced and launched, the first strand of which will involve the development of a tracking process.</P>
      <P>However, I will get the Department to look at the number of cases of suspensions and expulsions of which we know.  I know people will argue the rules are not being strictly implemented, but the bottom line in term of the rules is that no school may expel a pupil under 15 years of age unless the school can provide an alternative programme. We must work with schools to develop alternative programmes within schools and to facilitate, as best we can, the making available of programmes to which disruptive pupils can be referred.  The Deputy is right that we must always be careful of the other students in the class who deserve a disruption free learning environment.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had even an elementary knowledge of the legislation introduced by my predecessor he would be aware that the committee is specifically constituted to advise, guide and make recommendations to the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with responsibility for Youth Affairs in relation to the operation of youth work.  It is a matter for the committee to initiate any meetings it may want with the relevant Minister of State.  I received no request by the committee for a meeting until 13 February when I received a letter from the chairman requesting me to meet it.  I immediately acceded and met the committee yesterday. The committee is welcome to meet me at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the legislation introduced by the previous Government it is envisaged the committee will advise the Minister in the context of the operation of the legislation.  However, the legislation is not in operation because the previous Government made a mess of it.  The operation of the legislation was predicated on the existence of bodies &mdash; the regional education boards &mdash; which were not in place at the time it was passed, were not put in place and will now never be put in place.  The legislation must be changed to replace these bodies and the Government <Col N="70" /> has decided they will be replaced by the vocational education committees.  It would have required a simple amendment to replace the term &ldquo;regional education board&rdquo; with &ldquo;vocational education committee&rdquo; in the legislation.  However, upon examination I saw glaring deficiencies in the Act and I, therefore, took the opportunity to undertake a fundamental review of the legislation, which is almost completed.</P>
    <P>Given this, I have taken the view that the committee considered it would not have a proactive role until the legislation becomes effectively operable.  That is why I did not hear from the committee.  It decided to contact me on 13 February requesting a meeting which took place yesterday. When I met the committee yesterday it recognised its role is unclear until the new legislation is introduced.  However, I told the committee that I would be delighted to take on board any advice, suggestions or recommendations it offers.  I also advised it could make submissions in writing and that I would welcome any further meetings.  I hope the legislation will be published shortly.  If the committee's submissions are constructive I will be delighted to take them on board.</P>

Will he agree that it was impossible for the committee to ask for such a meeting when it had not held one for over eight months?  Does he agree that the committee should have been involved in the submission of the Estimates for the budget and that there should have been discussions between the Minister and the committee prior to such a submission?</P>

      <P>The committee can arrange its own meetings.  It is not for me to arrange meetings with it.  Following its meetings and deliberations it can then advise me, in writing or through a meeting.  I am open to meeting the committee at any time.  I have no role in convening a meeting of the committee.  It would be improper and counter not only to the spirit but to the letter of the legislation for me to insist on the committee, which was established to advise me, holding meetings.  That is a matter for the committee under its independent chairman, who was appointed by my predecessor.  The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as making recommendations in connection with youth work, nothing or nobody stopped the committee from holding meetings as often as it wished to make whatever submissions it liked.  I am always open to receive submissions from the committee if it wishes to make them, which it can do in writing or orally to me.  The legislation makes it clear that it is for the committee to convene its own meetings and arrange its own business.  It is not up to me to dictate to the committee or to order it to meet.  It decided it <Col N="71" /> wanted to meet me yesterday.  I immediately acceded and was glad to meet it.  We had a constructive chat.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses which must generally be of at least two years' duration at approved colleges.  Over 37,000 students benefited under the initiative in 1996-7 at a cost to the Exchequer of £77 million in 1997. Any extension of the initiative would have to be considered in the light of overall resource constraints. In this regard, tax relief is available at the standard rate on fees paid to private colleges in accordance with the provisions of section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995, and section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996.  My priority is to increase the number of places available in publicly funded colleges. This priority was delivered on this year and will be again in the next academic year.</P>
      <P>Legal proceedings have been instituted in the case of Patrick Jordan junior, Patrick Jordan senior and Raymond Kearns <i>v.</i> the Minister for Education, Ireland and the Attorney General, regarding the non-inclusion of Portobello College within the free fees initiative.  As the matter will be before the courts I do not consider it appropriate to make any further statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of including private colleges within the scope of the higher education grants scheme, the scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  An approved institution is defined to mean university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years' duration, being a course or courses which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
      <P>The annual higher education grants scheme which I approve sets out a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme.  The approved institutions mainly comprise the publicly funded third level institutions.  However, a number of religious and other institutions have been admitted to the scheme over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am engaged in an ongoing review of all aspects of higher education grants, including the eligibility rules and the administration of the scheme.  In this regard, the scope of these schemes is being considered as part of an ongoing review of the existing arrangements.  This review will be <Col N="72" /> completed in advance of the 1998 student support schemes.  Any extension of the existing arrangements in relation to grants can only be considered in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>

I gave way on a number of occasions when I had not completed my reply.  I do not intend to continue too long other than to say, in addition to what I have said, that in the letter mentioned by the Deputy we did deal with the question of equity within the third level system. In our manifesto we made it clear that the implementation of our third level policy, particularly in relation to fees, grants, places and so forth, was subject to the availability of resources. We made that clear both at the launch of our manifesto in May 1997 and at the subsequent press conference.</P>

      <P>Was there a very clear commitment, in a letter written to private colleges, that Fianna Fáil would provide grants?  Is it correct that the Minister ruled out honouring such a commitment in an interview with a journalist? Further, does the Minister not agree that it is a serious inequity that people who go to private colleges for want of places in public sector colleges cannot avail of support for fees and maintenance while those who are lucky enough to get a place in publicly funded colleges, at far more expense to the taxpayer overall, get such support?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads our programme for Government he will see what our priorities are.  I defy him to come up with an example of a previous Government that fulfilled commitments in as short a space of time as we fulfilled the commitments in our programme for Government, particularly relating to the third level sector.  Our key priority was the provision of places.  This year alone we created an additional 7,300 places between post-leaving certificate colleges, universities and institutes of technology. That is a remarkable achievement in such a short space of time.  The places comprise an additional 2,000 in post-leaving certificate colleges, an additional 2,600 in universities and an additional 2,000 in institutes of technology.  That is our number one priority.</P>
      <P>The second major priority relates to post-leaving certificate students in ensuring that they will be in a position to avail of the higher education grants scheme.  That has significant resource implications.  I and my officials have met with the private colleges since I came to office.  A number of issues have to be addressed.  One key issue is that of mission drift.  In allocating resources, the State must ensure that the nation is served by the programmes being followed in colleges.  We must avoid what happened in the United Kingdom and in the US where colleges drifted significantly from their core function.  We are determined that the technological sector will meet its mission of responding to the needs of industry and business and, likewise, that universities will retain their core mission of academic development and of meeting the needs of the wider economy.</P>
      <P>There are other issues pertaining to equity.  The bonding issue is crucial to equity in terms of participation in private sector colleges.  There would be a very serious problem in allocating public funding to institutions that we are not sure will survive.  The whole issue of bonding is critical in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat the three supplementary questions I asked, none of which was addressed in the Minister's lengthy reply.  Will he confirm that he did make a clear commitment <Col N="74" /> that Fianna Fáil in Government would introduce grants for private colleges in the letter in question which is quoted in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of the same date?  Will he confirm that in an interview with a journalist on 3 March, the day before, he indicated that he would not honour that commitment? Does the Minister not agree that his decision is inequitable in that he is refusing to grant equal entitlement to students who have qualified for a place in a private college to maintenance support and fees support on a means tested basis purely because they are going to a private and not a public college?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked about fees, and we have ruled that out.  In relation to equity, I do not accept the Deputy's simplistic thesis.  A range of issues have to be teased out and resolved in the context of equity.  The bottom line is to make sure that we have enough places available in the public sector to enable students to pursue courses in institutes of technology, in universities and in post-leaving certificate colleges.  Because of our commitment to maintenance grants in the post-leaving certificate sector in particular, the numbers in that sector have increased significantly, and there is greater retention of numbers on PLC courses this year over previous years.  We did make commitments in advance of the election.  We made it clear in our manifesto that those commitments would be subject to the availability of resources and that there would have to be clear prioritisation. We outlined the priorities in the programme for Government.  They are increased places in public sector institutions and maintenance grants for post-leaving certificate students who were the most disadvantaged in the system up to now under the Government of which Deputy Bruton was a member.  We can accommodate only so much in any given programme.  In our programme for Government we have clearly set out what we consider the priorities to be.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that Fianna Fáil pursued votes at the last general election on the basis of a clear commitment on which the Minister is now reneging?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that.  There are very few votes in this issue.  Our aim was not the pursuit of votes but to develop a national strategy for participation in third level education.  I will not play around with taxpayers' money.  I have made the priorities clear.  For the first time this autumn over 100,000 pupils were attending Irish <Col N="75" /> universities.  We have broken the 100,000 barrier because of initiatives taken by this Government and because of the priority we gave to providing additional places in universities and institutes of technology.  We increased places this year by 7,300 right across the board.  That is a commitment to people and to students.  We have engaged with private third level colleges about a range of issues they have put before us.  We will continue to meet with them, unlike the Deputy's Administration. We will have ongoing discussions on the various issues that arise from time to time, not least the issue of bonding and the issue of a national qualifications framework.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, taken to implement the recommendations in the report on school attendance and other difficulties in schools in Clondalkin, Dublin 22.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The general recommendations contained in the report on school absenteeism in Clondalkin are being considered as part of the preparation of legislation and initiatives to deal with the complex issues involved in school absenteeism. My objective is to bring heads of proposed legislation to Government in the autumn. I intend to be in a position to introduce the legislation before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>As reflected in the report, the issue of non-school attendance demands a comprehensive solution involving a combination of legislative and other measures.  A range of special measures is already in place in the education area.  In Clondalkin, ten primary schools have disadvantaged status and are in the home school community liaison scheme, two schools are included in the Early Start pre-school pilot project and five Clondalkin schools are included in the teaching counsellor scheme.  This latter scheme is targeted exclusively on the Clondalkin and north inner city areas of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I recently launched an initiative targeted specifically at early school leavers and children at risk of dropping out in the eight to 15 age group.  This initiative will be of particular interest and relevance to areas such as Clondalkin. It is likely that groups in Clondalkin will be entitled to apply for inclusion in this initiative. I also established the National Forum on Early Childhood Education which is currently under <Col N="76" /> way.  The forum will consider how services in this area can be developed for the future.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures I outlined, coupled with the new legislative provisions which I will bring forward, will make a valuable contribution towards addressing the concerns highlighted in the Clondalkin report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed all the Minister can say is that the recommendations are being considered as part of a process.  Regarding the position on 26 November when this matter was last discussed, why has the schedule for introducing the legislation slipped back by six months? The Minister indicated at that time that the Bill relating to school attendance would be published early in 1998.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree there is a need for a specialist non-school unit in Clondalkin to offer support to children with serious attendance problems? The survey showed that 25 per cent of children in the area were either chronic or regular non-attenders.  Does the Minister agree there is a need to resource a unit of the type recommended to address the specific problem in Clondalkin highlighted in the report rather than dealing with it as part of a long-term planning process in the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing has been referred to a long-term planning process.  All 38 area partnerships are preparing plans and programmes similar to the study undertaken in Clondalkin.  An initiative relating to the eight to 15 year old group has been launched.  This matches some of the recommendations in the Clondalkin report, such as what it described as a pre-youthreach centre for children under 15 years.  The Department is not inclined to take the route of pre-youthreach centres but wants to develop a project that is school based and has formal and informal dimensions. It is open to the area partnership and community in Clondalkin to apply for inclusion in the scheme for eight to 15 year olds.  This is a practical and concrete initiative on the ground.</P>
      <P>Staffing can be considered only in the context of the schedule for the 1998-9 school year.  As I stated previously, my desired approach is a variety of inputs, including psychological, remedial and home school liaison services, to schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding school attendance legislation, it has been necessary to engage in a fundamental review of the previous Government's plans.  It produced the heads of a Bill on school attendance which relied heavily on regional education boards.  The previous Government's policy included the introduction of such boards which would appoint school attendance officers. However, if that had been the case, we would have waited indefinitely for a school attendance service because no detailed planning had been carried out in the Department on the establishment of regional education boards.  A commitment <Col N="77" /> was made in terms of the preparation of legislation but nothing had been done regarding the logistical mechanisms of regional boards.  It would be many years before a school attendance service was provided if I took the route favoured by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The Department is now considering school attendance differently.  We consider that school attendance involves the prevention of absenteeism and a range of other strategies to ensure that children stay at school, are enthusiastic about it and have relevant curriculum programmes to follow. This will ensure the current level of school attendance difficulties is reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>All the issues relating to school attendance existed when the Minister said last November that the legislation would be introduced early in 1998.  Why has the Minister lost six months on his schedule regarding the Bill?</P>
      <P>I accept there is a need for legislation but will the Minister make provision, particularly from September on, to ensure concrete proposals are put in place to deal with this problem and we are not waiting for a Bill which may take until 1999 to be implemented?  Action is required specifically in relation to the Early Start and Breaking the Cycle initiatives in schools which are excluded in the Clondalkin district and other deprived areas such as Tallaght, Darndale and elsewhere. Will the Minister make provision and start to put concrete measures, in addition to legislation, in place by September?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not awaiting the publication of legislation.  I have stated repeatedly that legislation on its own is not the answer. Resources are an important part of dealing with the issue and the Department has developed strategies. It is unfair to suggest that we are awaiting legislation.  The initiative for eight to 15 year olds, which has already been launched, is most important.  We are looking comprehensively at developing a national strategy on disadvantage. This is important because over 550 schools have been designated as disadvantaged.  Under the previous Administration, apart from what was available to those schools in terms of additional capitation grants, there was no coherent national strategy to deal with educational disadvantage, particularly in socio-economically disadvantaged areas.  I will not wait for legislation to implement measures to improve the position.  Work is ongoing to improve it at various levels throughout the system.</P>

      <P>In the context of the school attendance legislation, how many school attendance officers does the Minister envisage will be provided?  Does he envisage spreading them beyond the areas in which the Act operates at present?  The Minister mentioned intervention in the context of keeping children at school.  I welcome that positive approach.  Does the Minister envisage that the position of school attendance <Col N="78" /> officers will be strengthened by statute and they will become involved at other levels, for example, interfacing with other agencies and Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  At present there are school attendance committees and officers in Dublin, Cork and Waterford cities and Dun Laoghaire. Elsewhere, the Garda Síochána perform school attendance duties, which is unacceptable in the modern age.  I pay tribute to the school attendance officers and committees who have done a fine job.  We have much to learn from their experience and expertise.  They will add to and inform developments.  However, we will not follow the conventional model which has developed since the foundation of the State.  The ultimate objective of the legislation is to put in place a school attendance service and structure that applies nationwide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, provides a commitment to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses.  I have already advised the House of my intention to introduce grants, which will be at the same level as the third level maintenance grants, as soon as possible for students who are registered on PLC courses as of September 1998.  Provision for the payment of the first instalment of these grants has been included in the 1998 Estimates. An information leaflet setting out guideline information about the introduction of PLC grants was distributed by my Department in early February .</P>
      <P>The introduction of maintenance grants for students attending PLC courses involves the development of significant new administrative arrangements.  While the method and timing of these payments may take some time to finalise, I assure the House that they will be made and they will fully meet our commitments.  I expect to be in a position to announce further details on the administration of the scheme by early May 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>PLC courses are playing a key role in preparing young people for employment and further education <Col N="79" /> and training.  These courses represent a significant element of the Government's response to meeting the skill needs of the Irish economy and have been identified by business leaders to be a very effective means of meeting those needs.  The teleservices programme, whereby I provided additional places for a two year NCVA certified course, demonstrates the flexible nature of the sector which facilitates the provision of quality programmes uniquely tailored to industrial needs. My Department is providing some £39 million this year towards the running costs of PLC courses.  A capital provision of £20 million will also be available for PLCs and apprenticeships as part of the £250 million education technology investment fund.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputies will acknowledge the commitment we are showing to the sector, which I am confident will continue to develop over the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, there are one, two and three year PLC courses.  Will one year courses be covered by this arrangement? Must the courses be accredited to recognised bodies, such as the NCVA, the RSA or City &amp; Guilds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme will apply to all students registered on PLC courses for the 1998-9 academic year, including one, two and three years courses.  Obviously, the NCVA is the certifying body for the majority of PLC courses.  We eventually want all PLC courses validated in the context of a national qualifications framework.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle, the grants will be attached to the national qualifications framework, but we have not worked out the details of each course yet.  I do not have specific information on the areas that will be covered.  All students registered on PLC courses will be eligible to apply for grants, subject to means testing and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify that all PLC students, and not only those registering for the first time, will qualify for the grants?  There is considerable flexibility in schools and vocational education committees, in particular, about the establishment of PLC courses.  Does the Minister envisage that degree of flexibility continuing or does he envisage a regime coming into place after the introduction of the grants whereby schools and vocational education committees will have to get departmental approval for the establishment of PLC courses?</P>

      <P>They have to obtain departmental approval to start a PLC course.  While there is ongoing engagement between colleges and the Department, the bottom line is that the Department must approve the places.  That was the case even before I became Minister.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate there would be chaos if every college could set up courses as they saw fit.  That would be untenable.  We are committed to expansion.  As I outlined in reply to an earlier question, an additional 2,600 places have been approved for 1998-9.  There has been phenomenal growth in the PLC sector.  It a key component of our strategy to meet the skill needs of the economy, which has been verified by industrialists and people in the business sector generally. The maintenance grants will apply to all students registered in 1998 and not only first year enrolments.</P>

      <P>With respect, the bottom line is that the Department has approved all places this year.  There is a procedure in place whereby colleges seek approval from the Department for establishing new courses.  Before becoming Minister I was chairman of the Forum of Colleges of Further Education in Cork, which embraces the three colleges of further education there.  I am intimately aware of the processes in which we engaged.  We sought harmony between the three colleges for the courses for which we would seek departmental approval on an ongoing annual basis.  The City of Cork VEC has sought approval <Col N="81" /> for a range of courses on behalf of those colleges. In the context of the skills issue and meeting the needs of the economy, we will endeavour to balance the number of students taking up engineering, science and technician courses and other courses.  The teleservices initiative we introduced last autumn created an additional 500 places to meet a particular need in the economy.  We will introduce similar initiatives across the board.</P>
      <P>I would hate to think anyone would hold the view that the introduction of maintenance grants for PLC students would be used as a brake on the system.  We increased the number of places by 2,600 this year alone.  The PLC system is cost effective and very successful.  I confirmed in my reply that the provision for the payment of the first instalment of these grants is included in the 1998 Estimates, but I cannot confirm as yet the date for payments.  I hope to be more specific in that regard at a later stage.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Deenihan's question, academic requirements for a grant will be satisfied by securing a place on a plc course that has been approved by the Department.  If students are on courses approved by the Department they will receive a grant.</P>

      <P>I express my support, and that of Sinn Féin, for Deputy Gormley's amendment.  Members who would misrepresent those of us who take an alternative view on the Amsterdam Treaty should note that I speak as a concerned European.  It is entirely consistent to support the maximum possible constructive co-operation between the peoples of Europe and, at the same time, to defend Irish sovereignty and Irish neutrality.  James Connolly, who has been mentioned already in the debate, said: &ldquo;the internationalism of the future will be based on the free federation of free peoples&rdquo;.  What is being constructed under the Amsterdam Treaty is not a free federation but a joint super state with no democratic accountability to its citizens.  Everyone in the House knows that the further political power gets from local level and the more the political institution grows, the less democratic it becomes.  Structures and institutions become more and more remote from the citizen.  That is a huge problem at a state level.  It is much more so at the level of the European Union where an unelected bureaucracy forms policies and implements decisions over the heads of tens of millions of citizens across a whole continent without their input and often without their knowledge. A handful of MEPs representing a million or more citizens per constituency in a European Parliament is not democracy.  That is the context in which we voice our Opposition to the erosion of neutrality in the Amsterdam Treaty.  This is not a red herring or a false debate.  The clauses are there in black and white and commit this State to a common foreign and security policy and the <Col N="83" />&ldquo;progressive framing of a common defence policy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I deplore the patronising and insulting tone of a number of speakers who have treated with disdain the legitimate position of all those who oppose the Amsterdam Treaty.  There have been attempts to smear and discredit those of us who defend neutrality.  We have been aligned and so maligned with the extreme right in Europe but, strangely, Deputy De Rossa has had no difficulty in lining up with the traditional right in this State when in Government.  The long time advocates of so-called democratic centralism have found a new and a great toy in the European Union where their advocacy echoes on sympathetic ears.</P>
      <P>Those who support a common EU foreign and security policy and the framing of a common defence policy have not answered a very simple question.  They have not told us against whom we are supposed to be defending the European Union.  Who is the enemy?  Where is the power that is going to attack Europe?  Surely that is the greatest bogey man of them all and another justifiable argument that this treaty arose from neutrality.</P>
      <P>The European Union is now a huge economic power bloc, rivalling the United States.  From where is the military threat to this bloc to come? Clearly the drive towards common foreign policy, common security and common defence does not come from any need to protect European citizens from external or internal aggressors, rather the drive is coming from those who want to move towards a super state with a military arm allied, as clearly stated in the Amsterdam Treaty, to an armaments industry.</P>
      <P>Another Deputy referred to the alleged shame of the Irish people in observing conflicts in other countries about which we felt or feel powerless. We have no cause for shame.  Unlike most other members of the European Union we in our history as a nation had no hand, act or part in the empires which exploited people around the globe and left a legacy of conflicts which continue today.  This State, above all, has committed itself to the peacekeeping role of the United Nations. That peacekeeping role should be strengthened and the United Nations should be democratised so that the veto and the domination of the big powers is removed.  Instead, under this treaty we are moving away from that towards an exclusive EU bloc, asserting its power on the world stage by turning the European Union into a military alliance.  The original agenda of purely peaceful economic co-operation, the basis on which the people of the State joined the EEC in 1972, is being set aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent opinion poll showed that the vast majority of people do not even know of the existence of this treaty, and, as I said on the previous debate on the Bill, an effort is being made to slip it past the people.  That is because the proponents of this treaty know that if it is exposed to full public scrutiny the violation of neutrality will be <Col N="84" /> clear for all to see.  This amendment is simple. The Labour Party has faced the electorate on several occasions with a commitment to enshrining neutrality in the Constitution.  This is its opportunity. If, as the Government says, the treaty does not violate neutrality this amendment should cause it no difficulty either.  I fully support the amendment and I commend my colleague, Deputy Gormley, and the Green Party for bringing it before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty whatever, nor has the Government, with the right of any individual Member to table any amendment and to make any comment they wish.  That is the prerogative of every individual here.  Since morning I have deliberately refrained from making any contribution to give all Members every opportunity to make their contributions pertaining to this important treaty.  Some 19 contributions have already been made since morning.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what was said regarding the amendment.  It would appear that many of the contributions are a repeat of Second Stage.  We are now dealing with the matter on Committee Stage and it is important to focus on what is being proposed.  With regard to the amendment to Part II, 5º of the Schedule, as proposed by Deputy Gormley, I refer the House to the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when moving the Second Stage of this Bill on 3 March.  In that statement the Minister made it clear that Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unaffected by the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam.  This view was shared by speakers on Second Stage and by most of the parties represented in the House.</P>
      <P>In a statement to the Dáil on Second Stage on 4 March, Deputy Gormley asserted that the Amsterdam Treaty endangered international peace and security.  The exact reverse is the case. The European Union is a project for peace and security, founded on the principles of democracy and human rights.  The common foreign and security policy provisions of the new treaty reflect the concern of the vast majority of citizens that the European Union should make a greater contribution to international peace and security, commensurate with its economic strength and its political responsibilities.  Members should reflect on that important statement.</P>
      <P>I wish to reply briefly to the points made in this debate, a number of which were previously made on Second Stage and to which the Government responded at the conclusion of that Stage on 4 March.  Deputy Gormley referred to Denmark as a model we should follow in the defence area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy and I wish to make my contribution without interruption.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley, however, did not mention that Denmark is a loyal and long standing member of NATO and that Denmark attaches importance to the primacy of NATO in European security and defence.  Is this the Danish approach which the Deputy proposes Ireland should follow?</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins and Deputy Gormley made a number of comments about armaments.  The Amsterdam Treaty does no more than recognise the existing situation and creates no new obligations for member states.  Ireland is not and never has been silent on this issue.  We have a strong commitment to the control of and restraint in arms transfers and we will continue to promote such restraints at European Union and United Nations level.  Our history in this century has been one of neutrality, independence and moderation. We seek consensus to achieve that which is best for the evolution of mankind.</P>
      <P>I wish to set the record straight with regard to the role of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  Deputy Gormley suggested that Ireland should have nothing to do with the Amsterdam Treaty's provisions on peacekeeping but that we should focus on the United Nations and the OSCE.  There is no conflict between the objectives of the UN and the OSCE and the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty.  The Amsterdam Treaty explicitly situates the European Union's common foreign and security policy in the context of the principles of the United Nations Charter and the OSCE's basic document. I refer the Deputy to the text of Article J.1.</P>
      <P>The OSCE explicitly supports and encourages co-operation between the range of organisations dealing with security in Europe.  This cooperative approach is seen in its clearest form in Bosnia. Far from being incompatible with the peacekeeping and crisis management role of the EU and the Western European Union, the OSCE welcomes the support and co-operation of the European Union and the Western European Union.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley's remarks appear to indicate confusion about decision making under the common foreign and security policy.  No member state will be forced to do or to agree to anything with which it disagrees.  In the final analysis, any member state, including Ireland, can block a decision. I have been a Member of this House for almost 16 years.  In the past nine years I have been a member of various Governments and I have attended several meetings of the European Council of Ministers.  Ministers attend such meetings as equals and seek to achieve a consensus on that which is best for Europe and the member states of the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody is under any inhibition or suffers any impediment when attending Council meetings. <Col N="86" /> On many occasions Ireland has had the support of Germany and France to achieve consensus on what is best for Europe and Ireland.  On other occasions Ireland has had the support of the UK and the other smaller countries.  Support varies according to the issue.  Ireland has no difficulty in continuing its expanded role within the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty incorporates the Petersberg Tasks, which are listed in Article J.7.2, so the European Union can play a more active and constructive role in the search for international peace and security.  They are not a code word for a European army engaging in adventures around the globe.  Deputy De Rossa was correct to point out that the Amsterdam Treaty creates no obligation on Ireland or any other member state to participate in a conflict.</P>
    <P>Far from representing a threat to Ireland's policy of military neutrality, the Amsterdam Treaty enables the European Union to respond to the new challenges of the post-Cold War world in a manner which is in keeping with Ireland's traditions of United Nations peacekeeping and the traditions of the other three neutral members of the European Union.  This is achieved by the inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks in the treaty. These are humanitarian &mdash; rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management &mdash; tasks which were conceived in the context of support for United Nations and OSCE peacekeeping and crisis management.</P>
    <P>The tasks are voluntary on a case by case basis and are to be distinguished from commitments of common defence.  Neither a European Union common defence nor the integration of the Western European Union into the European Union is an objective of the Amsterdam Treaty or its protocols.  They remain mere possibilities and are subject to a number of lock mechanisms.  In his statement on 3 March, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, set out the scope of and safeguards in the treaty.  If the issue of a European Union common defence were to arise in the future it would be put to the people for their decision in a referendum.</P>
    <P>Despite suggestions to the contrary, the European Union does not aspire to become a nuclear superpower, waging war on neighbouring countries or regions.  There is nothing in the Amsterdam Treaty which supports such a contention. The inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks in the new treaty should not be seen as a threat to the United Nations.  Indeed, successive United Nations Secretaries-General have called for greater regional support for the efforts of the United Nations in peacekeeping and crisis management. The treaty explicitly situates the common foreign and security policy in the context of the principles of the United Nations charter.</P>
    <P>As there is no question of Ireland's policy of military neutrality being compromised by the Amsterdam Treaty, Deputy Gormley's amendment is unnecessary, superfluous and unwarranted.</P>

      <P>In a few minutes.  The Minister of State claimed that we have not been silent when confronted with changes in our neutrality. That is not true and I can refer to a number of instances.</P>
      <P>Neutrality has traditionally meant that Ireland has not become involved in military alliances and has not accepted their doctrines.  However, in 1995, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed to a fundamental doctrine of NATO and the Western European Union, the principle of nuclear deterrence.  Deputy Spring gave me a hard time this morning and I regret he is not present so I can confront him with this.  He told the House this morning that he did not agree with nuclear deterrence.  However, at an important meeting in Madrid in 1995, he accepted the principle.  The same principle has been accepted by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attending the Madrid meeting of the Western European Union Council of Ministers, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, gave his assent to a Western European Union strategy document European Security: A common concept of the 27 Western European Union countries. It was endorsed by all the countries involved in the Western European Union, full members, observers and associate members.  It states: &ldquo;The independent nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and France which have a deterrent <Col N="88" /> role of their own contribute to the overall deterrents and security of the Allies&rdquo;.  The footnote states that the four neutral countries in the European Union &mdash; Austria, Finland, Sweden and Ireland &mdash; were not party to certain NATO and Western European Union decisions on the role of nuclear weapons, that none of the four countries stated any objection to those decisions and did not seek to distance themselves from them.  By endorsing the Madrid document they accepted without question the principle of nuclear deterrents.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy.  When Deputy Spring was Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and I had responsibility for European Affairs a White Paper was published setting out the six principles which govern participation in security and defence organisations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy quoted statistics.  He will be aware that in the MRBI poll conducted in September 1996 almost 80 per cent indicated that they favoured participation in Partnership for Peace. Since the Partnership for Peace and Petersberg Tasks are similar I presume the Deputy would have no difficulty in incorporating them in the Amsterdam Treaty to be approved by the people.</P>

      <P>A total of 69 per cent indicated that they supported Irish neutrality.  That is all that matters.  If people do not know what Partnership for Peace stands for and what the Petersberg Tasks are, it is a deception.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the long-awaited White Paper, the first comprehensive statement on Ireland's role in world affairs.  For that reason it was welcome.  It states:</P>
      <P>The values that underlie Ireland's policy of neutrality have informed almost every aspect of our foreign policy.  These values have been a principal motivation behind our involvement in the search for collective security arrangements in the United Nations, in our participation in international peacekeeping, in working together with our partners in the European Union to preserve peace in Europe and worldwide, in our work for human rights and development and in our promotion of arms control and disarmament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper addressed the issue of nuclear weapons and recalled Ireland's pioneering role in developing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty <Col N="89" /> through its sponsorship of a UN motion on disarmament. It states:</P>
    <P>Twenty five years after the entry into force of the NPT and five years after the end of the Cold War the Government sees no justification for stocks of nuclear weapons and missile materials that exist today.  Successive Irish Governments have advocated the complete abolition of nuclear weapons and have worked for and encouraged concrete steps to that end.</P>
    <P>We should look at what Deputy Spring did at the Madrid conference.  There is a contradiction.</P>
    <P>We will say one thing on this side of the House and Deputy Mitchell and the Minister of State will say something else.  It will be up to the people to decide who they should believe.  As we approach 22 May the propaganda machine will hit high speed and we could, possibly, lose but that does not take from the validity of our case.  I am convinced this represents an erosion of Irish neutrality and is a serious backward step.  For that reason I again ask Members to support the amendment.</P>

If the referenda on the Amsterdam Treaty and the Northern Ireland peace process are held on the same day, 22 May, it could give rise to many complications, not least confusion. The Referendum Commission is being funded to put the case for and against the Amsterdam Treaty.  If the referendum on the Northern Ireland peace process is held on the same day, I presume we would be obliged to follow the same procedure and ask the Referendum Commission to put the case for and against.  That is daft.  We may find ourselves in a difficult situation if the State has to provide money to the Referendum Commission to put the case for and against something which will have been tortuously agreed through the peace process.  I ask the Minister of State to convey my concerns to the Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gormley quoted the revered founder and former leader of my party, Éamon de Valera, who ensured Irish neutrality was one of the great political statements this century.

    <P>In his statement to the House on 3 March, at the commencement of its second reading of the 18th Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the Minister for Foreign Affairs explained that the Government, on Committee Stage, would move an amendment to the proposed wording of Article 29.4.6 of the Constitution as contained in the published Bill. The amendment as set out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs three weeks ago was formally published on 19 March.  It relates to the second paragraph of Part I and Part II of the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment reads:</P>
    <P>The State may exercise the options or discretions provided by or under Articles 1.11, 2.5 and 2.15 of the Treaty referred to in subsection 5 of this section and the second and fourth Protocols set out in the said Treaty but any such exercise shall be subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas</P>
    <P>Taken together, the three Articles and two Protocols cited in the amendment correspond to the areas of the treaty cited in the explanatory memorandum to the published Bill in relation to the need for the new subsection 6.  The explanatory memorandum stated that the new subsection 6 was necessary, in addition to the new subsection 5, in order to confer on the State sufficient powers for it to exercise the options and discretions provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam should it so decide.  The explanatory memorandum instanced, in this connection, general provisions in the treaty on closer co-operation, flexibility, police and judicial co-operation and free movement pursuant to which obligations may be <Col N="92" /> entered into by a number of member states of the European Union short of the full membership.</P>
    <P>Following a lengthy, detailed and helpful round of discussions, the Government brought forward a modified wording of subsection 6.  During the debate on the Bill on Second Stage, the modified wording was endorsed by the three parties which formed the Government when the treaty was negotiated.  It is this modified wording which is before the House today as a Government amendment.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Government amendment is to make clear that the State is explicitly authorised to exercise the options and discretions provided by or under the three named Articles and two named Protocols to the treaty but that any such exercise shall be subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The amendment does not prejudice, and is not intended to prejudice, any other provisions of the treaty which are covered by the proposed Article 29.4.5.</P>
    <P>Taking the three Articles and two Protocols seriatim, they cover the following: Article 1.11 covers police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters; Article 2.5 allows for closer co-operation under normal Community business, known as the First Pillar; Article 2.15 inserts a new Title IIIa into the European Community Treaty and covers visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons.</P>
    <P>The second Protocol sets out how the Schengen arrangements are to be integrated into the framework of the European Union.  <i>Inter alia</i>, it provides that Ireland or the United Kingdom or both countries, which have not signed up to the Schengen agreements, may at any time request to take part in some or all of Schengen.  The Council will decide on such a request.</P>
    <P>The fourth Protocol establishes the position of the State in relation to Article 2.15. Ireland and the United Kingdom are exempt from the provisions of the new Title IIIa as long as they maintain the common travel area arrangements, although they may either together or individually participate in the adoption of specific measures. Ireland has stated in a declaration to the final Act that it intends to exercise its right to take part in the adoption of measures under Title IIIa to the maximum extent compatible with maintenance of the common travel area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs in a statement introducing the debate on Second Stage set out at some length the complex set of interrelated provisions in the Treaty of Amsterdam regarding what were known under the Maastricht Treaty as justice and home affairs.  These interrelated provisions account for four of the five specific elements covered by the amendment proposed today, namely Article 1.1 1, Article 2.15, the second Protocol and the fourth Protocol.  Article 2.15 and the second and fourth Protocols are closely related to each other in substance and I shall therefore group them together in my further comments.  Before doing so, I shall say a word <Col N="93" /> about Article 1.11 and I shall look briefly at Article 2.5, which concerns closer co-operation in the First Pillar.</P>
    <P>Article 1.1 1 of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for the replacement of Title VI of the Maastricht Treaty by a new restructured Title VI or Third Pillar, which will be concerned exclusively with provisions on police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters.  The new restructured Third Pillar has three Articles under which options may be exercised by any member state. These options or discretions enable a member state to adopt a convention established by the Council; such conventions may come into force once they have been adopted by a majority of the member states; to agree to accept the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to give preliminary rulings at the request of national courts on points of Community law relating to a wide range of matters adopted under the Third Pillar &mdash; within this option there are two sub-options, namely states may decide whether any of their courts or tribunals may request preliminary rulings or whether only courts and tribunals of final instance may do so; to join in the new provision in the Third Pillar for closer co-operation among at least a majority of member states, using the institutions of the Union, in matters coming under the restructured Third Pillar.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs in a statement introducing the debate on Second Stage also made clear that, in areas of the treaty related to free movement, Ireland in negotiation secured a number of opt-outs, with the possibility of opting-in on certain conditions.  The Minister said then, and I repeat today, that what Ireland has negotiated is, in a sense, an ideal arrangement.  Our right to preserve the common travel area with the United Kingdom is confirmed, but we and the United Kingdom may also request to participate in any actions at the level of the Union &mdash; either under the new Title lIIa or in the context of Schengen which covers matters some of which fall within the new Title IIIa of the European Community Treaty and some of which fall within the new Third Pillar &mdash; where we consider it to be in our interests to do so.  These opt-outs for Ireland, with the possibility of opting-in on certain conditions, arise under Article 2.15, and the second and fourth Protocols.</P>
    <P>The possibility for this State to opt-in to actions under Article 2.15 and the second and fourth Protocols having been expressly negotiated, it is appropriate that the State be given the power to avail itself of these options.  It is, I suggest, especially right and fitting that the exercise by the State of these particular options should be subject to prior parliamentary approval.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, Ireland and the United Kingdom do not participate in the Schengen co-operation system, which has developed outside the European Community-European Union Treaty framework and which the Treaty of Amsterdam will bring into that legal framework for the 13 member states which are involved.  The <Col N="94" /> Schengen <i>acquis</i> consists of a comprehensive series of measures aimed at the gradual abolition of checks on persons crossing internal borders between participating States.  These measures are in the following areas: the harmonisation of visa and asylum policies; police and security co-operation; the harmonisation of provisions on weapons and ammunition; judicial co-operation; the development of a common information system in relation to entry, the granting of visas and police co-operation.</P>
    <P>Under the second Protocol, Ireland and the United Kingdom will not be bound by what has already been agreed in Schengen but will be able to opt in at any time to some or all of what has already been done and to take part in any new proposals to build further on it, in both cases subject to terms and conditions which are set out in the Protocol.  Schengen deals with a range of issues such as borders, immigration controls and policing which overlap with the provisions of the new Title IIIa on visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons. Other areas of Schengen co-operation will be dealt with in the new Third Pillar.</P>
    <P>Article 2.5 of the Treaty of Amsterdam will add general provisions to the European Community Treaty which will allow a group of member states less than the full membership to use the Union's institutions to develop closer co-operation between themselves under the First Pillar. To ensure that the introduction of general flexibility provisions would not over time damage the coherence and solidarity of the Union, the treaty defines a tight framework of rules to govern the circumstances in which flexibility provisions may be invoked.  The rules specify that the exercise of closer co-operation should aim at furthering the objectives of the Union, respect the principles of the treaties and the single institutional framework of the Union, only be used as a last resort, concern at least a majority of States, not affect the <i>acquis communautaire</i>, be open to all member states, and comply with the specific additional criteria applicable to closer co-operation in the First and Third Pillars.</P>
    <P>Article 2.5 establishes specific additional criteria, to the effect that closer co-operation in the First Pillar must not concern areas of exclusive Community competence, affect Community policies, actions or programmes, concern the citizenship of the Union or discriminate between nationals of member states, go beyond the limits of Community powers under the treaty or constitute a discrimination or a restriction of trade or distort competition between member states.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, one of the options which arises under Article 1.11 is the option to participate in closer co-operation in the restructured Third Pillar.  The general flexibility provisions of Article 1.11 and Article 2.5 do not apply to the Second Pillar, which concerns the common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>Taken as a whole, the amendment reflects the fact that the specific Articles and Protocols which <Col N="95" /> it identifies contain options and discretions.  The other new element which it introduces is a requirement for prior parliamentary approval for the exercise of the options and discretions provided by or under those specific Articles and Protocols. From what I have said about the specific Articles and Protocols, it will be clear that they concern matters which are important to the citizen and which could impact directly on him or her.  It is therefore, I suggest, entirely right and appropriate that, should the Government wish in the future to take up the options in question, it should first lay a proposal in this regard before the Dáil and Seanad.  It should make its case fully and in context to the elected representatives of the people, engage in a full debate and, subject to parliamentary approval, proceed to exercise the option in question.</P>
    <P>I have set out at some length all that is covered by the amendment which I am proposing today on behalf of the Government.  The purpose of Article 29.4.6 of the Constitution, amended as I have proposed, is to provide legal certainty with respect to the State's ability to implement the flexibility provisions of the treaty and to exercise the opting-in rights secured in the negotiations, subject to the prior approval of Dáil and Seanad Éireann.  On this basis, I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The Government in the way it handled sections 5 and 6 and the subsequent amendment to section 6 was close to breaking a consensus of the majority of parties in the House on how we would approach this issue; it came close to snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. The provisions in section 6 allowing for opt-ins were not necessary.  It is something of a belt and braces approach.  The amendment has been tabled as a face saving exercise because the Government simply would not admit there was an error of judgment in including section 6 in the first place.  However, a belt and braces approach is better than none and I will not oppose the amendment.</P>
      <P>Options have been exercised in the past.  Under the Maastricht Treaty, for example, EMU criteria deal with the option to qualify and if qualified to opt in or stay out.  There can hardly be any option more dramatic, serious or historic than the option to join EMU yet that was provided for in the treaty, without an equivalent in section 6 of the Referendum Bill or the amendment before us.</P>

    <P>Fine Gael is a strong, unapologetic pro-European integration party.  It is important that the Amsterdam Treaty is passed as it is one in a series of treaties and acts which are bringing about the peaceful integration of the continent of Europe. It started in 1951 with the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty six years after the end of the Second World War.  A total of 60 million Europeans killed each other during the first half of this century in the cause of so-called nationalism. The strongest navy and army determined the <Col N="96" /> power of a nation in Europe.  In the second half of the century, beginning with the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty, 15 states in western Europe have integrated.  The integration process is ongoing and those who knocked EMU should not forget it is part of the process.  I am happy to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I support the amendment which arises from the Government rowing back very fast from its original position because it was facing a serious political situation. Any provision that has the safeguard of at least allowing a debate in the House should be supported. There should again be more discussion on the key issues covered by the Bill.  It is unthinkable that the Government without reference to the House or the people could have had the <i>carte blanche</i> provided for in the initial proposals.</P>
      <P>An example of what is at stake is the development of Europol and action on international crime, such as heroin trafficking, etc.  The Bill dealing with this passed all Stages in the House with virtually no debate.  It provides for potentially serious developments in future that will finish up in the House again.  Essentially, a supranational police force is being created which is not accountable to the European Parliament or any other democratic institution within the EU or individual states.  This should not have been accepted by Ireland yet, as usual, it was but I fear this will not be the end of the matter.  Undoubtedly, any such force will overstep the mark and under the cover of cleaning up the horror of drugs, etc., will create interference with the genuine civil liberties of law abiding citizens.  As a result of the Government recognising the political reality and the wish for democratic accountability by ordinary people, at least Members will have the opportunity to debate individual decisions that the Government wishes to put before the House.</P>

Ratification enjoys almost unanimous support in the House and this reflects the overwhelming support in Ireland for European integration and participation in that process.  Ireland's future is inconceivable without the European Union.  The Treaty of Amsterdam is the next necessary step in the creation of a larger, more responsive and ultimately more successful European Union.  I am sure the House will join with me in urging that no effort be spared to ensure a very high turnout in the forthcoming referendum. This objective will be assisted by the referendum commission.  It behoves us all to ensure that Ireland makes a strong, positive statement when the treaty is put before the people in May.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.  &rdquo;</P>
      <P>The issue of allowances to Deputies and Senators has been put on the long finger for far too long.  It has been widely recognised for some time that the workload of politicians has increased substantially over the past number of years.  They work long and unsociable hours and, more often than not, incur large expenses for which they are not sufficiently remunerated. However, bearing all this in mind there is no easy way to announce more money for politicians as it is invariably seen as politicians piling more money on the political gravy train.</P>
      <P>The job of a legislator is becoming more unattractive by the day.  However, suppressing wage increases and not being adequately compensated for the work that one does is not healthy for the political system in general.  It merely feeds the apologetic nature of the current climate where individuals who work hard are not rewarded for the extra expenses they may incur.  The proposed changes I am putting forward in the Bill will allow the Minister for Finance to change the current allowances to an amount which is fair and equitable and will reward Members of this House for the valuable work they do on behalf of their constituents. I do not apologise for this, and neither should any other Member.</P>
      <P>The Bill is largely an enabling measure under three broad headings.  First, it will enable recognition to be accorded to the work carried out by Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas who undertake specific parliamentary responsibilities over and above their normal duties as parliamentarians. Second, it will update the statutory enabling provisions for travel and secretarial facilities for Members and parties to assist them in their parliamentary duties.  Third, the Bill contains the necessary enabling powers to deal appropriately with the pension arrangements of judges and court officers in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in the case of Judge McMenamin.  It will also deal with some anomalies in relation to pensions of Ministers and other officeholders.</P>
      <P>The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector recommended the payment of allowances to the chairpersons of Oireachtas committees in 1992.  It made this recommendation because it considered that the workload of the chairperson significantly exceeded what would be regarded as the fully extended range of responsibilities and workload of the &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; Member of the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) (Amendment) Act, 1994, gave effect to the recommendation of the review body by providing for the payment of allowances to the chairpersons of Oireachtas committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="99" /> Since then, there have been substantial changes in the role, functions and number of Oireachtas committees.  In addition to the more traditional committees, such as the Committee of Public Accounts, we now have a new range of committees whose scope extends to scrutiny of the performance of all Departments.  This change is an integral part of the new emphasis on quality service, transparency and public accountability which is at the heart of the strategic management initiative.</P>
    <P>While the new committee system is in its infancy, it has been generally accepted that it is working very well.  The role of the members of these committees in bringing about this situation and in ensuring that it continues is vital.  In particular, there is a need to recognise the additional burdens being placed on committee members other than the chairpersons.  For this reason, it is timely to provide for the payment of allowances not only to the chairpersons but also to those Members of the Oireachtas who hold other positions of responsibility which are vital to the proper functioning of committees and the Oireachtas generally.  Accordingly, section 4 of the Bill provides that the Government may, by order, provide for the payment of allowances to the chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of, and whips to, Oireachtas committees.  It also provides for the payment of allowances to the chairpersons of sub-committees of Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the Government may, by order, provide for the allocation of an annual amount to the chairpersons of Oireachtas committees. This allocation is intended to assist the committees to carry out their roles by the payment of allowances to members in respect of rapporteur or other services which they may provide. Only members of committees who do not receive an allowance under sections 3 or 4 may receive such an allowance.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of allowances for the chairpersons of Oireachtas committees, it was decided to pay an allowance to the Leader of the House in the Seanad.  The question of allowances for the holders of certain other recognised positions in the Dáil and Seanad also arises.  As in the case of the chairpersons of Oireachtas committees, there is no doubt that the holders of certain positions in the Dáil and Seanad carry out roles which involve additional duties and responsibilities which significantly exceed those of &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; Members of the Oireachtas.  Neither is there any doubt that the roles performed by the holders of these positions contribute greatly to the efficient operation of the Houses.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, section 3 provides that the Government may, by order, provide for the payment of allowances to Members of the Oireachtas who hold certain positions in the Dáil and Seanad.  The allowances would be payable to the Members concerned in respect of their special duties as holders of these positions.  It is proposed that the following positions in the Dáil would <Col N="100" /> attract allowances: the Assistant Government Whip and party whips.  The positions in the Seanad, in addition to the Leader of the House are: the Deputy Leader of the House, the Opposition Leader of the Seanad and the Government and Opposition Whips.</P>
    <P>Allowances currently payable to the chairmen of various Oireachtas committees are pensionable on a <i>pro rata</i> basis under the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) pensions scheme.  This will, of course, continue to be the case.  All of the new allowances under sections 3, 4 and 5 will also be pensionable, and I will make amendments to the pension scheme to carry this through.</P>
    <P>In view of the pensionability of these allowances, section 10 provides that the Minister for Finance may make regulations to provide for deductions of pension contributions from these allowances.  This will be done on the same basis as applies to the chairmen's allowances at present.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for a number of technical amendments to clarify what has become present practice in relation to the management of facilities for parties in Leinster House.  Specifically, it will abolish the requirement that a deduction be made from the party leader's allowances when the leader is provided with a car at State expense. It will also clarify the present position about payment of allowances to independents and underpin present practice about the provision of secretarial assistance to qualifying parties.</P>
    <P>Sections 12, 13 and 14 are complex, but the principle is simple enough.  These sections deal with two issues which arise in the operation of the pension arrangements for Ministers, Ministers of State and parliamentary officeholders, which it is appropriate to address.</P>
    <P>The first of these issues is in relation to the calculation of pensionable service.  In most areas of the public sector one's pension is based on the length of time served.  If a person serves for five years, they get a pension in respect of those five years; if they serve five and a half years, their pension is based on five and a half years' service and so forth.  By contrast, where Ministers and officeholders are concerned only completed years of service are reckoned and any part years are disregarded.  A person could have five years and 364 days' service but the pension would still be based only on five years' service.  This Bill would change the situation so that, within the normal overall limits on reckonable service, part years would be reckoned on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  A former officeholder with five and a half years' service will therefore get a slightly better pension than the officeholder with five years' service and less than the officeholder with six years' service.</P>
    <P>The other main issue dealt with in relation to the pensions of officeholders concerns the position of former holders of offices which are referred to as &ldquo;secretarial&rdquo; offices in the pensions legislation.  These include the office of Minister of State, Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann and Leas-Chathaoirleach.  A secretarial pension is calculated on the basis of the <Col N="101" /> salary of the relevant secretarial office &mdash; most frequently the Minister of State salary.  Even where the person in receipt of such a pension had significant service as a Minister, though not sufficient to qualify for a ministerial pension &mdash; just below three years, perhaps &mdash; the pension payable will normally be based on the Minister of State salary.  It is my belief that service in a ministerial capacity should be more fully recognised than heretofore and the Bill therefore provides that, where more beneficial to the individual, a secretarial pension can be based on the average salary of the qualifying offices held by the person concerned, weighted according to the length of time spent in each qualifying office.  I am sure the House will agree that these changes in pension arrangements are reasonable and appropriate.</P>
    <P>In section 9 I propose a number of amendments to the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938.  First, I am repealing section 4(3) of the Act, which relates to regulation making powers in respect of Members' travelling facilities, because this particular provision is no longer in use.  For some time now regulations concerning such facilities have been made under the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1964.</P>
    <P>Second, I propose to repeal section 4(4) of the 1938 Act under which Members are obliged to submit their claims for reimbursement of travelling expenses to the Leinster House authorities within 100 days of such expenses being incurred. l think Members will agree it is anachronistic, in this day and age, to have such a provision in primary legislation.  Furthermore, as Members generally will be aware, failure to observe this time limit means that claims for travelling expenses cannot be paid, even though such expenses have been incurred by Members in the exercise of their parliamentary duties.  The repeal of the &ldquo;100 day rule&rdquo; provision in the 1938 Act will address this issue.  I also intend to deal in the future with the question of time limits on the lodging of claims for recoupment of travelling expenses in regulations. The technical amendments in section 18 to the regulation-making powers governing Members' travelling expenses will facilitate this.</P>
    <P>Some of the existing restrictions on payment of overnight allowances and travelling facilities for Members attending meetings in Leinster House are anomalous.  Members will be pleased to hear that, in section 15 of the Bill, I am making provision to extend the number of occasions when an overnight allowance may be paid for accommodation costs arising from attendance at Leinster House.  Specifically, where Members wish to attend Leinster House for the purpose of using the facilities available in the House on non-sitting days, they will be entitled to claim an overnight allowance for accommodation expenses, subject to an annual limit of 25 such occasions per year. This will be of benefit to those Members who, heretofore, have been unable to avail of the facilities of the House during recess periods, because <Col N="102" /> there was no legislative provision in place to allow for the reimbursement of their accommodation expenses in Dublin.  This measure will, I hope, encourage Members to make fuller use of the facilities available in the House, thus further assisting them in the performance of their parliamentary duties.</P>
    <P>Members of both Houses have long argued for improvements in the level of secretarial support available under the existing provisions, arguing that they incur substantial additional costs of secretarial help outside Leinster House out of their own pockets.  In response to this request, section 16 provides for an augmentation of the existing provisions for secretarial facilities by introducing a new allowance for this purpose of £5,000 per annum for Deputies and £3,750 per annum for Seanadóirí.</P>
    <P>A number of other provisions in Part 2 of the Bill are of a minor technical nature and I do not propose to go into any great detail on them.  For example, sections 17, 19, 20 and 22 fall into this category.  Section 21 extends to Members' daily travel allowance, overnight allowance, constituency telephone allowance and the new special secretarial allowance the existing statutory exemption from income tax that already applies to Members' general expense allowance.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part III of the Bill are intended to achieve two objectives.  For serving judges and court officers and future appointees to such offices, the rate of retirement lump sum will be increased from the current rate of one and one half times the pension to a rate which, as with most other groups of public servants, gives a lump sum of up to one and one half times pay.  It also provides enabling powers to deal appropriately with the position of judges and court officers who retired before 19 December 1996, the date of the Supreme Court decision in the case of Judge McMenamin which related to the superannuation provisions of judges.</P>
    <P>The background to this matter is that, prior to 1961, judges qualified for a pension of up to two-thirds of pay but with no lump sum or death gratuity. Following representations from judges, the present arrangements for lump sums and death gratuities were put in place in 1961 on a self-financing basis.  An actuarial valuation of the Judiciary's terms determined that a retirement lump sum of one and one half times the pension and a death gratuity of one year's pay could be financed by a reduction of 25 per cent in the pension previously payable, thus giving a revised maximum pension of 50 per cent of pay.  As a result, the superannuation terms currently applying to District Judges and court officers provide for a pension which accrues at the rate of two eightieths of salary per year of service subject to a maximum of one half of pay after 20 years.  The lump sum is three eightieths of salary per year of service subject to a maximum of one and one half times pension.  In contrast, the lump sum of most public service groups is one and one half times pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> For Supreme, High and Circuit Court Judges, the pension accrues on the basis of two eightieths of salary for each of the first five years of service and three eightieths in respect of each year from the sixth to the 15th year, subject to a maximum of one half pay after 15 years.  The lump sum is three eightieths of salary for each of the first five years of service and nine one hundred and sixtieths of salary in respect of each year from the sixth to the 15th year.  As indicated previously, on death in service a death gratuity of one year's pay is payable.</P>
    <P>For some considerable time, the Judiciary have claimed that it should be given the same rate of lump sum as public servants generally.  Judges took up the matter of their pension provisions on a number of occasions with the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  In report No. 30 of 30 November 1987, the review body stated:</P>
    <P>Many of the submissions we received from the judiciary expressed strong dissatisfaction with certain aspects of their non-salary conditions and suggested.that the Review Body should deal with these issues.  Some of these issues are outside our terms of reference.  We [the review body] recommend therefore that the Minister for Justice should initiate a review of the current non-salary conditions of judges.</P>
    <P>More recently, the late District Judge Liam McMenamin took a case in the High Court claiming, <i>inter alia</i>, that District Judges should have their retirement lump sums doubled.  In 1994 the High Court accepted that the actuarial basis for calculating the 25 per cent reduction in judges' pensions required to pay for the retirement lump sum and death gratuity was correct in 1961 but it ruled that because of changes since then, principally the introduction of the arrangement whereby pensions in payment are increased by reference to increases in the pay of serving staff, the retirement lump sum should now be 1.9 times pension.  The High Court declared that:</P>
    <P>The State, in permitting a gross inequality to arise between the reduction in pension of District Court Judges and the costs of the lump sum gratuities intended to be met by such reduction, is in breach of its constitutional duty to secure pension rights for District Judges which are not irrational or wholly inequitable.</P>
    <P>On appeal the Supreme Court, in dealing with the actuarial basis of the 1961 arrangements, stated that:</P>
    <P>It appears from the evidence in this case, that this situation has changed radically since 1961 and that the deduction of one quarter from the pension to which judges are entitled is adequate to provide a lump sum on retirement of 1.9 times the pension payable to judges on retirement rather than 1.5 times as provided for by law.</P>
    <P>Either the deduction of 25 per cent when a <Col N="104" /> deduction of 22 per cent would be sufficient for the purpose or the failure to pay a gratuity of 1.9 times the pension, amounts to a reduction or diminution of the pension entitlement of the Appellant.</P>
    <P>This situation requires to be remedied by the Oireachtas in accordance with the provisions of Articles 35 and 36 of the Constitution because the present situation has led to an unjust and inequitable result whereby the Appellant has suffered loss whether by way of excessive reduction in his pension or the payment of an inadequate lump sum by way of gratuity.</P>
    <P>The manner in which this situation is remedied is a matter for the Oireachtas and it is not open to this Court to interfere with the manner in which this situation is dealt with by the Oireachtas unless the Oireachtas fails to have regard to its constitutional obligations in this regard and this Court must assume at this stage that the Oireachtas will have regard to such obligations.</P>
    <P>In drafting the legislation which is before the House, the Office of the Attorney General advised that implementation of the Supreme Court judgment would necessitate change not only in relation to the retirement lump sums of serving judges but also in relation to retirees before 19 December 1996 where the judge is still alive or there is a spouse's pension in payment.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the increase in the lump sums proposed in the Bill for serving and future judges and court officers goes beyond what is strictly required in order to comply with the Supreme Court decision.  Given that the review body recommended that there be a review of this matter and having regard to the fact that most other public servants already have an entitlement to a maximum lump sum of one and one-half times pay, there is a strong case for giving judges and court officers corresponding terms.  The Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>As regards the detailed provisions in Part III, sections 24 to 27 substitute the actual rate of pension payable to judges and court officers for the existing arrangement which provides for a notional pension of up to two-thirds pay which is then reduced by one-quarter, that is, to a maximum of one-half of pay, in the case of people who qualify for the retirement lump sum and death gratuity.  That arrangement was incorporated in the 1961 Act because that legislation had to cater for judges who opted to retain the pre-1961 arrangements as well as for judges who opted for the new arrangements.  All judges in the former category have now retired so the arrangement is no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 and 29 provide for the increases in the retirement lump sums.  Section 28 has the effect of increasing the retirement lump sums of serving and future judges and court officers up to standard public sector levels.  Section 29 provides enabling power to address the requirements of the Supreme Court decision in so far as it applies <Col N="105" /> to judges and court officers who retired before the date of the McMenamin decision.</P>
    <P>Section 30 provides for certain technical amendments of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions)(Amendment) Act, 1991, which are required as a result of the amendments in sections 24 to 27 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the proposals in the Bill are largely of an enabling nature to facilitate improvements in the facilities for Members in pursuit of their parliamentary duties, recognise the contribution being made by Members who are being given new positions of responsibility in this context, and remove some anomalies in relation to certain pension entitlements of former Ministers and officeholders.  I am also availing of the opportunity presented by the Bill to deal appropriately with pension arrangements for judges and court officers in the wake of the McMenamin judgment.</P>
    <P>On passing of the Bill it is my intention to bring forward at an early date the appropriate regulations to give effect to the changes now being proposed.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Finance for explaining the Bill in great detail.  His speech, which has been circulated, will be helpful to all Deputies and Senators in understanding the changes proposed.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Deputies and Senators in the Fine Gael Party I welcome the changes proposed by the Minister but changes in allowances are no substitution for a proper salary.  Deputies and Senators of the Houses of the Oireachtas are very badly paid.  Many Deputies of my age have had the experience of their children, who are in their 20s and just out of college, earning more than the people who represent parliamentary democracy.</P>
      <P>We do not want to engage in a long, self pitying whinge &mdash; that is not the purpose of my remarks &mdash; but the Bill has wider implications.  People are motivated to come into politics for many reasons. Many are motivated by the desire to give public service.  They are certainly not motivated by considerations of money.  People must have a salary which is sufficient to lead at least the kind of life they led before they came into politics.</P>
      <P>Increasingly, the number of people who go forward for election to the Dáil in particular is being decreased.  Certain categories of people &mdash; I was in a favourable category &mdash; in a public service or teaching job can effectively come on secondment to the Dáil.  That puts one in a favourable position but hundreds if not thousands of people in the private sector could not possibly seek election to the Dáil because they could not afford to work the hours required for the salary being offered and, more importantly, they could not afford to risk the security of their position and have nothing to go back to when one takes the exigencies of elections into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware, if they examine their records or read Deputy Nealon's book, that approximately one-quarter of the Dáil has <Col N="106" /> changed in all recent elections.  Of the 166 Members, approximately 40 &mdash; over 40 on the last occasion &mdash; either retire and do not seek re-election or fail to be re-elected.  That is a large turnover. Any sensible young person with a good job and good promotional prospects in the private sector would be crazy to put that at risk and incur the exigencies and difficulties of public office and to measure it against a salary which for many people of reasonably modest income in the professions would involve an actual reduction the day they come into this House.  The Bill is not a substitute for a proper salary.  The Buckley and Gleeson reports served this House and its Members very badly in the recommendations they made over the years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the terms of the Bill.  The committee system is well established now.  The chairmen, vice-chairmen and Whips do a good job, and much of the work of the House is now conducted in committees.  Persons who hold those positions have an additional responsibility to attend and work in the House, unlike colleagues who do not hold those positions, and they should be modestly rewarded.  I understand the Minister has in mind the establishment and regulation of awards which already are fairly modest.  It is a good idea also to reward rapporteurs in committees and there is provision in the Bill that the Minister, by regulation, may in future apply an allowance to a rapporteur who carries out particular work for a committee.</P>
    <P>The committee system is operating in an uneven manner.  I am of the view that we have too many committees but if the principal decision is that we need a committee to match every Department, it will be difficult to reduce their number while having specialist committees of the Houses also.</P>
    <P>The manner in which we conduct our business gives an impression that we are inefficient and that we do not properly set about our business.  It is absolutely ludicrous in a House with 166 Members that committee sittings take place simultaneously with plenary sessions.  Any county council in the country would have a bigger turnout for crucial debates than this House would have even on a matter as important as Report Stage of a Finance Bill or the debate we had earlier today on matters of foreign policy, European defence and security.</P>
    <P>We must get to the stage when plenary sessions are shorter and well attended.  Plenary sessions should not take place unless approximately one-quarter of the Members of the House attend.  A minimum of 40 Members should be in attendance but that cannot happen if we have long plenary sittings where work expands to fill the time available and a kind of Murphy's law operates Proper committees backed up by much sharper and shorter plenary sessions, where real business is conducted, would give a far better impression of this House than is being communicated through &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; or the short clips of business communicated to the public in the 6 o'clock <Col N="107" /> and 9 o'clock television news.  We do not look well, we do not sound well and it appears that everybody is just passing through.  The general impression people get looking at &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; is that Deputies do not do their job. There is little point trying to explain to them that Deputies are in their offices conducting constituency work, that they are watching the proceedings on the monitor and that they are under a whipping system in the House.  I sometimes despair when I see the school parties come into the Public Gallery and look down into the Chamber.  The number of Members present now would be regarded as a big crowd.  We are selling ourselves short.  We are supposed to be in the communications business.  We are supposed to be very image conscious.  We might be conscious of individual or party image but I do not see any consciousness of the image of this House.</P>
    <P>There is a connection between the low turnout in elections and the impression that what we do here is becoming increasingly irrelevant.  I suggest a very modest proposal which should be accepted across the parties.  We should sharpen the work of the committees which are beginning to work well but we should also sharpen the work of the plenary sessions of the House.  The Order of Business is well attended; it sounds like a normal democracy and a normal Parliament in action. The morning session should consist of the Order of Business followed by Taoiseach's Question Time for half an hour or three quarters of an hour.  The rest of the day should be dedicated to committee work.  Real plenary sessions should take place in the House from about 7.55 p.m. where the work of the committees would be reported back to the House and Second Stages taken.</P>
    <P>The House should not sit unless a large quorum is in attendance and not on standby for when the quorum bells ring.  Plenary sessions should not take place unless about a quarter of the Members &mdash; about 40 people &mdash; are present.  There might then be real debate and we would look and sound like parliamentarians again.  It is not that the work is not done but that a bad impression is given.  While we are reflecting on the committee system and the Minister is rewarding chairmen and other committee officeholders, it is worth being self critical also and looking at the impression which is created, particularly by the plenary sessions in the House.</P>
    <P>Much of the work which carries this Parliament forward is done by Members of the Opposition Front Bench.  In future, party leaders will have to fill Front Benches on some kind of punishment detail because they are the only people who are not being rewarded in this Bill.  Front Bench members of a party are normally not appointed as committee chairmen, vice-chairmen and Whips because they already have a position.  Those who carry forward the actual policy work will be doing so without any additional reward, which is a flaw in the system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> The Minister has also omitted the category of acting chairmen of the House, who put in a great deal of time.  I cannot see why the substitutes for the Ceann Comhairle cannot be rewarded if those who chair committees are to be rewarded.  That is anomalous and invidious and if the Minister cannot change it under regulation he should do so by an amendment on Committee or Report Stage.  Many acting chairmen will receive committee allowances, in any case, so we are only talking about three or four additional people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the overnight allowances.  It is nice not to be out of pocket.  Any of us on the Front Bench who live in the country come to Dublin throughout the summer, apart from our normal fortnight's holidays, and stay overnight.  We come to Dublin every week during the summer, although there might not be any Front Bench meetings during the first three weeks of August. Until the Minister introduced this provision, we paid for the overnights out of our own pockets and we had no way of claiming it back, either through tax claims or claims on the public purse. That is unfair.  People who must stay in Dublin during the recesses because of their parliamentary or party duties should be able to claim their expenses and I welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>The secretarial allowances are also welcome. People have different practices.  My secretary is in Leinster House, as are those of many Members.  I also need secretarial assistance in my constituency and this allowance will help in a small way. However, I wish to point out a further anomaly. A Member whose secretary is based in the constituency receives a start-up grant for providing an office and an annuity towards the expenses of that office.  However, those of us whose secretaries are based in Leinster House must incur the expenses of a constituency office ourselves.</P>
    <P>It cost me money to build and set up and heat my constituency office.  I must pay rates on it because the local authority regards it as a commercial enterprise.  I must also pay liability insurance to cover anyone coming into it who might claim against me.  However, because my secretary is based in Leinster House I cannot avail of the start-up grant or the annuities which are paid to those whose secretaries are based in their constituencies.  That is severely anomalous because my colleagues whose offices are based in their constituencies can use all the facilities in Leinster House.  They do not have a secretary here but they have the same accommodation I do &mdash; we do not put them out in the backyard and they do not have to work under umbrellas like people at the races do.  We should make the playing pitch truly level.</P>
    <P>I welcome, in general, the provisions in respect of the tidying up of pensions.  It is a bit severe that officeholders who serve less than three years in office do not receive any pension.  There is a case to be made for a portion of a year being treated as a full year for the first three years so that a person who served for two and a half years, for example, would be treated as pensionable.  I <Col N="109" /> welcome the minor amendments which were made subsequent to that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the changes made in respect of the judges and court officers, I do not believe the Minister had any choice but to act.  The decision of the courts in the case brought by Judge McMenamin seems to make it mandatory on the Minister to amend the treatment of lump sums along the lines which he is now proposing.</P>
    <P>I do not know what scope the Minister has to take on board any advice we give him here. However, his proposals will be generally welcomed in the House and generally deplored outside the House, but what else is new?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is new?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable why they are deplored outside the House because, as Deputy Noonan said, we are very slow to promote what we are trying to do in our membership of the Oireachtas.  Whenever a suggestion is made to improve the circumstances of Members there are headlines in the media.  When a professional submission was made to the Buckley review group, it was publicised as if we were receiving those recommended changes and people still believe we got them.  The Buckley decision was communicated to two Governments, one of which accepted it in principle, but neither of them paid it.</P>
      <P>The process of an independent review of the salary structures and expenses involved the making of reports by professionals.  Those reports were not acted upon but the media have always projected the idea that they were granted.  That makes it very difficult to reassure people that, although it was written about in the media, it did not happen.</P>
      <P>This package was flagged well before Christmas in the media and everyone thought we had received the increases for Christmas.  We still have not got them but at least the Minister has grasped the nettle and put into legislation a way for Members of the Oireachtas to recoup their expenses.  This happened after a long, tedious process of examination of all the claims which were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that Members who at present get £2,000 a year in telephone expenses incur expenditure of £5,000 and £6,000 in the interests of their constituents out of their own pockets which is forgotten about by the media.  When officials of the Department of Finance who wanted to ensure the claims were legitimate trawled the accommodation available within reasonable distance of Leinster House, they discovered the amount of compensation paid to Members who had to stay overnight was far less than the costs.  Likewise the mileage allowance, which the Minister now has the opportunity to regulate.  The applicable mileage allowances for the Civil Service do not equate to the kind of mileage which Members of the Oireachtas travel on an ongoing basis.  For example, to undertake one day's clinics in my <Col N="110" /> constituency last Saturday I drove 120 miles over 11 hours.  I then spent most of Sunday preparing and documenting the problems I encountered. That is why none of my four sons would attempt to take up politics.  They all earn much more than I.</P>
    <P>We either pay people properly or there will be no incentive for them to give a service to the State and to those they wish to represent.  Colleagues who won seats in the 1992 general election and lost them in the general election last year and were fortunate to be seconded from their professions found, on returning to their jobs, that their new salaries far exceeded what they received as Members of the Oireachtas.  They gained money by losing their seats.  There must be something wrong with a democracy which encourages people who wish to serve the State for a reasonable recompense not to be re-elected when they can return to their profession and be paid more.</P>
    <P>The Minister has addressed many anomalies in this wideranging Bill.  In some instances, decisions by the courts placed a constitutional obligation on the Minister to respond, especially in the area of justices.  While the media will only write about politicians because they are popular figures for criticism, none of us should apologise for what the Minister has done in grasping the nettle of inadequate accommodation and recoupment of expenditure involved in our parliamentary duties and for providing that people should be paid appropriately.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his courage in addressing the anomalies which were pointed out to previous Ministers without success.  I also welcome the fact that, for the first time, he has addressed some of the outstanding problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not address the fundamental issue of Dáil salaries.  Instead, it extends overnight expenses for non Dublin Deputies, proposes the introduction of allowances for Deputies with responsibility posts in the new committee structure, creates an allowance of £5,000 for additional support staff for Deputies and makes changes in the provisions relating to the pensions of Ministers, Ministers of State and other officeholders.  It also provides for improvements in the retirement lump sums payable to certain members of the Judiciary for the reasons the Minister has stated.</P>
      <P>Inevitably, some of the measures proposed will be seen as an alternative route to tackling the issue of basic Dáil salaries, which successive Governments have avoided in recent years.  I would have preferred an approach that would have restored the basic pay of Deputies on an established pay comparison basis and created a serious research facility for Opposition Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding some of the changes made by the Government, we are now in danger of moving from being a Parliament which did all of its business in the Dáil Chamber to one which is struggling to make operational an elaborate committee <Col N="111" /> structure more appropriate to a Parliament four times our size.  It is undesirable that the configuration of our committee structure should be dictated by assuaging the aspirations of disappointed candidates for Government office, irrespective of which Government is in power.  It is understandable that if a Member of this House is to conscientiously shoulder the additional burden of a committee chairman, he or she should enjoy a stipend commensurate with that responsibility.</P>
    <P>However, I do not agree that the provision of allowances should go beyond the position of chairperson.  For that reason, I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to excise section 5.  The Government, and perhaps other Deputies, will argue that the purpose of the section is to enable committee members to have approved initiatives properly researched.  However, I do not believe that it will work like that in practice.</P>
    <P>I support what I believe will come to be seen as one of the most worthwhile initiatives taken by a Minister for Finance in respect of the functioning of this House in section 15 which, for the first time, opens the prospect for Opposition legislators to access research expertise.  However, I do not accept that section 5 is the way to enhance this facility.  It is open to abuse.</P>
    <P>The imbalance in resource available to the Executive as opposed to the Opposition is one of the most serious threats to the effective functioning of our parliamentary democracy.  The notion that a Minister, supported by the entire resources of the Civil Service, including the Office of the Attorney General, can be seriously challenged by an Opposition Deputy supported by a secretary is laughable.  Quality opposition of legislation is dependent on political parties relying on voluntary advice or on party staff whose salaries must be funded from party resources, thus giving rise to other questions that have taken up a good deal of parliamentary hours in this House in recent years.</P>
    <P>The contrast between being and not being in Government is not, as some commentators would have us believe, a chauffeur driven Mercedes but rather the virtually total absence of support staff for the Opposition Deputy.  The complexity of issues and legislation before the House nowadays is such that they are no longer capable of being dealt with in the afternoon, when the gentlemen of the Bar ramble in from their real place of employment.  In addition, the Opposition Deputy must confront a highly competent permanent government in the Civil Service, but one that is characterised by obsessive secrecy.</P>
    <P>The real answer to changing the balance between accountability and control and ensuring greater accountability is improved support services for Deputies.  For that reason I welcome section 16, which, in the long-term, opens up the possibility of some redressing of this imbalance between Government and Opposition.  I have accordingly put down an amendment which seeks <Col N="112" /> to ensure that the moneys allowed under this section are dedicated for research purposes.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this House can efficiently operate more than half a dozen serious committees, including the Committee of Public Accounts.  The plethora of committees now in place has been prompted by ignorant comment in some sections of the media and by Government desire to mollify disappointed ministerial aspirants. Neither is a good enough reason for burdening this House with a raft of committees that overstretch our ability to operate them effectively and whose often heavy workloads are usually ignored, even by the informed press corps.  I hope the day is not too far distant when we will rethink this madness.  The Chief Whip has frequently defended the legislative record of this Government by rightly saying that more legislation is not necessarily better legislation.  However, a committee structure that almost invariably depends on the staying power of party spokespersons for line by line scrutiny of legislation will not necessarily improve the quality of scrutiny of that legislation by holding out the prospect of allowances to reluctant committee members.</P>
    <P>I do not denigrate the constituency work of Members of this House.  It is difficult to restrain oneself to parliamentary style politeness when one hears some of the sneering omniscience about Deputies and constituency work.  It is a great strength of our system of parliamentary democracy that Deputies are rooted in the reality of the lives of ordinary people.  We may be open to criticism in terms of the balance of the role of legislator with the tasks and obligations of constituency work.  Some have got the balance badly wrong, some create work for the sake of stoking the clientelist system but, generally, it is a positive, formative influence that Deputies are obliged to stay in touch with the needs and aspirations of the people who put us here.  In any event, it is folly to think that additional allowances will make legislators out of those for whom the process has so far remained a mystery.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to the question of the basic pay of Deputies.  That is the issue which ought to be addressed.  For reasons best known to themselves, successive review bodies have failed to establish a proper basis for remuneration of Deputies.  Such efforts as have been made have been fudged by successive Governments.  The history of the last review, to which Deputy Ferris referred, is a case in point.  A submission made to the Buckley review group on behalf of Deputies suggesting a pay link to the principal officer grade in the civil service was leaked to the media by a member of the committee.  The result was that in many sections of the media what was a pay claim became immediately translated into a pay award and merited the headline &ldquo;TDs to get 30 per cent pay increase&rdquo;.  In reality, and some nine months later, TDs were awarded 3 per cent.  This attracted comment in at least one media outlet &mdash;&ldquo;TDs to get a further increase on top of 30 per cent award last summer&rdquo;.  In the event, the <Col N="113" /> Government of the day did not to implement the 3 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>In a former life, I worked as national secretary of the ITGWU, now SIPTU.  It was my job either to negotiate or supervise the negotiation of the pay and conditions of every category of worker, blue collar, white collar and professional.  I did not do my job by apologising for my existence. The fair comparison system usually determines pay rates.  By any comparison with our colleagues outside the country, or with fair comparators inside the country, the basic pay of TDs is out of line with the responsibilities of the job in modern day Ireland.  I am reminded that if I had stayed in my previous employment I would be earning roughly twice my current salary.  If anyone wishes to discount the fair comparison system and link me to average industrial pay, it should be acknowledged that I work almost twice the average 35 hour week.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the question of the kind of coverage that this issue gets, there is a great ignorance, even among the informed press corps, of the job of a TD.  Two letters I got this morning are relevant.  One is from a teacher in a school in an impoverished part of my constituency pointing out that they are trying to put together a programme to bring 40 children from the school to a Gaeltacht area for a holiday which they normally would not have.  The expense would amount to about £400 per child.  He said: &ldquo;I appreciate that there are many demands on your limited funds but we hope that you will be able to make a contribution to this very well intended project&rdquo;.  In handwriting at the bottom there was scribbled, &ldquo;I am sure you get lots of letters like this but I hope you can make a contribution&rdquo;.  The other letter was from the same school but from a different teacher saying: &ldquo;Our school is running its second annual book week starting 20 April&rdquo;.  He went on to explain that each of the well-known authors invited had to be paid for their time and &ldquo;as the book week will incorporate World Book Day on 23 April, we are hoping that you can give a donation of £50 towards sponsoring an author&rdquo;. It is an extraordinary coincidence that these two letters happened to come from the same school, albeit from different teachers, looking for support for two very worthwhile projects.  People who want to sneer at that kind of request and say that this is not the work of a legislator do not understand the job of a constituency TD or how difficult it is to not to co-operate with worthwhile projects in one's own constituency.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the question of basic pay for TDs is not being addressed.  I do not think any number of allowances can be a substitute for that, and some of the allowances are undesirable because they threaten to put in permanent existence a committee structure that is not suited to this House.  We have 166 Members and 30 Ministers, not taking into account the 15 Opposition Front Bench spokespersons.  We do not have the number of Deputies in this House necessary to operate a committee structure as elaborate as the <Col N="114" /> one we have now put in place.  We have gone about things the wrong way in that regard.</P>
    <P>I repeat my welcome for this Minister's initiative which will be seen in retrospect as mouldbreaking in terms of opening up the prospect of some back-up of research expertise for Deputies. That measure should be expanded for the Opposition because the imbalance about which I spoke as between the Executive and the Opposition is the most dramatic thing one experiences in not being in Government.  It is not reasonable in 1998 to expect an Opposition Deputy and his or her secretary to respond adequately to a Government resourced by the entire Civil Service and the back-up that entails.  That is an area that I hope can be developed in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I cannot give my support to this Bill.  My dissent is based on the genuine belief that the manner in which all these matters are dealt with is flawed and clearly seen to be flawed.  It would be easy to play to the public gallery and seek cheap publicity on this matter. I do not propose to do that.  At the same time, the legitimate scepticism of the people on the pay of their electoral representatives is not without foundation and ought not to be ignored in this House.  This scepticism arises primarily from the fact that Members of the House have had the ability to set their own rates of remuneration, expenses and allowances.  That was always an unsatisfactory situation which was open to abuse, and even more open to the perception of abuse.</P>
      <P>Instead of taking this function out of our hands and giving it to an independent body which would set rates for allowances, this Bill puts that power in the hands of the Minister.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, I am not denying the need for the allowances provided for in this Bill.  In particular, the need for extra secretarial assistance is felt by all Deputies.  Why this is so is the question I must put.  Is it not because of the clientelist system which has been nurtured by the political system in this State?  Citizens have a right to efficient, friendly and speedy access to the services of central Government and local authorities. They are often faced with a wall of bureaucracy and, rather than remove the obstacle, legislators have preferred to treat people as personal clients who can be catered to rather than as citizens with rights.  This culture dominates public life in this State.</P>
      <P>The speed with which the changes in this Bill have been processed through this House stand in contrast to the long delay in the payment of the social welfare increases, such as they were, introduced in the budget.  There is also the anomaly that thousands of people in the public service are classified and paid on a lower grade than their actual work warrants.  Budgetary constraints prevent their upgrading, and again this blockage is in contrast to the ease with which these provisions are to be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated at the outset that I cannot give this Bill my support and have outlined some of the <Col N="115" /> reasons that influenced my decision.  I acknowledge, however, without hesitation the justification for a number of elements involved in the proposals included in the Bill and recognise their merit.  My decision is not based on populist considerations but on the reasons I have already outlined. These elements must be addressed to ensure we have an accountable and transparent system that is open and accessible to scrutiny by all levels of society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I oppose the Bill because it is not an honest way to deal with the position the Minister considered had to be addressed.  After the Buckley report recommended increases which Members of the Oireachtas thought were much too low, the Minister and his predecessor were besieged by Members seeking the introduction of wage increases under various guises.  The Bill attempts to introduce a wage increase for Members of the Oireachtas under an assumed name.</P>
      <P>The existing salary of Deputies is adequate. The average industrial wage is approximately £16,000 per annum at present, while a Deputy's salary is over twice that amount before tax.  I accept that many Deputies work long hours.  I work between 12 and 15 hours a day on average during the week and I also work at weekends. However, I receive twice the average industrial wage.  I understand the Department of Finance announced today that certain recommendations of the Buckley report will be implemented.  I am surprised the Minister did not refer to this matter because it is closely linked to the Bill.  I understand the salary of Deputies will be increased by £1,000 while the Taoiseach will receive a massive £16,000 plus increase from 1 April.  Ministers will receive an increase of £13,000 while Ministers of State will receive an increase of over £3,000.  In terms of the struggle for survival of most ordinary working people, they are obscene salary increases for people who are already extremely well paid.</P>
      <P>Ordinary workers and unemployed and poor people will react with great cynicism and anger to this proposed package of increases.  This is justified in view of what they have been subjected to in recent years.  Workers found in the past ten years that their wage increases were repeatedly hammered to an approximate 1 per cent increase in real terms per annum while the profits of their employers soared without hindrance.  In view of the anger that exists regarding that issue alone, people should expect the Minister's combined package to be greeted with great cynicism and anger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the huge level of exploitation wages in the economy and the hundreds of thousands of workers on extremely low pay, one can imagine how they will react.  They will contrast the combined package announced today with the fact that successive Governments and employers have dragged their feet on the introduction of a modest minimum wage of £5 an hour.  This is the basic <Col N="116" /> amount necessary to ensure any type of comfortable existence for workers in today's society.</P>
    <P>There is another difference between Deputies and ordinary workers.  The level of accountability of workers in the civil service or the private sector to their employers is much greater in terms of supervision and discipline.  I wonder what people make of press reports about high profile and high flying Members of the Oireachtas who apparently spend their time travelling round the world, cutting economic deals and making money.  They do not attend the House often and yet their wages are not cut, although that would happen if they were in ordinary employment.  There are swings and roundabouts.</P>
    <P>Deputies should have just and fair allowances. Undoubtedly, serving a constituency is expensive and there are demands on public representatives. Deputies must respond to the range of problems people bring to their attention.  These may be local or community problems, such as the scourge of heroin.  Deputies who, like me, represent working class people are obliged to respond and this costs money.  However, the current allowances cover this area.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> My policy is to publish information for the benefit of my party and constituency about the money and allowances I receive as a Deputy and how it is spent on servicing the constituency.  The current allowances are adequate.</P>
      <P>The proposal in the Bill under which almost every second member of parties will qualify for an allowance is the most cynical stroke of all. Under the proposal chairpersons and Whips of committees and sub-committees will qualify for allowances.  Will every committee now set up sub-committees with a chairperson and Whip in order to milk the system further?  The proposal should be dropped and I hope it will be withdrawn on Committee Stage because it is a recipe for further patronage in the political system.  The people involved will be nominated by their party leaders. The good boys and girls will be rewarded with this extra perk while others who are not so good will be punished.  This system of patronage is discredited and should not be encouraged by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was made earlier about the insecurity of Deputies' jobs.  Undoubtedly, Members can be unceremoniously flung out of the Oireachtas at any time.  That has been put forward as justification for the extra remuneration about which we are speaking.  Ordinary working people face that prospect on a daily basis and they do not have extra lining in their pockets to prepare them. Because three workers in Ryanair stood up for their rights they were unceremoniously told by a vicious management they no longer had jobs in the company.  Their nests have not been feathered even though positions are just as insecure as those of Members of this House.  I would not be against <Col N="117" /> legislation that would allow public representatives re-enter their former employments if they lose their seats, but that is somewhat different from providing allowances for Members in case they lose their seats.  I do not believe people should be unceremoniously thrown out of their jobs, but teachers and others in the Civil Service already face that prospect.</P>
    <P>The Government should rethink its policy in this area.  I do not regard the genuine cynicism and anger of ordinary people as cheap or populist. They are correct to look with jaundiced eyes on the joint package being introduced today.</P>

I thank the members of the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges who met me some time ago to discuss this matter.  While it was not possible to accommodate everybody or to include all the suggestions, I made considerable steps in this regard.  As I stated at the outset, there would never be an appropriate time to introduce this package, but it is the job of politicians to make decisions.</P>
      <P>As I said on many occasions in the House, if TDs belittle themselves and play themselves down, they cannot expect the public to hold them in great esteem.  I do not know any person who attends the cheapest doctor or accountant in the town in which they live.  We must take criticism on the chin.  Irrespective of when we introduced this legislation, it would attract similar headlines. When I was in Opposition I stated that I would do something about TDs' expense allowances if I were ever in a position to do so.  That is what I have done and I thank Members for their comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been railroaded into introducing an elaborate committee structure that is not assisting the efficient running of the House and this measure will make that decision irrevocable. Not many years ago all the business of the House was done in this Chamber, but we now have a plethora of committees that is not surpassed in any Parliament in Britain or mainland Europe with four times as many Members.  Of the 650 Members of the House of Commons, only a small number aspire to ministerial office or believe they will ever achieve it.  Therefore, a number of them from specialist backgrounds or with specialist interests devote their time to particular committees with a view to becoming the chairperson in due course.  We simply do not have the man or woman power in this House to service the array of committees that have been set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been railroaded into setting up this elaborate committee system by some of the more ignorant comment in the media to which the House has been subjected over the years.  We have been criticised mainly by members of the media who rarely set foot within the perimeter of the House and we have responded.  The system was also set up to meet the wishes of all Governments &mdash; including the one of which I was a Member &mdash; to give a chocolate sweet to the disappointed Deputy who did not realise his or her hopes of becoming a Minister by making him or her a chairperson of a committee.  They are not <Col N="119" /> good enough reasons to overstretch the resources of the House.</P>
    <P>We can competently handle only about six committees and the system we are putting in place will make it impossible for a Minister or Government in the future to revoke the decision to set up all those committees.  We should address Deputies' basic pay rather than provide allowances for them.  I accept, however, that chairpersons of committees should receive allowances because of their heavy responsibilities.  The Select Committee on Finance and Public Service has just spent four or five days dealing with the annual Finance Bill.  It must be a record certainly in my time here &mdash; subject to correction &mdash; that not a single member of the press presented during the four and a half days when the annual Finance Bill was being teased out.  This is the Bill that implements the measures proposed in the annual budget and which has the most severe and far reaching implications.  Millions of pounds worth of decisions are made per line of some sections of the Finance Bill, yet not a single member of the press attended.</P>
    <P>We ought not to be railroaded into putting in place this comprehensive plethora of committees. For that reason I oppose the section.  Let us learn to walk before we can run.  We have come from a situation where Bills simply had to wait their turn in the House.  We can now process four Bills simultaneously while the Chamber is sitting on the Report Stage of a different Bill.  The Government Whip is right in that more legislation is not necessarily better legislation.  As Deputy Noonan has said, the Front Bench spokespersons end up carrying the can.  We should pause on this as it is not the ideal way to address the questions before us.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I too agree that section 5 should be deleted and the reasons enunciated by Deputy Rabbitte are correct.  A further reason is that the Government proposes in section 5 that any changes in annual amounts of allowances would be made by order rather than come before the Dáil.  That is a feature of many of the provisions of the Bill.  That is wrong.  It is being done to reduce publicity when extra increases are proposed.  Any changes made should be brought before the Dáil for approval. It is not honest to stitch in a provision whereby, once the Bill is enacted, by Government decree various changes can be made in regard to allocations to committees and so on.  That should not be agreed.  All major changes should be proposed to the Dáil, not simply made by Government diktat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the view expressed by Deputy Rabbitte.  I have been in this House a number of years and I come from a position where everything was debated on the floor of the House to a situation where we have the committee system.  I do not think the system <Col N="120" /> is much better.  At the end of the session the question is how many Bills the Government put through.  I agree with what was said by the Government Chief Whip in the past and by Deputy Rabbitte that more legislation does not necessarily mean better legislation.</P>
      <P>A disadvantage of holding Committee Stage in the House was that on the Finance Bill, for example, we probably reached only section 12 out of a couple of hundred sections and all Members contributed.  It is dealt with somewhat better in Committee.</P>
      <P>Efforts have been made by the Government to streamline the committee system to have a committee marking each Department.  That was an improvement on the previous system.  We have decided, for better or worse, to have a detailed committee system.  My late colleague, Brian Lenihan, and I argued that because of the multiseat constituency and 166 TDs an elaborate system of 22 committees was not appropriate but that was not agreed.  The matter will have to be revisited.  The purpose of this section is to allow for some small allowance to members of committees who do so some rapporteur work.  Consequently I cannot accept Deputy Rabbitte's suggestion.</P>

      <P>The contributions from Deputies Rabbitte and Higgins are confusing the debate. The argument regarding the number of committees is ongoing.  I doubt if two Members out of the 166 would agree on it.  However we must accept reality and accept the situation that exists. These committees have been set up following much debate and officeholders have to ensure they work efficiently.  The question is whether allowances should be given to these officeholders. The answer is a definite yes.  Extra responsibilities are involved in the workings of these committees and an onus rests on them to ensure they work efficiently.  I have no doubt that extra allowances should be given to these people.</P>
      <P>In the previous Administration an extra place was provided at the Government table which involved extra expense but it was accepted that poor negotiations led to the creation of the position. At the end of the day it was accepted that it was necessary and it worked reasonably well.  I am disappointed we do not have the full agreement on this section, though I am not totally surprised.</P>

I do not know if the majority of Members have read this section and I doubt if anybody <Col N="121" /> understands it, apart from some civil servants.  It provides for pensions for certain categories.  The labyrinthine methods devised in regard to these pensions are incredible.  It is more like an algebra lesson than a Dáil Bill.</P>
      <P>Before it is passed on the nod, as is usually the case with Bills such as this, the Minister should explain the import of these sections.  Why can such provisions not be framed in language that can be understood by everybody rather than in obscure formulas for calculating pensions?</P>

      <P>As I explained on Second Stage, sections 12, 13 and 14 are complex. However, the principle is simple.  These sections deal with two issues which arise in the operation of the pension arrangements for Ministers, Ministers of State and parliamentary officeholders, which it is appropriate to address.</P>
      <P>The sections provide for the basis of the calculation of supplemental pensions which are payable to persons under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938.  It is a complex formula.  It recognises the <i>pro rata</i> element of pensions so that if a person has five years and 160 days' service, the person will receive a pension for that length of service.  Until now a Deputy or a Minister only received a pension for a completed year of service, whereas all other members of the public service received pensions for whatever length of service they completed.  That is the purpose of these sections.</P>
      <P>In addition, in the case of Members who might have served as Ministers of State and then as Ministers, the sections are designed to give recognition to the time they served as Ministers of State and to give that service a weighting in the calculation of their pensions.  The calculations are complex but the principle is simple.</P>

      <P>In congratulating Deputy Farrelly on introducing the Bill I echo the Minister's remarks and share his reservations.  I favour the regulation of the security industry and can see the wisdom of examining the merits of the proposals outlined in the consultative group's report.  It would be wise also to study EU standards in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The private security industry in general is in need of regulation, particularly when it comes to the employment of door security staff.  It is unfortunate <Col N="123" /> that the most popular description of personnel in this discipline is &ldquo;bouncer&rdquo;.  While this terminology may be apt in the case of some security staff, I cannot agree it is a fair description of the majority of those performing this essential and, at times, dangerous duty.  Unfortunately, there are those who believe the best method of enforcing door security measures is the aggressive approach.  Those who have this mental perception of their terms of employment should not be involved in the door security arena.</P>
    <P>The role of supervisor of security staff is of prime importance.  The vast majority of supervisors ensure that those who work for and with them are psychologically suited to the work.  They monitor the number of patrons frequenting the premises under their care, ensure they have male and female security staff, as required, and have a clearly defined policy stipulating the actions to be taken by security staff.  There are certain matters which need to be handled with tact at all times. Door security staff frequently find that they have to exercise their right to refuse admission to premises.  The manner of security personnel is of vital importance.  A flat refusal of entry without explanation can lead to an explosive situation.  A moderate and measured explanation will normally result in acceptance of the right to refuse entry.</P>
    <P>There are also problems associated with asking patrons to leave premises.  This should never be done by a security person who interprets his or her role as that of a &ldquo;chucker out&rdquo;, as it is known in Cork.  It is more effective to continuously monitor the behaviour of clients and to avoid major problems by nipping potential trouble in the bud.  Most patrons will react responsibly, reasonably and favourably to an even handed approach.</P>
    <P>Complaints are regularly made to security staff about overcrowding, noise levels or the behaviour of other patrons.  Many complaints are valid, although some are imaginary, but they must all be treated with respect.  This means employing staff who are capable of mature assessment and reaction and who can handle situations with discretion.  Nowhere is this more important than when force is required to restrain patrons who have lost self-control through drink, drugs or as a result of a heated argument.  They must exercise only enough force to control a situation as overreacting could be fatal.  They may have to escort the offenders from the premises and exercise judgment on whether to call the gardaí.  They must at all times remain calm and distance themselves from heated arguments and excessive force.  Our compensation culture means the threat of legal action is always present.  Security management and staff must assist the organisers of functions to ensure that premises are not overcrowded.</P>
    <P>Security staff play a pivotal role in ensuring that the licensing laws are observed.  We are currently reviewing the trading times of licensed <Col N="124" /> premises.  At a meeting of the sub-committee of the Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights I proposed that Deputy Farrelly's Bill be referred to the Minister to see if licensing provisions could be included.  When Deputy Owen was Minister for Justice she proposed a similar course of action.  She said she would ask the consultative group to look specifically at this growing area of security with a view to regulation.  She said she could envisage that once the industry was regulated, a condition for people seeking licences for premises such as pubs, discos, etc.  would be that they would use only registered security people to provide security services at their premises. I am convinced that such provisions could be incorporated in this Bill.  I am concerned about people drinking and then intimidating pedestrians on the pavements outside the premises.  We need more regulations in this area.</P>
    <P>Security staff must know where fire fighting equipment is on the premises and the position of fire escape routes which must be kept clear.  They must ensure that such equipment is in good working order.  They must be aware of the constraints imposed by fire fighting regulations.  They must have an overall insight into the many aspects of stewardship required in the locations where they work.  They must know where first aid facilities are stored and how to administer basic first aid. They must note and record all incidents in a register. If a member of the public becomes sick or is accidentally injured, they must report it.</P>
    <P>There is more to security than keeping good order.  That is why we cannot pass this Bill without examining every aspect of the security business. I ask Deputy Farrelly to accept the Minister's prudent approach so that a consensus can be reached in this important debate.  We should continue to examine the report of the consultative group and wait for the proposals the Minister will bring to Government.  I urge the industry to immediately introduce a voluntary code of practice for its door and event supervisors, as we wait for the Minister to put regulations on a statutory basis.  I am sure all Members of the House share my faith in the ability and commitment of the Minister to address this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Bill is before the House because it gives us an opportunity to focus on this serious issue and on the provision of security services by the private sector. Although the Bill is well intentioned, its focus is too narrow.  However, it should form part of the study undertaken by the consultative group.  I look forward to a review of security firms and operators and to more comprehensive legislation for the industry as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we have seen on the Continent, security firms are widening their activities to include event management, crowd control and on-site security and are taking over the traditional role of bouncers. I disagree with Deputy Farrelly's remarks on the radio yesterday evening because his description of bouncers' activities was too severe. <Col N="125" /> A few people can give any business a bad name. I would like to think that bouncers who breach the norm are in the minority.</P>
    <P>Today's bouncers must be aware of everything on the premises.  A lot of responsibility is placed on their shoulders and they are expected to be experts on underage drinking and drug abuse. They are supposed to know the building and fire regulations and they are expected to deal with first aid issues.  These expectations are too high. Most bouncers are employed on an ad hoc basis, yet they often become key personnel on doors and in buildings late at night.  They are expected to respond to all situations and to restrain themselves from using physical force.  They must also understand the principles of physical crisis management.</P>
    <P>Security firms must educate the personnel they employ as bouncers.  It should be incumbent on them to ensure that the person they place at the door to maintain crowd control or to carry out any of the functions described in the Bill is familiar with their surroundings and capable of dealing with any situation that could arise.</P>
    <P>Regulations should ensure that bouncers have the skills necessary to carry out their job in a responsible manner.  There should also be a body at national level to monitor criteria laid down in legislation to ensure a more responsible response from the employer and employee.  They are regulations to which those employed in the freight business, accountancy firms or any organisations adhere and they can be monitored and policed in such a way that serious penalties can be imposed on those who breach them.  A serious penalty should also be imposed on offenders who cause difficulties on or at the door of premises because on occasions they get away far too lightly.  I support the Government's intentions in regard to this matter and I hope comprehensive legislation will be introduced.  Such legislation must also take account of the health and safety issues surrounding any business or premises which do not appear to be included in the Bill.  Comprehensive legislation is needed to cover the security activity of firms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Farrelly on introducing this Private Members' Bill.  It is a monumental task and it must be nerve-wracking to listen to both sides of the argument and hope that one's Bill will get through the House.  The spirit of the Bill is laudable and I am sure every Member agrees with it.  However, there are wider issues that the Minister and the Government must consider as well as the matters covered in this Bill.  The Minister mentioned issues of recruitment, training requirements, monitoring of working hours and the standards of employment. It is hoped that all those issues will be addressed soon in a Government Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the work is largely believed to be part-time in nature and is conducted mainly in the black economy.  On a recent television programme I heard the managing director of a very <Col N="126" /> substantial security company report that he had great difficulty in recruiting employees.  That can be partly explained by the fact that the rates of pay in that industry are between £4 and £5 per hour and because of some of the poverty traps that still remain within our system.  We hope to eliminate them over time &mdash; some of them were addressed in the budget, particularly the family income supplement which will now be calculated on net rather than gross income.  The rates of pay that pertain in the industry are not attractive to the unemployed and there is a tendency for those employed in this industry to work in the black economy.  That must be addressed also, but it can only be adequately addressed by also taking into account the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, and company law.</P>
    <P>As well as the need for this industry to be regulated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform through the police force, the question of self-regulation must also be examined. There is a need for the security industry in general to improve its image and to develop in a professional manner.  Electricians are affiliated to a body, RECI, which applies standards set by Eolas which has developed standards that are acceptable. Such self-regulatory bodies are becoming more acceptable to the general public.  Perhaps the regulation of this industry should not be monitored by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but by a self-regulatory body assisted by the Department in setting the standards to be adopted and used by companies and organisations in the industry.</P>
    <P>A main concern about bouncers or door supervisors, as Deputy Farrelly kindly referred to them, is whether my children will be safe when they attend discos and clubs.  There is anecdotal evidence that some bouncers are aggressive and that people aged between 18 and 25 who have appeared to have had too much to drink are liable to be badly beaten up if they give any lip to a bouncer.  That is not tenable or acceptable. However, patrons of those premises inform me that good clubs employ decent bouncers and that the standard of bouncers is good in clubs that are regarded as nice places to go.  That must be recognised. We should not tar all bouncers in all clubs with the same brush.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine who is a steward in Luton University's student union works as a bouncer at the door of a disco.  He had to attend a two week course for one hour a day which involved a programme of drug awareness, crowd control and first aid.  That type of course run under the auspices of a self-regulatory body should be mandatory for bouncers or door supervisors.</P>
    <P>There are many worthwhile recommendations in the report of the consultative group.  I look forward to examining them in greater detail in the months ahead and to ensuring the spirit of this legislation will be part of the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in congratulating Deputy Farrelly on introducing this Bill because it is no small task to introduce a Private Members' Bill.  If it does not achieve anything else, it will have put into sharp focus the need for such legislation and I am sure the Minister will introduce a Bill fast on the heels of this one.</P>
      <P>There was a reference to the history of problems surrounding doormen and bouncers which is true to an extent, but I do not know to what extent.  The Minister mentioned that approximately 10,000 people are employed in the security business and that excluded bouncers or doormen. It would be freely admitted that even if one walked past a nightclub or pub one would presume bouncers had been hired on the basis of their brawn rather than their brain.  That appears to be the visible criterion on which people are selected for the job.</P>
      <P>It is a difficult job and not one I would like to do.  Deputy Ardagh referred to concerns about the safety of young people.  I would also be concerned that my children are safe and would not be at risk of being brutalised by someone who was breaking the law.  It must be acknowledged that those bouncers who do a good job protect us and our children from the louts and thugs who want to create trouble.  I know people who do that work and jumping into the middle of a melee between two or three young men or women who decide to have a punch up is not a pleasant way to earn £20, £30 or whatever they earn a night. Those who do a good job and try to intervene must be acknowledged.</P>
      <P>The Bill specifically refers to pubs and clubs but security also applies to department stores and shops and this also needs regulation.  I refer to minority groups who have been treated appallingly, in particular the travelling community who as a general rule appear to be excluded from admittance to hotels, pubs and certain shops. There is a need to deal with this issue in a fair and just fashion across the board.  It is difficult to understand the arbitrary way in which decisions have been made and that should not be allowed.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive approach is required and the group which examined this issue is representative of the security industry, including members of IBEC, SIPTU, the Garda, the Health and Safety Authority and the National Standards Authority and recognised the need for regulation.  The Minister referred to offences, such as robbery, which should debar an individual from employment. Individuals with convictions for assault should automatically be debarred from employment in the security industry and this should form part of the regulations that are drawn up.  However, this should apply to those with a history of assaults, not individuals who made a mistake years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a problem with what is interpreted as a constitutional difficulty in regard to obtaining information from the Garda on potential employees.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, allows for such exchange <Col N="128" /> of information where somebody of an anti-social nature can be investigated.  Constituents of mine have had to sign consent forms with the local authority to allow it to investigate them.  A way should be found around obtaining such information and it should not be used as an excuse for not doing anything.  I congratulate the Deputy and hope he accepts we are fully supportive of his Bill.  I also hope he will allow the Minister to introduce legislation.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Deputy on bringing forward the Bill.  One of the issues about which there is a great deal of concern in terms of door security for night clubs and pubs is overcrowding.  Reference to night clubs and dances casts one's mind back to the Stardust disaster in February 1981.  Door security staff should be trained in basic first aid and be aware of fire escapes and emergency exits because of the very nature of the job.  People become aggressive under the influence of alcohol and drugs, which may not normally be in their nature and the lives of others are put in danger, not just those who are out for a night's entertainment but also the staff of the night clubs.  It is important this is considered by the Minister when preparing legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried by the Minister's response and the fact that Deputy Farrelly's commitment has not been matched by him.  He refused to accept the Bill and his grounds for doing so are that the Bill needs to be amended and the security industry requires wide and comprehensive legislation to meet present and future needs.  I accept the first premise may be true and I have great confidence in the officials of the Department to be able to right any deficiencies <Col N="129" /> on Committee Stage.  I agree the future of the industry requires close and careful consideration but I cannot accept that the Minister refuses to deal speedily with an issue that affects the security and well being of thousands of young people. Most parents of teenage children, such as myself, find this worrying and unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Clubs and discos aimed at young people have mushroomed in recent years.  We know that in some of them, they are enticed into taking drugs or are offered them.  According to the Eastern Health Board, 35 per cent of young people have had such an experience.  We also know from anecdotal and hard evidence that in certain cases organised criminals dealing in drugs have moved in on new markets for their trade by controlling and managing bouncers at discos and clubs.  An easier way to gain access to potential victims is hard to imagine.</P>
      <P>This is the cause of worry and anxiety among parents.  Many young people have an unprecedented level of disposal income and ways to spend it.  All types of places of entertainment, decent and otherwise, have sprung up in response and these are often guarded by unregulated, unregistered bouncers.  That is not acceptable and the Minister has a duty to act on this and not rely on a long-term strategy relating to the industry and certainly not the leisurely and reflective approach which he is adopting towards the industry generally.  I am sure there are interesting debates to be had with regard to the future of the industry.  The issue is one of importance with which the Minister needs to deal now.</P>
      <P>There is no desire to penalise anybody who observes good industrial and business practice under the Bill.  Nobody operating a legitimate door supervision business has anything to fear. They have much to gain from such legislation.  We must recognise there is a twilight world in which some bouncers operate, one which cloaks misdemeanours and tax evasion and by its very secrecy, disguises serious crime, particularly drug dealing which targets young people.</P>
      <P>The Minister must alter his mindset and look at the issue in terms of the danger which exists for young people because of a lack of regulation of bouncers who in the main work in places frequented by them often late into the night.  This measure should be seen as part of a zero tolerance strategy against drugs.  This strategy was very ably embarked on by the Minister's predecessor. However, despite his enthusiasm in Opposition, the Minister is sadly unwilling to extend this strategy to cover this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will deal with the cowboys who avail of the benefits of unregulated activity.  The lack of information on the number of bouncers speaks for itself.  The fact that many bouncers operate in the black economy and do not have to be registered or trained underpins the need for regulation. Government speakers referred to the lack of training, which is fundamental.  Like every service, this industry needs to be made more professional and put on a proper footing.  There is <Col N="130" /> also a need for an identification system for bouncers whether by number or badge so that there is accountability when complaints are made and an individual bouncer can be called to account.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at reports that members of the Defence Forces and Garda work as bouncers. Under the Constitution they have a right to do so outside their normal working time, but the Garda Commissioner has requested members of the force to declare such work to him as clearly there are situations where there are conflicts of interest. This area would also benefit from proper regulation.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister has a difficulty with the notion of certification of fitness to work as a bouncer.  In recent cases bouncers have been brought before the courts &mdash; I have no doubt they are only a fraction of the total number &mdash; in relation to actions which were illegal and extremely serious.  If action is not taken it is inevitable that further cases will come before the courts.  Is that what the Minister wants?  Is he aware that he has a responsibility to deal with this issue?</P>
    <P>The present position is clearly unsatisfactory and we should not wait to deal with it until the consultation process is completed, the recommendations are drawn up and the work is done at Cabinet level.  This process can take many months, if not years.  This problem needs to be addressed now.</P>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;The Government should only regulate where there is a clear need to do so and where the public interest would be served by such regulation&rdquo;.  This issue is crying out for proper regulation on both these counts.  Why wait until later when Deputy Farrelly is offering an opportunity to meet that need and serve the public interest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Like Deputy McManus, I am dismayed, flabbergasted and disappointed that the Minister has not seen fit to accept this measure.  I have been a Deputy for 11 years and I have seldom heard such commendations of an Opposition Bill which has been given a decisive thumbs down by the Government.  One cannot have it both ways.  If the Bill is as good as the Minister says then the obvious thing to do is accept it and amend it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I contrast this with the approach of the previous Government who repeatedly acknowledged that constructive measures put forward by the Opposition would be accepted, put into Committee and amended.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, can testify that I was involved in ensuring that her legislation dealing with people with disabilities was accepted by the House, sent to Committee and enacted.  The Minister is doing himself and the general public a gross disservice by having such a closed, cloistered and cluttered mind to accepting legislation which has much to commend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amused at the attitude that we should wait until people have deliberated on the report of the <Col N="131" /> consultative committee, after which we are supposed to see a so-called better Bill.  I have with me the Government's legislative programme issued on 23 January.  The programme is divided into sections A, B, C, and D. Section B lists 16 Bills which are before the Dáil and Seanad, section C lists 15 Bills which the Government expects to publish this session and section D contains the also rans, so to speak, with the great expectation that they will be enacted before the expiry of the Government.  I read the legislative programme for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but did not see reference to a Bill which will regulate the private security industry.  The programme lists the following Bills: Attachment to Earnings Bill, Civil Evidence Bill, Contractual Obligations Bill, Council of Europe (Amendment) Bill, Criminal Justice Bill, the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill, Criminal Law (United Nations) Bill, Data Protection Bill, Defamation Bill, Disabilities Bill, Equal Status Bill, Family Law Bill, Family Law (International Protection) Bill, Fraud Offences Bill, Fund-raising for Charitable and Other Purposes Bill, Ground Rent Bill, Indexation of Fines Bill, Judicial Pensions Bill, Land Registry Bill, Parental Leave Bill, Prevention of Corruption Bill, Prison Service Bill, Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill and Trust Bill.

        <i>(Mayo):</i> This underpins the hypocrisy of not accepting the legislation.  I wish the Minister had been his own man and had not once again accepted lock, stock and barrel the advice proffered to him by his Department.</P>
      <P>This is a good Bill and I commend Deputy Farrelly on introducing it after much tedious and painstaking effort.  I know the amount of research undertaken as I worked closely with Deputy Farrelly. It has been acknowledged virtually by everyone, including members of the security industry, that the time for regulation is long overdue. This Bill is just one element.  Some people say it is too narrow but this is not true.  Rather the Bill is clear, workable and prescriptive.  It proposes the setting up of a register to which the public will have full access and which will be available in every Garda station.  It also proposes the setting up of a proper application procedure under which a person has to make an application to the Garda superintendent and due notice is placed in the local newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It proposes the verification of personal fitness, which is crucially important.  It states that certification must be provided in relation to the appropriateness of the individual applying for the particular post in question.  It clearly states that a person debarred from qualifying or receiving a certificate of fitness has redress to the courts.  It <Col N="132" /> proposes the setting up of an appeals procedure and provides that a person not on the official register cannot present themselves as a door supervisor at a licensed premises, disco or dance hall.  It ensures that records are kept up to date and are available for inspection.  It insists that there must be clear visible identification and authentication of a person's right to work as a doorman or bouncer.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that this clear, prescriptive and workable legislation has not been accepted. Deputy Farrelly's Bill will fill a vacuum.  It is incredible that all there is in an industry which is supposed to look after the welfare of three quarters of a million young people for three or four hours every weekend is <i>laissez-faire</i> ad hockery and lack of supervision.  This measure should have been embraced by the Minister and the Department, yet while it has been praised and love-bombed, it has been rejected.  That is the net result of the discussion &mdash; the Government may compliment the legislation all it likes but if the measure is not accepted it is doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>Also doomed are the thousands of youngsters, some under age, who will go to discos this weekend and have open access to drugs, in many cases for the first time.  As was said last night, discos are the Mecca and marketplace for the drug scene.  The EHB statistics show that we have epidemics of drugs and drink and that these cancers in our society are growing worse.  Yet this clear, simple, prescriptive, effective, workable measure is being thrown out because the Government could not be receptive enough to accept it for what it is.</P>
    <P>Drugs have now become the norm in even the smallest towns and villages.  The graveyards of rural Ireland are filling up just like city cemeteries. The scene has changed from the heroin problem, which was the unfortunate lot of those with no hope in inner-city ghettos, with neither job prospect nor future.  Drugs are becoming yuppified as a result of the reckless statements of popular culture figures and are regarded as part and parcel of the challenge of modern society.  In these circumstances, a measure to ensure responsible supervision at discos and dancehalls should have been welcomed and rushed through the House.  I am aghast that it has not been accepted because the Bill was parsed, analysed and subjected to the most intense scrutiny and I genuinely thought the Government could not reject it.  This is a sad day for legislation and the House. I wish that a little more dialogue, consultation and openness of approach had been forthcoming, because society would be all the better for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Farrelly on advancing proposals on this issue.  The time has come to regulate persons employed for security purposes at a dance or function.  Security is a big business not only in night clubs but in daytime businesses like restaurants and take-aways and it is argued that this area should be regulated separately from the mainstream industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> The biggest question is who decides the difference between appropriate and excessive physical force when restraining an unruly individual.  Most would agree that a chokehold of some sort is an appropriate method of restraint but to a bar bouncer &ldquo;appropriate force&rdquo; might mean far more.  Bouncers can restrain or remove a patron who they believe is being or has been a nuisance, using methods they deem appropriate.  Therein lies the problem, because there is no concrete or written list of appropriate and inappropriate techniques and methods.</P>
    <P>While most people going to a bar on a given night have no intention of provoking a confrontation, some become rude or unruly and refuse to leave when asked by the establishment's employees.  Those employees are justified in employing physical means to remove those who refuse to leave of their own accord.  With huge amounts of people crowding into bars on a given night, the potential for incidents like these to escalate into dangerous confrontations is immense.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate to give bouncers courses to teach them to talk rather than hit patrons and it is essential that such courses cover criminal law, common law, the law on assault, incident reporting and first aid.  People employed for security purposes in night clubs and other places serving liquor should not have a recent criminal history and should have training in appropriate conflict resolution and restraint techniques.</P>
    <P>After an assault involving a security officer working in a night club it is sometimes difficult to get details of the staff involved.  If the night club employed the officer on a casual basis, the fact of the employment might not be formally admitted; it might be of mutual benefit to the club and the employee to obscure the fact of employment so that neither the employer nor the employee would pay tax.  If the night club engaged a firm to provide security the employment details might be held by that firm.  Lack of accountability can also stem from unsafe systems of work.</P>
    <P>Some security personnel in night clubs work long hours in difficult and overcrowded conditions. Some get insufficient directions from their employers or have little access to police access or other support if there is violence.  Some are poorly trained.  There should be proper training for bouncers and a system of regulation. Bouncers should be required to have a licence entitling them to act as such and this licence should enable the bouncer to be identified and recognised.  There also should be an independent body to monitor the activities of bouncers.  Anyone with a criminal conviction should not be employed.  Training should cover crowd control and self-defence.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems arising with bouncers are due to their lack of training and the absence of a set standard on their duties.  Everyone accepts that bouncers are an essential element in a well maintained and run night club or licensed <Col N="134" /> establishment.  However, it is extremely important that they do not abuse their position and that they recognise they have a duty not alone to their employers but to the patrons of the establishment in which they work and the public at large.</P>
    <P>A night club bouncer was jailed recently for an assault on a customer.  That is a serious threat and this legislation would protect both the patron and the bouncer.  A person who assaults another is guilty of an offence.  This may be relevant if a bouncer uses force in excess of what is required to remove or exclude a person from the premises. A number of other offences should be noted.  If a bouncer causes unlawful wounding or bodily harm he will be guilty of assault.  If an action is unlawful it is of itself a criminal act, so it does not matter if the victim has consented to it.  No person can licence another to commit a crime.</P>
    <P>A person may apprehend another in the act of committing or immediately after committing a serious criminal offence.  The person apprehended may not be detained but it is necessary and reasonable to allow for the attendance of a police officer or, alternatively, the person apprehended must be brought to the police officer as soon as is reasonable or practicable.  The enforcement of this depends on the involvement of the gardaí.</P>
    <P>The licensing legislation needs a complete revamp.  This has been promised by previous Administrations but we must seriously examine it.  Specifically, it is imperative that the law on bouncers be amended soon.  The licensing laws date back to the 1890s and are outdated, so the matter requires attention.  I compliment Deputy Farrelly on introducing the Bill.  Previous speakers have applauded the Bill but it is disappointing that the Government has not seen fit to give it the go-ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to welcome the Bill and to congratulate Deputy Farrelly on the work he put into it over the past few months.  I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, is in the House because she knows what I am going to say.  About a year ago I had the good fortune to be a Member of the Upper House, along with Deputy Farrelly, and the Minister well remembers my comments on the night her Bill was introduced to the House.  It was an excellent Bill, designed to extend postal voting to those with a disability.  What was the attitude of the Government of the day?  It accepted the Bill in the Dáil and in the Seanad, and that legislative initiative by Deputy Wallace in Opposition became law.  I lauded and congratulated Deputy Wallace on that occasion.  She is now getting red in the face, and rightly so, because that is the kind of action our Government in power encouraged in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not good enough to treat this House as some kind of rubber stamp assembly, that the Government has a total font of wisdom and nobody else can get a look in.  That is not the <Col N="135" /> notion the Government should put forward in this House.  The Minister of State is well aware of the support she received in terms of her own legislative initiative last year when in Opposition.</P>
    <P>It is totally frustrating to see good work established on the Opposition benches thrown out by the Government.  The Government could accept this legislation on Second Stage, propose a variety of amendments on Committee Stage or keep it on the Order Paper for months, but it should accept the principle at the heart of Deputy Farrelly's Bill, which the Minister's colleagues supported last night.</P>
    <P>What message is the Government and the Minister of State sending out to this side of the House?  It is the tired old message that whatever is produced on this side of the House will be forgotten as soon as it is put on the Order Paper. I was not in the House last night but I had an opportunity to read the contribution of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue.  The first comment that jumped out at me concerned the constitutional issue.  We always get this argument from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  When the constitutional issue raises its ugly head it sends lights flashing on this side of the House.  The Minister said last night that the Bill could have fundamental constitutional implications &mdash; another Articles 2 and 3 in the making. To what article was the Minister referring?  Perhaps the Minister of State might inform us of this later in the debate.  Raising the constitutional issue provides an opportunity for some people in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to play around with certain legislative initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to criminal convictions and that various people could not gain access to employment as door supervisors.  If the Minister has a view on that he could propose an amendment on Committee Stage.  The attitude of the Government, not just in relation to this Bill but to a variety of other initiatives proposed by various parties on this side of the House in the past number of months, is not good enough because it demeans this House and treats those of us on this side as second class citizens.  If we are to treat our work here with the important status it deserves the Government owes it to colleagues on this side of the House to accept the principle at the heart of the Bill.  It can amend it on Committee Stage and propose a variety of other initiatives but unfortunately the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, who rightly accepted the generosity of the last Government when it accepted legislation she proposed, do not intend to accept the Bill.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Farrelly.  On reading the Bill it is obvious that it makes sense.  We all know the type of violence that can attach to going out on a Friday or Saturday night, particularly in an urban setting.  One only has to listen to some of the radio commentators on Saturday morning to hear about the latest stabbing or the fracas that <Col N="136" /> developed outside a public house or a nightclub. As Deputy McManus said, there is an urgency about this legislation.  It is not good enough for the Government to simply reject it and cast it out until we get the view of some experts.  That is our job.  We can engage as many consultants as we want but it is our job as legislators to change the law.  The Government has an opportunity to do that by accepting the Bill and amending it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Many parents and young people in particular will not thank the Government for rejecting this legislation because they know that on Friday and Saturday nights in many areas of this city their children are being exposed to untold risks.  They want this House to do something about that. Deputy Farrelly has given us an opportunity to address this problem but the Government is throwing it away.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should be ashamed because if she were on this side of the House and I was in the fortunate position to be sitting where she is now, I would accept the Bill.</P>

The Minister was very forthcoming in that regard last night.  We acknowledge the report published in January this year and all the comprehensive issues surrounding this area.  In fairness to Deputy McGennis, people are genuine in commending Deputy Farrelly on raising this issue and the work he has done to bring forward the legislation.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister went into great detail to explain the reason the Government will not accept the Bill.  He emphasised that it is with regret and based on careful consideration of the Bill and related issues of a significant nature that the Government arrived at its decision.  I do not intend to go over the same ground but I should mention that a number of provisions in the Bill, particularly with regard to access to employment, raise significant constitutional issues affecting the fundamental rights of the individual which would need careful consideration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or raising standards in the industry.  Issues such as recruitment, training, monitoring of work, employment standards and so on must be addressed.  Deputies made excellent points about the type of training required in this area &mdash; as Deputy Farrelly's Bill indicated &mdash; in regard to safety, responding to emergencies and dealing with large groups of people.  Deputy Naughten echoed those important points about training last night.  There is general acceptance that in any proposals to regulate the security industry, wider issues than simply accessing the industry need to be addressed if overall standards are to be improved and professionalism achieved.</P>
      <P>Deputies Ring, O'Flynn, Ardagh, McGennis, Moynihan and McManus rightly drew attention to general concerns about the attitudes and behaviour of some door supervisors who act in an aggressive manner and appear to think they are immune to the law.  The Minister took the opportunity last night to spell out that there are no special legal privileges unique to this employment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly's Bill is concerned solely with provisions for the registration, control and supervision of persons engaged as door supervisors at licensed premises.  In this regard, the Bill confines itself to this narrow sector of what is a very broad, wide-ranging, multimillion pound security industry. There was a reference last night to the need to regulate door supervisors as part of the entertainment industry.  The Minister went to some lengths to explain we are talking here about regulating the private security industry, an industry with over 10,000 employees, over 400 companies and an annual turnover estimated at about £200 million.  Door supervisors are only part of that broad spectrum of the industry and any proposals to regulate them must be addressed with the bigger picture in mind.</P>
      <P>It has been the view of most Members for some time that there is a need for proper regulation of the security industry.  In using the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo;, we do not mean any disrespect to the Bill, which all sides acknowledge has considerable merit, but we wish to simply emphasise the broader issues which are not addressed in it.  That point was also made by Deputy McGennis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the consultative group was published at the end of January.  The Minister stated <Col N="138" /> that Deputy Farrelly made a submission to the group and it is recognised he has a long-standing interest in the area.  The report's conclusions and recommendations were also referred to.  It is worth recalling that the consultative group emphasised that any regulatory framework for the security industry will not only have to deal with the question of access to the industry, but also with a series of issues aimed at having a significant impact on the industry in the medium and long-term.  These issues are not addressed in Deputy Farrelly's Bill but were considered essential by the consultative group in professionalising the industry and in improving standards in employment and training generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is giving detailed consideration to the recommendations in the report.  He has acknowledged that complex legislation would be required to give effect to its central recommendations. The Minister has announced his intention to consult formally in the immediate future with his colleagues in Government who have an interest in the recommendations of the consultative group which impinge on their areas of responsibility.  When the Minister has completed that consultation he intends to immediately bring proposals to Government which will recommend an appropriate course of action.  In so doing, he will be mindful of the need to ensure all other possible approaches to regulation have been fully explored.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Farrelly will understand and appreciate why the Government has decided not to accept the Bill.  I trust he will also accept there is a need to consider the private security industry as a whole rather than legislating for one small part of it.  I appreciate and accept his view that if he had intended to legislate for the broad security he would have brought forward a Bill to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will also accept the Government is genuine in this regard and appreciates the fact he raised the issue.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive approach is needed.  This significant point was made by the consultative group when it underlined the best way to address all the complex issues highlighted in its report is through a combination of comprehensive measures.  The Minister has given a commitment that he will bring proposals to Government recommending the most realistic, effective and appropriate course of action to deal with the industry.  We urge the House to await these proposals.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and I genuinely recognise the work involved in bringing forward this Bill.  In doing so Deputy Farrelly has again highlighted this issue and the Minister has given a commitment to bring proposals to Government on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate over the past two evenings &mdash; Deputies Ring, Naughten, Upton, O'Flynn, McGennis, Ardagh, Moynihan, McManus, Higgins, Perry and Hayes and the Minister and Minister of State.  It is regrettable, given the importance of the issue and that 750,000 people visit the clubs, pubs and entertainment venues concerned, that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister of State, who is my constituency colleague, and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, could not persuade their colleagues to accept and implement this Bill.</P>
      <P>I did not say the Bill had all the answers.  The Minister, the Minister of State and all the Fianna Fáil speakers said the Bill is too narrow.  If I had wanted to produce a Bill for licensing the security industry I would have done so.  I think the officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have no intention of assisting bringing forward legislation, given that my colleague, Deputy Jim Higgins, mentioned there are 35 items of legislation on the Department's list but not a word about the security industry.  I cannot let tonight pass without repeating to the Minister and Minister of State that they are seen by the officials as car passengers with provisional licences and that the officials regard themselves as running the Department.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, with the Independents who will support them tonight, are saying to the young people that they care about them but not enough to look after them when they go out socialising.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not mention the problems of assault, drugs or the black economy.  He mentioned constitutional problems and that the Department of Finance might not be able to fund this legislation.  I stand over my statement that this legislation is self-financing.  It is quite obvious that the Minister, the Minister of State or anybody else in the Department did not try to find out whether it is self-financing because I know it is, even at £10 per head per licence.</P>
      <P>Is it not quite odd that the thousands of dogs in the security industry are licensed by regulation under the Department of the Environment and Local Government but that dog handlers do not need a licence?  Is it not odd that while the Government tells us it will look after us down the road, many serious incidents have occurred over the past six months, including murders and guards being shot in the middle of the night, arising from feuds between doormen trying to get space to peddle drugs to young people in this city?  Many serious incidents have arisen from feuds over the past six months, including murders and guards being shot in the middle of the night. In addition, doormen have tried to get space to peddle drugs to young people throughout this city.  Yet the Government has given the perception to thousands of young people that the concept of zero tolerance goes no further than the gates of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> This proposal has received support from everybody, including overwhelming support from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Deputies and Senators are agreed on the need for it.  However, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has told its Minister and Minister of State that it cannot proceed with it, despite the fact that people in this and other industries have sought such legislation for 20 years.  The legitimate companies in the industry want the situation cleaned up because the illegitimate companies are under pricing and under cutting them.  All the information I have received from every area of the industry confirms this.</P>
    <P>The consultative group was established by the Minister's predecessor because the then Department of Justice took the view that it would act as a fob to get it as far as 1998.  Three months after the report of the group was sent to the Minister the Department has decided to fob matter off again until 1999.  It has no intention of leap frogging the 16 Bills before the House to legislate for the security industry.</P>
    <P>Does anybody care about the pressures which young children face from the age of 12?  There is not a town in Ireland which has escaped these pressures nor one which has escaped the opportunities available to people to push their wares, such as drugs.  Despite this, we in this House are failing to legislate to help to protect these children. They have enough worries without the additional stress of wondering whether an ecstasy tablet has been placed in their mineral drinks.  We need legislation to licence those who protect them and to make owners of clubs and pubs responsible for those who work for them.</P>
    <P>When I started on this road a year ago I never said I would make proposals to license the full security industry.  However, if by this day two months there is no proposed Bill before the House I will introduce another Bill which will be broad enough to receive not only the support of this side of the House but the support of the country to the extent that the Government will be swamped.  The Minister of State may laugh but I cannot stand the hypocrisy of those who, seven months ago, travelled the country, spoke of zero tolerance and promised protection to those affected by crime.</P>
    <P>Many people today suffer and have suffered from misdemeanours inflicted on them by people whose name could never be found.  This legislation proposes a register, accountability, proper training and an assurance that employers are answerable.  Many of those seeking redress have only been able to produce the first name of their assailants.  If the Minister advises that there could be a constitutional problem with such a simple proposal, why are we paying the Civil Service and the Government's legal advisers to ensure that the necessary changes to proposed legislation are undertaken in the best interests of the majority of those it seeks to protect?</P>
    <P>I thank all those who helped me to introduce this legislation, including the members of my party's <Col N="141" /> Front Bench who ensured that this Bill reached the floor of the House.  I also thank the huge number of people who telephoned and those who sent letters of support from the various organisations throughout the country who said it was the first time sensible legislation was proposed to protect not only them but the individuals using their premises.  The majority of people involved in this industry are doing an excellent job.  It is a small percentage of people who have brought it into disarray.</P>
    <P>The Government's failure to accept this legislation <Col N="142" /> will allow individuals to hire clubs to run discos, supply the doormen and DJs and turn off the drink to sell water at £5 per glass and then sell drugs to their clubbers.  There can be no system of check.  Not long ago I was alarmed to discover that one such disco occurred not far from the Minister of State's home.  It determined me to introduce this legislation.  Yet the Government is turning a blind eye to these activities and has indicated it has no intention to regulate the industry.</P>

      <P>The natural advantages of the Shannon Estuary with its deep and wide waters, abundant green field sites and ability to cater for a broad mix of industrial opportunities has long been recognised by a number of experts. However, despite these natural advantages and numerous studies, reports and statements of interest, the Shannon Estuary has remained seriously underdeveloped over the past three decades.</P>
      <P>The pre-budget submission prepared by KPMG on behalf of Shannon Development and its subsidiary management company, Shannon Estuary Development Limited, was presented to the Department of Finance in November.  The submission outlined the basis for a tax pilot scheme which would enable Shannon Development to leverage its underdeveloped industrial land banks to raise private sector capital.  This private capital would be used to fund site preparation and key infrastructure necessary to attract foreign industrial investment to the region.  The process would be piloted at its largest green field site at Ballylongford, County Kerry, which is referred to locally as the Tarbert-Ballylongford land bank.  The scheme would be directly regulated by Shannon Development and only State owned assets would be targeted.</P>
      <P>Apart from the tax incentives sought, no Exchequer funding is required.  The new pilot tax model is creative and minimises State outlay.  The proposed scheme would be controlled and regulated by Shannon Development on behalf of the State.  The proposed tax incentives will only be targeted at corporate investors and are, therefore, limited and containable.  The revenue foregone to the State is minimal, particularly when compared to the potential economic benefit to the State.</P>
      <P>The capital raised from the private sector, with the assistance of special tax incentives, would be used to develop essential site infrastructures, such as roads, water, sewerage, electricity and general lay-out.  Normally, tax incentives are provided to the private sector for building and construction works or above ground works, but in this case, incentives are provided for key site infrastructure or below ground works only.</P>
      <P>The pilot tax model is specifically designed to leverage the under-utilised Ballylongford-Tarbert State landbank to prime industrial development. In effect, this landbank has remained undeveloped at significant sunk-cost, and is likely to remain undeveloped unless a priming mechanism, in the form of the proposed investment status relief, is provided to the private sector.</P>
      <P>In tandem with tax designation, it is proposed to advance fast-track planning as a model for reducing time-to-delivery, as adopted successfully in the UK, particularly Scotland.  To be more competitive at attracting foreign inward investment, it is necessary to minimise delays in the preparation of site layout and planning and environmental aspects.  It is also proposed to put in place a focused and targeted international marketing programme via the IDA.</P>
      <P>Tax designation is of great benefit as a priming initiative, but on its own will not cause greenfield sites to be developed.  It is necessary to provide an additional investment status tax relief which will allow a development company, controlled by Shannon Development, to acquire the designated site and raise private sector capital funding, which is tax deductible.  This funding will be in the form of share or loan capital and will be used to finance infrastructure development.  The funding will be raised from corporate sources only &mdash; no individuals may participate &mdash; and will be capped at £10 million.  However, only £5 million will initially be raised as part of the pilot scheme.</P>
      <P>The Tarbert-Ballylongford landbank has remained in an underdeveloped state since the purchase of the first tranche of land in the 1960s from a local farmer.  That this has been allowed to happen, despite its recognised natural asset s is disgraceful.  It is now an opportune time to address the economic and social imperative of attracting foreign investment to the Shannon Estuary to counter the evident out-migration, falling population and high unemployment levels in the north Kerry area.  As the final stages of the Finance Bill will be before the Seanad tomorrow the Minister still has an opportunity to make provision for this very innovative and well thought out proposal from Shannon Development to ensure that at least this unique site is given the opportunity to realise its true potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to convey my presentation to the Minister so that he will consider it on the final Stages of the Finance Bill in the Seanad.  I have already mentioned this matter to him and Shannon Development got a very positive response from officials in the Department <Col N="145" /> of Finance.  There is no reason this well thought out proposal should be shot down at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this topic.</P>
      <P>As he stated, a submission on this matter, prepared by KPMG on behalf of Shannon Development, was received by the Minister for Finance last November.  A delegation met officials from the Department of Finance to discuss the matter in February 1998.  It emerged from the meeting that what is actually being sought is a new BEStype tax relief, which would be broadly similar to the new tax relief for investment in renewable energy, to encourage the investment of private sector funds in infrastructural development of Shannon Development land.</P>
      <P>Shannon Estuary Development Limited is a wholly-owned managed subsidiary of Shannon Development, established in June 1997 following Government approval.  Its principal aim is to serve as a mechanism for a partnership approach to develop the Shannon Estuary, with emphasis being placed on specific industrial sites owned by Shannon Development.  It is proposed that Shannon Estuary Development will enter joint venture arrangements with private sector interests to bring about priming infrastructural investment in the region, aimed at developing key industrial sites and thereby making them more attractive for inward industrial investment.  This partnership between the public and private sectors will serve to maximise the use of public assets and private funding and strengthen the marketing activities of IDA Ireland in attracting new industry to the region.  The proposers see this leveraged private sector capital approach as a direct substitute for Exchequer funding to install the necessary infrastructure such as roads, water and electricity. However, even with the required infrastructure in place, Shannon Estuary Development cannot give a guarantee that any industry will be attracted to the site.</P>
      <P>As with all tax incentive schemes, once an incentive is introduced for one area, everybody else wants one.  Thus, if a tax incentive is introduced for Shannon Development to put in place the necessary infrastructure on a greenfield site, every other developer in the country will seek similar treatment.  In addition, the Department of Finance is currently considering proposals for public-private partnerships for infrastructural projects on the lines of that implemented in other countries, but this scheme operates under quite different rules.  If a tax relief is given for this site, it could have much wider implications in that it could be seen as a pilot public-private partnership and the tax relief given could be demanded as a <i>de minimis</i> for public-private partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the Government's commitment to lowering the level of income and corporation tax and the introduction in the Finance Bill of a new urban renewal scheme and a pilot rural renewal <Col N="146" /> scheme, subject to EU approval, another areabased tax incentive cannot be considered at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter and the Minister for coming in to reply.</P>
      <P>I have great respect for the staff, professional and otherwise, who work in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Office of Public Works.  This matter arises from claims made by the public sector trade union, IMPACT &mdash; the Minister was kind enough to meet representatives of that union yesterday &mdash; and refers in particular to architect, archaeologist and ecologist grades in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>IMPACT claims the level of recruitment of permanent staff has been practically nil and that no architects have been approved in more than 20 years.  It also claims that up to 100 professionals are employed on a contract basis in the two Departments and they have no basic employment rights, job security or access to paid holidays.  They have no entitlement to sick leave, maternity leave or occupational pensions.  Many are on rolling contracts which last for a number of years.  It also stated that the law regarding rights for contract workers centres on whether they have a contract for service or a contract of service.  Under a contract of service, the worker enjoys the full protection of employment legislation, but a contract for service effectively gives the worker the status of a supplier.</P>
      <P>Ministerial replies to Adjournment debates are prepared by staff in the Department before the Minister hears what the Member has to say.  It is difficult, therefore, for the Minister concerned to answer questions.  However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is currently in the House, may have a different outlook and answer off the cuff from time to time.  I have a number of questions to put to the Minister.  If she does not have the answers in her script, will she submit them to me in writing in the next few days?</P>
      <P>Is it true that no architect has been employed on a permanent basis by the Office of Public Works in the past 20 years?  If it is not true, how many have been employed during that time? How many people are employed in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on contract work of six months or less and 12 months or less duration?  Will the Minister supply me with the same information for the Office of Public Works?  Were there discussions with the unions involved prior to such recruitment, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4.2 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>?  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is agreed by both sides that discussions will take place on a local basis with the union to <Col N="147" /> discuss (a) the circumstances other than the above where temporary or contract working is required; (b) the numbers of temporary or contract staff which it is proposed to recruit; and (c) the maximum duration of such employment.</P>
    <P>Is it true that the Office of Public Works refused to attend the Labour Relations Commission when IMPACT referred the matter to that body and, if so, what was the reason for non-attendance, given that the Taoiseach stressed the necessity for harmony between management, union and staff when he launched the document, Working Together for Excellence in the Public Service, on 5 March?  He said the promotion of partnership in both the public and private sectors underpins Partnership 2000.  Shared objectives and harmony between management, unions and staff at the workers level is crucial to sustaining economic growth, job creation and consequential social development.</P>
    <P>Is it true that the contracted personnel are deemed to be holders of a contract for service as distinct from a contract of service?  The contract of service gives the worker protection under the appropriate legislation.</P>
    <P>Is it true that the Department and the Office of Public Works continue to offer short-term contracts to people on some schemes, that is, for six months or less or for 12 months or less in the knowledge that these schemes are funded by the European Union for periods of three years or more?  If these allegations are true it would appear the Minister is presiding over a modern day lump system similar to McAlpine Fusiliers where the best is got from young qualified people and all they gain is valuable experience but they lose out in terms of the benefits and facilities available to permanent staff.</P>
    <P>If it is the case that rolling contracts are being offered, the Minister should abide by agreements laid down in the PCW, discuss them with the unions, where necessary, and give those people the benefits available to permanent staff.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is smiling.  If he is amused at what I am saying that is a matter of concern to me, given that many decent people from South Kerry went on the lump with McAlpine Fusiliers when he and I were children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  He is correct in saying I had the opportunity to meet with the unions yesterday afternoon.  This meeting was both useful and helpful.  I do not accept there has been any breach of the PCW by my Department.  My Department has shown a great commitment to the PCW over its lifetime, having reached many satisfactory local pay and flexibility agreements within its parameters with various grades in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although my Department has across its spectrum many people employed on temporary contracts <Col N="148" /> where necessary, in view of the recent developments, I am taking the Deputy's motion to refer those specifically engaged on contract for services in Dúchas, the Heritage Service.</P>
    <P>When the Heritage Service was transferred from the Office of Public Works the number of civil servants &mdash; administrative, professional, technical and industrial &mdash; which was deemed appropriate for the work being transferred were moved to my Department which has not changed the nature of the employment of these staff.</P>
    <P>Certain tasks of Dúchas are contracted out. This has been the practice in the Office of Public Works prior to the transfer of the Heritage Service to my Department.  The tasks in question were considered appropriate for contracting out and this Department has not changed that practice. The contractors involved are mainly self-employed professionals, registered with the Revenue Commissioners.  They provide tax clearance certificates before being engaged and withholding tax, as appropriate, is deducted from them.  In general they would hold similar entitlements to benefits as any self-employed person.</P>
    <P>In the central agreement adopted under the PCW by IMPACT on 27 November 1996, that union accepted there were cases where the most appropriate way certain tasks could be carried out was by contract.  The tasks in question in my Department were being carried out on contract long before that agreement was signed.  The agreement also states that the union, IMPACT, has co-operated with such arrangements in the past and will continue to co-operate with such arrangements in the future where similar considerations apply.  Since the transfer of the Heritage Service to my Department there has been little, if any, change to the original considerations which had given rise to the engagement of these people on contract.  My Department has simply continued what had been a long-standing practice in the Office of Public Works.  I cannot accept therefore that my Department has breached the terms of the PCW agreement.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister, wherever a new body of work is allocated to or arises in my Department, I have always sought additional staff resources to meet that extra workload.  Examples of this are the staff who will shortly be recruited to meet the extra demands placed upon the National Parks and Wildlife Service by the proposed designation of the special areas of conservation, and also the additional staff secured to carry out the work associated with the islands. The reason for giving these examples is to demonstrate my commitment to ensuring that where there is a clearly identified need for staff, I am not slow to take positive action to address the situation.  In this case however, the situation is different in that there is no &ldquo;new&rdquo; body of work in question, merely the continuation of a long-standing arrangement.</P>
    <P>I met with representatives of the IMPACT union yesterday and they explained their concern about the number of contractors in the Heritage <Col N="149" /> Service and their desire to have the number of permanent civil servants in professional grades increased.  I explained that my Department was examining the position and will take into account, inter alia, the points raised by IMPACT at that meeting.  I am committed to maintaining communication with the union in this regard.  This is the position and I assure the House of my continued best efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>When the Deputy refers to the Office of Public Works and Dúchas it is important to make the proper distinction.  Unfortunately, there is still some confusion with regard to the responsibilities of both.  If there is an understanding of the different responsibilities of the two, the Deputy may be in a position to agree with the reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The reason I raise this matter is that some weeks ago I was taking a person to the train station who intended to board the Cork train.  We were delayed for an hour and a quarter because of a protest with the result that the person was late for the train.  Outside the offices of Dublin County Council people with horses and carts were protesting.  At first I thought a film was being shot.  Due to the protest we could neither get up or down the street.</P>
      <P>Such protests are unfair on the public.  Those who wish to make a protest have a right to do so. However, regulations should be introduced here or by Dublin County Council to prevent groups, wishing to make a protest in the capital city, from delaying traffic.  Such protests mean that hospital appointments are broken, ambulances and fire services are held up and generally people's lives are put at risk.</P>
      <P>Public protests should be organised.  There are areas in the city where protests can be held, for example, the Phoenix Park, Croke Park, Landsdowne Road and so on.  The organisations involved can pay for the use of such venues.  It is time such protests were stopped.  A group wishing to protest should apply to the relevant local authority. Given the traffic congestion in Dublin it is difficult to get through Dublin city as it is jammed from morning to night.  When an organisation wishes to protest the city is clogged up for an hour or two.  That will have to stop.  I ask the Minister to bring a measure before the Dáil to deal with this matter.  He will have the support of all political parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to people making a peaceful protest.  However, a situation such as the one which occurred a few weeks ago, when people blocked the city with horses and carts, is wrong. There was no respect for law and order.  People on the quays were frantic in their attempts to get to train stations, hospitals and their homes.  The city was choked up and nobody did anything about it.  I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister with regard to the protest.  I am aware it is not his responsibility but I wanted to <Col N="150" /> know if any prosecutions would ensue.  He said it was a matter for the Garda Síochána.  I hope there will be prosecutions.</P>
    <P>This type of behaviour must stop.  The protests make us appear foolish to the outside world. There were probably visitors in the city who witnessed it being brought to a standstill by people with horses and carts.  We must be the laughing stock of Europe.  It was a reminder of the wagon trains of years ago.  I hope the Minister can resolve this serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that all public demonstrations are subject to the law governing activities in public places, such as the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1995, for example, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994.  The public order legislation provides for a series of offences to deal with disorderly behaviour and for appropriate measures to enable the Garda Síochána to respond for the purpose of preserving order.</P>
      <P>There are other significant statutory provisions which provide for various offences arising from disorderly behaviour and the like.  In addition, in the event that there are offences against the public peace on the occasion of a public demonstration, it is open to the Garda Síochána by common law to take the necessary and appropriate action.  On such occasions there would be a duty on the Garda authorities to take action to preserve the peace.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the conduct of public demonstrations is given appropriate attention at all times by the Garda Síochána.  I have not been informed by the Garda authorities that there are any particular problems from a law enforcement perspective arising from demonstrations or protests, although I appreciate that at the time such protests can be a cause of irritation to the general public going about its business.  Those who take part in such demonstrations are subject to the laws governing activities in public places.  Where breaches of the law occur, it is a matter for the Garda Síochána to take the necessary action and I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the law is enforced as the occasion demands.</P>
      <P>Demonstrations or public protests which attract large numbers of people can, by their nature, cause disruption to the traffic and to the general public.  There is, of course, a general obligation on persons engaged in such demonstrations or protests not to wilfully obstruct traffic or to engage in any disruptive behaviour in breach of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard suggestions that public demonstrations be confined to large public areas, such as Phoenix Park.  Quite apart from the legal aspects of such suggestions, I do not believe there would be public support for any proposal which could be interpreted as seeking to interfere with any right to peaceful assembly or to free expression in the absence of breaches of the law. The gardaí are in a difficult position on such <Col N="151" /> occasions but their primary duty at all times is to maintain law and order.  I am satisfied that existing statutory provisions are adequate to deal with any difficulties arising from such events and the Garda authorities will continue to give appropriate attention as the occasion demands.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced by Deputy Ring's argument that protests should be confined to venues such as Croke Park and Lansdowne Road.  Sporting enthusiasts in both codes might take the view that there are sufficient protests at these venues already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Tullamore urgently requires a new Garda station and the Minister must provide the money to build it immediately.</P>
      <P>The Garda station in Tullamore is ideally located in the centre of the town.  However, it was built in the 1930s to accommodate a staff of approximately 14.  The existing station is unsuitable and unsatisfactory.  It is terribly overcrowded as there are 46 members of staff stationed there. The overcrowding puts additional pressure on the gardaí by obliging them to work in cramped conditions.</P>
      <P>The building is inadequate for a modern police force.  It is a potential fire hazard, with wooden floors, wooden partitions, a wooden staircase which is extremely narrow and narrow corridors. A fire alarm was recently installed but the potential danger still exists.  I doubt that the station in its present condition can comply with health regulations. In addition, in view of the present regulations regarding the treatment of persons in custody, I have doubts about the propriety of holding people in such conditions.</P>
      <P>The accommodation in Tullamore Garda station comprises a small cramped area for members of the public, a small day room and a small public office.  There is a sergeant's office and a room which is used for filing and by the other sergeants.  This room is also used as a doctor's room.  There is a kitchen and canteen area.  There is one toilet downstairs and two upstairs.  The adjoining building is used by the superintendent and his secretary and by the juvenile liaison officer's staff.</P>
      <P>Tullamore Garda station is used as a holding centre for a large area of County Offaly. However, there are only two holding cells in the station.  At weekends or when the Circuit Court is sitting, there might be up to ten prisoners held in the station.  As a result, the prisoners must remain handcuffed to prison officers.  That is unsatisfactory for prison officers, the prisoners and everybody else concerned.  It is a serious matter that deserves attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have witnessed gardaí interviewing members of the public in the corridors of the station.  In the public room I watched a number of conversations <Col N="152" /> taking place between the gardaí and members of the public.  People who visit Garda stations, whether voluntarily or when brought in for questioning, go there to discuss sensitive personal matters of a most intimate nature.  To be obliged to discuss such matters in the hearing of other members of the public is a matter of serious concern. In many cases the privacy of individuals is breached.  This alone must indicate the urgency of the situation in Tullamore to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to see the conditions at Tullamore Garda station for himself.  Tullamore town has made wonderful progress in the past ten years.  It is now an extremely busy town which has three large supermarkets, huge office blocks, a large shopping centre, a new hotel with another due to be opened shortly and an excellent general hospital.  The Department of Education and Science has offices in the town, as have the Departments of Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs.  Customs and Excise also has offices in Tullamore.  In addition, a number of major industries and factories are located there.  Tullamore continues to expand and in the interests of both the public and the Garda Síochána, I urge the Minister to provide a new Garda station immediately.</P>
    <P>Tullamore is only 60 miles from Dublin and, as it currently enjoys prosperity, it is attracting criminals from the Dublin area.  In addition, the gardaí in the town have had to deal with two murders in recent years and are currently dealing with a well known missing person case.  The population of the town is between 13,000 and 14,000, while the population of the area served by the district headquarters is over 20,000.</P>
    <P>The existing station is in the ideal location.  The former fire station building adjacent to it is empty and available.  The Minister should, if at all possible, make the necessary funding available to allow work commence this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and affording me the opportunity to explain the latest position with regard to work on Tullamore Garda station.  As he is aware, there are proposals for a major extension and refurbishment of the station.  To provide the necessary room for expansion, the former fire station building adjacent to it has been acquired by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the accommodation provided is less than adequate given the number of staff working in the station.  This is a point which my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, has been emphasising to me.  The Deputy can, therefore, rest assured that I fully appreciate the need for speedy improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that concern was expressed about fire safety in the building.  Last year fire and safety works were completed at a cost of approximately £50,000, including the provision of an external fire escape stairs, emergency lighting system and cabinets to enclose the fuse boards.  A smoke detection and fire alarm system was <Col N="153" /> installed and fire blankets and extinguishers were provided.  I am following the matter closely and I am concerned that whatever remedial action is needed to ensure the health and safety of gardaí and staff working in the station is undertaken.</P>
    <P>The station is being accorded a high priority under the Garda building programme.  There are, however, a number of projects which remain to be completed under the programme before the major work planned in Tullamore can begin.  I cannot say, therefore, when it will be possible to commence work.  I am determined, however, to tackle the problems there as soon as possible. There will be no avoidable delay in upgrading the facilities.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work has been done in recent years in improving standards of accommodation in Garda stations throughout the country.  It is, however, a large-scale operation.  The programme of improvement has been accorded a high priority by the Government.  This year more than £9 million has been provided for the building and maintenance <Col N="154" /> of Garda stations.  Gardaí occupy 704 stations and other units of accommodation throughout the country, including married quarters, large complexes, like Tullamore and Garda Headquarters, and a variety of smaller units. Many of the buildings occupied were built before the foundation of the State and designed for a different era.  Many, like the station in Tullamore, are in need of major upgrading or replacement. This year a major contract has been placed for the extension and refurbishment of the divisional headquarters in Thurles.  It is hoped to commence three to four other major projects.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work has been done in recent years to improve the situation.  I am sure Members will acknowledge the improvements to Garda stations and the provision of new stations built in recent years throughout the country.  The new station in Tullamore will follow as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26 March 1998.</P>

      <P>My Department received proposals from the Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology for a major extension to the institute, comprising two stages, at an estimated total cost of £8 million.</P>
      <P>Following an evaluation of the proposal by my Department, I gave the go-ahead to the institute to award a building contract for stage one of the development, at a cost of over £3.5 million on 19 November 1997.  At the time of the original approval the project had to be limited in size due to funding constraints.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, since that date I have put in place a major investment programme &mdash; the scientific and technological education (investment) fund &mdash; comprising £250 million over three years, for the third level sector as a whole.  Its establishment represents a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to the various problems which need to be tackled in the education system.  It makes available the necessary capital resources to deal with issues such as overcrowding in third level institutions, the emergence of skills shortages, upgrading of equipment and research and development and increased availability of computers in our schools.</P>
      <P>Very recently my Department received a proposal from the Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology authorities seeking approval to build the second phase of the extension in parallel with phase one.  The proposal to allow both phases of the extension to proceed in parallel is currently being considered in the context of the capital moneys now available to my Department.  I hope to be in a position to make a decision in the matter very shortly.</P>

      <P>The allocation of staff to an institute of technology is based on the programmes and budget submitted, on an annual basis, as required under the terms of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992.  Officials of my Department meet the management of the institute, each year, on an individual basis to discuss their programmes and requirements for the coming academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing levels for any of the institutes of technology are determined taking into account the scale of the institute's operation, its complexity, the range of its courses and facilities and the resources available for the year.  Differences in staffing arising between Cork Institute of Technology <Col N="157" /> and Waterford Institute of Technology can be explained by reference to these factors.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Cork Institute of Technology incorporates the Crawford College of Art and Design and the Cork School of Music which deliver programmes which are not parallelled in scale by Waterford Institute of Technology.  In addition, enrolment in part-time programmes, in apprenticeship and CERT courses are significantly greater in Cork Institute of Technology. Moreover, Cork Institute of Technology has twice the number of students on full-time engineering courses when compared with Waterford. These courses generally require a greater staff allocation than courses in business and humanities where Waterford Institute of Technology has a higher ratio of students.</P>
    <P>Under the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992 the institutes operate as autonomous bodies with an expanded role.  My Department has put in place a new staffing structure for all the institutes and continues to develop this within the limits of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 14 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>I am engaged in an ongoing review of all aspects of the third level maintenance grants schemes, namely, the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education scholarship scheme and the ESF-aided maintenance grants scheme.  Deputies will be interested to note that some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.  In the 1996-97 academic year, almost 48,000 students received grants under these schemes at a cost of some £91 million in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No specific research has been carried out by my Department about the increases in costs affecting students.  My Department draws upon data prepared by the Central Statistics Office on inflation and wage costs.  Maintenance grants have been increased in recent years in line with changes in the Consumer Price Index.  Similarly, the reckonable <Col N="158" /> income limits for grant eligibility have been increased in line with movements in the average industrial wage.  The question of increasing maintenance grants and income limits for the 1998-99 academic year will be considered in the context of the annual review of these schemes.  I expect to be in a position to announce details of the student support schemes for 1998-99 in early May.  I would, however, remind the Deputies that any improvements in this regard can be only considered in the light of overall resource constraints and other competing needs in the education sector.</P>
    <P>My priority in the area of student support has been to honour the commitment given in the Programme of Government An Action Programme for the Millennium to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses.  I have already advised the House of my intention to introduce grants, which will be at the same level as the third level maintenance grants, as soon as possible for students who are registered on PLC courses as of September 1998.  Provision for the payment of the first instalment of these grants has been included in the 1998 Estimates.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the management of Light of Christ national school, Dunmore East, County Waterford, applied to my Department for grant assistance towards the provision of a classroom for a remedial teacher and a library-medical room.  I understand the school which was built in 1991 currently has a library-medical room and that the remedial teacher, whose services are shared with three other schools, works from a room which was converted for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I acknowledge the converted room may not be ideal, the Deputies will appreciate that the demands for capital funding in the primary sector are considerable.  The pace at which ancillary accommodation can be provided at primary schools is dictated by the financial resources <Col N="159" /> available to me.  The priority always has to be the provision of essential classroom accommodation and the elimination of sub-standard classrooms.</P>
    <P>While I am not currently in a position to approve funding towards the proposed project, I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the school will be considered in the light of future capital allocations.</P>

The HEA's advice was based on recommendations of a working group composed of representatives of the universities, my Department and the authority.  The working group, under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority, was reconvened to undertake an indepth review of future needs for second level teachers. This review is focusing both on total needs and on needs by subject grouping, where feasible.  The working group is examining all relevant factors such as pupil numbers, pupil-teacher ratios, teacher retirements and career breaks.</P>

      <P>I will ensure that adequate capital resources are made available so that there will be sufficient places for pupils and students seeking <Col N="160" /> first, second and third level education both now and in the future.</P>
      <P>National demographic trends indicate that the number of pupils attending first and second level schools will decline significantly in the short to medium term.  This pattern is already clearly evident at first level, where total enrolments have fallen by around 10,000 per year for the last few years and will continue to decline until 2005.  At second level, enrolments have already peaked and will also decline for the next number of years. The indications are that total enrolments will show marginal increases from 2005 at first level and from 2011 or 2012 at second level.</P>
      <P>Within the national demographic trend, variations will occur in local school areas, particularly where major housing developments are taking place.  In such areas, extended or new school facilities may have to be provided and the extent of additional accommodation will be determined by my Department, in consultation with local educational interests.</P>
      <P>The Commission on School Accommodation, which was set up in 1996, will assist my Department in recommending criteria and procedure for school planning and provision, having regard to such factors as demographic change and the need for plurality within the system.</P>
      <P>At third level, the report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education, which was published in June 1995, sets out the parameters in the growth in higher education. This report was accepted by the then Government as a benchmark for the future planning of the sector, subject to regular review.  The first such review is currently being carried out by a study group established under the chairmanship of Dr. Donal de Buitléir.  The study group's remit is to advise on the appropriate level of provision of education and training places for school leavers and others.  I understand that the group's report will be available in the near future, at which stage I will consider its findings.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, I have secured very substantial resources for the third level sector to enable it to continue to support our economic development and I will continue to keep the level of provision at third level under review.  In this regard, I have provided extra funding to create some 1,450 additional places in 1997-98, in software courses at degree and technician level and technology courses at national certificate level.</P>
      <P>The Government has also announced the establishment of the £250 million education technology investment fund.  One of the objectives of the fund is to develop new areas of activities in our institutions, especially where emerging skills needs have already been identified.  The additional investment of £60 million targeted for the skills area will facilitate the provision of additional places in skill needs areas.</P>

      <P>It is estimated by my Department that approximately 300 additional special needs assistant posts would be required to fully meet the recommended ratios set out in the report of the Special Education Review Committee.  At present, my Department is funding a total of 272 such posts at an annual cost of £2.75 million.  This includes 20 posts which I allocated shortly after my appointment as Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>It is estimated by my Department that a maximum of approximatley 70 additional teacher posts would be required to fully achieve the pupil-teacher ratios recommended by the review committee.  The recommended pupil-teacher ratios have already been achieved in eight of the 12 categories recommended for improvement by the committee.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional teaching and special needs assistant posts in any year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand across the special needs area.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 20, 21 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge ws fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years and set for review this academic year.  In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
      <P>Students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the charge payable by students for registration, exams and student services, is a matter for the third level institution involved.  When I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge, from £150 to £250, for the current academic year, I was concerned about that portion of the charge which is intended to fund student services and in particular the lack of transparent procedures.  Accordingly, I requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The working group has completed their work and the Higher Education Authority has issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions.</P>
      <P>This framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the £250 charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution should provide information as to the allocation of the £250 charge towards exams-registration and towards student services on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to my direction that any arrangements put in place should not adversely affect the current funding of students unions, clubs and societies, the framework recommends that institutions be cognisant of the average contribution <Col N="163" /> from the £150 base in this regard of £50, when determining the revised contribution for these services from the £250 charge.</P>
    <P>I understand that the allocation to the student unions within the colleges includes an affiliation fee, where appropriate, to the Union of Students in Ireland and it is a matter for that organisation to determine the allocation of its funding.  I am confident that the framwork will be adopted by the various institutions involved and I have asked the Higher Education Authority to co-ordinate the review after six months, as recommended by the working party, of the consultative procedures and their outcome.</P>
    <P>I have not taken any decisions about the future arrangements in relation to this charge.</P>

      <P>The National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, in consultation with my Department, is drawing up procurement plans for <Col N="164" /> the provision of multimedia PCs and other information technology equipment for schools.  As stated in Schools IT 2000 &mdash; A Policy Framework for the New Millennium, each first and second level school will be assisted by my Department in acquiring at least one multimedia computer system with Internet access before the end of 1999. Additionally Telecom Éireann has agreed to supply each school with a multimedia computer system by September 1998 and the roll out plan for the distribution of these computers is about to be implemented.  As a result of Telecom Éireann and Department of Education and Science plans, approximately 8,500 multimedia computers will be provided to schools by the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>The NCTE has overall responsibility for incareer development provision in ICTs under Schools IT 2000 and is formulating a strategic plan for the delivery of varied training programmes to teachers up to the end of 2001.  This plan is being developed in consultation with the in-career development unit of my Department and various training provider interests.  In recent months a total of approximately 80 ICT training programmes for teachers have been approved for funding by my Department.  The NCTE is also currently considering specific proposals for ICT teacher training programmes submitted by individual schools and various groups and organisations in recent weeks.  It is expected that the provision of these ICT training programmes will commence after Easter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Information is not readily available on the numbers of students who fail to complete third-level courses at the institutes of technology and universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the university sector, the Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994 which indicated a completion rate of 81 per cent for those students entering in 1989-90.  This rate is a high completion rate by international standards. The authority is currently finalising arrangements with the Educational Research Centre, St. <Col N="165" /> Patrick's College, Drumcondra to undertake a further detailed study in this area.</P>
    <P>I also intend to set up a study of attrition rates in the technological sector and a proposal for an action-research project on attrition-drop-out rates in the institutes of technology is being considered by my Department at present.</P>
    <P>The commission on the points system has engaged a team of researchers to undertake a feasibility study on the predictive validity of the points system in relation to the intake of students into higher education.</P>
    <P>The reasons for dropout are complex.  There is no simple explanation.  Factors such as motivation, capabilities and suitability are all involved. There must also be a balance between completion rates on programmes and maintaining the necessary, objective standards.</P>
    <P>The challenge of maximising completion rates, consistent with maintaining appropriate standards is a matter, in the first instance, for individual universities, institutes of technology and the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been taken by the institutes of technology and the NCEA in relation to the monitoring of departures before students have completed their courses.  A system has been developed for a statistical monitoring of uncertified departures from certificate and diploma programmes and has been applied on a pilot basis in some institutes.  A further proposal from the institutes of technology for a study to monitor student attrition and retention is currently being considered in the Department.  Other studies, in both individual institutes and in groups of institutes, have also been carried out with a veiw to developing actions to minimise uncertified departures.  A comprehensive study on the guidance services in institutes of technology was carried out with assistance from the National Centre for Guidance in Education.  A further study began in October 1996 aimed at providing a comprehensive examination of the reasons underlying uncertified departures.  The study covers the 1996-97 session and encompasses background research, case studies, surveys and questionnaires.  In December 1996 the NCEA initiated a study into admission requirements, academic standards for transfer from national certificate to national diploma to degree and into attrition rates within courses in NCEA designated institutions.  An interim report from the study was presented to the council's academic committee last April.  I understand that presentation of the final report has been deferred in order to take account of other ongoing studies on attrition rates with a view to providing a more comprehensive analysis of the problem.</P>

      <P>The report of Sir Ron Dearing on the future of higher education in the UK was published in July 1997.  Arising from this report, Mr. David Blunkett, the UK Secretary of State for Education and Employment announced that he planned to introduce an annual tuition fee of up to £1,000 for third level students depending on parental income.  Along with all other EU students, including UK students, Irish students, commencing courses in 1998-99, will generally be asked to contribute up to £1,000 per annum on undergraduate courses.</P>
      <P>I further understand that all EU students will be eligible for grant assistance towards this tuition fee from the UK authorities, subject to the same conditions as will be applied to UK students.  In this regard, it is likely that those students with reckonable incomes below £23,000 will be fully grant aided by the appropriate local education authority and will not have to pay any contribution towards the fee.  Students with reckonable income of between £23,000 and £35,000 will be partially grant aided and will, accordingly, only be liable for a portion of the full fee.  Students whose reckonable income exceeds £35,000 are unlikely to be grant aided and will be liable to pay the full £1,000 tuition fee.</P>
      <P>Full details of the arrangements, including the administrative arrangements, are expected to be available by April.  Officials of my Department are engaged in ongoing discussions with their counterparts from the Department of Education, Northen Ireland in relation to the practicalities involved.</P>

      <P>The steering committee on the future development of higher education considered the participation levels of mature students in higher education and noted that participation of mature students in higher education was low in Ireland having regard to the international experience, despite the different demographic profiles.  The committee recommended that there should be a progressive increase in the numbers of mature students entering full-time higher education from 1,100, 3.7 per cent, in 1994 to 2,200, 6.2 per cent by 2000 and subsequently to increase to 5,600, 16 per cent by 2010.  When considering the steering committee's proposals, the Higher Education Authority advocated a faster rate of growth to a level of 7.5 per cent by 2000, rising by 2.5 per cent each year thereafter to a target of 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> The report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education, which was published in June 1995, was accepted by the then Government as a benchmark for the future planning of the sector, subject to regular review. The first review of the steering committee's report is being carried out by a study group established under the chairmanship of Dr. Donal de Buitléir.  The student group's remit is to advise on the appropriate level of provision of education and training places for school leavers and others. I understand the study group's report will be available in the near future, at which stage I will consider its findings.</P>
    <P>A range of measures have been introduced in recent years to facilitate higher participation by mature students.  These include: improvements in the student support arrangements to extend them to mature students and to enable such students to be assessed on their own means; the free fees initiative and the provisions allowing tax relief on fees for certain third level courses, which apply to mature students; the special arrangements to enable mature students to train as primary teachers; initiatives aimed at facilitating the return to formal education of women in Cork, Dublin, Tralee, and Galway-Mayo institutes of technology; the new national certificate in technology courses, which was developed by a joint education-industry task force, and targeted in particular at non-standard applicants, commenced in nine institutes of technology in January 1998.  Nearly 300 students are attending this course of whom over 100 are mature students.  It is hoped to organise further courses in this area in the future.</P>
    <P>The proposed new Institute of Technology at Blanchardstown and the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute will have a major focus on non-standard applicants and on mature students and continuing education.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Higher Education Authority provides targeted funding to its institutions for initiatives designed to support the participation of mature students, particularly second chance students.  In 1997, the authority provided £601,000 for projects in this area.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority, in co-operation with third level institutions, is also promoting the co-ordinated development of a system of modular course structures and related credit transfer arrangements.  Such flexibility in course structures has the potential to facilitate access and enable mature and part-time students to study for qualifications while remaining in full-time employment.  Part-time options are often more attractive to mature students and while a current age profile for part-time students is not available, in 1993-94 almost 85 per cent of all part-time third level students were mature students.  In 1995-96 there were almost 22,000 part-time students in third level institutions aided by my Department.</P>

      <P>There is a range of special preventative and support schemes promoted by my Department to assist schools in making provision for disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>The teacher counsellor scheme was introduced on a pilot basis in 1995 in selected primary schools in the Inner City and Clondalkin-Tallaght areas of Dublin.  Teacher counsellors assist in co-ordinating a whole school approach to devising and implementing good practice and strategies that will help to prevent disruptive behaviour. They also teach and counsel small groups and individuals who exhibit persistent behaviour difficulties in the classroom.</P>
      <P>A detailed evaluation of the teacher counsellor scheme is under way and I expect to receive a report on the outcome of the evaluation before the end of the school year.</P>
      <P>I have established a planning group to prepare proposals for a national education psychological service and I expect to receive this report in the near future.  This service will be a further support for schools in providing for pupils who may have emotional and behavioural difficulties which result in disruptive behaviour.  In the meantime, an additional 15 psychologists are being employed in the psychological service development project in the context of the demographic dividend, to extend the psychological service provided by my Department to primary schools. These new psychologists have already begun to take up their appointments and will participate in an induction programme over the next few months.</P>
      <P>The report on discipline in schools commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin has been made available to every school.</P>
      <P>The present allocation of learning support teachers, guidance counsellors and home school community liaison teachers continues to be a significant source of assistance for dealing with disruptive pupils.</P>
      <P>I launched recently an important new EU funded initiative which is targeted at children in the 8-15 year age group who have dropped out of school or are at risk of dropping out.  In addition, my Department is engaged in the preparation of draft legislation to deal with the complex issues involved in non-attendance at school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am finalising proposals for the establishment of a management support service for second level schools.  It is envisaged that this service will be a resource for school managements and assist them among other matters, in dealing with school planning <Col N="169" /> and the revision of general guidelines with regard to pupils who pose difficulties in school.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention, at the moment, to establish alternative education settings for disruptive pupils.  My preferred option is to supply maximum supports for teachers and pupils in the school setting itself.</P>

      <P>There are a total of 119 special schools dedicated to meeting the educational needs of children who require special supports.  Each special school is equipped to cater for a a particular range of special needs.  The schools in question have an overall capacity to cater for approximately 7,700 pupils.  All the schools in question enjoy significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios and attract special levels of funding.</P>
      <P>Thers is a total of 703 special classes in place at present.  These special classes have a capacity to cater for approximaely 8,200 pupils.  The classes in question enjoy the same levels of special support as that made available to special schools dealing with the same range of needs.</P>
      <P>Not all children with special needs require placement in a special school.  In many instances, such children can be suitably catered for in special classes attached to ordinary primary schools or on a fully integrated basis, with the support where necessary of remedial or resource teachers.</P>
      <P>Children with special needs who are fully integrated into ordinary primary schools are supported by 1,242 remedial teachers and 78 resource teachers.  Some of these children are also supported by the visiting teacher service.</P>
      <P>My Department is prepared to give positive consideration to applications for the establishment of additional special schools or special classes where the need for such provision has been properly established.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the range of provision in place, coupled with my Department's willingness to facilitate any necessary expansions in that provision, offers the necessary assurance of adequate provision in the special needs area.</P>

      <P>Since 1996 the student support schemes <Col N="170" /> have been extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states.  Prior to this, such grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In this context, following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying.  It was further agreed that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid, in all circumstances, would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the relevant country in which the student was studying, at the prevailing exchange rate.  Previously, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates.  Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continue to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates.  Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements.  I am satisfied that these arrangements are equitable and efficient.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in other EU member states.  Moreover, such an approach could well give rise to anomalies and to claims of inequitable treatment between students studying in different countries.</P>

      <P>The skills group, which was established by Forfás, identified skills needs in the areas of software engineering, engineering technicians and teleservices up to the end of the century.  In relation to software engineering, an annual additional output of some 1,000 computing graduates was identified.  In the area of engineering technicians, the skills group recommended the provision of additional technician places.  In the area of languages for the teleservices sector, the need for additional places was also identified by the skills group.</P>
      <P>In response to these identified needs, a steering committee, chaired by the chairman of the Higher Education Authority, was asked to identify the most cost effective way of providing the additional software and technician graduates.  The committee recommended a capital investment of some £50 million, over the period 1997-2000, in this regard.  The committee further recommended that the Higher Education Authority and my Department be empowered to negotiate with the institutions, so as to maximise the output of graduates within this capital investment framework. The committee also recognised the need for current investment to facilitate the provision of these computer software graduates and engineering technicians.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the steering committee's report, I obtained Government approval for an immediate additional £5 million capital investment to fund an expansion in places on these high-technology courses in the 1997-98 academic year.  No financial provision had previously been earmarked to meet these critical needs.  An additional 650 places in software engineering and over 500 places in engineering technician programmes have been approved for the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
      <P>Arising from the work of the joint education/industry task force to improve the supply of technicians for the high technology sector, I have already announced the setting up of a new industry/college initiative to jointly recruit, educate and train technicians.  Almost 300 students have commenced courses in nine institutes of technology from January 1998, which involve structured work-placement, and it is expected that these students will enter the workforce about 18 months after the courses begin.</P>
      <P>In the teleservices area, I have introduced a national initiative to provide training to meet the skill needs of the international teleservices industry. Over 400 training places have been filled in 20 PLC colleges throughout the country which will offer full-time two year post leaving certificate courses in international teleservices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following these immediate responses, the Government announced the establishment of the £250 million education technology investment fund and the Scientific and Technological Education <Col N="173" /> Fund Bill was enacted in December 1997. One of the objectives of the fund is to develop new areas of activities in our institutions, especially where emerging skills needs have already been identified.  The additional investment of £60 million targeted for the skills area will ensure the proposed expansion programme can proceed effectively and within the necessary timeframe.  A further £20 million is provided within the fund for developing the PLC and apprenticeship areas.  The precise student number targets will be negotiated by my Department with the institutions involved.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a widely representative business-education partnership forum, to be co-chaired by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and myself, has been established in tandem with an expert group to advise on future skills needs and forecasting techniques and an implementation group, comprising the chairman of the expert group, the relevant secretaries general of the appropriate Departments, the chief executive of Forfás and the chairman of the Higher Education Authority.  I am confident that this structure will ensure that our education system continues to adequately respond to the specific needs of the economy.</P>

      <P>A special pilot programme to address the educational needs of children with autism was introduced by my Department in the 1995-96 school year.</P>
      <P>Under this programme, a number of special classes dedicated specifically to the needs of children with autism have been established.  The pilot programme involves the allocation of extra teachers to specifically address the educational needs of children with autism.  It also involves the delivery of specially tailored education programmes to meet the needs of those children and the delivery of special in-service support to the teachers concerned.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate has now commenced a review of the operation of the pilot programme. This review, which is expected to be completed by the end of the current school year, will provide a basis for the development of future responses to the educational needs of children with autism.</P>

      <P>While I have had no discussions with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government concerning safety standards on school buses, the overall operation of the school transport scheme is constantly under review to ensure the best and safest possible service is delivered.  All vehicles operating under the scheme meet rigid safety stanards and, where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass the Department of the Environment and Local Government tests in regard to roadworthiness.</P>

    <P>Bus Éireann, which operates the service on behalf of my Department, is justifiably proud of its safety record in operating the school transport scheme.  It places special emphasis on safety and, to this end, has a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure a safe and reliable service.

The forum is bringing together service providers and experts in the field for the purpose of advising me on a strategy for the future development of early childhood education services. My objective in holding the national forum is to allow all groups with an interest in the area of early childhood education to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the future development of services in this area.</P>
      <P>The forum's deliberations cover the ages from birth to six years, and, accordingly, include what is currently the infant cycle in primary schools.  I would not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the forum on this or on any other matter but will await the forum's conclusions before making any proposals.</P>
      <P>Following the conclusion of the national forum, an independent report of its proceedings and conclusions will be prepared by the independent secretariat and published under the authority of the secretary general to the forum.  This report will be an important document in its own right and will be an important input into a White Paper on early childhood education, work on which will commence following the forum.</P>

      <P>It is a fundamental principle of the primary school curriculum that individual differences between children should be recognised and catered for in the school programme.  It posits that the curriculum should be sufficiently flexible to allow each child to progress at an appropriate pace and to achieve satisfaction and success at his-her own level.  The report of the Review Body on the Primary Curriculum, 1990, was supportive of the retention of this principle in any future review of the curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised primary curriculum being completed by the NCCA also takes account of the need to cater for individual differences.  Its broad objectives are set down in a format which requires that due account should be taken of intrinsic abilities and varying circumstances among pupils.  As an earnest of its concern for pupils whose needs are different or who may be <Col N="178" /> disadvantaged in some way, the NCCA is preparing an issues booklet entitled Differentiation, which will accompany and inform the main curriculum statements and teacher guidelines.  The NCCA has also recently established a working group on pupils with special education needs.</P>
    <P>These initiatives by the NCCA are designed to support and enhance the work already being done in schools for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.  This programme of special measures is designed to offset the potentially damaging effects of social and economic disadvantage on success at school.  The programme includes measures such as the allocation of additional concessionary teaching posts, homeschool-community liaison programmes, the appointment of teacher-counsellors and the Early Start and Breaking the Cycle initiatives.</P>

      <P>Pupils transfer to second level schools in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland at different ages and they also take their first national certificate examinations at different ages.  In addition, the leaving certificate programme involves a broad range of subjects while the A Level programme involves the study of three subjects in more detail.  Consequently, there are some inherent difficulties in aligning second level curricula in both jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and the Council for Curriculum Examinations and Assessment, CCEA, have worked closely in the development of civic, social and political education in the Republic of Ireland and in the programme of education for mutual understanding in Northern Ireland.  There is regular contact between the NCCA and the CCEA and also with other curriculum councils in England, Wales and Scotland through the curriculum councils liaison group, CCLG, through consultation on curricular developments, early drafts of new syllabi and trends in assessment.</P>
      <P>At departmental level, the European studies project has developed modules in History, Geography and the European dimension which dovetail, as appropriate, into the separate curricular requirements in both jurisdictions.  From time to time to mark important historical events curricular material is developed for use in both education systems.

      <P>My Department is currently engaged in the preparation of draft legislation on school attendance.  My objective is to bring heads of proposed legislation to Government in the autumn. I hope to be in a position to publish draft legislation before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The question of raising the school leaving age will be among the issues addressed in this legislation. While I will study the views put forward by Forfás in relation to this matter, my view at this stage is that the school leaving age should be raised to 16 years or completion of the three year junior cycle.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The need for additional education and training provision for young people is being kept under continuing review by the Government.  My Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are co-operating and will continue to do so to ensure that appropriate responses are made to emerging needs.</P>
      <P>In this context, the Deputies will be aware that arising from recommendations of the Forfás interim skills group on which both Departments were represented, I approved additional training courses at PLC level to develop multilingual teleservices-telemarketing skills with an uptake in the present academic year of over 400; I secured Government approval in July 1997 for £5 million capital investment to meet the emerging skills needs of the high-technology sector; and I established a joint education-industry task force to improve the supply of technicians.  Almost 300 students commenced new courses in January 1998 having been recruited on a joint basis by the third level technological institutions and by industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 6 November 1997 the Government announced details of the £250 million Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund which will be used to develop technology education at all levels, ranging from primary schools <Col N="182" /> to advanced research.  There are three main objectives to the establishment of the fund: to renew and modernise the infrastructure of third level institutions, particularly in the technological sector; to develop new areas of activities where emerging skills needs have been identified; and to invest in promoting innovation to maintain and further our economic growth.</P>
    <P>The Government also announced details of an important initiative in relation to interaction between Government, business and educationtraining. The purpose of the initiative is to promote dialogue between Government, business and the education institutions in relation to the education and training needs of the economy, to develop and facilitate the forecasting of skills requirements and to provide mechanisms for the speedy implementation of decisions.  The three basic components of the new initiative are: a business-education partnership forum which is to be co-chaired by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Education and Science; an expert group on future skills which will advise on future skills needs and forecasting techniques; and a high level management implementation group to progress recommendations to the point where decisions can be taken and to monitor progress on the rate of implementation of decisions.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will also be aware that an interdepartmental group comprised of representatives of my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS is responsible for overseeing provision in the education and FÁS sector for early school leavers.  In this context, I would advise the Deputies that in the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework, 1994-99, new initiatives were agreed for implementation in 1998 and 1999 under which £2.96 million will be provided over 1998 and 1999 for a new initiative focussed on structured pilot projects in urban and rural disadvantaged areas with test models for the development of an integrated area based co-ordination of services to cater for young people aged eight to 15 at risk of early school leaving; £19.733 million will be provided for a minimum of 1,000 additional places for early school leavers in the youthreach and traveller training programmes; £0.987 million will be provided for the strengthening of counselling, guidance and psychological services for participants in these programmes; and £1.97 million will be provided for bridging and progression options for early school leavers through the FÁS training system.  Some 725 places within the FÁS system will be redeveloped to progression options for youthreach and traveller trainees in 1998.</P>

      <P>In July 1996 the Government approved in principle the recommendations in the report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education as a benchmark for future planning in the sector subject to regular review.  As a response to the higher education needs of the south east region, the report recommended an increase in student places in what was then the Regional Technical College, Waterford, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title to regional institute of technology.</P>
      <P>Since the report of the steering committee was published the number of full-time students in the college has increased from the 1994-95 level of some 3,500 to 4,740.  Early in 1997, the college was redesignated as the Waterford Institute of Technology and arrangements have been put in place to carry through the process leading to the delegation to the institute of authority to make awards, within a national qualifications framework. This process is being carried out by a review team chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly.</P>
      <P>The institute has submitted to my Department a framework for its development and this proposal is the subject of ongoing discussions with officials.  An increase in degree level provision in the areas of computing, financial services and administration was agreed for the 1997-98 academic session by the Department with the institute in the context of meeting the identified higher education needs of the south-east region. Proposals regarding additional degree level provision for the 1998-99 academic year will be the subject of forthcoming discussions with my Department in relation to the institute's annual programmes and budget submission, recently received.</P>

The special arrangements are intended to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate s performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment as distinct from attempting to compensate in any way for a lack of ability or knowledge on the part of the candidate.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for assessment of children with special needs, including children with specific learning disability, dyslexia, rests with the relevant health authority through the director of community care.</P>
      <P>However, I intend to establish a national education psychological service which will provide services for all primary and secondary schools. Proposals for the establishment of this service were included in the programme for Government. A planning group which is to make recommendations on the introduction of this service, including its role, functions and the resource implications, is expected to report to me by the end of April.  The national education psychological service will then be introduced on a phased basis as resources permit.</P>
      <P>The education needs of primary school pupils with specific learning disability are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.  Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  In addition the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.</P>
      <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes.  If necessary, they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Depending on their level of difficulty, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.  Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in a range of special schools and special classes dedicated to the needs of the children in question.  In 1997, my Department allocated a sum of £24,971 to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities, ACALD, to assist in its administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas.  My Department is at present considering a request for additional funding for the ACALD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure that all available <Col N="185" /> resources are deployed as effectively as possible. I can assure the Deputy that the needs of children with specific learning disability will be fully considered in this context.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, my predecessor agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the current school year in consultation with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend.  Since there are no teaching posts available for allocation in the current school year, I am at present examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitment to one teacher schools.</P>
      <P>The future of one teacher schools with an enrolment of less than ten pupils will be considered in consultation with the board of management, parents and teacher of each individual school.  The crucial issue relating to these schools is that arrangements are put in place which are in the best interests of the pupils and acceptable to the school community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opening statement in the article Business Education Links in the February edition of IBEC News acknowledging that we have an educated workforce which is one of Ireland's clear competitive advantages in the world economy.</P>
      <P>Young people in our schools are exposed to many areas of life and development not all of which are directly related to the workplace but which have enormous personal and social value. These include art and music, physical education and recreation, social, health and relationships education.</P>
      <P>The transition year programme gives students the opportunity to develop many of the skills that the article states that schools are not capable of addressing.  During this year the students become heavily involved in groupwork, brainstorming and co-operative project work which are exactly the areas required by business.  In addition, all students on this programme engage in work experience and are briefed, monitored and debriefed during and after their experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition many schools give the same opportunity <Col N="187" /> to students to participate in sporting teams and other competitive areas like debating, and many students develop leadership and teamworking skills within these activities.  Also, almost all schools have some involvement in various national and local competitions, for example, young scientist, choral competitions, stock exchange simulations and competitions, computer and language clubs, rotary and young achievement leadership programmes and minicompany and young entrepreneur programmes. Most schools also organise trips to adventure centres, field visits, career guidance exhibitions and educational visits to Britain and Europe.</P>
    <P>The criticism of the leaving certificate in the article does not seem to take account of the recent changes that have taken place.  Revised syllabuses have been introduced in a number of subjects at leaving certificate.  In all the modern language programmes there is now an emphasis on oral and aural work.  The revised leaving certificate business programme has a major emphasis on enterprise and the revised accounting syllabus has included management accounting and IT as major components.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are now two additional leaving certificates available.  The leaving certificate vocational programme is taken by students in 50 per cent of our schools.  Students take a selection from the established leaving certificate subjects and, in addition, take the following three modules: work preparation, work experience and enterprise education.  The leaving certificate applied is a completely new programme with an obligatory focus on a vocational area.  Again, work experience, projects and tasks are at the core of this programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the work of IBEC with our schools and applaud the enterprise which it has shown in the development of the links programme.  It provides extremely valuable learning materials for teachers and opportunities for local businesses to build up a link and relationship with the schools.  I also would like to acknowledge the work of IBEC in organising a placement programme with employers whereby over 130 business teachers have worked for two weeks plus in its members' firm.</P>

In this regard, I point out that tax relief is available at the standard rate, on fees paid to private colleges in accordance with the provisions contained in section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995 and section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the legal proceedings which have been instituted in the case of Patrick Jordan Junior, Patrick Jordan Senior and Raymond Kearns <i>v</i> the Minister for Education and Science, Ireland and the Attorney General regarding the non-inclusion of Portobello College within the free fees initiative.  As the matter will be before the courts, I do not consider it appropriate for me to make any further statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am happy to inform the Deputy that the National Forum on Early Childhood Education is taking place this week in Dublin Castle. The forum is bringing together service providers and experts in the field for the purpose of advising <Col N="189" /> me on a strategy for the future development of early childhood education services.</P>
      <P>My objective in holding the national forum is to allow all groups with an interest in the area of early childhood education to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the future development of services in this area. The provision of appropriate pre-school education in areas of social deprivation and low educational achievement is one of the issues being addressed by the forum.</P>
      <P>Following the conclusion of the national forum, an independent report on its proceedings and conclusions will be prepared by the independent secretariat and will be published under the authority of the secretary general to the forum.  This report will be an important document in its own right and will be an important input also into a White Paper on early childhood education, work on which will commence following the forum.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to Question No. <Col N="191" /> 85 on 12 February 1998, the Government's commitment to the ongoing development of the further education sector is evident in</P>
      <P>&mdash; the decision to provide means-tested maintenance grants for students attending PLC courses with effect from September 1998. The scheme will operate along the lines of the existing third level schemes and will be a critical development in enhancing access to lifelong learning,</P>
      <P>&mdash; the significant role played by PLC courses in the Government's response to meeting the skills needs of the economy, particularly the recent initiative in international teleservices, which is accompanied by substantial capital investment and a new student support scheme for the cost of overseas placement,</P>
      <P>&mdash; the inclusion of specific provision for the PLC sector under the new Education Technology (Investment) Fund, some £20 million of this will be available for PLC courses and apprenticeships.  This is a first.  It is the first time since the initiation of PLCs that serious capital investment has been devoted to the sector.  This much needed investment underlines the importance which the Government attaches to the sector,</P>
      <P>&mdash; the increase of a minimum of 1,000 additional places on youthreach and in senior traveller training centre places which is being provided in 1998, allied to additional funds for a new measure to provide counselling, guidance and psychological services for participants in these programmes,</P>
      <P>&mdash; the decision to have a Green Paper on Adult Education which will make recommendations on future developments in the context of expanding access to lifelong learning,</P>
      <P>&mdash; the ongoing investment in the work of the National Council for Vocational Awards and TEASTAS in providing national certification and assessment for this important sector, streamlining and regulating standards in line with industry needs.</P>
      <P>One of the most urgent requirements in the further and higher education and training area, outside the existing universities, is the provision of a comprehensive national qualifications framework which will ensure the quality of the outcome from the sector and in doing this building on the excellent work carried out by the NCVA and the NCEA.  I am satisfied the PLC sector has and will continue to have a dynamic role in meeting skills needs and in the promotion of lifelong learning and employability generally &mdash; this role is readily recognised and acknowledged by industry.  I intend to build on these strengths.  I will keep under review the structures through which this might best be done.</P>

      <P>A number of students are not attending school because they have been expelled or otherwise excluded from school.  The managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.  Such a code is unique to each school as it reflects a whole host of factors associated with the community which it serves.  My Department has issued guidelines to assist schools discharging their responsibilities in this area.  The guidelines stress that expulsion should only be considered after every effort at rehabilitation has failed and every other sanction has been exhausted.</P>
      <P>I intend at an early stage to establish a mechanism for the purpose of quantifying the number of pupils who fall outside the system through suspension or expulsion.  In addition, the Education Bill which is currently before this House contains provisions which will allow a more formal appeal by parents or students who have reached the age of 18 years against exclusion from school.  This should bring greater clarity to these matters.</P>
      <P>It is open to parents who experience school placement difficulties to seek assistance from my Department in securing an alternative school placement through the involvement of the inspectorate in a consultative process with school authorities. My Department's psychological service is also available to assess pupils with special needs in order to identify the most appropriate provision for such students.</P>
      <P>Programmes such as youth encounter projects and youthreach are designed to cater for pupils whose needs can best be dealt with outside of the mainstream school system.  I am also committed to addressing the needs of children with school attendance problems.  In this context it is proposed to introduce a School Attendance (Amendment) Bill during the current year.</P>

      <P>The remedial teaching service is one of a range of services provided for children with special needs who are attending school on a fully <Col N="193" /> integrated basis.  Such children may also have access to the resource teacher service or the visiting teacher service.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,242 remedial teachers are currently in place in primary schools.  At second level, a total of 350 ex-quota remedial teachers are in place.  A total of 78 resource teachers are currently in place in primary schools.  At second level, a total of 147 ex-quota resource teachers are in place.</P>
      <P>The visiting teacher service provides back-up support for children with certain disabilities attending both primary and second level schools. A total of 42 visiting teachers are involved in providing this service.  My capacity to allocate additional resources to these services in any year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand across the special needs area.  I have to establish priorities and deploy available resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>As far as the current school year is concerned, decisions regarding the allocation of available resources had already been taken by my predecessor in March 1997 before she left office.  I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible for the 1998-99 school year.

      <P>Schools IT 2000 &mdash; A Policy Framework for the New Millennium states that the project will involve three major initiatives: the technology integration initiative, TII; the teaching skills initiative, TSI; and the schools support initiative, SSI, which will include: ScoilNet; and the school integration project, SIP.</P>
      <P>On the technology integration initiative, under strand 1 it is proposed that &ldquo;each school be assisted in acquiring at least one multimedia computer system with Internet access before the end of 1999&rdquo;.  In partnership with Telecom Éireann it is planned to have this element in place by the beginning of the 1998-99 school year.  Strand 1, therefore, will be completed ahead of schedule. The overall objective is to have an installed base of at least 60,000 computers within four years.</P>
      <P>On the teaching skills initiative, the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, has responsibility for the development of a strategic training programme for teachers in ICTs in education. Plans are being put in place now to ensure that at least one teacher from every school receives training aimed at developing practical experience in using the computer and associated technologies.  This training will parallel strand 1 of the technology integration initiative, TII.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the schools support initiative, the NCTE has responsibility for the development of ScoilNet as described in Schools IT 2000 &mdash; A Policy <Col N="195" /> Framework for the New Millennium.  Plans will be developed for ScoilNet at an early date and all schools will be informed when it comes on line.  I am confident that ScoilNet will be an excellent resource as regards the provision of information, advice and support to schools.</P>
    <P>The school integration project will involve at least 40 schools.  The NCTE will draw up a list of priority areas and detailed criteria for the evaluation of project proposals under the SIP.  These will be circulated to schools with an invitation to submit proposals.  A large number of schools have taken the initiative in this regard and these schools have already submitted project proposals. These will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria established by the NCTE.  I expect that a number of SIP projects will be in place for the beginning of the 1998-99 school year.</P>

      <P>Detailed draft evaluation criteria have been prepared to ensure a reliable and consistent approach to whole school evaluation throughout the system.  These criteria cover all aspects of WSE, including learning, teaching, planning and management.  The draft evaluation criteria have been made available to the schools in the pilot project.  Schools can therefore use these objective criteria for self-evaluation and also to compare their own internal judgments with the external WSE evaluation.  The use of agreed evaluation criteria also has potential to yield objective and dependable data on the broad functioning of the education system at national level.</P>
      <P>In comparing schools there is an implicit asssumption that like will be compared with like in a fair and consistent manner.  However, schools may differ significantly in terms of their pupil enrolment, in the range of abilities and personal characteristics of their pupils, in their staffing and in their academic organisation and teaching approaches.  Such variable school context factors can account for differences in outcomes among schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparisons made between schools generally refer only to differences in outcomes and rarely to the underlying explanatory causes of these differences, and this in turn leads to incorrect assumptions being made about the effectiveness of schools.  In addition, comparisons between schools' outcomes always focus on those aspects of schooling which are most easily measured and ultimately lead to calls for the formation of <Col N="197" /> league tables.  These comparisons and league tables have potentially negative consequences for schools.  Important areas of schooling less amenable to measurement and quantification, such as the development of pupil attitudes or the expressive and affective side of learning, may not receive sufficient emphasis in curriculum design and implementation in schools.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the model of whole school evaluation being developed in consultation with the partners has the capacity to encourage and support schools and to promote effective school development.  While schools will be able to measure their education achievements against national evaluation criteria, the crude and superficial nature of league tables has no place in my policy for school improvement.  WSE will be an important element in the inspectorate's supportive and advisory role in relation to quality development in schools.  Many schools currently engage in development practices, such as whole-school planning and school self-review, aimed at improving the quality of education they offer. The WSE process will affirm existing good practice in this area and will assist and support all schools in their quality improvement efforts.</P>

This involves the appointment, by way of open competition, <Col N="198" /> of 15 educational psychologists on three year contracts.  The competition has been held and the 15 successful candidates have all indicated their intention to accept the offer of employment.  They are expected to take up their posts over the next few months.  These psychologists will be based in the following regions: north-west, west, mid-west, south, south-east, midlands, east Leinster and north-east Leinster. My Department will decide on the actual schools to which they will be assigned after the psychologists have participated in an induction programme lasting for six to eight weeks.</P>

      <P>In the great majority of schools it is now normal practice that teachers assess the attainments of pupils in literacy and mathematics at different stages in their progress through school. It is particularly important that they do so at the early stages of pupils' careers in school so that pupils who are having difficulties in acquiring basic skills in literacy and-or numeracy are identified and helped as early as possible.  For many years my Department has supported the provision of courses for teachers in the use of educational tests.  The majority of school now use a variety of standardised and diagnostic tests to assess pupil progress and to identify pupils with learning difficulties.  Decisions on the extent and timing of this testing of pupils are a matter for each school.</P>

      <P>With particular regard to training the general principle applied is that FÁS training programmes are open to all persons who are unemployed and seeking work.  However, priority of access is given to persons on the live register, regardless of gender.  The participation rate of women in FÁS programmes is some 49 per cent.</P>
      <P>FÁS is also undertaking a number of initiatives geared to the reintegration of women to the labour market.  These include &ldquo;return to work&rdquo; and &ldquo;enterprise training&rdquo; courses and a NOW, New Opportunities for Women, programme which aims to provide locally-based training in partnership with community groups.</P>

      <P>The EU directive concerning the Internal Market in electricity came into force on 19 February 1997.  Ireland has to implement the directive by February 2000.</P>
      <P>It requires that approximately 28 per cent of the Irish electricity market be opened to competition at that time, increasing to about 32 per cent by 2003.  This will allow independent electricity generators to contract directly with designated eligible customers for the supply of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eligible customers will be those who will be free to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; to choose their electricity supplier in the competitive market.  Customers consuming more than 100GWh per year, which <Col N="203" /> represents about 8 per cent of electricty sold, are automatically eligible.  The remaining 20 per cent is likely to comprise customers consuming more than 4GWh per year.</P>
    <P>The majority of customers, known as the franchise market, will continue to be supplied exclusively by the ESB.</P>

      <P>The Forfás report contains a range of recommendations designed to promote the development of broadband telecommunications investment in Ireland in the short term.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have only received the report in recent days and it is now being examined by my Department.  My preliminary reaction is that the report is a valuable contribution to the process of policy formation to ensure that Ireland's telecommunications sector is developed to become an international leader and to contribute to future economic development. I intend to hold discussions with the board of Telecom Éireann later this week on those aspects of the report which relate to the activities of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of areas where the conclusions of the report have already been acted upon.  I am referring in particular to the suggestion that the powers of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation need to be expanded. This is already being addressed through the transposition of EU directives which are designed to harmonise the powers of national regulatory authorities for telecommunications across <Col N="204" /> Europe.  For example, I recently signed the European Communities (Interconnection in Telecommunications) Regulations, 1988, which significantly enhance the powers of the director. I will also, over the coming weeks, give effect to further regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, which will give new powers to the director in relation to licensing of telecommunications operators and the provision of leased lines.</P>
    <P>I intend bringing proposals to Government in the coming weeks in relation to the future of Cablelink.</P>
    <P>The question of incentives for the future development of broadband infrastructure, including a possible role for Structural Funds, is already being examined by a group of assistant secretaries of Departments who were recently charged by the Government with the task of defining the policy actions necessary to promote the development of the information society in Ireland.  It would be premature to comment on the outcome of these deliberations at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package, which was paid out in October 1996, provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU suckler cow premium scheme or 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme.  In effect the regulations require that when all balancing payments under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1996 EU special beef premium scheme are made, a comparison is to be carried out between the number <Col N="206" /> of animals qualifying for payment under the 1995 schemes and the number qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  Money is to be recouped from those farmers who had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  The money so recouped is then to be used to make payments to those farmers who had more eligible animals under the 1996 schemes.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in the process of recovering overpayments from those farmers in the former category and this money is to be used to make outstanding payments to farmers in the latter category.  Obviously it is important that as much money as possible can be recovered before striking a rate for payment of additional top-ups.</P>
      <P>To date, the person named was paid special beef premium BSE compensation amounting to £1,218.36 on 67 animals &mdash; £19.08 x 67 &mdash; on 7 October 1996.  He had 50 additional eligible male animals in 1996 and will, therefore, be entitled to a further payment on these animals.  It is expected that the Department will be in a position to make these payments before the end of June 1998.</P>

The stamping and punching of premium application status of these documents is required under Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2629/97.</P>
      <P>Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No. 3886/92 also stipulates that any male bovine animal in respect of which a special beef premium application has been submitted but which has not qualified for the special beef premium, either due to an excess on the national quota for this scheme, or, due to the individual applicant having exceeded his or her stocking density for premia, currently two livestock units per hectare, is deemed to have received the premium claimed and may no longer be the subject of an application for the same age bracket, by any person.</P>
      <P>It is for the individual farmers to ensure that they only submit bovines for premium within the limits of two livestock units per hectare, unless, for their own reasons, they wish to have animals deemed paid.  For example, some farmers could knowingly submit more animals than they would receive actual payment for in order to have such excess animals deemed paid special beef premium and thus eligible in due course for deseasonalisation slaughter premium.</P>

    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that there are a number of factors to be taken into consideration when allocating additional Garda resources to any division.  These include divisional requirements, population ratio, crime ratio, security issues and other matters which contribute to law and order.  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the best possible Garda service is being provided in Galway with the current deployment of personnel. In fact the crime statistics for the Galway subdistrict for the past four years indicate that there has been a 14 per cent decrease in the number of crimes committed over the past four years.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that two sergeants are being assigned to the Galway West division on promotion on 3 April 1998.  An additional existing sergeant and three gardaí are also being transferred to the division on the same date.  It is further understood that in consequential changes Mill Street Garda station will be assigned one sergeant and four gardaí on 2 and 3 April 1998, respectively.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the personnel situation in the Galway West division will continue to be monitored and reviewed.  Each time additional personnel become available for allocation the needs of the Galway West division will, of course, be fully considered in conjunction with the needs of other <Col N="212" /> divisions throughout the country.  However, the Garda authorities have informed me that at present there are no plans to establish further Garda sub-stations in any area of the Galway district.</P>

      <P>The Children Bill, 1966, which deals primarily with juvenile justice matters, <Col N="213" /> is at present before this House awaiting Committee Stage.  Where children have been found guilty of committing offences, the Bill seeks to involve their parents at every stage of any subsequent proceedings.  In particular, section 67 of the Bill obliges parents to attend court when their child is charged with an offence; section 90 gives the court power to order parents to pay compensation in respect of any offence of which their child has been found guilty and section 91 gives the court power to order parents to enter into a recognisance to exercise proper and adequate control over their child.  However, it would not be feasible, for constitutional reasons, to make parents criminally liable for offences committed by their children.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently engaged in the preparation of draft legislation to deal with the complex issues involved in non-school attendance. Among the issues being considered in this context is the need for mechanisms which ensure that children's attendance is properly monitored and that early warning systems alert the authorities to any emerging problems.  My objective is to bring the heads of the proposed legislation to Government in the autumn.  I hope to be in a position to publish draft legislation before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I recently launched an important new initiative aimed specifically at children in the eight to 15 year age group who have dropped out of school or are at risk of dropping out.  A sum of £2.96 million will be provided over 1998 and 1999 for this initiative which will focus on structured pilot projects in urban and rural areas of disadvantage. The objective is to test models for the development of an integrated area based co-ordination of services to cater for the young people in question.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the outcome of this initiative, coupled with the new legislative provisions which I will be bringing forward, will have a major impact on addressing our current school attendance problems.</P>

    <P>In addition to the special schools referred to above, a range of special classes are provided in the areas to which the Deputy refers.  These special classes cater for a variety of special needs and each class enjoys the same preferential pupil-teacher ratio and special funding levels as apply to special schools for children with similar disabilities.  My Department is prepared to give positive consideration to the establishment of additional special needs facilities where the need for such facilities has been properly established.</P>
