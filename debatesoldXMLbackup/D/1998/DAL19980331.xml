      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>On Saturday morning last I had a telephone conversation with the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair.  We agreed that we must continue to make every effort to ensure we achieve agreement by the 9 April deadline.</P>
      <P>We discussed the murder by the INLA of former RUC officer Cyril Stewart on Friday last. This outrage underlines once again the urgent need to move forward in order to achieve agreement.  Yet we must never lose sight of the terrible grief of the family of Mr. Stewart who, like many families, have suffered a cruel bereavement as a result of this savage attack which I again utterly condemn, as I did publicly yesterday.</P>
      <P>The Prime Minister and I have agreed to keep in close contact.  We will meet later this week.  We both remain fully determined and focused on ensuring that the required progress will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I speak for the House in wishing the Taoiseach well in the work he has to do this week in conjunction with the British Prime Minister and with all the participants in the talks.  He has the support of everybody in Ireland in his work in that regard.  May I ask the Taoiseach, <Col N="418" /> however, if he had any discussions with the talks participants in advance of the public floating by him of the concept of having a Border poll every five years?  How does the Taoiseach see this proposal contributing to the necessary stability to ensure the North-South and internal arrangements work harmoniously in the initial difficult years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his remarks.  The Border poll idea has been around in one form or another for many years and, as I said yesterday, people should not get hung up on this idea.  I was questioned about it and it has been discussed in the talks.  I see these proposals as something that could happen in time.  There would be no point in having people vote if there was no likelihood of change.  Certainly there would be no likelihood of having a poll until the system was bedded down and operational.  It is not a matter of great contention between the parties.  In a context where there were 25 or 26 items on the agenda in the past few days, it is not one that creates difficulty between the UUP and ourselves or any other party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the probable reason it is not creating difficulty is it had not been publicly aired until he raised it yesterday?  What was his purpose in going public yesterday on the idea of a five-yearly Border poll?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been under discussion for some time.  The reason I went public on it yesterday was that I was asked a direct question by a member of a BBC crew who had obviously been placed there, because he asked me about a question that had been discussed at a meeting on Saturday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach on his handling of the negotiations to date. With Deputy Bruton and every other Member, I wish him well in the few days remaining for the successful conclusion of these negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, I understand from press reports that it is not proposed to indicate what these changes will be until every other issue has been agreed specifically in relation to the North-South bodies.  When does the Taoiseach expect to at least let the leaders of the parties of this House have sight of the proposal, because it is not appropriate that we should have to respond to press reports in relation to them, given that every party in this House will be expected to support the outcome of these negotiations?  Will the Taoiseach agree also that one of the key requirements arising out of the negotiations will be an agreement which does not lock the traditions into their respective camps forever, in other words, that the agreement should enable people of different political persuasions and with different views on the constitutional <Col N="419" /> status of Northern Ireland to interact and develop a new approach?</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting there should never be a poll on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, but regular, frequent polls of this type would make people defend their constitutional position on Northern Ireland.  It would undermine one of the basic things we are looking for &mdash; stability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his remarks.  I will brief party leaders as soon as I believe we have a clear understanding.  There are intensive bilateral meetings today and our negotiating team, led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has already had a number of meetings.  It met the Ulster Unionist Party and the Alliance Party as well as the smaller parties, some of which are seeking support for changes to strand one. They have not played a major part in the process to date and must not be excluded by the formulation of strand one.  That is a major issue for the Labour Party, the Ulster Democratic Party, the Progressive Unionist Party and the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition.  I hope to speak to Mr. John Hume, who is in London to meet the British Prime Minister, after Question Time. Senator Mitchell is seeking progress by Thursday so that we can move on, and it will be the weekend before we can see where the process is going.</P>
      <P>We have moved a lot of issues forward. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and even matters that are fairly well resolved sit there until the final parts are agreed.  Strand one is still a difficult area, though not necessarily from our point of view.  The North-South dimension is difficult and the constitutional issues are still not resolved, though these have been teased out extensively and argued about at length.  I will contact the party leaders as soon as I can.</P>
      <P>The Unionists said the poll idea was a good way to proceed.  That was when there was no principle of consent.  It is argued that there should be a poll every so often.  I agree it should not be too often and should not be at the start, otherwise it would take time for matters to settle.  The notion of not having a poll creates difficulties for others, which must also be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputies Bruton and De Rossa in wishing the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and others involved well in a difficult stage in a long process that has lasted through several administrations.  The Taoiseach previously indicated the availability of necessarily confidential briefings for party leaders, which I welcome.  Those will probably be at the end of this week or early next week.  Without being unhelpful, there is a necessity for an early debate in the House before final decisions are taken.  How does the Taoiseach intend the Dáil to debate this process?  Concerns have been expressed, not just about Articles 2 and 3, but about the composition of North-South bodies and the implications for the accountability <Col N="420" /> of the Department of Finance, etc.  Those issues have been spoken about on the margin but not in this House by people who will have to exercise that responsibility in due course.  While I wish the Taoiseach and his colleagues success in reaching an agreement, will he indicate how he envisages all elected Members &mdash; not just the leaders of the main parties &mdash; being involved in a dialogue?  Such participation is essential if we are to get a satisfactory outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly desirable that we should discuss the agreement in the House at an early date, but I have no set plan for that yet.  At this stage I am concentrating on reaching agreement, but I have no difficulty with holding a debate here on it.  In due course, a referendum Bill will come before the House, but I assume Deputy Quinn wants a debate earlier than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that can be arranged. If there is an agreement, parties will want to consult at all levels, but the agreement will have to be completed before holding such discussions. We will have a debate in the House as soon as possible after an agreement is reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I also wish the Taoiseach well in the efforts to reach agreement.  As the original question refers to his recent telephone conversations with the British Prime Minister, is the Taoiseach determined to dispel the growing perception that the process is becoming more bilateral and intergovernmental and losing its multilateral and community dimension?  Will he outline what measures are proposed to dispel that unhealthy, and perhaps even inaccurate, perception?  Will he do everything possible to ensure a Nationalist or Unionist majority rule <i>modus operandi</i> is not enshrined in a solution and that there is room to focus on more consensual decision-making?  I would appreciate being part of the briefing suggested by the Taoiseach for other party leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to understand that the major session of full plenary talks is almost exhausted.  I believe all parties agree we must move into smaller groups to reach agreement.  Members have called for such a move for many months.  However, plenary sessions were held last week.  The level of rancour at full plenary sessions is extraordinary.  Progress can be made at bilateral or trilateral talks and I believe that is what the parties want.  This is not a move from full plenary sessions.  We will hold full plenary sessions when they are necessary.  The parties have examined their position papers and know the areas of compromise or disagreement.  It is necessary, therefore, to work in small groups.  For almost two years Senator Mitchell allowed the big round table process to develop to extraordinary lengths because he felt that was the best way to <Col N="421" /> proceed at that stage and he was proved right. However, he now holds the view that the groups should be narrowed down.</P>
      <P>We will try to ensure that nobody has the authoritative role of domination in any agreement reached and that it is based on consensus and as much partnership as possible.  Many of the issues in strand one which have taken up a great deal of time and are still unresolved relate to how the majority voting position holds.  Clear ground rules to deal with that can be built in if everyone agrees to them and I believe there will be such rules. None of the party leaders, their delegations or advisers, all of whom I have met over the past number of weeks, has suggested anything to me other than that they want an assembly under strand one which will work and which will not be dominated by a bloc of Unionist votes or frustrated by any other combination of votes.</P>
      <P>I am confident the leaders' intent is for a workable assembly.  If strand two works, that is the North-South dimension, not only should there be implementation bodies but elected politicians should also be involved in the process, and the same applies to the east-west dimension.  I stated this yesterday at the meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and in this House on previous occasions.  These are mechanisms which will ensure everyone's voice is heard.  If this did not happen, the agreement would not be worth anything because people would feel isolated and alienated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach the best of luck for the next ten days or so and he knows no one is more sincere in that wish than I. The word &ldquo;historic&rdquo; has been bandied about much, but I believe the decision to be taken in the next ten days or so will be historic no matter how it works, and I am still optimistic about the outcome.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that one of the purposes of the 1973 Northern Ireland Constitution Act, in which the Border poll was introduced, was to take the constitutional issue out of Northern politics, to the extent that was possible, to enable the powersharing executive to get on with its day to day work and the basic job of reconciling the two sections of the community in Northern Ireland without the constitutional issue being constantly present?</P>
      <P>What I call the &ldquo;rabbit&rdquo; theory in Northern Ireland politics, that there will be a solution because one side will eventually outbreed the other, is an extremely dangerous concept.  A greater recipe for instability and continuing trouble could not be imagined.  I know it is not part of the Taoiseach's thinking but will he assure the House that no one need have fears about it and that it is not part of his mindset?  Some people already think in those terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard about that.  We must try to achieve an agreement by which people feel happy with themselves.  They will not feel completely happy as they will object to certain <Col N="422" /> parts of the agreement owing to the fact that they must compromise.  However, it must be an agreement which they can sell to their supporters and which can then be put into operation.  I am glad that in the past few weeks, especially last week, the talks have focused on the fact that we seek workable bodies and structures which can operate and function in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Currie has heard me say before in this House and in conferences and seminars we have attended, it never ceases to amaze me and I have not yet worked out why so many politicians have an absolute fear about working in a political assembly to try to best handle their affairs. Although we do not have an input into strand one, I believe Northern Ireland politicians should take the opposite view to the one they hold about such an assembly because these are matters concerning their constituents and people.  Were that to happen, they would not always be focusing on long-term strategies.  It is very difficult for any of us to influence what happens in the long-term. Most elected representatives can have a shot at trying to influence what happens in the shortterm and the parties should think about that, but it appears many of them do not hold that view.  I hope in the final settlement that we will perhaps have a structure by which they can deal with short-term issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that any measures which may be agreed which tend to institutionalise sectarianism, rather than address its causes, would have serious consequences for the future of the people in Northern Ireland?  Will the Taoiseach agree that representation in the Dáil or Seanad for one section of the community only from Northern Ireland &mdash; as mooted in a newspaper today &mdash; would be counterproductive, divisive and sectarian?  Will the Taoiseach report on his recent meeting with the Women's Coalition?  Will he agree that its proposal of a civic forum, parallel to the political forum, which would be a venue for ordinary people, cross-community organisations and representatives from the suffering communities to come together to trash out their common problems and try to agree solutions would be more constructive than any formal institutionalisation of the divisions that have to be overcome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first concept of representation, if proposed, would not have been exclusive.  If the idea was followed through, it would be open to everybody but it was only a proposal.  The second concept concerns the civic forum of which we have been supportive on the basis that it was not a second parliamentary tier but a genuine forum.  Efforts are being made to convince the other parties of that proposal but we have been supportive of the Women's Coalition proposal on the civic forum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to return to the issue of the poll in relation to the constitutional <Col N="423" /> status of Northern Ireland.  From the point of view of the way in which an agreement will work in the long run, it is important that people are enabled to be cross-communal in their politics.  In addressing the issue of a poll &mdash; I welcome the fact that he has said this should not happen often &mdash; will the Taoiseach agree that the idea of demographics being a trigger for holding a poll would be obnoxious?  This is a nice word for a sectarian head count.  The idea that if a child is baptised a Catholic or a Protestant it defines their politics for the rest of their lives is a nonsense.  We should seek to end that kind of nonsense.  It is contrary to the whole idea of Wolfe Tone republicanism, unlike the style of sectarian republicanism portrayed in various parts of society, North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never put in that form. As I said previously, the idea of sectarianism of that degree would be absurd.  The concept merely comes from the fact that there may be a need for a mechanism in due course to test the state of opinion on constitutional issues.  That is where it comes from, not from demographics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of a poll do I take it that the people of this State will be enabled to say yes or no to such a proposal as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no agreement on that issue.  People have argued that the logic is that if the two parts of the island vote on the first day, the two parts of the island should vote on the second day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach return to a question put to him earlier which he did not answer?  Can he confirm that a proposal to give one section of the community in Northern Ireland seats in an all-Ireland body is not on the agenda in the talks?  I read in the newspapers this morning that there would be special seats in the Seanad for Northern Nationalists. Does the Taoiseach agree this is a sectarian concept?  We are concerned with all the people in Northern Ireland and on this island, whether they are Nationalists or Unionists.  Any proposal which singles out one section in this way would run contrary to the concept of a non-sectarian approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the council published its first annual report and a summary statement on competitiveness earlier this month.  This report and future annual reports, with occasional submissions made to me by the council, will be considered in a co-ordinated manner across Departments with a view to developing proposals for consideration by Government.</P>
      <P>At this time, I do not propose to make changes to the terms of reference of the National Competitiveness Council which are to prepare and submit to me a report on the main challenges facing the enterprise sector over the medium term and the policy responses required to meet them; to examine and monitor policies and actions that impact on the competitiveness of the enterprise sector and prepare reports on priority competitiveness issues, as appropriate, with recommendations required to improve competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The council was established pursuant to Partnership 2000.  Its brief relates to the core concern of Partnership 2000 and the social partners generally to maintain and deepen our competitiveness. It has strategic implications in the short and long-terms for a wide range of public policies and I regard that submitting its reports to me represents the most suitable means of ensuring that the actions of Government collectively advance our competitive objectives.</P>
      <P>However, responsibility for action on foot of the council's recommendations rests with the appropriate Ministers, who have functional responsibility.  Many of the areas concerned are the responsibility of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, under whose aegis, FORFÁS, which provides the secretariat to the council, operates.  I have no plans to change this arrangement.</P>

      <P>Does the Government intend to act on the recommendations contained in the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This is an excellent report. I have had a number of discussions with members of the group on the draft report.  This was out of courtesy rather than to change the report in any way.  The group wishes to discuss the report with me again now that it has been presented.  The council has highlighted the following priority areas on which it wishes the Government to take <Col N="425" /> action: skills, education, tailored policies, EMU, costs, taxation, trade diversification, labour market, innovation, telecommunications, the information society and public administration.  The Government should focus on all these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach said that the Government intends to act on the recommendations, will he agree that the report was particularly scathing about the level of telephone charges?  It made the case that Ireland could not be a leader in the information society if its local telephone charges, which determine the cost of internet access, remain as high as they are. Does the Government intend to implement the council's specific recommendation that the derogation from full competition in voice telephony which exists up to the beginning of the year 2000 would not continue and would be done away with immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report contains hundreds of recommendations.  I assure the Deputy and the House that these issues will be addressed.  The Minister has already met the board of Telecom Éireann regarding the comments in the report on telecommunications.  There are questions in the House this week on some of the issues to which the Deputy referred.  There is concern in the business community, not only about the cost of telecommunications as highlighted in the report, but on many other areas also.  It is an excellent report and we should follow the issues raised in it.  I have discussed it with the Cabinet and asked officials of the Department at senior level to examine its implications.  I hope we will be in a position to act on many of its recommendations, not just one.</P>

      <P>I responded to the general president of SIPTU by conveying my view that any perceived breach of the terms for resumption of work, in which I was personally involved, was a matter for the inquiry team.  The commitment agreed to by all the parties on a resumption of work was that there would be no victimisation by either side and that any breach of this would be reported to the inquiry team.  I understand the inquiry team is considering the matters complained of by SIPTU. I have received a communication from the chief executive of Ryanair reaffirming the company's commitment to co-operate with the inquiry team in discharging its brief, including any alleged breach of the terms for a resumption of work.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach think it is time for Government spokespersons to stop soft-soaping Ryanair and treating its management with kid gloves?  Will he clearly state that the dismissal of three low paid baggage handlers by a Ryanair executive who pocketed a massive bonus of £17 million not so long ago, thereby depriving them of their modest income, amounts to an obscene abuse of working people and an extremely arrogant provocation by Ryanair management?  Does the Taoiseach agree that this action seems to constitute clear notice that Ryanair management has no intention of genuine dialogue with those among its workforce who wish to join a trade union?  Does he agree that it underpins the urgency of introducing trade union recognition legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unhelpful to give a positive answer to the question raised by the Deputy.  To do so would not help Ryanair or SIPTU.  All of us must urge both sides to work together and come to an understanding on the issues dividing them.  It has been a bitter dispute and there are still arguments about what precisely happened.  Ryanair would reject the idea that it sacked or fired people while SIPTU has an alternative view.  It is best for the House to leave what is an industrial relations matter to the inquiry team.  Perhaps later, as indicated by Deputy Quinn, it may be necessary to refer the issue elsewhere.  It is a matter for the inquiry team, which has vast experience, to decide on the best approach.</P>

The matters discussed typically have a bearing on a wide range of policy issues, especially those of a social, economic and political kind.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the timeframe is not long?  There are a large number of Christian churches and there are people who are not of the Christian tradition.  It is important that the commemoration of an event with a specifically Christian origin should have a Christian element, something which is acceptable from every perspective.  What arrangements does the Government intend making or will the issue be allowed drag on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it will not drag on.  Numerous proposals have already been put forward to all Government Departments and agencies concerning proposals for the millennium.  As I said recently, I am anxious that the Government be involved in co-ordinating a limited number of national events, making sure there is activity in the regions and, where appropriate, linking in to other events.  It might be possible in some cases for the Government to fund or partially fund some of those events.  No proposal has been received from any of the churches to the effect proposed by Deputy Bruton although proposals relating to churches from a historical and heritage point of view have been received.  When the Deputy raised this issue in this House some weeks ago, I discussed it with some of the people on the millennium committee.  It is a suggestion which should be put to the churches.</P>

Thousands of events are due to take place but I believe the Government should focus on a small number of national, regional and local ones.  The proposal in regard to the churches is a good one, particularly in view of the historical significance of the millennium.</P>

      <P>On the specific matter of the millennium adjustment which will arise in the year 2000, is the Taoiseach aware that the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, has described this matter as a civil emergency?  Is he aware that Mr. Niall Fitzgerald of Unilever has said that the millennium problem could lead to a world-wide recession?  Is he aware that the Civil Defence in Britain has been asked to draw up plans to deal with emergencies which could arise in regard to the distribution of food, gas and so on?  Does the Taoiseach believe that the British Prime Minister is simply being alarmist or has he had any discussions with him to discuss whether our more laid back approach to this matter is justified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Numerous questions have been tabled on this issue and numerous discussions have taken place.  I have continued to urge the central group working on this issue in the Department of Finance and other Departments and agencies to deal with it.  In the first and second weeks of January I spoke about this issue to all the Government Departments on a one to one basis.  I am not saying we have everything covered, but we are endeavouring to ensure all Departments are dealing with this.  As I told Deputy Quinn recently, I followed this up with the main ones, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  There were some difficulties in two or three other Departments about which I am still not satisfied and we are continuing to follow up on those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a long discussion with Niall Fitzgerald on this issue when he was here a few weeks ago.  He gave me the benefit of his thoughts and why he held his position.  As Deputy Bruton stated, he and others believe this problem will create a world recession in the remaining months.  He did not say that only to make a newspaper headline. I know from speaking to him at length that he <Col N="431" /> believes that to be the case, but I hope he is not correct and I told him that.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of seminars on this issue and perhaps we should have more high profile ones on it.  I talked to the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, about this in a casual way on a few occasions because he is being told by some industrialists and computer companies of the huge difficulties this problem could cause.  All Ministers have been aware of this issue from last summer and have been urged continually to deal with it in the agencies under their remit and in their Departments.  We will continue to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware there can be official complacency about things?  We have seen it with regard to banking supervision and perhaps we may be seeing it now in regard to the millennium problem.  It is very important the Taoiseach does not accept comfortable and comforting answers and that he establishes a unit to second guess the complacent answers he may be getting from various agencies on this matter. Even if such second guessing proved to be unnecessary it would be money well spent.  We should not necessarily accept what the British do as being always right, but if the British are very concerned about this issue, which plainly they are, we should be a little more concerned than we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first time we agree on something.  We often agree on issues and I agree with Deputy Bruton on this.  Since I came into office I have taken this issue seriously because of what some computer experts outside the public service have told me.  The Deputy mentioned bringing in people from outside the public service to work with the central group.  I did that in August or September last year and asked them to examine what was happening in the central group.  I accept people can be complacent.  I read reports, mainly from outside this country, on what might happen in this regard.  When I was in the United States recently I heard people speak of their fears of what might happen.  I dealt with this with the Departments and I will continue to do that because of the major difficulties that may be caused in our payments, receipts and records systems by this event.</P>
      <P>Regarding reporting to this House on this issue, I followed up this issue with the various bodies, groups and the co-ordinating group that was in existence in the Department of Finance.  It has worked actively on this, taken outside advice and worked with consultants and others who have joined it.  There has been a good deal of activity with regard to dealing with this issue.  I hope we have this problem covered, but I will continue to urge for certainty in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of what Deputy Bruton raised and in reply to what the Taoiseach said, I suggest that, rather than having an inquiry <Col N="432" /> around the year 2002 into what went wrong, it might be useful if the Taoiseach, in consultation with the Whips, were to decide the appropriate committee of the House to which senior civil servants could report and to put them on record before us because there is a good deal of IT expertise in the various parliamentary parties. Across the board in a committee format it might be an effective way to satisfy people that, for example, our entire social welfare system will not crash in the year 2000, which effectively would leave people destitute.  That is but one example and the Chair will be aware of others.  On foot of the real concerns expressed by Deputy Bruton and many others, the Whips could consider the most appropriate committee to which senior civil servants could report because if this proves to be a problem in three or four years' time they will ultimately carry the can for it.  We should be fore-warned now as to how this can be dealt with.</P>

Will the Taoiseach agree he should appoint someone from outside the public service as an external auditor of the preparedness of all Governments services for this event who would report directly to him so that he would have someone other than the agencies reporting to him on the preparedness of those agencies?</P>

The Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste report on behalf of that committee.  I am very conscious of the difficulties and concerns in this regard.  I am sure Deputies Bruton and Quinn know as much as I do, but many of the packages in small to medium sized industries and companies allow for the switching of their records quite cheaply.  The difficulties appear to be greater for the medium sized firms.</P>

The change-over seems to be far easier for the SMEs, but the Departments and State agencies are dealing with this and the Tánaiste has responsibility for the private sector in this regard.  I will return to this issue again shortly.  I said at Christmas we would review the mechanism at the end of the first quarter to consider how work has progressed, particularly with regard to the larger areas.  Some of the Departments I mentioned are to report back to me and I will return to this matter again as soon as I have those reports in a few weeks' time.</P>

The specific incidents in question and the underlying causes of all such problems between fishermen operating in the same fishing grounds have a potentially serious safety dimension.  Fishermen must be free to go about their business without unlawful interference.  We cannot and will not accept attempts to harass or intimidate them by people who, it appears, show scant regard for the safety of their fellow fishermen.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the most recent incidents the Naval Service dispatched vessels in response to reports of trouble to investigate what had occurred.  I am advised also that the Naval Service is in the process of collecting statements from the skippers of the vessels concerned and that the information will be passed to the Department of Defence and my Department for assessment and any appropriate action.  I can assure the House that all steps will be taken to ensure that any fishermen who acted recklessly face the full consequences of their actions.</P>
      <P>As soon as we became aware of the alleged incidents and at my instruction, the Department took the matter up at high level with the relevant UK authorities to convey my deep concern and to pass on available information about the vessels allegedly involved.  I also raised the matter in bilateral discussions at the Fisheries Council last week with both the UK and Spanish fisheries Ministers and stressed the need, in everyone's interest, for concerted action to tackle these difficulties.  I urged both Ministers and the European Commission to facilitate and ensure co-operation at all levels to minimise and prevent such incidents.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Defence, who shares my concern. We have agreed that our two Departments, the Naval Service and the Air Corps should liaise closely in reviewing the implications and lessons from recent events and in ensuring the most effective deployment of our services in the task of preventing such incidents and responding to them if they occur again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> In a related development, my Department held a high level meeting with its French counterparts last week in response to a worrying pattern of reported clashes between Irish and French vessels.  Both sides agreed on liaison mechanisms to respond to alleged incidents and to resolve conflicts as they arise.  Most importantly, there was an agreement to work together with both fishing industries on codes of practice for fishermen, which will minimise the risk of future conflicts.</P>
    <P>I also took the opportunity to raise formally at last week's Fisheries Council the need to tackle problems which arise between fishermen from various member states operating on the same fishing grounds with different gear types.  This phenomenon is by no means confined to one or two fisheries but is quite widespread in Europe. Conflict avoidance measures, along the lines which we are pursuing bilaterally, are needed generally and I will continue to be at the forefront in pursuing these measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that discussions are taking place between the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Defence.  It is important that proper procedures are put in place because this is not the first time this type of incident occurred.</P>
      <P>With regard to the discussions between the Minister and the UK and Spanish authorities &mdash; the vessels were registered in the UK for flags of convenience and their names are known &mdash; what type of action does the Minister anticipate will be taken against such vessels in view of what occurred?  The Minister will agree that the action taken by the UK and Spanish authorities will indicate how serious they are about these matters and will, in itself, be a deterrent against such incidents in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The alleged incidents occurred outside Irish territorial waters, which raises questions about the power of the Naval Service to intervene.  This matter will, therefore, be among the central issues to be addressed at the forthcoming meeting between my Department and the other relevant agencies.  When the Naval Service has obtained statements from the skippers concerned, we will consider, in consultation with the Attorney General, what further action can be taken.</P>
      <P>One of the principal difficulties which arose was getting to the site of the incident quickly when the first notification arrived.  The boats were fishing in waters 40 or 50 miles from the coast.  We want to find other measures to deal with this problem.  I have some ideas, which I will discuss with the Naval Service and the Department of Defence, to ensure we can respond quickly to such incidents.  It takes some time for a boat to steam to an area up to 50 miles away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister anticipate any action being taken by the Spanish and UK authorities?  If they do not take action, it will encourage <Col N="435" /> the bully boy tactics adopted by the Spaniards because they have larger, stronger, steel hulled vessels.  It is unfair intimidation.  Similar incidents occurred in the past and I am aware of the action the Minister has taken with regard to the UK and Spanish authorities.</P>
      <P>One of the Minister's objectives, under the Programme for Government, is to secure a long-term ban on flags of convenience.  However, tangible action must be taken by the UK and Spanish authorities to deter these practices.  Otherwise, I fear for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>One practical measure which can be taken is the preparation of a code of practice. There are two aspects to this serious situation. The first is to deal with these incidents urgently when they occur, an aspect about which I am extremely concerned.  The second is to develop codes of practice for fishermen from different countries who are fishing in the same waters and sometimes with different gear.  Conflicts arise in such situations.  That is why I had meetings with the Spanish and British Ministers and with the British authorities.</P>
      <P>In this case, the British authorities are responsible because even though the vessel is Spanish it sails under the UK flag.  That is a problem from their point of view because they must examine how they should exercise their controls in such situations.  We will insist on such controls being exercised.  The British authorities are anxious to be co-operative and helpful and to develop codes of practice.  They are also anxious to act urgently when an incident occurs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Last month I launched the technical report by the Marine Institute into the practical implementation of the quota based salmon management system recommended by the salmon task force.  I used that occasion to set out in detail my policy for the salmon resource, which is designed to bring about incremental strategic change in conservation and management in the interests of the salmon resource and the legitimate interests in that resource.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to moving ahead on our ambitious agenda for salmon, this year and beyond.  My priority is to ensure that salmon and salmon habitats are protected and conserved in the face of a wide variety of threats to their viability.  This priority is set in the context of a comprehensive programme of strategies which aim to deliver on the management, development <Col N="436" /> and information needs of the resource in a cost efficient and effective way.</P>
    <P>I have stressed that progress will require the continued confidence and co-operation of all sides and acknowledgement that the process of change is an incremental one.  The report, which I published last month and which has been circulated widely, is a practical contribution to the work of progressing the next phase of new salmon management strategies.  There are a number of actions under way on this front, along with the process of consultation and feedback on the time-table and resource implications of the quota and tagging regime which are set out in detail in the report.</P>
    <P>Within that framework of action, which includes my review of organisational change in the inland fisheries service, I am currently considering the institutional, legal and funding aspects of the move to a tagging and quota regime and realtime management.  In that context, I will assess the task force recommendation for a national salmon management commission, which would set national quotas with scientific advice, provide a forum for all players to contribute to salmon management and facilitate fishery management plans at catchment level.</P>
    <P>I will bring proposals to Government during the year on a new organisational management framework for fisheries generally, including the proposed commission, the legislative and struc-tural change required and the related financial and human resource implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply, although I am not sure he answered the question I asked.  As chairman of the statutory committee dealing with this matter, with my two Fine Gael colleagues and the Minister of State, Deputy Hugh Byrne, I was privileged to examine that report in great detail over a lengthy period of time.  One of the main recommendations related to the appointment of a commission, as contained in the document to which the Minister referred.  Does the Minister intend to set up a commission to co-ordinate activities relating not only to management but also to tagging?  The Minister answered the other questions I raised on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy heard me but I said I will be assessing the task force recommendations for a national salmon management commission which would set national quotas, give scientific advice and so on.  The role of the commission would be to ensure a co-ordinated approach to salmon management by all the bodies involved.  Some of the elements will have to be progressed before that is done.  The commission will have broad responsibility, including approval of catchment fishery management plans, setting and monitoring national total allowable catch, approval and monitoring of adjustments and to act as a forum for all the players in salmon management.  At present we are trying to develop <Col N="437" /> the other elements so that the commission can be set up.  I am anxious to proceed with that as early as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister sets up the commission, which he indicated he is considering, will he ensure there are representatives not alone from the driftnet sector but from all the activities involved in salmon fishing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>By setting up a specific commission there will be an opportunity for involvement by all the stakeholders and that is my intention.  Various people will be involved representing the central and regional fisheries boards, the Maritime Institute, the Department and all the stakeholders in the salmon resource, without whom the commission would be meaningless.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>the status of the request for compensation for fishermen for the period November 1997 to January 1998.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have advised the House on several occasions that I am open to considering any substantiated case for assistance made by fishing organisations for losses incurred because of bad weather of exceptional severity and duration, in light of Met Éireann weather data and within the parameters of EU legislation.  However, as I explained to Deputies on previous occasions, under EU State aid rules approval for financial assistance to the fishing sector must be obtained from the European Commission.  The Commission has consistently stated that EU funding will not be made available to compensate for bad weather.  The Commission has also affirmed that it opposes national compensation schemes in this regard.</P>
      <P>Analysis of Met Éireann weather data for December 1997 and January and February 1998 shows that while the period in question was windy it was not unusually so.  Those months had considerably less gale days than the same months in 1993-94 and 1994-95.  The average number of gale days recorded on the north and south west coasts was less than the seven year average for November to February.  Given these data, with available data on whitefish landings by the Irish fleet up to the end of February, it would serve no useful purpose at this stage to approach the Commission with weather related compensation proposals.</P>
      <P>I am glad the recent good weather has been very favourable to the fishing industry with landings of quota whitefish and prawns up by more than 20 per cent compared with last year.  This will make up for the difficult weather conditions experienced over Christmas, with every prospect of the fleet catching the full quotas available to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it there will be no weather compensation package for fishermen.  Has the <Col N="438" /> Minister communicated this message to the two fisheries organisations which approached him, the South and South-West Fishermen's Organisation and the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, one of which met him recently?  I am aware of the Minister's response of 17 February which is similar to today's response.  The Minister has completed the analysis, but I take it there will be no weather compensation package for fishermen.  I am aware of the Minister's concerns about the European Union acceding to this request, but it acceded to a £4.5 million package in 1994 which was granted by the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance, at the behest of Deputy David Andrews.  There is a precedent for such a compensation package and the Minister should now say whether a weather compensation package will be granted on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I set up a task force to consider this matter.  The Deputy referred to the south and south-west and herring fishing in the Celtic Sea. There is a major problem in that area which must be addressed and a task force was set up for that purpose with various interests involved, including the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation and the South and South-West Fishermen's Organisation. That report is expected shortly and we plan to base our actions on it.  It will be a comprehensive report which will deal not only with weather data but the market and price aspects as well as other factors that affected fishermen during that period. I am conscious of the overall position.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has weather data. There were very windy days over the Christmas period, during which time there were tragedies, and I am conscious of how bad the weather was at that time.  A broader picture must, however, be taken in terms of the catch, particularly of whitefish, and that is the picture that will be put to the Commission.</P>
      <P>In regard to the position in 1994, the circumstances were different then.  We were taken to the European Court because of our action at that time and it was only at the last minute the case was set aside on the grounds that such circumstances would not arise again.  I set up the task force to reflect the overall problem and the report is expected reasonably soon.</P>

      <P>The herring task force set up by the Minister because of the collapse in herring prices and other factors is due to report on 31 March, which is today, and I do not know whether that timeframe will be met.  Is the Minister saying that he will consider a compensation package taking into account the herring and the weather elements and will he approach the European Union on that basis?  I did not refer to herring in my original question but to the weather. The Minister referred to the herring task force. Will both of these be taken in tandem and will the Minister present proposals to the European Union at that stage?  There may be a possibility of compensation based on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to inform the House of the outcome of last week's Fisheries Council which considered the proposal to ban the use of drift nets in the albacore tuna fishery.  I confirm that I successfully faced down any immediate decision, despite majority support for the ban, and that further negotiations will take place on addressing the consequences for Irish fishermen before any such decision is reached.</P>
      <P>The UK Presidency has set a high priority on getting agreement to a ban on driftnets in the tuna fishery during its term.  It has majority support for the proposal and hoped to push it through last week.  However, since January, and at the Council, I have strongly opposed the proposal on the basis that there is no compelling scientific evidence of significant by-catches of dolphins and other marine mammals in this fishery.  The proposal exceeds international legal requirements.  A strict monitoring and control regime is in place and the Atlantic tuna stock is not under pressure.  I made it clear that the tuna driftnet fishery is a sustainable and profitable fishery of vital economic importance to our south-west communities.  I also made it clear that Irish fishermen have a legitimate stake in this fishery and are entitled to remain active participants.  I urged my colleagues to give proper consideration to the need to address the human consequences of the proposal.</P>
      <P>In the face of strong opposition from me and my French colleague, the Council very sensibly agreed to postpone any final decision to allow sufficient time to address the serious consequences for fishermen.  In the negotiations ahead I will give priority to ensuring an appropriate timeframe for the introduction of any ban and that EU financial support is made available to fund programmes which will allow Irish fishermen to continue their involvement in the tuna fishery.  Discussions on the key components of any settlement will begin with the Commission and the UK Presidency straightaway.</P>
      <P>I have consulted fully with the fishing industry on this issue.  I met the Irish South West Fishermen's Organisation in advance of the Council when we reviewed together the proposal and my strategic approach.  I welcome their support for my stance and will continue to stay in close touch with them on developments between now and June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> It would be unrealistic not to recognise that the majority of member states and the Commission support a ban.  I will maintain my outright opposition to any ban up to the June Council on behalf of the industry but I will also work intensively to maximise and protect their interest in the emerging settlement.  The outcome of last week's Council put me in a position to do this, given that Ministers and the Commissioner fully accepted the need to address in a concrete way the consequences of the decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  He is aware that this is a vital summer fishery for fishermen on the south-west coast, particularly for trawlers which operate from Union Hall, Castletownbere and Dingle.  The Minister must be disappointed that, despite the scientific evidence he produced, his EU colleagues did not support his view that there is no valid reason to ban this fishing.  I am glad the Minister proposes to maintain his approach up to the meeting in June.  However, in the event of the decision not going his way, without the necessary retraining and adaptation of vessels fishermen on the south-west coast will only be able to catch 25 per cent of the stock they currently catch.  This would be very unsatisfactory.  These fishermen have suffered a collapse in herring prices and this would be another blow to them.  In such a situation there would have to be a long lead-in period before the introduction of any change and other forms of compensation would have to be considered for these fishermen</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This fishery is vitally important to fishermen in this area between July and September.  I made the point strongly that while this fishery may not seem important in an overall context it is crucially important during this time of the year.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to have a two year lead-in time, including this year and next year.  I objected strenuously to this proposal and I have no doubt from the discussions that there will be a longer lead-in time.  France and Ireland fought this point strongly at the meeting.</P>
      <P>The conclusions of the Presidency are relevant in this regard.  The President of the Council concluded as follows:</P>
      <P>It is clear that a majority in this Council is concerned about the by-catch problems which exist in the driftnet fishery for tuna and sword fish and envisage that a ban on such fishing is needed, although some delegations (France and Ireland) take a different view.  The Presidency working document would represent a technical basis for such a measure.  (This was the document before the meeting of Ministers.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioner has been very helpful in her statement on compensatory measures.  We <Col N="441" /> note that the Commission is fully prepared to adopt, together with Member States, appropriate flanking measures.  (These are effectively compensatory measures.) The Commission has indicated that 1.  there should be assistance for those wishing to give up fishing and for those wishing to convert to other fishing activities or other methods of fishing [this effectively covers the three possibilities] and 2.  any measures must become effective quickly.</P>
    <P>On conversion to other fishing activities, our argument is that there is already a fishery and our fishermen want to stay involved in it.  This is what we must try to achieve.  The third proposal is that expenditure should be kept within existing funding provisions.  This means existing funding provisions for the fishery sector generally.  We pointed out that we are different from other countries in that we do not have major funding we can shift to this area and, therefore, there will have to be specific provision for us.  This point was accepted.  We will have to see what can be negotiated in this regard.</P>
    <P>The fourth proposal is that compensation should apply only to those who have already participated in the fishery.  This is a reasonable point. We made the point that we are talking about people who have a track record, not people who fished this year or last year.  That is another point for considerable debate.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree we have been pushed off the pitch by the Spanish on this issue?  Will he also agree we are talking about a fishery approximately 250 to 300 miles offshore and that the concern about dolphins and whales is phoney?  Will he further agree that 20 fishing boats and their crews, mostly in west Cork, are being pushed out of the only lucrative part of their business because of this decision?  Is it not correct that because of the decision that appears to be in the offing, the prospects of a cannery onshore is now put out of the reckoning?  Will the Minister agree we should fight this case to the very end and should not go along with the British, who are obviously pushing for a decision during their Presidency, and that it will be a disaster for many fishermen in the south west, and particularly in west Cork, if this decision goes through?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy it is important to fight the issue and that is what I have been doing.  The reality of the politics, however, is that the British Presidency will be followed by the Austrians and then the Germans, and they have made it clear they are in favour of an immediate ban.  They do not see a need for compensation of any kind in that area.  That is the problem we are facing.  It would be preferable if <Col N="442" /> the matter could be resolved in a satisfactory way by the June Council.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned fishermen being pushed out by the Spanish but that is a simplification.  It might suit the Spanish fishermen who fish by other methods&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;such as the long lines or other trawling methods if the Irish fishermen were not in that fishery.  That is why we want to create a situation where Irish fishermen can remain in the fishery and benefit from it.  Obviously the Spanish would be in favour of this ban.  They tend to fish in the warmer waters and they have less difficulty with the question of dolphins, although I am sure they catch dolphins also.  It is from that point of view that the issue arises.  It is no longer acceptable, certainly among the members of the Community, to catch dolphins in nets.  The issue arises from that quarter rather than specifically from the Spanish fishermen.</P>
      <P>In relation to the number of boats mentioned by the Deputy, we had six boats fishing last year but, taking the track record, 20 boats have been involved over the past number of years.</P>

      <P>It is well known that dolphins do not associate with albacore tuna.  They associate with blue fin tuna which is caught in the Pacific Ocean.  There is no basis for the argument put forward by the EU that driftnet fishing of tuna should be banned because dolphins are being caught.  That is not the case.  I have made inquiries into this matter.  Irish fishermen do not catch dolphins in their nets, only tuna fish.</P>

      <P>Partial research and investigation has been done in this area and that was presented at the meeting.  Nevertheless the almost unanimous view of the member states is that there should be a ban on the driftnet.  Already driftnet has been restricted from 7.5 kilometres to 2.5 kilometres.  That affected the economics in a considerable way because anyone using 2.5 kilometre nets will experience difficulty.  That may be one of the reasons the numbers have decreased somewhat in the past number of years.  We are trying to provide alternative measures because we would prefer fishermen to stay in the fishery.  We want funds to be made available to train and equip them in the fishery and to ensure they can sustain it.  There will be separate provision for people who want to get out of this area.</P>

      <Quest>the number of hectares of land planted in the State in 1997 and grant aided by his Department; and if this is in line with the planting target as outlined in the Government approved plan for forestry development.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne) Hugh (Wexford) Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>The area afforested in 1997 and grant aided by my Department was 13,900 hectares.  This includes some 2,500 hectares which was grant aided early in 1998.  This disappointing outturn was due to a number of factors which included competition from other EU funded schemes and farmers postponing their planting decisions in anticipation of the higher grant and premium rates I introduced with the sanction of the EU Commission in October 1997.</P>
      <P>The outturn for 1997 is significantly down on the planting target of 25,000 hectares outlined in the strategic plan for forestry.  However, I expect the level of afforestation to recover significantly in 1998 and thereafter as the increased grants and premium rates take effect.</P>
      <P>The current afforestation estimate for 1998 is 18,000 hectares, rising to 20,000 hectares in 1999 and 25,000 hectares in the year 2000.</P>
      <P>Pre-planting approvals for 18,000 hectares have been issued for the current year and applications for a further 6,000 hectares are being processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that interest in the forestry industry has waned.  Something must be radically wrong with the industry.  Only 11,400 hectares were planted last year or less than 50 per cent of the target it was hoped to achieve.  The Department's policy seems to be &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo; in that it estimates that 18,000 <Col N="444" /> hectares will be planted in 1998, 20,000 hectares in 1999 and 25,000 hectares in the year 2000. Unless planting is accelerated widely, we will not reach that target.  The Minister should examine why it was not attractive.  In 1997 we did not even achieve 50 per cent of the target.  The Department must have some idea of the reason.  Otherwise forestry is drifting like a ship without a rudder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that this ship is not without a rudder and has a very good captain. We intend to win the battle.  I remind the Deputy that during the planting season of l997, his party was in power.  I am not saying that was the reason for the low planting rates, or that it was in anticipation of increased grants or of Fianna Fáil returning to office, but planting was down to 11,400 hectares.  This year pre-planting approvals for 18,000 hectares have issued, and approvals for a further 6,000 hectares are being processed.  That is a clear indication we are winning the battle, and it is mainly because of the new grants, but there is also a strong intent in the Department.</P>
      <P>I have visited four locations and have met numerous farmers who have shown an interest in forestry.  Those meetings were attended by representatives from the forestry service, Teagasc and a very enthusiastic IFA.  If this had been done heretofore, planting levels would not have fallen. We will plant in excess of 18,000 hectares in l998, in excess of 20,000 hectares in l999 and we will achieve our target of 25,000 hectares by the year 2000.</P>

      <P>The Minister laid heavy emphasis on incentives.  He said he hoped to achieve a target of 25,000 hectares under forestry by the year 2000.  How can the Minister be sure that the same commitment will exist with regard to premiums and incentives beyond l999, given that our operation programme finishes in l999?  Our target under the strategic programme is 17 per cent by the year 2009.  How will we achieve that, given that from now on there will be certain disincentives to forestry planting?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the question if I get the opportunity.  I am optimistic because people who were not so keen heretofore are now interested in afforestation.  The level of interest in forestry has increased significantly.  Within the EU there is a strong commitment to forestry.  The programme currently in place will continue, perhaps to a lesser degree, but I am confident that when the Deputy is still asking questions in the <Col N="445" /> year 2000 he will be told that we have achieved the target of 25,000 hectares under forestry.</P>

      <P>Deputy Reynolds has touched on an important point, and I speak as somebody with a different view from his, in that I favour forestry.  It is a question of the culture of forestry. Is the Government fully committed to forestry development?  Does it accept there are criticisms?  How does it propose to overcome those other than by merely dangling pound notes in front of people?  Does the Minister of State accept that there has been a change, in that those who were involved in forestry some years ago thought they were doing something patriotic but there are many people now saying they are despoiling the landscape?  Has the Minister given serious thought to that aspect of forestry from the point of view of the future?  If not, will he undertake to do so and inform us what type of promotional campaign he has in mind to encourage the financial institutions back into forestry development, if that is in fact Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take advantage of the conflict on the other side of the House. However, the view expressed by Opposition Deputies was expressed to me last night where some people were strongly for and some were strongly against afforestation.  There are strong regulations in place.  It is not a question of dangling pound notes in front of anyone as an encouragement to increase afforestation.  Farmers are shrewd business people.  If they see afforestation as a viable alternative, they will go for it.  I am putting afforestation forward as a real option and will continue to do so to achieve what the Government set out to achieve.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has announced his decision to establish a working group which will be chaired by the Department of Finance.  He has invited representatives of the Central Bank, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs to participate.  The Attorney General's office has been asked to assist in the assessment of the legal issues involved.  The group's task will be to investigate the law and practice governing the provision of financial services in Ireland and the impact this has on consumers.  The group will also consider what steps may be needed to increase public understanding of the regulatory systems, including the manner of their implementation.  The Minister for Finance wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank and the Tánaiste on 30 March advising them of the establishment of the group and inviting nominees.

      <P>It is a comment leading to a question.  Is the Taoiseach aware that a spokesperson for the Government indicated last week that the existing legal arrangements were regarded as sufficient.  How has that view changed so quickly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton knows, people were shocked by last week's events.  A number of investigations have been set up, but in the Government's view these would not cover one of the major issues raised last week, which related to the difficulties some State agencies had in reporting matters that had been investigated by them.  The investigations being carried out into National Irish Bank are those conducted by the Central Bank, the Garda Bureau of Fraud, the High Court inspectors and the Arthur Andersen group on behalf of National Irish Bank.  There are also two investigations into the CMI issue being carried out by the Revenue Commissioners and the authorised officer under the Insurance Act that the Minister for State, Deputy Treacy, set up. The office of the Director of Consumer Affairs is also investigating the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that all investigations will deal with National Irish Bank, but other issues were raised and the Minister for Finance has asked the Governor of the Central Bank to undertake, as a matter of urgency, an assessment of the laws relating to the Central Bank's role as regulator of the financial services sector.  This assessment will include the procedures used to give effect to this role with a view to identifying the impact of these on consumers and in particular any gaps in consumer protection that need to be filled.  This area was highlighted by recent events.  There appears <Col N="448" /> to be regulatory control, but how does that fit in with consumers' interests?</P>

      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a short Bill to amend certain sections of the Electoral Act, 1997, relating to the disclosure of donations for political purposes and the regulation of expenditure at elections.  The need for the Bill arises from the experience gained in operating the 1997 Act to date, particularly the legal interpretation applied by the Public Offices Commission to Parts IV and V of the Act.  It is no surprise that difficulties have arisen, as we sail <Col N="455" /> in uncharted waters in so far as the disclosure and expenditure requirements of the 1997 Act are concerned.  Although there was provision for furnishing election expenditure statements up to 1963, the requirements then and the present public scrutiny of all things political are not comparable.  I, for one, do not remember the pre-1963 regime and so far as I know there is only one Member of the House who was a Member when that arrangement relating to the publication of election expenses operated.</P>
    <P>The Government has no problem with the principles of Part IV of the Electoral Act, 1997, which deal with the disclosure of political donations.  I made the same point on Committee Stage of the Bill before the House last year.  This Bill seeks to make the 1997 Act more workable following the initial experience of the reporting arrangements for disclosure of donations and the furnishing of statements of election expenses.  Following consultation between the party Whips, I understand the amendments are acceptable to all the parties with the exception of the Green Party.  Even though the Bill has 18 sections, the substantive changes are contained in six sections.  Most of the other sections contain consequential drafting amendments.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the Electoral Act, 1997, broadly provide for the following: the modification of the definitions of the expressions &ldquo;donation&rdquo; and &ldquo;election expenses&rdquo; as used in Parts IV, V and VI of the Act; clarification that a donation received by an elected representative or a candidate of a political party at an election, which is passed on by that person to the political party, will be regarded as a donation to the party, provided a written acknowledgement is received by the elected representative or candidate from the party; a requirement that a person who makes donations to several members of the same party in the same year must furnish a donation statement to the Public Offices Commission if, when aggregated, the donations for the year exceed the disclosure requirement of £4,000 for a political party &mdash; this will replace the existing requirement on political parties to disclose such multiple donations; a clarification of the position in relation to election expenses incurred by a political party or a candidate at a Dáil general election and by-election and at a Presidential or a European election; the removal of the ceiling on the limit of a candidate's election expenses which his or her party may incur at an election.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will amend section 3 of the 1997 Act, consequent on an amendment in section 6 of the Bill.  Section 3 of the 1997 Act makes provision for the variation of monetary amounts in that Act by order of the Minister.  The amendment includes a reference to the new subsection (1A) in section 24 in the list of sections which have monetary amounts which can be varied by ministerial order, in accordance with changes in the consumer price index.  The monetary amount referred to in section 24(1A) is £4,000, which will <Col N="456" /> be the limit for disclosure by a donor of multiple donations in any year to different members of a political party.</P>
    <P>I will move a further amendment to section 21 of the 1997 Act on Committee Stage concerning the number of votes necessary to be obtained at a Dáil by-election to qualify for reimbursement of a candidate's expenses.  The number of votes to be obtained to qualify for reimbursement of election expenses will be the same proportion as at a general election.</P>
    <P>Section 5 includes the first substantive amendments in the Bill.  It provides for amendments to the definition of &ldquo;donation&rdquo; as used in section 22 of Part IV of the 1997 Act.  The first amendment in paragraph (a) of section 5 provides that benefits derived by a candidate from a service rendered at an election by an individual in the employment of a political party will not be regarded as a donation to the candidate, provided the individual is not in receipt of any extra reward or benefit in kind for the service.  This is in keeping with the general thrust of the 1997 Act that benefits derived by individual candidates, elected representatives or political parties from services or facilities which are publicly funded are not deemed to be a donation or an election expense. If such a provision is not included it would be nearly impossible to apportion the cost of an individual employed at party headquarters among many candidates of the party at an election.  It would involve keeping detailed time sheets.  In my view, the administrative work involved in keeping such detailed records would be out of proportion to the benefits obtained by the individual candidate.</P>
    <P>The amendment in paragraph (c) provides that expenditure by a political party on behalf of its candidates at an election will not be regarded as a donation to the candidates, except in the case of a monetary contribution to a candidate which will be regarded as a donation.  This amendment clarifies a point raised by the Public Offices Commission.  It will avoid the need for double disclosure as such expenditure by a national election agent of a political party on behalf of each of the party's candidates is required to be included in that agent's election expenditure statement.  It also forms part of the candidate's election expenditure limit.  The exclusion of this matter from the definition of a &ldquo;donation&rdquo; will not inhibit disclosure of the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>The section also includes in paragraph (d) an amendment to the 1997 Act which provides that a donation received by a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a representative in the European Parliament or a candidate at a Dáil, Seanad or European election will be regarded as a donation to the person involved unless it is passed on by him or her to the person's political party and a written acknowledgment of the donation is received by the person from the party.  In that case, the donation will be regarded as a donation to the party and it will have to be disclosed by <Col N="457" /> the party if it exceeds £4,000.  Disclosure by the elected representative or candidate is not required in these circumstances.  This amendment will clear up a legal doubt raised by the Public Offices Commission which would require double disclosure even though an individual was merely a channel between the donor and the intended beneficiary, the party.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of section 6 will amend section 24 of the 1997 Act to require a donor who makes donations to several members of the same party in the same year to furnish a donation statement to the Public Offices Commission, if the donations for the year, when aggregated, exceed £4,000.  The disclosure requirement applies to the donations whether the individual donations exceed the disclosure threshold for the individual to whom they were made and fall to be disclosed separately by the individual.  A political party will not be required to disclose such donations covered by the new subsection.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this amendment is to make it unnecessary for political parties, not only the larger parties but also the smaller parties, to introduce elaborate bureaucratic procedures to trace all donations, even very small donations, to every member of the party in order to ascertain if the aggregate of donations from any one source exceeds £4,000 in any year.  I referred to this problem when the 1997 Act was being discussed on Committee Stage last year.  The large bureaucratic exercise required would far outweigh the benefit sought from the present legal requirement.  The amendment will put the onus on an individual who makes multiple donations to the same or different members of a political party in a year, which exceed £4,000 in aggregate, to make a donation statement to the Public Offices Commission.  A Member of the Oireachtas, an MEP or unsuccessful candidate at elections to these institutions will still be required to submit a donation statement for any single donation exceeding £500 or multiple donations from the same source exceeding £500 at an election, or in a year, whichever period applies.  The donation statement by a donor of multiple donations exceeding £4,000 in a year to the members of the same political party will have to include the name of the political party and the individual donees to whom the donations were made.</P>
    <P>I will be moving two amendments to section 6 on Committee Stage.  The main amendment will clarify that if one or more of the multiple donations is made directly to the party as well as to individual members of the party, then such donations will be included in the total of the donations for disclosure purposes.  The other amendment is a consequential drafting amendment.</P>
    <P>Section 6 restates, with an amendment, section 24(1)(b) of the 1997 Act.  It provides an extra month for political parties to furnish donation statements for the period from 15 May to 31 December 1997.  The latest date for furnishing such statements will be 30 April next.  The deadline <Col N="458" /> for submitting donation statements by political parties will revert to 31 March in future years. The extension of time is being provided to allow political parties to take on board the changes included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the insertion of a new section in the 1997 Act to prohibit an elected representative, a candidate of a political party at an election or any other member of a political party from accepting a donation from a donor if he or she knows or has reason to believe that the donor in question will be required to make a donation statement and does not intend to comply with the requirement.  If, notwithstanding the prohibition on the acceptance of such a donation, an elected representative, a candidate of a party at an election or any other member or agent of a party receives a donation, he or she will be required to notify the Public Offices Commission and surrender the donation or its value to the commission. The commission will be required to cause a copy of such a notification to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and to dispose of the donation or its value in such manner as directed by the Minister for Finance.  This prohibition on accepting a donation where the donor is considering not submitting a donation statement is a corollary to the change proposed in section 6.  The section demonstrates that the amendment proposed in section 6 is not made lightly and it is not intended to convey a softening of the Government's attitude to the principle of disclosure of donations for political purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the 1997 Act provides for offences and penalties for non-compliance with the various requirements in Part IV of the 1997 Act.  Section 8 of the Bill provides for an amendment to insert new subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) in section 25 to designate as an offence non-compliance with the disclosure requirement of section 24(1)(a) and with the prohibition on the acceptance of a donation and other requirements of section 24(a) inserted by section 7 of the Bill.  The penalties are the same as the existing penalties in the 1997 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill will clarify that the expression &ldquo;election expenses&rdquo; means all expenditure for electoral purposes incurred on the provision of property, goods or services for use during the period of the election.  In the case of a Dáil general election, this period commences on the date of the dissolution of the Dáil and ends on polling day.  In the case of a Dáil by-election, the period extends from the date of the issue of the writ to polling day and, in the case of a European election, it commences on the date of the polling day order and ends on polling day.</P>
    <P>The amendments to section 31 clarify that all election expenses incurred before the commencement of the relevant period for an election on the provision of property, goods or services for use during the election period will be regarded as election expenses and will have to be accounted for by the relevant election agent.  The reason for these amendments is to assist candidates in an <Col N="459" /> election and the Public Offices Commission in implementing the Act.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion on whether an elected representative's normal constituency work is to be regarded as an election expense. This work was never intended to be regarded as an election expense.  I am glad the Public Offices Commission accepted this in the guidelines issued for the recent by-elections.</P>
    <P>There are four amendments to section 32.  The amendments in paragraphs (a) and (c) are consequential drafting amendments.  The amendment in paragraph (b) removes the ceiling of 50 per cent of the election expenses of a candidate which may be incurred by the candidate's political party with the candidate's agreement.  This will leave it open to the political party and a candidate to agree in writing a division of the candidate's expenditure limit as may be appropriate to the circumstances.  I do not accept an arbitrary upper limit should be set for this purpose.  A rigid limit is not appropriate when one does not know what exactly the expenditure will be.  The removal of the 50 per cent limit will facilitate the candidate and the political party to come to whatever arrangement satisfies both.  No change is being made in the expenditure limits.</P>
    <P>The provisions which provide that expenditure by a political party under sections 32 and 33 of the 1997 Act is deemed to be expenditure by the candidate will be replaced by two new provisions which specify that expenditure by a political party under section 32 in a constituency, other than expenditure by the national agent of the party, will be deemed to be expenditure by the candidate and must be accounted for by the election agent of the candidate.  In other words, if the expenditure by a political party in a constituency is not incurred by the national agent or under his authority, it is the responsibility of the candidate and his or her election agent.</P>
    <P>The amendment in paragraph (d) inserts a new subsection (4) which clarifies that expenditure by a party in a constituency, including expenditure by the national agent, will be deemed to be expenditure by a candidate for the purposes of the reimbursement of the election expenses of the candidate.  This will change the present position that the expenditure of a party in constituencies other than the candidate's constituency could be used by a candidate to claim recoupment of election expenditure.  The new arrangement clarifies that only expenditure in the constituency can be included in the candidate's claim.</P>
    <P>The amendments in section 12 of the Bill are identical to the amendments in section 11 except that they relate to European Parliament elections rather than Dáil elections.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is a transitional provision which provides that a donation statement or a Presidential election donation statement already furnished to the Public Offices Commission or a statement of election expenses to the Public Offices Commission relating to an election held before the <Col N="460" /> coming into operation of the Bill will be deemed to be valid if the statement in question complies with the provisions of the 1997 Act as they now stand or the provisions as amended by the Bill.  I will move amendments on Committee Stage to ensure donation statements for the period between 1 January this year and the date the Bill is enacted are also covered as well as donation statements to be made by unsuccessful candidates in the recent by-elections.</P>
    <P>The amendments proposed in the Bill to the 1997 Act will make the Act more workable for those covered by its provisions and the Public Offices Commission.  I express the appreciation of the Government Chief Whip to the other Whips who discussed over many meetings the conclusions being put before the House.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been under discussion with colleagues on all sides of the House because certain key provisions of the Electoral Act, 1997, introduced by the rainbow coalition Government, have proved inoperable.  My party welcomes the Bill on which there is a degree of consensus and which deals with these administrative difficulties.  The principles underlying the Electoral Act will continue to stand.  It is right, after a period of reflection, that it is being revisited and amended accordingly.  The principles enshrined in the Act are identical to those enshrined in most other modern European countries.</P>
      <P>We have to ensure limits are placed on expenditure and the State funds political parties.  This is essential if we are to create a modern, open democracy where decisions are taken purely in the common good.  If this can be achieved, much of the cynicism which surrounds politics here, as witnessed in the plethora of tribunals which have been established, will be eliminated with the result that more people will become involved in the political system.  I see this Bill as part of a process to reinvigorate politics and to change the perception and image of political parties within the wider community.  It is right that we should implement it.  Members of the House have a duty to help political parties, small and big, as well as Independents at this time as this cynicism is affecting the turnout at elections and the participation of individuals in the political process.  This should never be discouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good that limits are being placed on expenditure as much money is wasted in general and Presidential elections.  Over a three or four week campaign huge costs are incurred.  As we are all aware, there are politicians on all sides of the House who have incurred huge financial losses. We have to move away from such a system once and for all.  An upfront approach is adopted in the Electoral Act.  The Minister has proposed broadening the scope of donations so that those made to elected representatives and passed on to the party will be regarded as donations to the party once a written acknowledgment is received <Col N="461" /> by the elected representative that the sum of money has been forwarded to the party.  It is fair that there be a distinction between moneys and support given to the party and individual donations to candidates.  This brings the legislation up to date and is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Bill amends the previous legislation by excluding services rendered by staff of elected representatives for the purposes of a donation.  It was ludicrous that the work done by staff during a three or four week campaign could be considered part of a donation.  On seeing the implementation of the legislation in the general election and particularly in the by-elections it was realised that this provision could not work.  I commend this amendment contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is now an onus on a donor who gives more than £4,000 to the party to make a declaration to the Public Offices Commission.  Since enactment of the legislation many parties have wasted huge amounts of time going to constituency executive meetings trying to collect the relevant information.  It is correct that the onus should be on the donor as the function of a political party and its headquarters staff is to work in researching and advocating the message of the party.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be making a distinction between the amount spent by a party nationally and in each constituency.  I welcome this as many constituencies have no hand, act or part in what is spent by the party in a national campaign.  The distinction between the national campaign and the campaign in each of the 42 Dáil constituencies is sensible.</P>
    <P>Members were frustrated to learn that, according to the definition of the Public Offices Commission, money spent since 1 January on various activities in our constituencies was to be regarded as election expenses.  People were baffled by this and I do not think officials or the last Government, on inserting this provision, had any understanding that this would be the result.  Colleagues on all sides of the House welcome the provision in the amending legislation.  It is absurd that money spent printing a document about relevant public issues concerning one's work in the Dáil or on a local authority and one's approach to them and subsequently distributing it among constituents can be considered part of election expenditure.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has faced up to this problem in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A politician incurs considerable expense in distributing information among constituents, sponsorship, advertising on a regular basis in order to inform constituents of clinics and one's views on issues and in organising a number of meetings.  If we want a participative democracy we must ensure we listen to people on a more regular basis.  One of the ways of doing this is by organising public meetings, which cost a considerable amount of money.  This should not be part of one's election expenditure and I welcome the manner in which the Bill addresses this issue.  It is correct, however, that items such as literature, <Col N="462" /> posters and the other paraphernalia which accompanies modern elections be considered part of election expenditure in the three or four week period before elections.  I welcome the fact that this is explicit in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution people have a fundamental right to free speech.  However, a ginger group in a constituency which is either for or against a particular candidate could be established.  The candidate might have no control over its campaign or the money it raises.  Such a group could argue for or against a candidate but be outside the candidate's control.  People have a right under the Constitution to express and campaign for their views and raise money to promote them. However, politicians do not seem to have a right under the legislation to respond, as responding to all such views would result in all election funding being used.  Other colleagues have raised this problem with me.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Members and parties have an onerous and important task in reacting to these changes.  Hundreds of volunteers from all parties will have to interpret and implement the Electoral Act and this amending Bill.  A huge task lies ahead for the Minister, his Department and political parties in explaining the implications of the legislation.  There is much confusion in the party system.  We should be up front and open with people.  The Department and the parties have a responsibility to explain the changes to the officers of all political parties.  We owe them such an explanation and it is the right approach to take.  If we pursue the route of openness and transparency we should make no apologies for explaining to people the implications of the legislation.  I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of his Department or the Public Offices Commission producing some form of simple, understandable and readable manual on the issue of donations and expenses for the 42 constituencies.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give us his views on local authority spending.  Such expenditure does not come within the remit of this Bill or the previous legislation.  Is it his intention to limit expenditure in local elections?  What are his views on local authority candidates receiving donations?  It is possible that local elections will, at some time in the future, take place on the same day as general elections.  How will the legislation operate in such a situation?  It is probable that next year the European elections will take place on the same day as the local elections.  None of the candidates in the European elections will be seeking local authority positions&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is simply the latest chapter in an ongoing saga which began in 1993 during discussions between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party on the formation of a Government and a proposed programme.  There were a number of pieces of legislation which we sought to enact during our term of office and to which Fianna Fáil agreed.  One proposal concerned what became the Ethics in Public Office Act and another what became the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>The third element in that trilogy was the Electoral Act.  These Acts had an integrated purpose which was to deal with the erosion of public confidence in the way business was done in the political system.  The concern that a golden circle appeared to have access to some elected representatives was undermining the political system itself and public confidence in it.</P>
      <P>Although I was involved in the original discussions on the Act at the end of 1992 and the beginning of 1993, I had expected the particular set of measures involved to be enacted much earlier than they actually were.  All three pieces of legislation eventually made their way on to the Statute Book, although the journey there was a long and arduous one.</P>
      <P>In preparation for today's debate, I reread some of the Committee Stage debates on the Electoral Act.  There are many volumes of debates on the Act as it was extremely important, quite complex and innovative legislation.  I have to say, with more than a wry smile, that I am gratified the two Government parties have come round to believing that the measure enacted by the previous Oireachtas should remain largely unaltered.  The amendments encapsulated in the Bill before the House today simply seek to tweak some of the provisions of that Act and do not, as Deputy Hayes pointed out, seek to alter in any way the core principles involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I introduced the amended Bill subsequent to the McKenna judgment, the then spokesman for the Progressive Democrats, Michael McDowell, informed the committee that the Bill was so bad it was unamendable and that his party would fight it tooth and nail, word by word and line by line.  Perhaps it is Michael McDowell's absence from the party which has changed the Progressive Democrats perception.  I welcome its conversion to the core principles which we sought to enshrine in last year's Electoral Act.  The then Fianna Fáil spokesman on the environment, the current Minister, promised to largely gut the Act and repeal many of its sections.  He did that repeatedly throughout the debate when he felt certain sections were too <Col N="464" /> onerous or inadequate.  I also welcome the Minister's conversion to the principles involved.</P>
    <P>It was my attitude from the very beginning that this was innovative legislation, that it would cause practical difficulties from which we would learn and that the Bill was not written in stone.  I believed then, as I still do, that the core principles involved were right and that the framework was largely right.  I was aware that there would be practical difficulties and that the Act would have to be revisited at a later stage.  That is what we are doing today.  I welcome the Government parties' conversion to the principles which I and the previous Government sought to enshrine in law.</P>
    <P>By and large, I do not have any difficulty in supporting the amendments before us.  In terms of the Act's core principles, it is extremely important to the Labour Party that these remain untouched and unaffected.  The core principles of the original Act were threefold.  The first concerned the establishment of thresholds on election expenditure in order that people could not buy elections.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and I debated this issue on Committee Stage of the Bill last year and the Minister was then of the view that politics in Ireland was above being bought and that it was contemptible to think anyone could be affected by monetary donations.  Perhaps the outcome of recent tribunals has removed our collective virginal innocence in that regard.  There is no proof to date that any particular actions resulted from election donations but substantial donations were certainly made which were not made public.  We have now moved into an era where the disclosure of substantial donations is required by the public and where anything less than complete disclosure would not be tolerated.  I believe that any attempt to water down that core principle would have been resisted.  Putting a threshold on election expenditure is a valid thing to do.  The practicalities of that were always going to pose difficulties and I have no difficulty in supporting the suggested amendments which clarify the position.</P>
    <P>The disclosure of donations is another important element of the Bill which remains unaffected.  The thresholds for disclosure stand at £4,000 for political parties and £500 for individuals.  I believe those thresholds are about right even though I know the Minister argued for a higher threshold of £10,000 for political parties at one point.  I am glad he is not seeking to revisit those issues now as I think the disclosure thresholds are acceptable as they are.  If the Minister does not recall the £10,000 comment, I can give him the reference.  During a select committee meeting on 26 March 1997, he stated that the disclosure provision would not shut off donations and that in common with other parties Fianna Fáil was seeking funding in the run-up to the election.  He also stated that people were willing to make contributions and though most would <Col N="465" /> accept the £4,000 limit, they would prefer a £10,000 one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood it to be the Minister's view also.  However, it does not matter as he has not sought to change the disclosure limits.  I was involved in discussing the limits with the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, and there was some difficulty in arriving at the £4,000 limit.  I believe that an individual donation of £500 would be regarded by most people as a considerable sum.  I welcome the fact that the limits are now accepted and that we are simply considering mechanisms to make the practical reporting of such donations more effective.</P>
      <P>The final core principle of the Act related to the funding of political parties and the reimbursement of expenditure to candidates.  I know the Minister fundamentally objected to that last year, although I do not know whether he lost the battle on it at Cabinet level.  In any event, the issue is not being revisited in the legislation before us.  I welcome that as I consider it important that everyone should have an opportunity to contest an election and that some portion of election expenses should be met by the State in order to ensure independence from political donations and big business.</P>
      <P>There were a number of other elements in the original Act but I have outlined the three core principles.  One of the other elements concerned the establishment of the Dáil Constituency Commission on a statutory basis.  The Minister also had a number of proposals in regard to that, one of which concerned the removal of the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment and Local Government from it.  I am very glad I resisted that and that it and matters such as interim reporting are not being revisited in the current legislation.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with some of the particulars of the amendments which the Minister is seeking to make to the Electoral Act, 1997.  I welcome the modification of the definitions of the expressions &ldquo;donation&rdquo; and &ldquo;election expenses&rdquo; used in Parts IV, V and VI of the 1997 Act.  I welcome the tighter definitions.  We were all of the view that donations could not be so broad a catchment as to include the work of party officials.  It would be difficult, if not impossible, to apportion the salary of a general secretary of any of our parties, who works full-time in a general election campaign, to any one or all the campaigns and I do not believe that was intended.  It was my view, and I argued on Committee Stage of the Act, that a commonsense view would be taken by the Public Offices Commission to these matters.  Some of its decisions strayed beyond commonsense and this was one of them.  I have no difficulty with the tighter definitions on donations and expenses proposed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding clarification that a donation received by an elected representative when <Col N="466" /> passed on is regarded as a donation to the party, there was some ambiguity in the Act about what constituted a donation to a party if it was conducted through an elected representative.  It seemed clear that a donation to a party representative that is handed on and comes within the £4,000 threshold is a party contribution, but there is ambiguity about that and I welcome the clarity the amendment brings to it.  If someone hands a Deputy £3,000 for the party and it is handed on to the party and receipted appropriately that is a party contribution, but if the Deputy pockets it or uses it for his or her election expenses it is a personal donation under the meaning of the Act. This does not represent a change but a clarification of what was originally intended.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's sensible approach to aggregating donations.  Determining when the £4,000 threshold is breached would require every donation, even every 5p, to be accounted for and aggregated for a year to make sure that no one gave a member more than £4,000.  Reversing the onus and acknowledging it is not possible to ask every member of a party to account for every donation of any amount, whether 20p or £5, to some central body so that there can be a running tally of all donations in head office in case anyone reaches the magic figure of £4,000 during the year is welcome because that would be an impossible and silly task.  It is much better to place the responsibility on the donor and to provide that if he or she contributes more than £4,000 to a political party there must be a disclosure.  The Minister has gone a little far in the linked amendment because it does not make sense to require the receiver of a donation&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Ceann Comhairle's advice on this matter, but since the entire Bill is a Committee Stage amendment of an existing Act it is difficult to talk about it in general terms.  However, I will speak in those terms about the effect of that suggestion even though the Minister's speech dealt with the Bill section by section.  I know the argument the Minister would make if I put forward a proposal requiring the recipient of a donation to second guess if a donor would make a donation statement and if he or she did not make one that the recipient would not take money and that it would be an offence to take the money if the donor did not to make a statement.  That is a little too righteous in its intent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That proposal was not put to me at any stage.  A legal requirement on a recipient to second guess the intent of a donor is extremely <Col N="467" /> difficult and to create an offence if a recipient is wrong in his or her second guessing strikes me as an onerous burden to place on him or her and it would not have much effect in reality.  I make that point in terms of the amendments to the Act.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of our experience of the implications of anything we put into the Electoral Act. We should be as clear and as straight as we can in our drafting.  Anything that requires us to determine the intention of somebody, and if we determine it to be X there will be one course of action or Y there will be another course of action, is subject to difficulties.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on the removal of the ceiling on the limit of a candidate's expenditure which his or her party may incur.  That was included in the first instance because the total envelope of expenditure allowed was the aggregate of the allowable expense of each candidate for a particular party, which sounds very convoluted.  The reason for that was the Supreme Court decided that every candidate must be treated in like fashion so that an Independent and a political party candidate cannot have different thresholds of expenditure.  For that reason the expenditure incurred by a national party in a general election had to be taken from the allowable spend of its individual candidates, and that was fine.  If a party ran 100 candidates in 42 constituencies, it would tell them their allowable spend in a constituency was £20,000 and that it would take £5,000 of that and allow the candidate to spend £15,000 in the constituency so that it could build a national fund for the party of allowable expense from the individual candidates.</P>
      <P>It was put to me at the time that in order to boost the spend of the party it could put forward candidates for the sake of building up the expense in areas where it had no hope of electing a candidate.  It would be invidious of me to mention a constituency where the Labour Party might not get a candidate elected.  There are probably no such constituencies now, but if there were some it would be possible for the Labour Party to nominate two or three candidates, run a very low budget and low key election campaign and keep the election expenditure to build a purse of expenditure so that it could target it at winnable constituencies.  To deal with that we decided a candidate must spend at least 50 per cent of the expenditure in his or her constituency.  I do not see the logic of changing that.  The Minister might revisit that on Committee Stage and explain why that argument to ensure that as far as possible we do not encourage people to put forward candidates for the sole purpose of building a national expenditure for the party does not hold sway today as it did last year.  In deference to the Ceann Comhairle, I will save the other specific comments I want to make on amendments for Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join Deputy Hayes in saying that I appreciate the dialogue the Government engaged in on this Bill.  I clearly stated the Labour Party's position <Col N="468" /> from the outset and the core principles of the Bill which we tortuously manoeuvred through the Oireachtas with great opposition from some of the parties then in Opposition and threats of war from one of them which is now in Government, the Progressive Democrats.  We managed to get a progressive measure enacted.  It was not perfect but these amendments will improve it.  The Minister genuinely engaged in dialogue with the Opposition parties and the amendments before the House are the result of the consensus and common purpose of all parties.</P>
    <P>The Electoral Act and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill impose onerous responsibilities, which did not exist in the past, on candidates, political parties and the political system.  That is difficult but it is the right thing to do.  Some people still do not believe that, but I am convinced of it.  Since the Minister did not attempt to repeal the core principles of the Bill, he too must believe it is right.</P>
    <P>However, it is only a few weeks since the director of elections for Fianna Fáil in the Limerick East constituency, Deputy O'Dea, described the Electoral Act as the worst legislation ever enacted by the Oireachtas.  One can only assume he supports neither the measure enacted last year nor the measure before the House today.  In view of the Minister's stance, it can also be assumed that Deputy O'Dea's position is not indicative of the views of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is likely that the Electoral Act will have to be amended again after further experience of its implementation.  However, over a period of time, we will build a body of law that will be good for the democratic political system and, ultimately, will ensure less cynicism about politics and politicians.  That in itself is an extremely important issue.  I am proud to have been charged with responsibility for piloting the original important legislation through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill fine tunes certain aspects of the Electoral Act which were difficult to implement.  Difficulties arose with regard to the interpretation of some of the requirements of the Electoral Act and amending legislation was required.</P>
      <P>Some of the interpretations, through no fault of the Electoral Commission but because of how the legislation was drafted, tended to the absurd. The idea that expenditure by officers of a political party in the course of carrying out their normal functions would be regarded as declarable expenditure for the purposes of an election appeared to stretch the remit of the Act's provisions.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Hayes and Deputy Howlin, I appreciate the degree of consultation which took place prior to the introduction of this Bill, which I support.  It will render the Electoral Act more workable and will ensure that its provisions will endure into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Government, particularly its largest constituent party, appears <Col N="469" /> to be committed to the implementation of the Electoral Act.  The introduction of the Electoral Bill was strongly resisted by the two Government parties and, following the general election, there were strong mutterings that the new Government might repeal the Act or not implement it.  I am glad there appears to be a commitment on the part of all sides of the House to its implementation.</P>
    <P>The Electoral Act is significant in the context of electoral law and in the functioning of our democracy.  There are two essential principles in the Act.  The first is the imposition of a cap, for the first time, on election expenditure.  Arguments might be made about the level of the cap, how it operates in practice and how it can be distributed between expenditure by individual candidates and by their parties but at least there is a limit on what a candidate or political party can spend in the course of an election.  To some extent, the cap goes some way towards levelling the playing pitch at elections.  The second principle is the requirement to disclose political donations.  Donations of over £500 in the case of individuals and of over £4,000 in the case of political parties must be declared and disclosed.</P>
    <P>The combination of the Electoral Act and the Ethics in Public Office Act, which was also enacted by the last Government, has significantly influenced the change that has occurred in public life and in how it is controlled and made accountable.  We should remind the public repeatedly that the Electoral Act is now the law.  For a long time Ireland had a political culture in which it appeared to be acceptable that political parties or individual candidates could be financed privately and without accountability by sources which were unknown to their electorate and to the public. That is no longer the case.  The law now provides that the funding of political parties and of individual candidates is a matter of public interest and disclosure, and there are rules and regulations to circumscribe that.  I welcome that development, as does the public.  I am also glad that since the Bill before the House does not roll back the core principles of the Electoral Act, it commands support across the House.</P>
    <P>It is worth reflecting on the fact that matters which are currently, and were in the recent past, subject to tribunals of inquiry would not in all probability have required such tribunals if the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Electoral Act had been law at the relevant times.  The issue of contributions to political parties was, for example, examined by the beef tribunal.  Surprisingly, the report of that tribunal appeared to accept some of the evidence given to that tribunal at face value.  The McCracken and Moriarty tribunals deal with payments to elected representatives.  The Flood tribunal is dealing with the relationship between planning and property matters and politics.  It was established following the revelation of a payment to a politician during an election.  None of these tribunals would have been necessary if the Electoral Act and the Ethics in <Col N="470" /> Public Office Act had been in force at the time. We now have an entirely new regime for accountability of political life to the general public and for the disclosure of information in that regard.</P>
    <P>The continual discussion, reportage and commentary on what is known colloquially as payments to politicians has had a very corrosive effect on confidence in public life.  Notwithstanding that matters have been and are being investigated by the various tribunals and that new legislation is in place requiring disclosure, caps on expenditure and so on, there continues to be discussion of payments to politicians as if it were a current practice.  We need to remind ourselves and the public generally that what have become known as payments to politicians were practices that occurred in the past which could not have occurred if the legislation now in place were there at the time; if it were in place they would have had to be disclosed and would be in the public domain in any event.  There would be no requirement on anybody to go to the High Court to profess their right to privacy if there had been legislation which required the disclosure of payments and the placing of a cap on expenditure at election time.  Such legislation is now in place and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>This is electoral law which is confined to changing the way payments are made and the cap on expenditure is operational.  One can get around the cap on expenditure.  While the position is considerably improved from that when there was no cap on expenditure, there is still considerable potential for unevenness in the way in which elections are conducted and expenditure is made on elections.  Deputy Howlin gave examples of how the legislation might be got around.  There is another way, for example where a large political party might, in a five seat constituency where normally two or three candidates are selected, select four candidates, thereby entitling it to expenditure of £80,000 in that campaign.  That would be considerable outweighing of the cap that might be placed on the unfortunate single candidate from a much smaller political party who might in any event end up spending only half the amount that is entitled to be spent under the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unlikely it would happen in a civilised constituency such as Dún Laoghaire, not least because of the well-known views of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the selection of additional candidates.  We must be conscious of this matter.  While the Bill addresses difficulties that arose in the implementation of the legislation &mdash; because this is an entirely new regime in our electoral system it was not unexpected that there should be teething difficulties with its implementation &mdash; as the years go by it may be necessary to revisit other aspects of the legislation. <Col N="471" />  If, for example, loopholes arise or ways are found to circumvent the intent and the fairness of the legislation, that may have to be considered again.</P>
      <P>Since we are dealing with electoral legislation, consideration should be given by the Government and legislation should be introduced to modernise our electoral system in other aspects. For example, the question of when voting takes place must be considered and legislation introduced on it.  The holding of elections on Thursday, or if the Government thinks it will be to its advantage, on Wednesday, must be changed.  The practice of weekend voting which has been tried successfully in other countries should be introduced here.</P>
      <P>There is no golden rule that an election should be conducted in a single day.  Given the flexibility required of many people in the workplace and the requirement to be away from home and mobile, arrangements will have to be made in our electoral system to allow for that.  We should consider the question of where people vote.  We have adopted a traditional approach to polling stations. In other countries different approaches are being tried.  With the use of new technologies in particular it should be possible to adopt a more flexible approach to where people cast their votes so that opportunities are increased for people to participate in elections, the decline in which is a cause of considerable concern.</P>
      <P>Given the Ceann Comhairle's admonition to Deputy Howlin, I will not go into the detail of the Bill.  I look forward to commenting on specific sections on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important at the outset of this debate to ask a simple and pertinent question: why are we rushing through this legislation? Deputy Howlin said that we made mistakes in the past, that we need to get it right this time and that perhaps we will revisit this legislation at a future date.  The Chief Whip never ceases to remind us that this is not a legislation factory, yet today the legislative conveyor belt is at full tilt on this issue and I would ask the reason.  Substantial changes are being made, despite what Deputy Hayes and Deputy Howlin claim.  The spin doctors have been at work on this issue.  It has appeared in the papers and the media have swallowed hook, line and sinker that the Public Offices Commission recommended those changes.  If one picks up the phone and rings that commission to see if it recommended the changes one will find it did not.  It was asked for its advice on how the legislation could become more operable and it offered that advice, but it did not recommend the changes.  It has been stated that there is consensus on this issue, but having attended Whips' meetings I wrote a letter to the Chief Whip outlining my position that I do not agree with some of the changes proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real reason this legislation is going through is that the establishment parties got a fright after <Col N="472" /> the general election.  They discovered they had created a monster, that the Public Offices Commission assiduously and enthusiastically applied the law.  It interpreted the spirit of the legislation and stuck by the letter of the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the Whips' meeting and I am aware of the background to this.  People discovered &mdash; Deputy Hayes referred to this &mdash; that the bell was rung from the beginning and that between elections the money would add up and be counted as election spending.  This came as a shock to many Deputies and it is one of the reasons so many of them got up on their high horses.  The Public Offices Commission did not over-interpret the legislation.  Rather it was zealous and carried out its duties in the correct manner.  However, this sent a shudder up the spine of many in the establishment parties.  It wanted parties to account for all donations.  This is something of a headache but it is also potentially embarrassing.  I commend the Labour Party for introducing the legislation.  I have highest respect for Eithne Fitzgerald&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Howlin referred to the trilogy of legislation.  He carried out his duty remarkably well and I do not want to take away from him, but the notion of transparency was introduced in the wake of the beef tribunal. Deputy Howlin referred to the McKenna judgment.  The aim of the legislation was to enhance democracy by improving transparency and levelling the playing field.  It succeeded in doing this.  By placing a cap on spending, small parties could compete with the bigger guns.</P>
      <P>We must avoid the Americanisation of our political system.  We have seen that money can buy votes.  As Ed Rollins, a political consultant in the United States says, one can fool all of the people all of the time if one's advertising budget is big enough.  That is the way American politics operates, and it is the way Irish politics can operate. There is too much of the spin doctor in our politics.  We see too much of the gloss and not enough substance.  There is also too much sound bite.  I do not want our politics to go in that direction. On 5 February I asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business if the Government intended to remove the more unpalatable aspects of the Electoral Act.  He said this was not the case and that there was all-party agreement on the changes recommended.  However, there was no such agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the specific problems I have with the legislation, I draw attention to section 5 which will fundamentally change the definition of &ldquo;donation&rdquo;.  Under this provision the fleets of cars which ferry people from hospitals, mental institutions, etc. to polling stations on election <Col N="473" /> day will no longer be described as a donation. This practice should be regarded as a donation. Expenditure by a party on behalf of its candidates will no longer be regarded as a donation.  This is a very significant change, particularly when taken in conjunction with the other provision in section 5 which states that a donation to an individual will be considered a donation to the party if the individual gives it to the party and gets a receipt. The Minister should think through the consequences of this provision.  A candidate who receives £3,000 from a local developer will hand the money to the party but will ask it to print some leaflets for him.  Is this possible under the legislation?  If the party prints the leaflets the donation does not have to be declared by the individual.  A donation of £3,000 could be potentially very embarrassing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if this is possible?  If it is possible to do this, we are, in effect, legitimising political money laundering. When we do something in great haste we open up avenues people can use to get around things they should not be able to get around.  The Minister must look again at this provision, particularly as regards developers.  Reference was made to tribunals, for example, the Flood tribunal.  People are extremely cynical about donations given to politicians.  In my constituency developers give money to politicians, and the example I gave is a way of getting around this provision.</P>
      <P>Section 6 effectively does away with section 24 of the 1997 Act.  Under the existing legislation a party must account for the money given to different candidates.  This causes problems for parties, particularly the larger ones, but it is a good provision.  If an individual is given £500 he does not have to declare it but if the amount exceeds an aggregate of £4,000 the party must declare it. Under the Bill it will be a matter for the donor to declare the money.  This section is inoperable and section 24 of the 1997 Act should be retained.</P>
      <P>Section 10, which deals with when an election begins, has caused most problems for bigger parties.  When we issue leaflets in our constituencies between elections we are effectively electioneering.  We are effectively saying to the electorate that we did all these things and they should vote for us at the next election.  Regardless of whether we like it, it is election spending.  The Bill states that the election begins on the day it is declared, while the caps on spending will remain at £20,000 and £17,000.  Consideration must given to putting a cap on spending between elections.  People are already working out how they will get around this.  Parties will start campaigning between elections and issuing literature which may not contain the word &ldquo;election&rdquo; but which will help people to get elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to protest that the Bill is being forced through with unseemly haste.  I note the points made by various Government speakers and those of the larger Opposition parties about extensive discussions in the Whip's office.  However, the Whip's office is not Dáil Éireann which is the elected assembly of the people and that is where the details of the Bill should be teased out because they are complex. It is unreasonable to circulate a Bill on a Friday and have it disposed of on the following Tuesday when one considers the pressure of work on Members.</P>
      <P>The disclosure of donations received by political parties and candidates was made essential by the anger and concern that existed in society because big business and wealthy elements in society effectively could bankroll political parties and undoubtedly gain favours as a result, all of which was done with the utmost secrecy.  It militates totally against even the most basic concept of democracy that those elected should be responsible to the people who elected them and not to secret cartels of big business or super wealthy individuals who because of sizeable political donations were then able to get policies that were favourable to them enacted by the Government of the day made up of parties to which they subscribed financially as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major scandal of the past five or six years was the tax amnesty introduced by the Fianna Fáil/Labour Government which gave between £500 million and £1 billion to the wealthiest tax dodgers in the land.  Their names are secret and neither is it known whether any of them made substantial donations to the political parties which voted in the amnesty.  That is unacceptable and even now the Government insists on not declaring whether any party received donations from tax amnesty beneficiaries.  That must change and the new Act goes some way towards that as it introduces transparency in the form of the declaration <Col N="475" /> of sums over £500 for individuals and over £4,000 for a political party.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a serious watering down of some of the Act in regard to this matter.  The question of a donation not being considered a donation to an individual if passed on to the political party paves the way for widespread abuse in regard to candidates being able essentially to cover up the extent of donations received and from whom.  If a candidate receives a donation of £3,500 and passes it on to the party, what does the &ldquo;party&rdquo; mean?  If it is passed on, for example, to the constituency executive or the party head office, is that considered to be the &ldquo;party&rdquo; under the Bill?  We could have a situation where £3,500 is passed on and then given back in expenses by the party for the benefit of the election of an individual and it does not have to be declared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will seek clarification on that issue on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister might as well have excluded the section putting the onus on the donor where he or she aggregates donations of £4,000 or over. There is no mechanism to check whether such an aggregate comes to be reached by a single donor and to have a safeguard whereby if the candidate knows the donor is giving money to other people which amounts to £4,000 or over, there is a temptation to turn a blind eye.  It is unenforceable and should not be agreed.</P>
      <P>The Act states the Minister may make regulations governing local elections but the only limit that applies for disclosure by a councillor or local authority member is the £4,000 one.  Will the Minister clarify this?  Does section 5 mean a return to the situation where developers and builders can make fleets of trucks and their employees available to certain developer friendly political parties represented in the House?  There have been instances where pick-up trucks and vans owned by developers and builders travelled around various constituencies assiduously working for individual candidates of right wing parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the timeframe for incurring election expenses which will qualify as expenses and the limit on expenditure.  Running the expenses from the time of the movement of writs or the calling of a general election makes a mockery of setting expenditure limits, especially on major parties.  I agree the timescale which could be five years if it was between elections is unreasonable but I propose three months which is lenient.  However, the Minister's proposal is a carte blanche, particularly for the Government parties, to shift expenditure ahead of the date on which they know an election will be called or a <Col N="476" /> writ moved so that what is spent does not come within the election limit.  It is open to abuse.  Will the Minister reconsider that?</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  Most parties, with the exception of the Green Party, support the Bill.  I want to deal with some of the interesting points made by various speakers.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes raised a point in relation to the disclosure of donations at local elections.  He referred to the fact that regulations had not been made concerning election expenses for local elections or the disclosure of the donations by local authority members or candidates in local elections.  The Deputy is right but provision is made in the Electoral Act, 1997, enabling the Minister to make regulations in relation to these matters. The regulations will require the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  My intention is that the arrangements generally will correspond to those relating to Dáil elections contained in the Electoral Act, 1997, and this amendment to it.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that under the 1997 Act, for the purposes of disclosures of donations by a political party, a donation made to any candidate in a Dáil, Seanad, European or local election, or any officer, member or agent of the party, will be deemed to have been made to the party and will, therefore, be subject to the disclosure requirement in so far as the party is concerned.  If a local authority member receives money, he or she is regarded as a member of the party or as the party and would have the same disclosure requirements.  I will consider the whole area of donations and disclosure prior to the local elections.  Everybody will be aware of the provisions well in advance of those elections so that there will not be any misunderstanding in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin will remember our long discussion on Committee Stage about trying to clarify some of the points that arose.  Despite what Deputy Howlin says now, I pointed out at that time the areas of the Bill that would not be workable.  I have no doubt, as Deputies Howlin, Gilmore and Hayes acknowledged, that we will revisit this matter at some stage because of interpretations that may be taken by the Public Offices Commission.  That is not a criticism of the Public Offices Commission.  It must interpret the law as it stands regardless of what we say in this House.  This is uncharted territory and I have no doubt other areas will need to be examined at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to that point and the point Deputy Hayes made about the local elections, we will try to have some clear guidelines drawn up, perhaps in booklet form, not just for ourselves but for local authority members so that there will not be any ambiguity about the matter.  Obviously that is a matter for the Public Offices Commission but I will clearly signal the wishes of the House that <Col N="477" /> this matter be dealt with well in advance of the local elections.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Hayes's point about ginger groups &mdash; this was also referred to by Deputy Gormley &mdash; and the spending of money at elections by third parties, the system for the limitation of election expenses relates essentially to expenditure incurred by or on behalf of the candidates.  It is possible that persons not directly involved in the election may seek to involve themselves or influence the outcome and, for this purpose, they incur expenditure.  Such persons might also decide to incur expenditure with a view to promoting or perhaps opposing a particular outcome.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that it would be unconstitutional, inappropriate and probably contrary to the freedom of expression to prohibit advertising by third parties but in the interests of openness &mdash; we anticipated this on Committee Stage &mdash; and to enable people form their own judgment there is a requirement on any person who decides to do that to register with the Public Offices Commission if they intend to try to influence the outcome of an election.  The public can, therefore, make up its own mind about that group.  In the original Bill there was a ban on anybody taking out an advertisement or attempting to influence the outcome of an election.  That cannot be done unless they are registered with the Public Offices Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin raised a number of general points but one in particular related to the amendment under section 7.  I fully accept what the Deputy said but my information is that in regard to the previous amendment &mdash; the two are linked &mdash; concern was expressed by some people that this would be used as a device to get donations of £15,000, £20,000, £25,000 or more in that the party, an individual or a number of people in the party might ask someone for, say, £3,900 for the party and another amount for someone else.  This was the best we could do to implement the wishes of Members.  Even if it is difficult to operate, it is better to include that amendment so that there will be some provision by which that practice could be outlawed rather than totally removed. This is one of the areas we will revisit in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that point.  I am not sure what party proposed this kind of safeguard but it was insisted on and it was the best we could do in drafting an amendment to ensure people would not knowingly try to circumvent the law as it stands.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that many Deputies made the same points but I want to single out one for a reason.  Operating the expenditure limits from 1 January 1998, as the Public Offices Commission clearly intended, would cause horrendous difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> I have no doubt that if that were to remain we would have a constitutional action and the Bill, or at least this section of it, would be struck down. It is all very well to say that people who have money can promote themselves between elections by sending out leaflets, flyers, etc.  We are approaching a stage where all in this House are equal, with the exception of those who have outside interests, so it is not a reasonable argument to say that some people have an advantage if they spend money between elections to promote their clinics.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I cited the Conservative Party Manual which warned that difficulties could arise, that advertising a clinic could be regarded as Government expenditure.  If that line were taken, it would be unworkable, and that is accepted by the Public Offices Commission. There would also be a glaring inequality in that Members of this House who wanted to inform their electorate would have spent all their money and would be at a disadvantage beside other people from outside, from within their own parties or from other parties who would have a brand new limit.  Clearly it would not be workable.</P>
    <P>The compromise here makes it clear that expenditure incurred before setting an election date that is used for the campaign is covered, as is all expenditure from the date the writ is moved, so there cannot be a question of huge expenditure on an election campaign three or four months before an election putting somebody at a disadvantage.  Deputy Higgins said that the current situation may favour the Government.  A three months ban on expenditure would favour the Government even more if it knew when an election would be held.  The provision here is fair to everybody because everybody has the same starting point.  Let us suppose I decided to produce a full colour leaflet in my constituency stating what a wonderful job we had done over the previous 12 months &mdash; clearly election material &mdash; and an election was called the following day, I would have no election expenditure at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is ten years since the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Gerry Collins, changed the drinking regulations substantially.  In retrospect, those relatively modest changes, which were designed to meet the transformation taking place in Irish society, worked well.  They did not lead to widespread drunkenness, nor did they exacerbate the problems associated with excessive drinking. Time has moved on and society continues to evolve, its needs altering in the last decade.  The composition of the workforce has changed, as have patterns of work.  Thousands of young people want to drink at their convenience and in the manner to which other young Europeans are accustomed.  The time is ripe to update the licensing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill seeks to meet that challenge by updating and modernising the present licensing laws, which are obsolete.  This Bill proposes a relatively modest increase in opening hours, coupled with the abolition of the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo;.  In addition, the Bill seeks to regularise some anomalies in the licensing laws in relation to clubs, public houses and off-licences.  Over the years, bar workers have expressed concern about the hours they are expected to work.  These concerns are addressed comprehensively by the Bill, which is based on the fundamental principle that the consumers' concerns should be met in the widest ranging and most comprehensive way possible, while protecting the legitimate rights of those who work in the industry.  The Bill is based on the concepts of <Col N="480" /> partnership, choice and freedom.  The consumer should be given more choice, while those working in the industry should have the freedom to opt out of extra unsocial working hours if they so wish.  Alternatively, the Bill ensures that if they work late into the night they should be rewarded adequately for doing so.</P>
    <P>Ireland has developed at an unprecedented rate over the past decade.  Consumers want increased options for their leisure time and this Bill ensures that they can exercise their wish to drink for a longer time if they so desire.  Large numbers of people find opening hours particularly restrictive at weekends and this leads to an inordinate amount of after hours drinking, which is very unsatisfactory.  If the law cannot be enforced, which I believe to be the case, it is important that it be changed so that it can be enforced and respected.  There is an outcry in four western counties which provides a clear example of how this law has been disregarded.</P>
    <P>I understand the frustration of the drinking public, but I also sympathise with publicans, who are torn between an anxiety to satisfy their customers and an anxiety to act within the law.  That frustration is made all the more acute by virtue of the heavy penalties that can be attached to breaches of the licensing laws by publicans.  There can be no quibble with the Garda in their enforcement of the law.  They must do so in a manner compatible with the other demands on their time and resources.  However, in the dying days of the 20th century, it seems bizarre that the Garda find themselves imposing sanctions on adults consuming alcoholic drink.  Keeping this law on the Statute Book reflects poorly on our self-confidence and maturity as a nation.  It is time to treat the public as mature adults capable of looking after their own affairs without having the State poking its nose into their private matters.</P>
    <P>The level of consumption of drink in Ireland is average by international standards for modern developed economies.  The most recent EU data shows that the Irish consumption level is clearly in the middle of the 15 EU countries.  It is the eighth highest or eighth lowest, depending on the end of the table one counts from.  When the comparison is broadened to OECD countries, Ireland figures in the second half of a table of 21 countries.  Consumption here is less than in Australia, New Zealand, Hungary and the Czech Republic and is only marginally higher than that of South Africa, the United States of America, Japan and Poland.  Those who oppose drink claim this figure is too low because it does not take the large number of Irish teetotallers into account.  That claim is incorrect.  The number of adult teetotallers, at 24 per cent, is almost identical to the average for 21 developed countries.</P>
    <P>Those who claim that the Irish are a nation of drunkards who will drink themselves to destruction if the State does not interfere seem to be harking back to the images published by <i>Punch</i> magazine at the turn of the century.  This magazine portrayed the Irish as a nation of gormless <Col N="481" /> drunken imbeciles unable to control their drinking habits.  That was never true and the data available to disprove it have proved solid over a long period.</P>
    <P>There has been significant liberalisation of licensing laws in two countries which are similar to Ireland, New Zealand and Scotland.  They have liberalised their laws without any significant damage to their populations.  That liberalisation is believed to have been particularly beneficial in Scotland, where drunkenness seems to be less common.  Antisocial behaviour on the part of those leaving public houses has declined and liberalisation appears to have had a civilising effect on the population.</P>
    <P>Although this Bill's proposals differ from the changes made in Scotland, there are parallels between the two situations.  This Bill approximates to the Scottish provisions and the extra time provided for drinking will allow the public to adopt a more civilised approach to drinking. It will help to eliminate stockpiling of drink by customers as closing time approaches and to eliminate the dumping of large numbers of people on the street by bar staff at closing time.  It is easy to understand why bar staff take this approach. They are worried that they may be found guilty of breaking the law and about the consequences for their employers.</P>
    <P>There can hardly be any doubt there are significant differences in the demand for drink in different parts of the country, and in the same parts of the country at different times of the year.  It is obvious that areas which cater almost exclusively for the tourism industry have radically different needs from the areas where the tourism industry is of no great significance.  To some extent, existing legislation seeks to cater for these differences although in a somewhat convoluted manner.  For example, an extra half hour is allowed for drinking in the summer.  The law also caters for events by providing for a degree of flexibility in granting extensions when festivals and other important local events take place.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to rationalise the present practice by allowing the courts to vary the time of closing in different areas in accord with the needs of the locality.  The proposals provide for the courts to extend or restrict the hours of opening in accordance with local needs.  The Bill provides explicitly for the courts to be able to modify the hours of opening in accordance with the needs of the tourism industry and in relation to the special needs of areas which have a booming night life, such as the Temple Bar area of Dublin.  It also allows the courts to take into account the type of customers which frequent a public house as well as the type of area in which the public house is located.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifically provides for residents in a residential area to petition the courts to restrict the hours of opening in the event of customers behaving in a manner which constitutes a significant nuisance for the neighbourhood.  This is a new provision, which allows resident groups, who <Col N="482" /> feel their lives are being made miserable by noise or nuisance, to have their concerns remedied.  I hope it will meet the concerns of resident groups who are currently being exposed to unacceptable harassment arising from the manner in which some people behave on exit from public houses.</P>
    <P>A feature of the Irish licensing laws is the provisions which exist for granting exemptions. These provisions and what happens in reality is a convincing argument in favour of the need to modify the existing laws.  These provisions clearly undermine any principled objection to the extension of the present licensing laws.  In the year ending 31 July 1997 a staggering 65,096 licensing extensions were sought in the courts.  Statistics are not available to enable one to say how many of these applications were granted.  However, it seems reasonable to conclude a significant number were acceded to.</P>
    <P>If one works from the assumption that last year's figures are a reasonable representation of what has been happening over the past decade, approximately half a million exemptions to the existing law were sought since the law was last altered.  By any standards this is an exceptional phenomenon.  It is difficult to envisage any other law which needs to have so many exemptions applied to it.  This experience is one of the clearest arguments in support of the proposition before the House.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry is a major source of income and employment and has huge potential for further growth.  While there is no clear evidence that tourists come to Ireland specifically to drink, there can be little doubt those who come like to sample the atmosphere of the Irish public house.  For many tourists familiar with liberal opening hours, especially those from North America and mainland Europe, the experience of being thrown out of the pub at closing time is amazing.</P>
    <P>Many of these tourists are acquainted with the phenomenon of the Irish pub in their own country.  There are many differences in the nature of the Irish pub overseas and in Ireland.  However, one of the more unpleasant differences for holiday makers is the manner in which the law requires the pubs here to close very early in the middle of summer, at the peak of the tourist season.  For many publicans in tourist areas the short few weeks while the tourists are around is their chance to make enough money to tide them over the rest of the year when the local trade is slow. It seems reasonable that this group should have the option of making hay while the sun shines and allowed to trade into the night while a demand exists.</P>
    <P>The holy hour must be a unique and strange phenomenon for visitors to Ireland.  It must be puzzling for tourists from countries in mainland Europe where there is a culture of having a long lunch washed down by an appropriate amount of alcoholic drink.  I am sure they question what type of country they are visiting.  In the past it was deemed necessary to have a holy hour in Dublin <Col N="483" /> and Cork to ensure those who went to pubs at lunch time did not remain there for the rest of the day.  That law was changed by Gerry Collins when he was Minister.  It has been suggested that the holy hour was designed with civil servants in mind.  I presume this stemmed from the Myles na gCopaleen era when it is claimed people went to pubs at lunch time and the country ground to a halt in the afternoon as they wrote worthwhile essays.  There has been no significant problem in this regard since the law was changed.  I believe the holy hour on Sundays will also be abolished.</P>
    <P>A large section of the public like to go to pubs for their lunch on Sundays.  Many pubs give very good value in the quality of food they provide at a cost within the budget of most of the public. There is no reason the public should not be allowed to consume their lunch in peace without having to watch the clock.  For many, Sunday lunch is the only time in the week when they get the chance to relax.  For many families it is the only time in the week when they can relax together and they should be allowed do so in a public house if they wish.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that opening time on Sundays should be the same as during the rest of the week.  This provision would allow those who wish to have a drink on Sunday morning to do so.  The 12.30 p.m. opening on Sunday may have its genesis in a fear that having pubs open on Sunday morning would prevent the public from going to church services.  This concern is no longer relevant for a variety of reasons.  Many church services now take place on Saturday evenings.  It is difficult to believe it was ever relevant and the Bill seeks to end it.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with anomalies in the law in relation to opening hours for public houses and registered clubs.  It proposes to put both on the same footing as far as opening hours are concerned.  There is currently some doubt about whether the law allows for drinking up time in clubs.  In the definitive book on the Irish licensing laws by Constance Cassidy, the author alludes to this possibility, even if she does not make a definitive statement on the exact legal position. That would be an interesting case to test in the courts.  However, the provision that clubs can open for a limited period on Christmas day for members has not been altered.  The underlying principle behind this Bill, that where possible the choice open to the public should be maintained and expanded, underpins the decision not to change the current provisions in relation to clubs, except that they should have the same drinking up time as public houses.</P>
    <P>There are some differences between the law as it relates to the sale of goods other than alcoholic drink in public houses and off-licences.  Public houses are allowed to open at 7.30 a.m. for the sale of products other than alcoholic drink, while off-licences can only open for the sale of such products at 9 a.m. This anomaly should be cleared up and the Bill removes it to permit both off-licences <Col N="484" /> and public houses to open at 7.30 a.m. However, no changes are made in the time at which the two outlets are allowed to commence selling alcohol in the morning, which remains at 10.30 am.  The anomaly whereby off-licences are prevented from opening till 9 a.m. is a source of considerable annoyance to those who live near these premises.  Many people would like to avail of the services of off-licences in terms of the nonalcoholic products which many of them sell.  It seems unreasonable they should be prevented from opening until 9 a.m.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that St. Patrick's Day and Good Friday should be treated as any other day of the week and that there should be no special provisions applicable to these days.  At present St. Patrick's Day is treated as a Sunday under the law.  A central principle of this Bill is that the law should be streamlined and be as simple as possible.  Accordingly I see no reason special provisions should apply to St. Patrick's Day.  In any case the Bill treats it as similar to a Sunday.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 to 30 years there have been significant changes in the way the public behaves on Good Friday, 30 years ago Good Friday was treated in an exceptionally solemn manner and the country virtually closed down.  Commerce more or less came to a halt.  The national radio station closed down.  Little happened except religious services or essential services.  In the intervening period there have been many changes in the manner in which the public behaves on Good Friday.  It is still a very significant day in the religious life of many people.  However, for many others Good Friday is like any other bank holiday.  Many shops remain open and some provide extra shopping options.  Many use the day as an occasion to increase sales.  The Bill provides that those who feel like a drink on Good Friday should have the option of getting it.  It is difficult to estimate how many people would avail of such a service.  However, the Bill provides that those who want to avail of the service will be able to do so and those in the trade who want to provide the service will be free to do so.  Needless to say, there is no obligation on pubs to open on Good Friday or any other day and there is no obligation on people to visit them either.</P>
    <P>No change is proposed in the law as it applies to Christmas Day.  I believe there is no significant demand for pubs to remain open on that day.  In addition, it seems unlikely that those who own pubs or work in them would be interested in opening for business on Christmas Day.  Many pubs in Dublin do not open or, alternatively, open for very short periods on St. Stephen's Day and for some days following depending on what day of the week they occur.  There appears to be no demand for opening on Christmas Day, nor is there any wish to provide a service on that day.</P>
    <P>During the preparation of the Bill, I became aware that some centres involved in the past in the production of alcoholic drinks have been converted into heritage centres which are part of the tourism industry.  One such centre is based in Tullamore, <Col N="485" /> County Offaly, and was brought to my attention by my colleague, Senator Gallagher.  He pointed out that this centre, formerly the location where Tullamore Dew was produced, could not sell alcoholic drinks under the present law.  This seems inappropriate.  Many people visit these centres to study and understand the drinks industry and to get a flavour of its heritage.  These centres can be used very effectively as a tourism feature in the areas in which they are located. Their attractiveness to tourists would be enhanced by allowing those who visit them to buy drinks and to sample the produce manufactured there in the past.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that these centres should be allowed to sell alcoholic drinks.  The proposals contained in the Bill would regulate the sale of alcoholic drinks at these centres in a manner similar to the way the sale of alcoholic drinks is controlled at horse racing meetings and similar events.  The heritage centres would not be allowed to sell drink after 9 p.m. at night.  In these centres drinks purchased to be consumed off the premises would be limited to the product produced at the centre in times past.  For example, it would be limited to Tullamore Dew in the case of the heritage centre in Tullamore.  I thank Senator Gallagher for his background work in relation to the legal technicalities surrounding this part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>And appropriate.  It is envisaged that the centres in a position to avail of this provision would be small.  It is estimated that the number of centres which could benefit from the proposal would not exceed ten to 20 at a maximum.  In practice it is expected that a much smaller number of centres would avail of this provision.</P>
      <P>There has been some criticism of the decision to publish this Bill now.  There are those who argue that we should wait until a comprehensive Bill can be produced.  I accept the need to consolidate the law in relation to the licensing Acts, but I do not accept we should continue to wait to address the main aspect of the licensing laws of concern to the general public.  The licensing laws have been the subject of an enormous amount of study and a good deal of debate.  We have seen no change, or negligible change, since 1988 with the exception of Deputy Owen's Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1995, which dealt with trading on Christmas Eve.  There has been little action despite the considerable reflection on the industry's needs.  It is time we moved on, changed and modernised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a sensible, balanced approach to the main issue which concerns the public in relation to pubs: the time they can obtain a drink.  It is time the laws in this regard were modified and liberalised.  I have been very encouraged by the response I received from the general public since the intention to introduce this Bill was announced <Col N="486" /> over a week ago.  I was also encouraged by the views of the Garda Commissioner when he responded to a question regarding the effects he envisaged in the event of the law being changed.  I was also encouraged by the response of a District Court judge in Waterford when he expressed his views on the licensing laws in his court recently. He spoke both vigorously and trenchantly in favour of liberalisation and modernisation.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of comment about the undesirable effects of drink.  People have harped on about them.  It is no harm to put the other side of the argument.  There is no doubt that drink, when consumed to excess, has a black and a dark side.  There is no shortage of emphasis on that point.  That reality should not be allowed to obscure the fact that drink has many beneficial effects when consumed in moderation.  It is a useful and effective social lubricant and helps people to relax.  It can also be beneficial to health when consumed in moderate amounts.  This has been studied to a significant degree recently and there is a good deal of data which indicates that, in relation to some diseases, especially heart disorders, moderate intakes of some alcoholic drinks, especially wine, have a more beneficial effect than total abstinence.  I do not pretend for a minute that excessive drinking will eliminate or diminish disease but there is what is called in the jargon a U-curve response which shows there is a significant beneficial effect when drink is consumed in moderate amounts.  This is especially true in the case of red wine, but it goes wider than that.</P>
    <P>I believe the public is in favour of a change in the law.  I see no useful purpose in continuing to wait until every aspect of the licensing laws is dealt with in a comprehensive manner.  To do that means prolonging the issue with more committees, experts, reports and sterile debate.  It is time we did what we can.  What I propose is sensible, balanced and realistic and in accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of the public.  Other complex aspects of the industry and its regulation should be dealt with on another occasion when due time is available to consider them.</P>

      <P>The Government will not be accepting the Bill being introduced by Deputy Upton and I will give the reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to give the impression that I am against change in our liquor laws.  Any body of laws as diverse and as pervasive as the Licensing Acts require updating from time to time.  Therein lies the dilemma.  The licensing code is a complex body of legislation.  The collective citation of the <Col N="487" /> statutes comprising the licensing laws is the &ldquo;Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1997&rdquo; and there are almost 50 Acts cited since 1833.  I am by no means the first Minister for Justice who worked up a thirst in considering the licensing laws.  In respect of those 50 Acts, this does not include other legislation where there would be relevant references to the licensing code.</P>
    <P>Our legislation dates back to the 18th century. One learned textbook discloses that the first licensing statute which affected Ireland was passed in 1635.  It goes without saying that a great deal of drinking up time has passed since 1635.</P>
    <P>The whole body of law relating to clubs comes under the collective citation &ldquo;Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 1995&rdquo;.  The Licensing Acts represent a balance of interests, and in legislating for one or two sectors of the trade we may well alienate other sectors or interest groups, including the public.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1997, and the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 1995, to provide for hours of trading for licensed premises and registered clubs. The main provisions would be to extend opening hours to 12.30 a.m. throughout the year, with an additional half-hour drinking-up time; to abolish Sunday closing between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m; to replace existing Sunday opening with weekday opening time, and to permit public houses and clubs to open on Good Friday.  The Bill would allow off-licences to open for the sale of products other than alcohol at the same time as pubs.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell on the merits or demerits of the individual proposals.  There is probably not a single Deputy who does not have an opinion on our licensing laws, perhaps even deeply felt views on how they could be improved. I could go so far as to say that every adult in the land has a view &mdash; an expert view &mdash; on the licensing laws.  It is certainly an area which commands great interest and, no doubt, many conflicting views as to whether our existing provisions are too liberal, not liberal enough.  or simply out of touch with modern day living.</P>
    <P>I would have thought the Deputy was &ldquo;jumping the gun&rdquo; somewhat.  He is surely aware that the Select Committee on Legislation and Security was engaged in a broad review of the licensing laws when the 27th Dáil was dissolved.  That work is continuing under the sub-committee on security and legislation of the new Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.  In deference to a select committee of the House, it is premature to introduce legislative proposals in advance of that review without giving due consideration to the recommendations of the select committee on the matter.  To do otherwise would make a joke of the committees of the House. They were charged with examining this matter. Nobody could seriously expect me or any other Minister for Justice to accept a Private Members' Bill without giving consideration to a committee <Col N="488" /> which has been reviewing the matter for a long time.</P>
    <P>The former committee's <i>modus operandi</i> included inviting submissions from interested parties and the commissioning of a research document.  The sub-commitee on legislation and security is continuing with this work and, I understand, intends to prepare a report on the basis of the submissions received and also the research document which it commissioned.</P>
    <P>The input of the select committee, which is grounded in a public consultation process with all interested parties, is the appropriate way forward. I ask the Deputy to consider whether now is the appropriate time to introduce this legislation, in advance of the review by the select committee.  I, for one, would like to have the recommendations of the committee to hand, before engaging in an attempt to amend the legislation.  Even after having the benefit of the select committee's recommendations, there would need to be a further period of consultation with all interested parties, both from within the licensing trade and outside it.  The Garda Síochána, other statutory and voluntary groups and the public generally have legitimate interests and a contribution to make to this important debate.</P>
    <P>As indicated by the Chief Whip on 23 January 1998 at the beginning of this session, the Government has a full programme of legislative reform. My Department is engaged in a heavy schedule of legislative work in the coming months.</P>
    <P>However, I can give an undertaking that any recommendations made by the select committee arising from its review of the licensing laws will be given the most serious consideration by me, with a view to any amending legislation that may be necessary.</P>
    <P>As part of the consultative process in relation to examination of our licensing laws, I am supporting a seminar on liquor licensing law reform which will take place on 24 April 1998.  The seminar is being jointly sponsored by my Department and the Dublin Institute of Technology faculty of tourism.  The seminar is by invitation and all interests in this area are being invited.  A panel of national and international speakers will attend the seminar.  Issues for discussion include competition in the licensed trade, licensing administration and current issues in licensing reform.</P>
    <P>This is a timely seminar which will focus on the state of the liquor licensing laws and possible reform options.  It will be a useful input into the process of developing future public policy options in this area and should help to complement the work of the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.</P>
    <P>The licensing laws, while not ideal in all respects, provide for a balancing of sometimes competing interests, those of publicans, hoteliers, restaurateurs, holders of club licences, off-licence holders and interest groups in the community.  All these groups have a stake in the licensing laws. Any revision of the legislation would need to take on board the views of all interested groups. <Col N="489" /> I am not convinced such a comprehensive canvassing of all interest groups was undertaken in the preparation of this Bill.  Whatever consultation with the broad range of interest groups has taken place is unknown to me.  I note, for example, that a leading trade union involved, MANDATE, is reported as being opposed to the changes proposed in Deputy Upton's Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a need to give serious consideration to the socio-economic implications of extended opening hours.  The select committee is well positioned to give that kind of consideration to the matter and, on the basis of its research and consultations, will no doubt do so.  While it could be argued, as I understand Deputy Upton is doing in presenting this Bill, that a liberalisation of the licensing laws would benefit the tourist industry, any potential benefits which might accrue would have to be balanced against possible negative outcomes, including public order issues associated with alcohol abuse.  Issues such as the possibility of increased alcohol abuse and attendant domestic violence abuse, the possibility of more drink-driving offences as closing time extends even further beyond public transport cut-off time, and threats to public order generally are matters of considerable importance.  They deserve to be properly examined and investigated and the views of all interested parties placed on the record.</P>
    <P>I cannot be blind to the fact that research consistently shows alcohol abuse to be a background factor in the commission of some forms of serious offences.  By and large, alcohol is supplied in accordance with the law and people consume it lawfully.  For these reasons, there is perhaps an understandable inclination not to think of alcohol in the context of substance abuse.  The fact is, however, that some do not consume alcohol responsibly and, as a consequence, contribute directly to deaths on the roads, alcohol-related illnesses, and violence, both within the home and outside it.  The irresponsible use of alcohol sets an extremely poor example for younger people. This, combined with greater affluence and glamorised packaging of the product, can create the impression among our youth that heavy drinking is an accepted way of life.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have a core responsibility for any changes to the licensing laws.  This is not an easy task, nor one I would wish to undertake lightly. Any change requires very careful consideration and deliberation and should only be brought about when there is a clear and demonstrable or pressing need.  On the one hand, as I have already said, the consequential effects of any proposed changes, particularly if there is a question of them impacting negatively on the already significant problems associated with drink abuse, requires very careful consideration.  On the other hand, of course, we must not lose sight of the fact that the majority of drinkers exercise a responsible attitude to alcohol consumption and it would not be appropriate that measures taken to help curb <Col N="490" /> drink abuse would have the effect of penalising the responsible drinker.  There is no doubt that drink plays a very important part in social life generally.  In this context I would be forgiven for saying that it is something to be celebrated.  It makes it all the more appropriate that the sale of intoxicating liquor should be subject to controls which are acceptable generally and whose purposes are to prevent abuse.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill relates to the opening hours of pubs and clubs.  This is a hotly debated topic.  I wonder if there is anyone who does not have a view on this topic.  In 1988, at the time of the last major review of the licensing laws, a concerted effort was made to strike a balance by the then Minister, Gerry Collins, between the advocates of longer hours and those calling for shorter hours. The end result was a compromise.  I do not claim that compromise met, or now meets with universal approval but compromise was considered the way forward.  However, as compromises go it was generally accepted as striking a fair balance and any interference with that hard-earned equilibrium can only be realistically done after a thorough examination and public debate around all the issues concerned.</P>
    <P>While it is valid to say that some tourists arriving here from some countries find our licensing laws archaic because they cannot get a drink after a certain time, that in itself may not be reason enough to change the law.  Nor, according to Bord Fáilte, is it a universal demand of tourists.  I am sure one would get many members of the public who, if confronted with the prospect of public houses or clubs opening for longer hours, would wish to register their opposition on the basis of noise, threat to their person or property from drink-induced violence, or just common nuisance. It is not sufficient to listen to one side of the argument in this debate.  It is of considerable importance that one listens to both sides of the argument before reaching a decision.</P>
    <P>The proposal to abolish mandatory closing on Good Friday is another serious matter.  While many would argue that it is a matter for the individual to regulate his or her behaviour on this day as on any other day, this proposal will undoubtedly meet with opposition from people who genuinely hold the view that it should remain a closed day.  There are traditional aspects to the licensing laws which command significant support in the community and Good Friday is not a day that many would want to see an open day for licensed premises.</P>
    <P>Within the trade I wonder if there is consensus on the issue of permitted hours.  While the pub trade may well welcome longer hours, we may find that the operators of night-clubs and discos will oppose them as an unfair incursion into their particular end of the market, and we could be faced with a demand to make further concessions to this area of the trade.  The opportunities for upsetting the equilibrium I referred to earlier are only too apparent.  Since Solomon is long dead I do not have access to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> Part II of the Bill addresses the rights of employees in respect of the proposed extended opening hours.  There are many, including employers and employees, who question the use of legislation to set mandatory terms of overtime and holiday pay in advance of negotiations on the matter between employer and employee groups. It is worth pointing out that there will be a cost to be paid for longer opening hours.  How will the overhead costs to the licensee of extended opening hours, including additional wage costs, be recouped?  I expect this might be through increased sales of alcohol, an increase in prices, or a combination of both.  These are issues which in themselves are bound to excite considerable debate and which require serious reflection. There are also issues relating to working procedure which would require detailed consultation and subsequent negotiation with employer and employee organisations.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with certain general matters on which I do not intend to dwell to any detailed extent.  I do wish to comment on the first matter which relates to the granting of licences to what are termed authorised heritage centres, sites or premises of national or local historical significance relating to the manufacture or distilling of any intoxicating liquor.  Deputy Upton used the example of Tullamore and suggested that the heritage centre should serve Tullamore Dew.  If someone wished to drink something else they could go to a different licensed premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this to be a provision aimed at enhancing the tourist attraction of these centres.  This is a matter which could and should be more appropriately considered in the context of overall policy for developing the potential of such centres.  It would be important that such tourist amenities would be viable in their own right and not contingent on the granting of such licences.  This aspect of the Bill will be of interest to my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, who is responsible for policy in this area.  The proposals will be of equal interest to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera.  I mention this to reinforce the point that there are elements which require much more reflection, consideration and consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have based my opposition to the Bill on the premise that this is not the appropriate time to bring forward amending legislation, particularly in light of the attention being given to this area by a select committee of the House.  There is a need when preparing legislation, particularly when legislating in the area of intoxicating liquor, to maintain a correct balance.  There must be a balance which reflects not merely the legitimate commercial interests of the different groups which make up the trade but also between their interests and the general public interest.  The <Col N="492" /> means of achieving that balance is through a significant consultative process.  To proceed in any other way would without doubt upset the equilibrium and in so doing upset many people.</P>
    <P>This is an issue which will not go away.  It must be addressed.  A select committee has been charged with this task.  I would be making its deliberations redundant if I were to accept Deputy Upton's proposals.  The best course of action is to await the outcome of the deliberations of the select committee and then engage in the consideration, deliberation and consultation which is desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to Deputy Upton.  In certain instances I could agree with him.  As someone who is directly involved in the licensed trade, I have my own views.  I have yet to meet a group of people who do not have a view on the licensed trade.  In considering the matter one must take into account major changes in the pattern of drinking and the consumption of alcohol.  The biggest change is that the vast majority of people are far more careful in the volume of alcohol they consume, especially those in charge of motor vehicles.  People are also concerned about their health.</P>
      <P>The day is long gone when people, even in rural areas, consumed alcohol during the day.  I am sure every Deputy is well aware that in most towns and villages the vast majority of public houses do not open until 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. By law they are allowed to remain open until 11.30 p.m. with 30 minutes drinking up time during the summer and 11 p.m. with 30 minutes drinking up time in the winter.  Unlike other nations, Irish people do not go out until very late.  There is a different pattern in the United States where public houses can stay open late.  One could walk into a public house at 2 a.m. and there might not even be four customers on the premises.</P>
      <P>Sunday opening hours present the biggest problem.  When first mooted I agreed that the idea of a Sunday hour was a good one.  I still believe that people should go home at a respectable hour but the time has come to make a change.  Matches are now shown on television and, as Deputy Upton mentioned, many licensed premises have to serve food to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton mentioned the possibility of opening on Good Friday.  I am not advocating that public houses should open on Good Friday. I have come across few members of the public who want public houses to open on Good Friday but the same cannot be said about Christmas Day.  However, I am not suggesting that public houses should open on Christmas Day.  The public are well looked after on Christmas morning by the GAA, rugby, golf, Garda and Army clubs which are officially entitled to open for a couple of hours.  Relatives and friends of members are allowed to sign the visitor's book.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about the price but about opening hours.  I do not mind what they charge.</P>
      <P>When the select committee reports to the Minister he should rectify a number of anomalies in the trade.  On a previous occasion when certain changes were proposed I led a delegation of six publicans to a former Minister.  Two of the delegation are prominent members of the Opposition and they each had a different opinion.  This is not an easy matter for which to legislate as one cannot compare the position in Dublin to that in Limerick or Cork.  While it would be difficult to legislate for them alone, special provision should be made for seaside resorts, especially at weekends in the months of July and August.  Families which go there on holidays with children are not able to get out until late at night due to difficulties with baby sitting, etc.  In such a situation it is difficult if licensing laws are restricted.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputy Upton to withdraw the Bill as it is premature.  Our parliamentary party has discussed this issue and I raised it with the Minister who asked us to hold back until the commission makes its recommendations.  That is what we should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael supports Deputy Upton's Bill on the basis that we want it to get a second reading.  However, we propose that the Bill then be referred to the select committee of the Houses dealing with the matter.  I understand, however, that the Minister has a different view.  I listened with interest to the debate and agreed with much of what Deputy Upton said in his opening address.  I feel like the Deputy who is asked to judge at an agricultural fair in his or her constituency and who is in an invidious position as I also listened with interest to what the Minister said and found little with which I disagreed.  It is difficult to chart the most appropriate way forward on the basis of what we have heard.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that Deputy Upton produced this Bill because the Labour Party was represented at the all-party committee.  I understand it still is &mdash; perhaps this can be confirmed. It is extraordinary and hardly credible that the reports of the committee were read, sections were extracted and a Bill was produced in the expectation that the Dáil would pass it without any reference to the committee.  Deputy Upton dismissed any attempt at getting cross party agreement by talking in great detail about heritage centres, etc., despite being aware that the documentation from the heritage centre in my constituency has been with the committee for one year.  In his final sentence he said the debate to date had been sterile and that this is why he wants the Bill to be passed.  The debate has been anything but sterile.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's party Whip will explain the position.  There is agreement on most sides of the House that the issue of trading hours for licensed premises is in need of reform to meet consumer demand.  In spite of the 1988 legislation, the law is in disrepute.  I am not sure if it is at the instruction of the Minister, but in the west there is a prime example of zero tolerance, the second such zero tolerance initiative in as many weeks.  The first was in my own constituency in the context of speeding and road traffic. There is now zero tolerance in Galway and Mayo with public houses being closed by the Garda on the dot of closing time.  It is difficult to argue against this &mdash; I am not saying we should encourage a law which has already fallen into disrepute to remain in disrepute.  However, when the law is applied in one part of the country and ignored in another, those subjected to a rigorous application of it at the expense of others have a fair case.  The unsatisfactory nature of the situation is underlined in streets in many towns or cities.  Three public houses within a hundred yards of each other could all be operating different licensing hours.  It is nonsense.</P>
      <P>Special exemptions will have to be examined and I agree with much that Deputy Upton said in that regard.  The 65,000 applications for special exemptions each year prove the need for change and that the present daily hours are insufficient to meet consumer demand.  I think the vast majority of these exemptions are for Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays &mdash; perhaps Deputy Upton has done research on the matter.  It is important when changing the law that the exemptions being granted for Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are examined as I do not think there is a similar demand on such nights.  The Minister could usefully examine the idea of staggering exemptions through the week &mdash; although staggering is not an appropriate term when discussing licensing laws.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton spoke of the Scottish experience and made a valid point regarding the situation there.  The so-called '10 o'clock swill', where everybody was thrown out of public houses in Glasgow, gave rise to grave public disorder and has been substantially changed.  The problems experienced in Scotland were no longer evident once the laws were liberalised and extended hours were introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would be doing a disservice to proceed with the Bill or enact it without reference to the overall issues.  I welcome the Minister's undertaking that recommendations made by the all-party committee will be given most serious consideration with a view to amending legislation which may be necessary.  I hope the Minister receives a copy of <Col N="495" /> the report within a few weeks.  I also welcome his initiative for a one day seminar which will be useful and which I look forward to attending.  The report of the Competition Authority is due in the coming months and perhaps consideration should not be given to amending legislation until we see what it says in terms of licensing laws, restrictive practices, licences, etc.  This is an area the authority could usefully examine.</P>
    <P>A simple issue is that of the price of soft drinks and minerals in public houses.  It is totally unacceptable that, in some cases, a glass of coke or orange costs more than a glass of beer.  Colleagues on all sides will be declaring their vested interests, as Deputies Collins and Moloney have already done.  I know Deputy Moloney, who has many years service in the trade, will make a useful contribution to the debate, as will Deputy Perry.  It is unacceptable that a glass of sparkling water can cost as much as an alcoholic beverage, if not more.</P>
    <P>A great case can be made for Sunday afternoon trading.  The eating habits of Irish people have changed and they like to go to the pubs which serve food on Sunday rather than to hotels.  It is very difficult to justify the closure of a licensed premises at 2 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon when teams are about to take to the field for a premiership game broadcast by Sky Sports.  It is something of a nuisance that pubs are not allowed to open on Sunday afternoons and I hope that will be changed.</P>
    <P>There are other areas which must be addressed. The question of the trading hours of off licences and supermarkets must also be considered.  To proceed with a mere extension of opening hours and other ancillary matters, as proposed by Deputy Upton, is perhaps to neglect to deal with more important issues.  The manner in which licences are distributed throughout the country must be addressed.  The distribution of licences appears to be very unfair in so far as the province of Connacht, for example, seems to be overserved with licences whereas the opposite is the case on the east coast.  A level of service must be provided to all sections of the community where population levels deem it appropriate.</P>
    <P>The issue of six day licences must be examined. An amnesty was introduced some time ago for the conversion of such licences.  A number of six day licences operate at present in this State and the licence holders obviously cannot open on a Sunday.  I hope the Minister will introduce a mechanism which would allow for the conversion of these six day licences into seven day ones, perhaps on payment of a fee.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the Minister's comments on the difficulties involved in alcohol-related incidents as crime or abuse can arise from excess indulgence in alcohol.  I do not think this is something we should take lightly.  It is regrettable that no substantial research on alcohol has been carried out in this State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> There are other areas in which current laws are being totally ignored.  For example, underage young people are being employed on licensed premises.  One can visit any busy lounge on a weekend night and see very young people working as lounge boys and lounge girls, in spite of the fact that the 1988 Act specifically outlaws that practice.  I do not think there is any question of enforcing that provision in any rigorous way.  At the end of the day, the Minister must introduce legislation which will be enforced.  Any change made to opening hours must be accompanied by a strong warning on the part of the authorities and the Minister.  Strictly speaking, current winter closing time is 11 p.m. but one can still go into any pub, particularly in remote rural areas, and be served much later than that.  If opening hours are to be extended, we must rigorously enforce whatever time limit we, as legislators, impose.</P>
    <P>It is important that we meet consumer demand in this area.  Tourism has been highlighted by a number of interested parties as being a reason opening hours should be extended.  There is some validity in that but we should not merely extend opening hours to facilitate tourists in spite of the fact that tourism creates spending and spending creates jobs which increases revenue for the State.  Irish people must also be facilitated.  Difficulties are experienced, particularly during the summer months in towns which are noteworthy tourist attractions, when public houses close at the prescribed hours.  People who wish to indulge in an extra glass of lager or who want to stay out longer than 11.40 p.m. are forced to pay £6 into the local disco where they may not be able to get a seat and where they must contend with noise pollution.  These are the kind of practical daily issues which would be somewhat addressed by an extension in opening hours, particularly in summer time.</P>

      <P>There was a reference by the two previous speakers to the situation which pertains in regard to Good Friday.  Fine Gael supports the maintenance of Good Friday as a close day and is not in agreement with Deputy Upton's proposal to make it a normal working day in the licensed trade.  Nor does Fine Gael support the opening of pubs during Sunday trading hours on that day.  Pubs are open for 363 days of the year and the maintenance of Good Friday and Christmas Day as close days will not create any great public disturbance or outcry.  I am not sure there is a great demand for pubs to be opened on Good Friday.  It should remain a day of special significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are debating this important matter.  However, changing the licensing code is not as simple as Deputy Upton's Bill appears to suggest.  I am pleased the Minister has <Col N="497" /> given certain undertakings here and I am pleased that the work of the select committee, of which I am Chairman, is proceeding apace.  The committee is meeting on a weekly basis and a report should be available to the Minister within three to four weeks.  I agree with the Minister that he would require some time to consider that report. He stated he wishes to engage in further consultation although I am not sure of the extent to which he proposes to do so.</P>
    <P>I know he will be very interested in the outcome of the seminar and its report and I hope he will be in a position to come into the House by autumn with proposals which would meet many of the valid points raised by Deputy Upton.  The fact that we would have cross-party agreement towards reform at committee level will be a great help.  That underlines the importance of our committee system for the processing of legislation or at least recommendations for change.  It would be nonsense to enact this Bill without reference to the select all-party committee which has been given terms of reference by this House.  I ask Deputy Upton in his reply to this debate to comment on why he produced a Bill without referring to the work of the all-party committee or, perhaps, without even consulting his party colleague, Deputy McDowell, whose contribution to the committee was quite valued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for sharing his time with me.  I compliment him because the select committee he chairs is doing very important work.  It is important at this stage that there should be all-party agreement on this matter and that we introduce proper legislation in this area.  A codifying of our licensing laws as they apply is required because the present legislation in very dated.  It is important to get this legislation right because it will affect up to 6,000 families who operate privately owned licensed hotels, guesthouses or restaurants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The select committee should examine the question of off licences.  There is a great demand from customers for off licence facilities in supermarkets.  I know from my experience the difficulty and cost of going to court to get a licence for an off licensing facility in a supermarket, particularly when it is based in a town in a rural area that could not be classified as an urban area.  That necessitates the purchase of two licences outside the area and the employment of a senior counsel to go to court.  The legal fees alone can amount to between £8,000 and £9,000 and the granting of <Col N="498" /> the licence depends very much on the humour of the judge on the day.  The select committee should consider this important area.</P>
    <P>Customers demand a supermarket that incorporates an off licence.  That is particularly the case now when Tesco, which has a £12 billion turnover per annum, has opened outlets in every large suburban area.  If businesses, particularly supermarkets, are to survive in rural areas, they must have an off licence to offset the trade in balance.  Large supermarkets now open on Sundays and have extended hours during the week and because they have an off licence they are a major attraction particularly at Christmas, Easter and during the summer when people tend to entertain more in their homes.  The provision of off licensing facilities in supermarkets is one that requires reform to balance trade given the onslaught faced by the retail sector.  Many retailers are not only publicans but supermarket owners.  This debate may help the select committee, but it is encouraging to note that the Minister has given a commitment tonight to accept the recommendations of the select committee chaired by Deputy Flanagan which has done a good deal of work in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a case for a reasonable extension of the existing licensing laws not only to codify them but also because it is difficult for the Garda Síochána to implement them.  The amount invested by publicans in their property is considerable.  Given that the level of business in pubs between Monday and Thursday is minute, most publicans make their profits on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.  Many publicans find that their ratio of business between drink and food is 70:30 or 60:40.  A main difficulty is that customers who may wish to have their lunch at 2.15 p.m. on Sundays, would be breaking the law.  If the gardaí arrived they would be empowered to summons the licensee and take the names of the persons on the property.  From that point of view our licensing laws need to be changed.</P>
    <P>The operation of pubs has changed dramatically in the past 70 years.  Most customers go to the pub for a social drink and do not over indulge.  When this matter is fully discussed by the select committee I hope a sensible change will be recommended that not only will benefit publicans but also customers.  A huge return on investment is required for all businesses because of the level of investment in them.  Deputy Flanagan asked why publicans may have to make an extra margin of profit on the sale of Ballygowan or 7 Up.  One of the reasons is to meet their overheads given that they have to pay staff when there is very little business early in the week.</P>
    <P>Legislation will fail if it does not have the support of the society for which it is intended.  It will be ignored and brought into disrepute if it is not seen to be fair by everybody and it will be unenforceable.  A hotelier in Enniscrone last week told me that he lost a booking for a wedding because of the operation of a pilot scheme to enforce the law there, which the gardaí are entitled to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> However, if it to be enforced on a pilot basis, it must be done fairly and not by selecting one town and ignoring others nearby.  Customers are avoiding the towns where the law is being enforced and going elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Flanagan stated, most publicans do not want to operate until 1 a.m. outside the law. If, like the UK system, they knew that when the bell sounds at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock, or whatever the time the law stipulates, every pub in the area would be cleared, they would be happy. However, the greatest inequity is that customers know if a pub closes at 11 p.m. they can get a drink elsewhere.  The legislation should be enforced in a manner that will ensure publicans will not have to keep staff two hours after closing time to clear the premises.  Until such time as the select committee submits its proposals, the Minister should ensure that the pilot scheme to enforce the existing laws is administered fairly particularly during the tourist season.  We do not want visitors to think our laws are out of date because we want to be seen as Europeans.  As many of our visitors come for the weekend, publicans do not want extended opening hours during the week.  Most people socialise at weekends. One can leave a pub and pay £5 to gain entry to a hotel and be served drink until 2.30 a.m.</P>
    <P>Our licensing laws date back to the 1600s.  They need to be codified and updated to consolidate the livelihoods of the many families who run pubs.  It is rare that a second generation continues to operate a pub and that highlights the difficulties associated with being a licensed vintner.  I have the utmost respect for those who own and operate pubs.  They have a very difficult job and work unsocial hours.  They would welcome amended legislation that would put the time for closing on a statutory footing.  I also have the highest respect for the gardaí because in present circumstances it is difficult for them to enforce the law in small towns and villages.  Often gardaí have to be brought in from other districts because the local gardaí prefer not to have to take the names of people whom they meet every day when they are enjoying a social occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan has been working on proposals in this area for some time.  Those proposals will be brought before the House for debate and I believe they will secure the agreement of all parties.  They will propose a reasonable and acceptable change that will benefit the publican and the customer.  They will also demonstrate that Ireland is progressive and supportive of a valuable industry which has created thousands of jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Defence was unable to attend this debate but I am grateful for the attendance of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Ministers in this Government have a universal catch cry when questioned on certain policies they have not addressed to date.  It is that &ldquo;a commitment has been given in An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo;.  In this document, a commitment was given which echoed the promise of the Minister's pre-election manifesto to encourage the increased participation of women in the Defence Forces and to ensure the facilities necessary for their full participation.  What does this mean?</P>
      <P>On 5 November 1997, I raised the issue of the height requirement for entry into the Defence Forces during questions to the Minister for Defence.  Traditionally, the height requirement was 5' 2&rdquo; for males and females.  This does not appear to have caused a problem as the vast majority of people interested in applying for a position were not excluded by this condition. Recently, the height requirement was raised to 5' 5&rdquo;.  However, following representations to the Minister to revert to 5' 2&rdquo; for women, he agreed to reduce the height requirement by 1&rdquo; to 5' 4&rdquo; while it remained 5' 5&rdquo; for men.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the Kilkenny health project show that the average height of males and females in the general Kilkenny area between the ages of 35 and 44 years is 5' 9&rdquo; and 5' 4&rdquo; respectively.  Data given to me by Mr. Tony Watson of the University of Limerick shows that the average height of males and females in the UK is 5' 10&rdquo; and 5' 4.5&rdquo; respectively.  While it is outside the Minister's control, it is important to note that the height entry requirement for the Garda Síochána is 5' 9&rdquo; for males and 5' 4&rdquo; for females.</P>
      <P>On the basis of these statistics, there is blatant inequality between men and women with regard to entry into the Defence Forces, as a far greater percentage of women is excluded from applying. In reply to a parliamentary question which I put to the Minister on 10 March 1998 on this topic, the Minister said he was not in favour of any further reduction of the height requirement as it has been the experience of the training units that persons of shorter stature have difficulty carrying the bulk and weight of combat order equipment. However, strength is not related to height but to fat free body mass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that a Government which has an unprecedented number of Cabinet Ministers does not see fit to afford an equal opportunity to women to join the Defence Forces.  Is it not ironic <Col N="501" /> that the woman who is perhaps the greatest athlete this country has produced, Michelle Smith, would probably not meet the height requirement for the Defence Forces?  I ask the Minister to examine this matter again.  If he decides to make no further change, I am anxious that he give a credible explanation.</P>
    <P>In a not unrelated area, I ask the Minister to consider increasing the upper age limit by a number of years for entry into the Defence Forces for members of the FCA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the inability of the Minister for Defence to attend this evening.  The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for women in the Defence Forces and to the full participation of women in all aspects of Defence Forces activity, including operational and ceremonial duties.</P>
      <P>Women are eligible for service in the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and the Reserve Defence Force and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same general conditions as men.  All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts. The basis of selection is suitability rather than gender and there are no gender quotas.</P>
      <P>This has been the position since 1992.  Prior to that, the role of women in the Defence Forces was confined to administrative and service support duties.  A board established in 1991 to examine the role of women in the Defence Forces recommended the full participation of women in all aspects of Defence Forces activity, including operational work, and the full access of women to the military career educational system and to promotional opportunities.  These recommendations were implemented in 1992.</P>
      <P>The current position of women in the Defence Forces must, therefore, be judged against the fact that it has only developed fully over the past six years.  Of the 11,474 serving members of the Permanent Defence Force, 241 are women; 219 of these are serving in the Army, eight in the Air Corps and 14 in the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>While the number of women joining the Defence Forces is lower than the number of men, this reflects the much greater number of male applicants for entry to the Forces.  This is borne out by the statistics for 1997, for example, when the applicants for general service enlistment were 86 per cent male as against 14 per cent female. On the other hand, it should be noted that the success rate for women was higher than that for men as 55 per cent of eligible female candidates were enlisted as against 49 per cent of eligible male candidates.  Overall, 16 per cent of the personnel enlisted in 1997 were women.</P>
      <P>Women are also recruited as cadets and apprentices.  Women secured three of the 14 apprenticeship positions in 1997, which represented 29 per cent of the positions, although only 8 per cent of the applicants were female.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> There were seven female cadets in 1997 while the percentage of female applicants was low at 15 per cent.  Women have been serving in the Naval Service since 1995.  Recruitment of women to An Slua Muirí commenced in December 1997.  There are already 17 female members and further applications from females are currently being processed.</P>
    <P>Recruitment to An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil is open to men and women on an equal basis since 1991.  Female membership of the FCA at 3,100 represents over 20 per cent of the Force, a considerable achievement in such a short number of years.</P>
    <P>To further encourage participation by women in the Defence Forces, it was recently decided to amend regulations to provide that the minimum height requirement for females be reduced from 5' 5&rdquo; to 5' 4&rdquo; to take account of the natural height difference between males and females.  A greater reduction in the height requirement for females is not possible owing to the fact that persons of smaller stature might experience difficulties with the bulk and weight of combat equipment.  The height for males remains unchanged at 5' 5&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Promotional material for recruitment to the Defence Forces is targeted at females and males on an equal basis and is forwarded to all secondary schools.  In fact, the promotional video issued to schools recently focuses largely on a young female recruit.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied that women are not discriminated against in any way in recruitment, in participation in the full range of military duties, education courses and training courses or in promotion.</P>

      <P>The central question is whether it is right for the Department to levy a charge of £17,000 on the Lombardstown voluntary housing association that wishes to provide, on the campus of the old Lombardstown vocational school, housing units for senior citizens of the locality.  In so far as County Cork VEC has a role to play in the disposal of property, this matter came before the members some time ago and, without reservation or the recommendation of a charge, it took the view that the site and building of the former vocational school at Lombardstown should be disposed of and that, as a procedural matter, the prior permission of the Department of Education and Science should be sought.  Regrettably, while recommending that the site could be disposed of to the Lombardstown voluntary housing association, the Department imposed a levy of £17,000 on it.  Given the circumstances of the case, that is <Col N="503" /> a most unfortunate decision and I raise the matter to ask the Minister to intervene.</P>
      <P>This school was built in the early 1950s on a site donated by the local community to County Cork VEC.  Not uniquely at the time, a considerable amount of local voluntary labour was involved in the construction of the school.  Given those circumstances, it is mean spirited of the Department to take the view that a levy of £17,000 should be imposed on a local voluntary, civic-minded group that wishes to provide for the elderly in the community sheltered housing and ancillary services on the campus of the old vocational school.  I urge the Minister to review this case, taking into consideration the overall context of the request, the voluntary effort and the service provided by a local voluntary organisation in circumstances where the State could not, were it so obliged, provide a similar level of service.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the asking price.  It was anticipated that a nominal fee would be levied on the property, which would be in keeping with the development envisaged.</P>

      <P>I support the case made by Deputy Creed.  I am a member of County Cork VEC which considered this issue.  As a Deputy who lives adjacent to the Lombardstown area, I am aware of the proposal by the Lombardstown housing association for a scheme which would result in housing three or four elderly people in the locality.  At a time when we are trying to promote social housing, we should do everything possible to assist local community and voluntary groups, and the proposal from the Lombardstown people in this regard is worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The site on which the school was built was provided free of charge to the Department of Education in the 1950s and much of the work in constructing the school was carried out on a voluntary basis.  In those circumstances the Minister should use his discretion and consider this proposal more leniently than others.  The school which operated successfully for 17 or 18 years is now disused.  The building has become an eyesore and, with the Minister's assistance, the constructive proposal can be proceeded with.  I hope the Minister accedes to the formal request from County Cork VEC.  At a meeting of that committee last Thursday week it was formally proposed <Col N="504" /> that the site would be handed over at a nominal rate to the housing association.  Taking into account the history of the site and the building of the school, I hope the Minister will favourably consider that request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies for raising the issue.  It gives me an opportunity to clarify the position of the proposed sale of the old vocational school in Lombardstown.  Some time ago County Cork VEC sought my consent to dispose of the old vocational school as required by section 2 of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 1936.  The normal procedure in these matters is that my Department considers, in the first instance, if the property will be required for educational reasons in the foreseeable future and if not, a reserve price is set in accordance with the established market value of the property.  The committee is then directed to sell the property by tender or public auction, whichever is likely to secure the highest price.</P>
      <P>Having carried out a thorough examination of the proposal made by County Cork VEC, my Department is satisfied that the property at Lombardstown will not be required for educational use in the foreseeable future.  In addition, having regard to the merits of the proposal submitted and the intended use for the old school, it was decided, on an exceptional basis, to give sanction to the committee to sell the property to the housing charity at the established market value of £17,500.  The legal advice available to me is that under the present statutory framework a VEC is not empowered to dispose of a property at a price less than the established market value, which in this case is £17,500.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that if the normal procedure was followed in this case, the VEC would have to sell the property by tender or public auction.  The effect of this could well be to increase the consideration over the established market value and make the purchase more difficult for the housing charity.  I am pleased to have been in a position to facilitate the charity on this occasion by giving sanction for the sale of the school outside of auction or public tendering.  I take this opportunity to commend the charity in question on its efforts to provide sheltered housing for the needy in our society.</P>

      <P>I am fully satisfied that forestry is beneficial to the environment as it provides a renewable construction material resource and a renewable energy resource; it helps combat global warming by providing a carbon sink &mdash; it is estimated that Irish forests remove two million tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere annually; it contributes to clean air; it provides alternative sources of timber.  Northern temperate forests take commercial pressure off tropical forests; it reduces run-off and peak flooding compared with agriculture; it stabilises soils <i>vis-a-vis</i> extensive agriculture and it requires lower fertiliser and chemical inputs than agriculture; it contributes to biodiversity and landscape diversity; riparian woodlands are of benefit to fish life; and it provides a source of recreation &mdash; up to ten million visits are made to Irish forests each year.</P>
      <P>The beneficial effect of forestry is based on a wide range of scientific evidence.  The following is a list of recent papers on this topic for the Deputy's information.  Many more studies on all aspects of forestry benefits can be found in both the national and international literature, in COFORD research directories and at the universities.</P>

      <P>As Deputies will recall, I established the task force last year in the wake of revelations by the UK authorities that documents had been discovered in the Public Record Office in London which indicated that radioactive waste had been dumped in the Beaufort Dyke in the North Irish Sea during the 1950s.  Subsequent archival searches revealed hitherto unreported instances of dumping in Beaufort Dyke and at a number of other locations around the coast of the United Kingdom during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.</P>
      <P>The Government was very concerned by these revelations.  Accordingly, I asked the task force to review and assess the information becoming available on the dumping of radioactive materials in the maritime area and, based on this review, to advise on survey-monitoring and management measures to ensure maximum protection to our marine resources and restore public confidence in the quality of the marine environment.</P>
      <P>The task force, which is chaired by Nuala Butler, barrister, includes representatives from the Radiological Protection Institute, University College, Dublin, the Marine Institute, the Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>As I previously indicated, it is my intention to publish the report of the task force.</P>

      <P>The discussion document and report on &ldquo;Coastal Zone Management &mdash; a draft Policy for Ireland&rdquo; were prepared by consultants Brady Shipman Martin, at the request of my Department and the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, and published on 2 December 1997, for the purposes of simulating necessary public debate.  The documents do not represent Government policy and have served their purpose.  It is not proposed, therefore, to amend them for republication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost one hundred written submissions, <Col N="508" /> including one from Coastwatch, have been received in relation to those documents and a major public consultation seminar was held yesterday in Dublin to review the key issues raised in the documents and in the submissions.  The outcome of that lengthy public consultation phase will be carefully considered by the Government, in the coming months, in deciding on the essentials of a national coastal zone management policy and implementation framework.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, Passage East pier is owned by Waterford County Council and responsibility for its repair and maintenance rests with the local authority.  Waterford County Council has not to date made a proposal to the Department for financial support for dredging at Passage East.  My Department does not generally provide financial assistance for maintenance dredging, but grant aid proposals for capital dredging at fishery harbours are considered, having regard to available funds.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will also be aware, the available funding for harbour development under the Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-99 is extremely limited and priority must be focused on key strategic fishing ports, while facilitating as far as we can other much needed development. In the present circumstances, I regret that I do not see any immediate scope for financial support for a dredging programme at Passage East. However, I will inquire from Waterford County Council if it has any proposals and whether we can be of any assistance to the council.</P>

      <P>I have already outlined to the House this afternoon my commitment to ensure that the legitimate interests of Irish fishermen in the Atlantic tuna fishery are protected in the face of the proposed ban on drift-netting for tuna.  I have also spelled out my strategic approach to the negotiations on the issue.  I fully agree with the Deputy on the importance of the valuable tuna fishery for our south-west ports and the economic benefits for our fishermen. <Col N="509" /> I am not aware of any proposals currently to establish further tuna canning capacity in the south-west region.  While I fully agree on the need to maximise the returns onshore of all our fishing activity in terms of value added and jobs in the processing sector, it is the case that tuna commands premium prices, if the quality is right on export markets.  Creating the conditions for Irish fishermen to develop a niche in the quality high priced market will be a major consideration for me in securing a framework for our continued participation in the Atlantic tuna fishery.  I will be open, however, to consider any other additional proposals which can be demonstrated to deliver significant economic return.</P>

In this regard I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 255, 257 and 258 dated 28 January 1998.  As I stated then, compatibility of forestry development with the environment is the essential element of the Government's afforestation programme.  Compliance with the existing forestry guidelines on landscape, fisheries and archaeology as well as a wide range of additional environmental controls is a condition of grant-aid.  As there is no evidence of widespread non-grant aided afforestation these controls are sufficient to prevent environmentally destructive afforestation.</P>

      <P>I met representatives of Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Commissioners on 10 February 1998 to discuss their proposals for the development of the harbour.</P>
      <P>At that meeting the group presented me with &ldquo;a proposed development plan for Baltimore Harbour, preliminary report prepared for Cork County Council by D. J. Fitzgibbon and Associates&rdquo;.  This study, which my Department had agreed to co-fund with Cork County Council, examined a previous feasibility study carried out by the Nautical Enterprise Centre which was also funded by my Department.  The report outlines development options at a cost of over £3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> The revenues generated by port users of some £8,000 per annum would not be sufficient to sustain a development of the extent proposed in the development plan submitted by the Harbours Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I indicated at the meeting that the relevant administrative and technical services of the Department would examine the report in the context of other ongoing studies and revert to the Harbour Commissioners in due course.</P>
    <P>In the context of other studies relevant to consideration of these proposals, the Deputy may be aware that in October 1997 my Department appointed consultants to undertake a national EU funded seaport capacity study incorporating a comprehensive physical inventory of existing seaport capacity at all seaports, including Baltimore Harbour.  The study findings will inform policy decisions on the development and maintenance of adequate infrastructural capacity at strategic Irish ports to cope with increasing volumes of tourism and trade and underpin future development plans to deliver that capacity.  The report of the consultants is expected to be completed by end April 1998.</P>
    <P>The Government has committed in the Action Programme for the Millennium and in Partnership 2000 to review the strategic options for the future development and management of ports whose commercial activity has declined and to transferring small harbours to local control to develop marine leisure activities.  the proposed development plan will also be considered in that context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined in my earlier reply to the House my approach to progressing the recommendations of the salmon management task force for a salmon tagging and quota regime.  The technical report commissioned from the Marine Institute outlines the three year programme of action needed to deliver a &ldquo;real time&rdquo; salmon management system. I have put that report out for discussion, analysis <Col N="511" /> and feedback on the practical realities of delivering on this ambitious agenda.  Concurrently the process of assessing the legislative, staffing, funding and enforcement implications inherent in this programme is under way.</P>
    <P>Reliable and consistent scientific and catch data on the status of salmon stocks are essential to inform salmon management strategies at catchment and national level for determining spawning targets and for quantifying and setting sustainable catch levels.  The need for more fish counters in key salmonid rivers and catchments which will provide objective &ldquo;realtime&rdquo; data on stocks is being addressed through the current fish counter programme being undertaken by the Marine Institute and the Salmon Research Agency. Ongoing tagging programmes for scientific purposes, as opposed to carcase tagging which is a separate issue, and the development of databases will also contribute to an enhanced capability to accurately quantify the status of salmon stocks, thus informing and underpinning ongoing conservation and management strategies for the salmon resource.</P>

      <P>In the debate at the Fisheries Council last week on fisheries monitoring and control, I underlined to ministerial colleagues and the Commissioner the critical importance which Ireland attaches to ensuring a level playing field in fisheries enforcement and that I want to see demonstrable commitment and co-operation by all member states in the implementation of existing rules.  I stressed that fishermen everywhere need to be convinced of the benefits of enforcement, in the first instance by demonstrating that the rules are being uniformly enforced and observed across the EU.  Practical action to improve transparency and co-operation is essential to build a better climate of confidence among fishermen in the system which will lead to better compliance.</P>

      <P>I am fully satisfied that there is no conflict of interest in relation to my role in protecting fresh water fisheries and the current afforestation programme.</P>
      <P>Compatibility of forestry development with the environment is the essential element of the Government's afforestation programme and is a basic principle of grant aid.  As virtually all forest planting in Ireland is subject to grant aid, the controls operated by the Forest Service of my Department ensure that environmental concerns, particularly in respect of water quality, are fully taken into account.</P>
      <P>The current forestry and fisheries guidelines specifically prohibit the planting of conifers in close proximity to rivers, lakes or streams and this applies even in non-sensitive areas where the soils are well buffered.  There is no evidence to suggest that the decline in trout and salmon stocks is in any way attributed to forestry.  Indeed, the forestry impacts adjacent to our lakes and rivers are insignificant compared to agricultural and industrial effluents.</P>
      <P>The recent Aquafor report published last year highlighted the interactions between plantation forestry and aquatic ecology, some of which were negative, particularly in some of the most acid sensitive regions in the country.  However, the study concluded that it would be wrong to extrapolate from these areas to the whole country, or to conclude that forestry as a whole, has a net negative effect on aquatic ecology.  The Aquafor study was carried out on forests which ware established long before the current guidelines on forestry and fisheries were introduced in 1992.  These guidelines are currently being reviewed and will take cognisance of the findings of the Aquafor study.</P>

      <P>A &ldquo;needs&rdquo; study of the Irish coast carried out in 1992 by the National Coastal Erosion <Col N="515" /> Committee of the County and City Engineers' Association estimated that, out of the 5,800 kilometres of coastline within the State, some 1,500 kilometres are at risk from erosion. Research cited in the report on coastal zone management policy prepared for my Department and the Departments of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and Environment and Local Government by Brady Shipman Martin estimates that coastal erosion causes a loss of land area of between 160 and 300 hectares a year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, under international law submarines travelling on the surface have the right of innocent passage, without notification, through territorial waters. They may, on the other hand, pass freely through international waters whether on the surface or submerged.</P>
      <P>I, as Minister with responsibility for safety of life at sea as well as for the shipping and fishing sectors, have concerns regarding the dangers posed by submarines and am committed to taking every possible measure to focus the attention of the international maritime community on these hazards and to highlight the need for constant vigilance on the part of those who operate such vessels.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall it was at the Irish Government's initiative that a resolution was passed unanimously by the General Assembly of the IMO in November 1991 on the avoidance by submerged submarines of fishing vessels and their fishing gear.</P>
      <P>The terms of the resolution are first, to ensure that submarines navigating through areas where vessels are known to fish use all available means for determining the presence of such vessels and their fishing gear; second, to ensure that a submerged submarine, if information on the presence of a fishing vessel and its fishing gear is available, will avoid that fishing vessel and any fishing gear connected to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that there has not, since adoption of this resolution, been a notified incident where it has been established that a submarine was involved with an Irish vessel is a testament to its <Col N="516" /> effectiveness.  That being said, it is my intention to keep the question of submarine activity under review and to liaise, where necessary and appropriate, with other governments and the IMO to ensure compliance with the IMO resolution.</P>

      <P>In 1997 an expert group comprising representatives of Waterford Harbour Commissioners, New Ross Port Company, officials of my Department and an independent marine consultant reviewed and reported on the organisation of pilotage in the Waterford Estuary.</P>
      <P>A key recommendation of the group was that from an organisational and deployment of resources perspective, a single pilotage authority would be the best option for the estuary.  The group also recommended that a combined management committee representative of both port authorities would, in consultation with the pilots concerned, address the economic, human and other resource implications arising from the establishment of a single pilotage service as well as preparing detailed cost projections.  The primary remit of the management committee is to determine the safest, most efficient and cost effective organisation and administration of the pilotage area.</P>

It is an offence under the Fisheries Acts to engage in sea fishing without the appropriate authorisations.</P>
      <P>The scheme referred to by the Deputy is a special one intended to regularise the position of mainly small vessels which, although part of the fishing fleet, have never been formally licensed or registered.

      <P>I am aware of the survey conducted by consumer organisations on passenger ferry services operating on the major routes between Ireland, Britain and France, in the North and Baltic Seas and in the Mediterranean.  I note that the survey did not cover the <i>Isle of Inishmore</i>, which as the Deputy will be aware is the newlybuilt superferry operating on the Dublin-Holyhead route.</P>
      <P>My Department has looked at the results of the survey and I am satisfied that our existing legislative and inspection regime for safety on ferries is in line with, and in many respects exceeds, international and EU standards.</P>
      <P>The Marine Survey Office of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources operates a strict year-round inspection programme for all ferries using Irish ports.  This programme is designed to ensure strict compliance with national, international and EU safety standards. The programme also encourages a culture of safety, reliability and best practice.</P>
      <P>Irish-registered passenger vessels are subjected annually to a thorough inspection for the renewal of their passenger and safety certificates.  These vessels are required to be equipped, maintained and inspected to the highest international standards.  Foreign-registered vessels using Irish ports are also inspected regularly in exercise of Ireland's obligation as a port State.</P>

    <P>My Department liaises, on an on-going basis, with ferry operators in particular through the National Ferry Safety Committee, which is <Col N="518" /> chaired by the chief surveyor, where senior technical representatives from all ferry companies using Irish ports are represented and jointly discuss safety issues.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be fully aware of my total commitment to the safety of passengers and crews of all Irish vessels and other vessels operating in Irish waters.  I am disappointed that the ratings in the survey are not the highest awardable under the survey methodology.

      <P>Last year's disappointing outturn was due to a number of factors such as farmers postponing planting decisions in anticipation of the improved grant and premium rates which I introduced last October and the then uncompetitive position of forestry <i>vis-a-vis</i> other EU funded programmes.</P>

      <P>I have regularly underlined to the House my commitment to finding workable solutions to the flagship problem and in particular to mounting, through strict and intensive enforcement, an effective ban on the illegal activities of all fishing vessels, irrespective of nationality, in our waters.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to address the flagship issue from three key strategic perspectives.  The first is to ensure that the activities of flagships fishing in our waters are rigorously controlled and monitored at sea and on land.  The second is to press the other member states concerned to play their full part in properly controlling and monitoring the activities and landings of flagships.  The third is to work with the Commission and likeminded member states in order to ensure the necessary link between the economic benefits of national fish quotas and the coastal communities concerned.</P>
      <P>While our own fisheries protection services at sea and on land are co-operating closely to ensure that fisheries protection and control operates with maximum effectiveness, there are particular enforcement difficulties associated with the activities of flagships.  Other member states have legal responsibilities in this regard and I am continually pressing at European level for better practical co-operation between member states and a level playing field on fisheries enforcement. At last week's Fisheries Council, I stressed once again the need for collective initiatives in this regard and notably to deliver better monitoring and control of flagships to back up Ireland's endeavours as the coastal state most directly affected.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the principle that there should be a demonstrable link between a fishing vessel and the member state in which it is registered, in order to ensure that the economic benefits of national quotas accrue to the relevant fisheries communities.  Discussions are ongoing between the Commission and concerned member states on how best to achieve that objective commensurate with Treaty obligations.</P>
      <P>I will continue to push both at EU level and directly with other member states to deliver workable solutions to the problems posed by flagships and their fishing activities in the interests of the Irish fishing sector and the viability of fish stocks in our waters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scope for expansion of the catch capacity of the Irish fishing fleet over the next three years will be determined by a number of key factors, notably the tonnage/effort parameters for the fleet to be met under the national programme for MGP IV up to end 2001.  EU decisions year to year on the level of total allowable catches (and by extension the national quotas), which take into account conservation, sustainability and economic considerations, will also influence the scope for expanding catch capacity.  Within those parameters, my objective is to enhance the capacity and efficiency of the whitefish fleet and the quality of landings in particular to allow for full and effective take up of available quota opportunities and to develop new opportunities in non quota species.  I will also be working to ensure that all potential catch opportunities in quota and non quota pelagic species in EU and international waters as well as under EU agreements with third countries are maximised for the existing pelagic Irish fleet.</P>
      <P>The fleet modernisation programme under the Fisheries Operational Programme and my recently announced plans for capital grant aid and tax incentives for new whitefish vessels will support investment to deliver a safer, more competitive and efficient whitefish fleet capacity.  The corollary of increased high quality fish landings is the need to ensure the necessary onshore infrastructure and services to the fleet as well as continued expansion in fish processing capacity which will deliver added value job creation, quality and competitiveness.  Catches and landings must be closely matched to onshore demand thus ensuring a proper synergy between producers and market requirements.  In light of this strategic objective, I am working to deliver the necessary additional funding to support investment in onshore and processing facilities.</P>

      <P>I expect to receive a detailed progress report shortly from the Central Fisheries Board on the actions which the board is taking to deliver on the six point water quality action plan <Col N="523" /> which I announced last August.  Discussions are ongoing involving the Department, the Central and Regional Fisheries Board and the Department of the Environment and Local Government to ensure co-operation and complementarity in the use of all available resources to improve and protect water quality fisheries in advance of the critical summer months.  As previously undertaken I will advise the Deputy of the fully up-to-date position as soon as the Central Fisheries Board reports to me.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1 July 1997 46 licences have been granted by my Department for fish culture operations.</P>
      <P>Certain provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997 came into operation on 26 February 1998, by virtue of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 (Commencement) Order, 1998 (S.I. No. 46 of 1998) made by me. Those provisions, which are listed in the schedule to this reply, include sections 65 (2) (3), 66 and 67 which provide important new powers to deal with illegal aquaculture operations.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of that order was to enable me to make the necessary detailed regulations in relation to applications for aquaculture licences and to prescribe appropriate organisations to nominate persons for appointment by me as ordinary members (6) of the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board.  Work is well advanced in preparing the necessary regulations and I will soon be inviting nominations from the prescribed organisations.  The chairperson will be appointed by the Government.  All going well, I expect to be able to proceed with commencing most of the rest of the Act within the next month or two and I shall advise the Deputies as soon as I make the further commencement order needed.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to consider the question of commencing sections 11 (prohibition on persons engaging in aquaculture in anticipation of grant of licence) and 13 (period for determination of applications for licences) of the Act until late in the year, that is, after operating the Act for a sufficient period.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> The contracts for such staff provide details of their respective annual leave allowances.  The annual leave allowance is subject to the usual conditions which apply to the civil service regarding the granting of annual leave.  Requests for annual leave were made by contract staff to the Minister and-or private secretary as appropriate. Payment in respect of untaken annual leave was calculated by reference to returns being submitted to the Department's personnel unit immediately prior to the change of Government.</P>
    <P>None of those named above who received payments at the time of the change of Government in 1997 had received payments at the time of the previous change of Government in 1994.</P>
    <P>The conditions governing termination-severance payments to former personal staff of Ministers and Ministers of State are not set out comprehensively in the conditions of service of such staff.</P>
    <P>Two Government decisons in 1982 and 1987 provided for the payment of severance to personal staff of Ministers and Minister of State who had no jobs when their employment terminated. The conditions were enhanced in 1994 (following a Labour Court recommendation in relation to secretarial assistants) to provide for the greater of two months' pay or four weeks' pay for each year of service.</P>
    <P>Only one individual, who was serving as special adviser to the then Minister of State with responsibility for Labour Affairs resigned prior to the change of Government in 1997.</P>
    <P>In the term of the last Government, negotiations were held with or on behalf of certain personal staff which resulted in the arrangements being applied to some staff where other circumstances applied.  In the case of this individual, a case for the application of similar terms was accepted, I understand, on the basis that she was entitled to continue working under her existing contract as special adviser to the former Minister of State with responsibility for Labour Affairs, until such time as she had to be nominated to the returning officer as a candidate in the 1997 Dáil election.  In fact, the adviser resigned her position on 16 February 1997 and was paid a severance payment of £5,536.</P>

      <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, when operative, in the next month or two, will provide a modern licensing framework for all aquaculture, including an independent Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board to consider appeals against licensing decisions.  A full environmental impact assessment will be required for all proposed finfish developments, and the extent to which an environmental impact study will be required in other cases is under consideration. Applications for licences will be considered on a bay by bay basis as to take account of all relevant factors including environmental impacts.  Funding has been provided on an ongoing basis under the Operational Programme for Fisheries 1094-1999 for the upgrading of piers and slipways which service the aquaculture industry.  The acknowledged infrastructure requirements of the industry will continue to be prioritised and addressed, within the limitations of currently available funding for fishery harbour development.</P>

    <P>In addition to continuing with the programme of modernisation of existing vessels, I have announced my plans for a capital grant aid scheme for investment in new boats for the whitefish fleet using available funding within the Operational Programme up to 1999.  I have also secured, in this year's Finance Act, an exceptional package of tax incentives to attract investment into the fleet.  This programme will be the subject <Col N="556" /> of discussion in the coming weeks with the EU Commission.  I believe that this package will help to ensure the safety, competitiveness, and long, term future of the fishing fleet and related employment.</P>

      <P>As the Minister responsible for safety at sea, I am conscious of the need for continued updating of our maritime law.  In this regard, I have developed a comprehensive programme of work over the next three years which will bring Ireland to the forefront <i>vis-a-vis</i> best international practice.</P>
      <P>A priority remains to implement the recommendations of the fishing vessel safety review group to minimise the risk of loss of life among the fishing community.  This includes the implementation into Irish law of EU Council Directive</P>
      <P>97/70/EC which set up a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over.</P>
      <P>I also intend over this period to implement all relevant international maritime organisation safety conventions including amendments to SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) and STCW (Standards of Training Certification of Watch-keeping for Seafarers) Conventions and to give continued support to the IMO in the way of professional contributions to international negotiations.  In this regard, the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, which puts in place a mandatory safety management system on board vessels will come into operation for certain vessels from July of this year.  All relevant Irish vessels have been certified and my Department's Marine Surveyors, as Port State Control Officers, have a major role to play on the international front to ensure that foreign vessels, including ferries, visiting Irish ports comply with this code, in an attempt to eliminate sub-standard shipping worldwide.</P>
      <P>I am committed also to implementing all EU Directives on safety matters as they arise, to amending merchant shipping legislation as necessary, to initiating a new marine casualty investigation system, to developing and resourcing the Irish Marine Emergency Service as a coastguard and to ensuring co-operation with other marine safety agencies in extending/developing their safety infrastructures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and my Department will continue to promote safety awareness among the maritime community <Col N="557" /> at all levels in order that loss of life and marine casualties can be avoided as far as possible.</P>

      <P>EU and Exchequer funding under the Fisheries Operational programme will continue to support targeted investment of over £126 million in the fishing sector to end 1999 in order to maintain and enhance its contribution to the national economy and in particular its contribution to growth and employment in coastal communities, under the investment programmes for fleet modernisation, fishery harbour development, fish processing, marketing, training and research.</P>
      <P>Funding under the PESCA Community Initiative is supporting fishing communities to diversity and to support alternative activities.  EU support remaining under the PESCA Community Initiative is nearly £3 million up to 1999.</P>
      <P>There has been very satisfactory take up of investment support to date by the fishing sector. I am satisfied that remaining funding will be fully taken up over the lifetime of the programme.  I recently announced my plans for a new grant aid programme using available funding under the OP to support capital investment in new vessels for the whitefish fleet.  This will complement the tax incentives package to attract investment into the fleet which I secured in this year's Finance Act.  I am confident that this investment support, approval for which will be negotiated in coming weeks with the Commission, will generate significant investment in the renewal of the whitefish fleet in the medium term.</P>

      <P>On 9 March 1997 a collision involving the Irish fishing vessel <i>Exodus</i> and the UK registered Spanish fishing vessel <i>Sea Horse</i> resulted in a tragic loss of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Marine surveyors of my Department conducted a preliminary investigation into the incident under section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  As a result of evidence gathered in the course of this inquiry, the skipper of the <Col N="559" /><i>Sea Horse</i> was charged with offences under the Collision Regulations (Ships and Watercraft of the Water) Order, 1984 (S.I. No. 29 of 1984), as amended.</P>
    <P>At Bantry District Court on Friday, 11 April 1997 the skipper pleaded guilty to the charge that he failed to ensure that his vessel, while under way, kept out of the way of a vessel engaged in fishing.  The defendant was fined £750 and ordered to pay £250 costs.</P>
    <P>Any incidents of threatening or unsafe behaviour at sea are a matter of serious concern.  I have conveyed my concerns directly in bilateral discussions to the UK and Spanish Ministers about recent incidents, and have urged their active co-operation in preventing reckless behaviour which has such serious safety dimensions.  In particular, I am anxious that the relevant authorities work with us to encourage conflict avoidance measures and to ensure that there are appropriate channels for the formal reporting of follow-up and response to such incidents when they arise.  A formal reporting mechanism, as opposed to anecdotal reporting which is often the case, will enable the authorities to quantify, log and follow up on all such incidents.</P>

      <P>The current national salmon and sea trout fish counter programme under the aegis of the Marine Institute will see the progressive installation of 14 additional fish counters on key catchments and refurbishment of two existing fish counters by end 1999.  Most of these counters are scheduled to be in place by end of this year.  The total cost of the investment programme is projected to be around £540,000 the bulk of which is EU funded.</P>
      <P>Fish counters are an essential management tool in the quantifying and monitoring of salmon and sea trout stocks and spawning targets, which in turn informs ongoing management conservation and development strategies.  The present counter installation programme will give a significant enhanced level of regional catchment coverage. The programme will be evaluated on an ongoing basis as the counters become operational with a view to further expansion of the counter network after 1999.</P>

A record of leave entitlements and leave taken is maintained in respect of all ministerial personal staff.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>Preparations for the second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) to be held in London from 2-4 April are being carried out at meetings of Foreign Ministers and senior officials.  There have been a number of such meetings since the first Asia-Europe Meeting in Bangkok in March 1996; most recently, a meeting of senior officials took place in London in February 1998.  A meeting of Foreign Ministers will take place in London on 2 April, following a meeting of senior officials on the same day.  There have been a number of discussions within the EU to prepare a co-ordinated EU position, and the issue was discussed by the General Affairs Council on 30 March.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been participating actively in this work because of the importance the Government attaches to the ASEM process and to developing our bilateral contacts with the Asian countries which the ASEM process affords.  While there is no formal agenda for the summit, the chairman, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, has written to the Taoiseach a letter of invitation, which sets out the programme and the principal areas of discussion for the meeting.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Taoiseach intends to make a statement to the Dáil following his attendance at the Summit.</P>
      <P>The situation of Indonesia is a matter of serious concern and is likely to be discussed at the Summit.  In the bilateral meeting with the Indonesian Foreign Minister which is being sought, the situation in East Timor will of course be raised.  The Government fully supports the ongoing talks between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General on East Timor, and supports also the intra Timorese dialogue meetings, which are also under the auspices of the Secretary-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Burma, the Government, with its EU partners, have asked ASEAN to use its influence with the new member of ASEAN to improve the political and human rights situation in Burma, including the holding of talks between the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) and Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD and other groups.  Membership of ASEM is by consensus of all the members and I can assure the House that Ireland and its European partners would not be able to make a positive response to an application by Burma until such time as there has been significant improvement in the situation there. <Col N="565" /> Ensuring respect for human rights has always been a fundamental consideration in Ireland's approach to ASEM.  This will especially be the case in this year of the 50th anniversary of the UN Declaration on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>The trade facilitation action plan and the investment promotion action programme are framework documents intended to promote increased two-way trade and investment flows between the European and Asian partners in the ASEM process.  The plan and the programme are very general in content and rely on action by individual ASEM partners to implement their objectives.  As such, it is not expected that they will need to be monitored for their social or environmental impact.  Likewise, it is not believed that there will be a need to apply the ILO conventions on core labour standards to either the plan or the programme.  I am arranging for copies of both documents to be placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>Each member state of ASEM is entitled to have one member on the Board of Governors of the Asia Europe Foundation (ASEF).  The Irish Governor is Mr. Sean G. Ronan, a distinguished former Irish diplomat whose Ambassadorial postings included Japan and Korea.  ASEF is a relatively new body and I would welcome the appropriate involvement of NGOs in its work programme as that develops.  I have taken note of the Deputy's suggestion that ASEM begin a process of agreeing transparent and binding mechanisms for controlling arms sales.  I would welcome any steps that could be agreed which would contribute to a reduction in the arms trade, as this is an important objective of our foreign policy.  However, under the agreed framework for the operation of ASEM, there is no provision for binding arrangements of this nature to be put in force, and I would not be optimistic that consensus for the inclusion of such a provision would be obtained.</P>
    <P>I have also noted the suggestion that ASEM Governments discuss the protection of refugees <Col N="566" /> and migrant workers and will consider how this could best be achieved.</P>

Their contracts of employment stated that the annual leave allowance was subject to the usual conditions regarding the granting of such leave but did not specifically refer to the maintenance of leave sheets.  In this instance it appears that formal leave sheets were not maintained.  The granting of annual leave is a function delegated to line management in the Department of Defence.  The office of the Minister monitors leave arrangements for ministerial contract staff.  The Deputy may be assured that there was full reconciliation of annual leave entitlements at termination of contract stage.</P>

      <P>The payment in question was a top-up <Col N="571" /> payment under the first round of the BSE compensation package.  In order to compensate producers at the earliest possible opportunity the regulation governing these payments required that the initial top-up should be based on the number of eligible animals under the 1995 schemes and also required that there should be adjustments upwards and downwards later on to ultimately reflect the number of eligible animals under the 1996 schemes.</P>
      <P>The person in question had 12 eligible animals under the 1995 special beef premium scheme but had no eligible animals under the 1996 special beef scheme which in effect meant that he had no entitlement to BSE compensation as the crisis occurred in 1996.  As a consequence the money must be recovered.  The moneys so recovered will become the pool of money to compensate those farmers who had more eligible animals in 1996 than in 1995.</P>
      <P>Regrettably I have no discretion to waive the requirement to pay back the amount outstanding as the precise arrangements governing the BSE compensation payments are detailed in European Council Regulation 1357/96 and are not therefore negotiable at this point.</P>

      <P>The movement permit system for female animals moving to slaughter or to export was introduced in September 1996.  The arrangement whereby permits could be issued at marts was introduced in respect of animals moving direct to slaughter or export on the evening of the sale only and on the basis that applications could be checked by the technical agricultural officer against the herd files held in district veterinary offices.  As these offices are not open on Saturdays, such essential checks cannot be carried out.</P>
      <P>The implementation of a computerised movement monitoring system which is being developed is likely to obviate the need for the continuation of the female movement permit system.</P>

      <P>There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance (and double rate bands) is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v</i> the Attorney General <Col N="582" /> (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances.  An interdepartmental working group has been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  This group is due to report by the middle of this year.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works, following consideration of the possibility of using the property to meet other State accommodation requirements in Drogheda, had recently decided that the building is not suitable for such purposes and should be disposed of as surplus to the State's property requirements.</P>

      <P>The only contract awarded by my Department within the past seven years without advertisement for public tender, and which it might be argued fell within the criteria for public advertisement and tender as required by EU or national legislation, was a contract my Department has had since 1977 with Reuters Limited for the provision of information services.  The contract has been renewed every two years.  In November 1995 my Department was subscribing to both Reuters and its main competitor for the type of service that was required at that time.  My Department did a thorough review of its information service requirements and decided that Reuters best met its requirements and offered best value for money. As a consequence of that review the decision not to continue the contract with the other supplier was taken.  The two-year equivalent amount of the contract renewed on 27 November 1995 moved above the EU Commission threshold for EU public advertisement and tendering purposes for the first time.  At the most recent renewal of the contract on 27 November 1997, the value of the Reuters contract was below the Commission's threshold and, therefore, EU public advertisement and tendering procedures were not required to be followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only contracts which fall within the criteria for public advertisement and tender as required by EU or national legislation awarded by any of the bodies under the aegis of my Department without advertisement for public tender during the past seven years were a number of contracts awarded by the Office of Public Works to which special security measures applied and which, as <Col N="584" /> provided for in the directives, are exempted from the normal procedures.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 309 of 24 March 1998, the persons concerned who were in receipt of social welfare payments will be worse off financially as a result of one person taking up employment in view of the effects of the tax treatment of income earned.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples and in this regard I would point out that there is no provision in tax law which would permit the granting of married person's tax allowances and tax rate bands to cohabiting couples.  Each partner is taxed individually, as a single person, and in calculating the liability of each party no reference is made to the tax affairs of the other party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the previous question referred to the tax treatment in the forthcoming 1998-9 tax year of community employment scheme wages which are subject to income tax. Arising from income tax changes announced in the budget, a single person will normally be entitled to a tax free allowance of £3,950 in the 1998-9 tax year, comprising £3,150 personal allowance and £800 PAYE allowance.  This is equivalent to a weekly tax free allowance of £75.96. The weekly taxable income on the normal CE payment of £86.75 will therefore be £10.79, <Col N="585" /> which at the new reduced standard rate of tax of 24 per cent corresponds to £2.59 tax payable per week compared to £4.06 in 1997-8.  There will be no liability to employee PRSI in the 1998-9 tax year where weekly earnings do not exceed £100 per week.  In summary, therefore, participants in community employment with the normal gross wage of £86.75 per week will see their tax and PRSI deductions fall by £1.77 from £4.36 to £2.59 following the beginning of the new tax year in April.</P>
    <P>Exemption from tax or relief under the marginal relief system, may apply in a case such as this due to the level of income involved. However, without knowledge of the full circumstances of the case it is not possible to give a definitive answer on this point.  Should the taxpayer contact his or her Inspector of Taxes giving full details of his or her circumstances, his or her case may then be reviewed and marginal relief or exemption applied where appropriate.</P>

      <P>The first part of the initiative provides a special tax deduction for the employee.  This will be an additional tapering personal tax free allowance and an allowance for each qualifying child for a three year period as follows.</P>

    <P>To benefit under the scheme an individual must have been unemployed for at least 12 months and be in receipt of unemployment benefit, unemployed assistance or one-parent family allowance.</P>
    <P>Time spent on certain FÁS schemes or back to education schemes administered by the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs qualify as period of unemployment provided the individual has been in receipt of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or one-parent family allowance immediately prior to commencing the training.</P>

      <Col N="586" /> A qualifying employment under the scheme is one where the employment commences on or after the 6 April 1998; is for a minimum of 30 hours; and is capable of lasting at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>The second part of the initiative is a double tax deduction for employers who employ the long-term unemployed person.  The double deduction will cover wages and employer's PRSI contributions and can last up to 36 months provided the previously long-term unemployed person is still employed by them.</P>

The drug in question is available to patients on a &ldquo;named patient&rdquo;&ldquo;compassionate use&rdquo; basis; it is not available on the general medical services, GMS scheme.</P>
      <P>Health boards may provide assistance towards the cost of items which are not covered by the GMS scheme.  Assistance of this kind is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.  The South-Eastern Health Board has indicated that individuals are usually expected to contribute the first £15 of the monthly cost, with the balance being met by the patient.  Accordingly, in this case, while the total monthly cost of the medicine is £24.56, the patient in question only pays £15 per month.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 to 165, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The statistical information requested by the Deputy is listed in the table below.  The monitoring of annual leave of the previous Administration's ministerial staff was handled directly by the Minister and Ministers of State and any claims for untaken annual leave were verified by the Ministers in question.  Two persons working as part-time personal secretaries to one of the Ministers of State resigned before the change of Government in 1997.  No payments as described in the question were made to either person.  No ministerial staff member who received payments in 1994 arising from the change of Government also received payments in 1997.</P>

This will facilitate a speedier assessment of couples who wish to adopt children abroad.</P>
      <P>I understand the current waiting time prior to assessment in the Eastern Health Board is 12 months; a reduction of two months on 1997.  This reduction can be accounted for by the addition of one further social work post and to greater efficiencies in the overall process of application.</P>
      <P>I understand applications for assessments by prospective adopters in the Eastern Health Board area are dealt with in strict numerical order.</P>

      <P>Under the dental treatment services scheme, which was introduced by my Department on 1 November 1994, dental treatment will be extended to all adults with medical card eligibility on a phased basis.  In the initial phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 November 1994, emergency dental treatment was made available to all adults.  Routine dental treatment, which would include fillings, cleaning and the provision of partial dentures, and priority full denture treatment was made available to persons 65 years of age or older.  Under the second phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 June 1996, routine dental treatment was extended to persons in the 16 to 34 year age group and full denture treatment was extended to all edentulous &mdash; no natural teeth &mdash; adults.</P>
      <P>All health boards operate a priority waiting list for dental treatment for medically compromised persons who are given priority, irrespective of age, on production of a letter from their general medical practitioner.  I will extend routine treatment under the scheme to persons in the 35 to 64 year age group as the necessary additional resources become available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>The process of establishment of strategic policy committees (SPCs), is under way in county and city councils.  It is now a matter for each local authority to set up a committee structure suitable to their needs in accordance with detailed guidelines entitled &ldquo;Strategic Policy Committees &mdash; Guidelines for establishment and operation&rdquo; as issued to all relevant local authorities in November 1997 for distribution to members and relevant staff.  They are also available in the Oireachtas Library.  The guidelines are based on the work of a group which included local authority members, management, my Department and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines, paragraph 4.3-10 in particular, set out advice on the involvement of a range of <Col N="596" /> sectoral interests in these committees, including the community, voluntary and disadvantaged sectors.  The guidelines advise that groups from any particular sector should be active in the area of the local authority and/or have a county/city wide remit, or operate in a number of localities in the area.</P>
    <P>The guidelines have since been followed up by a national seminar day on SPCs held on 5 February, 1998 to further assist local authorities involved in setting up and implementing SPC schemes.  The proceedings, together with further guidance to authorities arising from the seminar including in particular the position of town authorities and their county SPCs, have been issued and copies of the document, &ldquo;Focus on Strategic Policy Committees &mdash; Update March 1998: Guidelines and Seminar Proceedings&rdquo;, have been widely distributed and supplied to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>It is now up to the local authorities to move ahead with the necessary arrangements for the establishment of SPCs, including the involvement of sectoral interests, in line with the guidelines and taking account of local circumstances. Decisions in particular cases are entirely a matter for the local authority concerned to whom any queries should be addressed; there is no provision for intervention by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development plan of a local authority is essentially concerned with regularising land use in the authority's area. The Local Government (Planning &amp; Development) Act, 1963, as amended, sets out mandatory and optional objectives to be included in a development plan.  Among the mandatory objectives is the identification of particular areas for particular purposes, such as residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural or otherwise.  In deciding on land use objectives in the context of the proper planning and development of their area, it is open to local authorities to take into consideration, as they consider appropriate, social issues such as employment.  This will be among the aspects of development plans which will be considered for inclusion in the proposed guidelines for local authorities on the scope and content of development plans which are in the course of preparation in my Department.  Furthermore, in the major review of planning legislation now under way, I will be considering whether there is a need to amend the present legislative provisions in this respect. <Col N="597" /> Under the new urban renewal scheme which will come into effect on 1 August 1998, designations for urban renewal will be based on the concept of integrated area plans which will address not only issues of physical development such as appropriate use, quality of design and conservation, but will also cover wider issues of local socio-economic benefit including training, education and social housing.</P>

      <P>Section 25 of the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, provides that fines imposed by the courts on persons convicted of offences under the Act are paid to the prosecuting local authorities.  The courts area is also required in such cases to award to the local authorities their costs in respect of the investigation, detection and prosecution of offences and their costs and expenses in the collection and disposal of any litter to which the prosecutions relate, unless there are substantial reasons for not doing so.</P>
      <P>While the more rigorous enforcement by local authorities of the relevant provisions of the 1997 Act, which I am encouraging, would generate increased revenue, the employment of litter wardens by local authorities is not conditional on the costs involved being recouped from such revenue.</P>

      <P>The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 1993, oblige landlords of rented dwellings to ensure that they comply with certain minimum standards, including their structural condition.  The regulations require that all out offices, yards and forecourts within the curtilage of the building containing the dwelling and all boundary walls, fences and railings be maintained in good repair.  Local authorities, which are responsible for the enforcement of the regulations, have been urged to take all steps open to them to secure compliance with their provisions. The Litter Pollution Act, 1997, section 6, requires the owners of any land appurtenant to a residence that is let in two or more dwellings to keep the land free of litter if it is visible to any extent from a public place.  The occupiers of such dwellings also have a statutory duty not to create litter.  In addition, the occupier of properties located within the confines of a speed limit area, other <Col N="604" /> than the general or motorway speed limits, are required to keep free of litter any footpaths or pavements adjoining the road.</P>

      <P>This year the Government has allocated £1.5 million for support for the voluntary organisations providing marriage and child counselling services.  This is an additional £600,000 over last year.  Responsibility for this area was transferred to my Department from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The scheme of grants for 1998 for these services will be launched on Thursday next. The scheme will be advertised in the provincial press on Thursday 2 April and in the national daily newspapers on Friday 3 April 1998.</P>
      <P>The family mediation service is a State run service which is now under the aegis of my Department, following its transfer from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The allocation for the service has been increased to £900,000 this year, a threefold increase from the previous year.  At present the service is available in Dublin and Limerick.  The extra allocation will allow for the provision of a number of additional centres around the country and I hope to be announcing details in the near future.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are under way to establish the family affairs unit which will have responsibility for a number of family services including support for the marriage and child counselling services and the family mediation service.  Additional resources were provided in the 1998 budget in respect of five posts for the new unit.  The unit will comprise eight staff, four of whom have been already assigned and a further three will be assigned when the work in relation to the Commission on the Family is finalised.  The family affairs unit is located in the Department's offices in Clare House, Marlborough Street, Dublin 1.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme is to provide a financial incentive to long-term unemployed people to return to work.  The scheme has a limited number of places and is targeted at people on unemployment payments, one-parent family payment and permanently incapacitated people in receipt of disability allowance or blind pension.  The person concerned took up employment on 26 January 1998.  Prior to this she had been in receipt of disability benefit, from 12 December 1997 to 8 January 1998.  Disability benefit is not a qualifying payment for the scheme and the person concerned is, therefore, not entitled to the allowance. This decision was conveyed to the person concerned on 19 February 1998.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, (i) have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age; (ii) have at least 156 contributions paid; and, (iii) have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, or 24 in the case of a retirement pension, registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.  The yearly average condition was reduced to ten contributions for the new <i>pro-rata</i> old age (contributory) pension which came into force with effect from 21 November last.  To qualify, a person with a yearly average of between ten and <Col N="609" /> 19 must have 260 rather than 156 paid contributions.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable &mdash; national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions.  These gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
      <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of this pension.  However, social insurance paid before 1953 under the national health insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age contributory pension purposes in satisfying the first two conditions, set out in the first paragraph above, but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and to certain people with disabilities under the age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  At the end of last January, about 505,000 people qualified for free travel at an annual cost of £33 million.</P>
      <P>The scheme was extended in 1995 to cover cross-Border travel between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It is available to passholders in Ireland, their spouses or companions in the case of people holding companion passes, and to Northern Ireland concession travel passholders. Any extension of the scheme on the lines suggested by the Deputy would involve additional expenditure which could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>With regard to funding, a provisional allocation of £2 million was earmarked for the proposed visitor centre under the tourism operational programme 1994-99.  As stated in my reply of 24 February, however, it is unrealistic at this stage to expect that the centre could be provided before the end of 1999.  Accordingly, no allocation has been made for the centre in 1998.  An application for funding will be included in the next tranche of European Regional Development Fund funds.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222, 238 and 239 together.</P>
      <P>Based on information supplied by the Mountjoy prison authorities, the position is that the doctors referred to visited Mountjoy prison on a total of 159 days during 1997.  One doctor visited on 49 days and the other on 110 days.</P>
      <P>In relation to the doctors referred to, locum payments were made for a total of 114 days and 61 days respectively amounting to £10,989.  The total locum cost for the male prison was £12,345. The total cost of medical care for Mountjoy male prison in 1997 was £99,195.</P>
      <P>In view of concerns expressed over a period of time regarding the efficient provision of medical services within Mountjoy prison my Department has sought through the provision of a new common contract, which has been accepted by the Irish Medical Organisation and a significant majority of prison doctors, to provide a mechanism for improving prison medical services where required.  Unfortunately, a small number of doctors have to date declined to accept this new contract.  My Department is currently engaged in discussion with the Irish Medical Organisation aimed at resolving this impasse.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 and 225 together.</P>
      <P>It is normal practice not to comment on the case of an individual prisoner.  I believe that it may be helpful in terms of explaining matters, however, if I were to mention that the prisoner referred to by the Deputy was convicted in the Special Criminal Court of a firearms offence and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment.  The prisoner was committed on 18 January 1998 and is not due for release with normal remission until 19 July 2000.  Having considered this case in some detail I am not prepared to grant any period of temporary release at this stage.  The Deputy may wish to note that a prisoner admitted to hospital can only be returned to prison having been discharged by the hospital authorities.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 131 of 12 March 1998.  As I stated then, in certain circumstances exemption orders can be granted by the District Court and conditions may be attached to these orders on the application of the local superintendent.  In such cases, it is a matter for local Garda management to see to it that the conditions attaching to the order are satisfied.</P>
      <P>At present I have no plans to amend the liquor licensing laws.  The Deputy may be aware that the Select Committee on Legislation and Security of the previous Dáil was engaged in a broad review of the licensing laws.  That work is continuing under a sub-committee of the new Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights. Any recommendations concerning opening hours of public houses which may emerge from this review will, of course, be given detailed consideration in my Department.</P>

      <P>It would be contrary to standard public accounting procedures to transfer particular revenues to particular purposes.  All revenues are taken in by the Exchequer and such allocations as are necessary are made through the normal Estimates process.</P>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, money seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 cannot be utilised as under the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, all moneys, including those resulting from the sale of assets are frozen for up to seven years during which time any person may claim legitimate ownership.  No money has yet accrued to the Exchequer under this Act as a disposal order transferring funds to the Exchequer cannot be made until the statutory period of seven years has elapsed from the date of the original order.</P>
      <P>The provision of funding for drug projects is channelled through the local drug task forces.  In addition, the young people's facilities and services fund has been established by the Government this year with a budget of £30 million to be spent over three years.  The initial allocation of £1.25 million for this year has been increased to £7.5 million.  The fund will support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in disadvantaged areas, particularly those affected by the heroin problem.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 232 and 233 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear as to what the Deputy has in mind in his first question.  At present almost all asylum seekers make their first contact with the Irish authorities at either my Department or the appropriate health board.  Where contact is made with one of these bodies, the asylum seeker is <Col N="619" /> automatically referrred to the other body so that their immediate reception needs are met, i.e. they make their asylum claim and their supplementary welfare and accommodation needs are considered.  As stated previously, it is proposed that the new accommodation being provided for the asylum division of my Department will also house the Eastern Health Board refugee unit, the UNHCR and a legal advice centre for asylum seekers.  This will be a one stop shop, as it were, for asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my contribution to the debate on the Asylum Seekers (Regularisation of Status) (No. 2) Bill, 1998, on 10 March, the Government accepted a recommendation from an interdepartmental committee that all appropriate assistance should be given by the relevant public bodies to faciliate the integration of recognised refugees into Irish society.

    <P>None of the personnel concerned received severance, statutory redundancy, payment in lieu of untaken annual leave or minimum notice payments in 1994 arising from the change of Government in so far as the former Departments of Justice and Equality and Law Reform are concerned.</P>
    <P>Although the personal secretary to the Minister for Justice submitted a letter of resignation, based on her understanding of what was required, it was decided in accordance with normal practice and from an equality and natural justice point of view that she should qualify for severance payments in the same manner as other ministerial appointees.</P>
    <P>The taking of annual leave was subject to the usual conditions regarding the granting of annual leave.  There was no contractual arrangement for the keeping of leave sheets in the case of the personnel concerned.  In practice, leave arrangements were agreed between individual officers and the Ministers concerned.</P>

      <P>At present, for the purpose of the administration of the prisons and places of detention, a juvenile is any person who is less than 21 years of age.  Accordingly, juveniles may be committed by the courts as follows: males aged 16 to 21 years to St. Patrick's Institution; males aged 17 years and over to Mountjoy, Limerick or Cork Prisons; females aged 17 years and over to Mountjoy or Limerick Prisons.</P>
      <P>In addition, in accordance with the Children's Act, 1908, males aged 15 and females aged 15 and 16 years may be committed to Mountjoy or Limerick Prisons and males aged 15 may be committed to Cork Prison.</P>
      <P>The Children Bill, 1996, which is at present before this House, deals primarily with juvenile justice matters.  The Bill proposes to abolish the provision of the Children Act, 1908, under which children who are certified by the court to be unruly or depraved can be sentenced to imprisonment.  It also proposes that children under 16 years of age who are sentenced to detention can only be detained in a children's detention school, responsibility for which will lie with the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>In addition the Bill provides that 16 and 17 year old children who are sentenced to imprisonment will be detained separately from older detainees and prisoners in places of detention provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the registrar of titles that this application for a copy instrument was lodged on 15 October 1997.  An extensive search has been carried out for this instrument in the Land Registry but I regret to inform you that it has not yet been located.  A further more extensive search is being carried out in the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>I am further informed it appears from the correspondence in the application by the registered owner that the copy instrument is being sought in relation to an application for release of a lease burden which is registered on the registered owner's folio.  If that is the case, the applicant's solicitor may, in the meantime, wish to lodge an application for the release of the lease burden, and the Land Registry will facilitate that application in so far as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253, 254 and 255 together.</P>
      <P>The stay safe programme is designed for use in primary schools and covers all forms of child abuse, including bullying.  Its aim is to prevent child abuse by equipping parents and teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect the children in their care.  Children are taught safety skills in the normal classroom context and these skills are reinforced through discussion with their parents.  In the circumstances, I consider that the stay safe programme is the most appropriate and effective programme for addressing the needs of school children in this area.</P>
      <P>Currently, approximately 80 per cent of schools are teaching the stay safe programme and, as over 85 per cent of schools have arranged parent meetings, I am confident that this number will grow. The experience has been that the number of schools which have held parent meetings closely mirrors the number of schools which will eventually teach the programme.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that there is often a delay between the time that a school holds a parent meeting and the time when a school actually starts teaching the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One teacher continues to be seconded on a full-time basis to the programme and acts as a co-ordinator for all aspects of the programme team's activities.  In addition, a nationwide network of 40 <Col N="629" /> teachers, working on a part-time basis, remains in place.  This network is continuing to support those schools currently teaching the programme and to target those schools which are not yet participating in the programme.</P>
    <P>The revised primary curriculum, currently being finalised by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, will cover the issue of child abuse prevention under the social, personal and health education &mdash; SPHE &mdash; module.  While it will not be mandatory for schools to use the stay safe programme, schools will be required to provide personal safety education for children.</P>

I will examine the submission carefully as the Bill progresses through the various legislative stages in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that the Bill was produced following an extensive process of consultation with the partners in education.  As a result, the Bill has received a generally warm welcome.  I intend to continue this consultation process as the Bill proceeds through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <Quest>if he will convene a national conference to examine in detail the extremely disappointing results revealed in the recent Partnership 2000 progress report regarding access to third level education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7816/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Partnership 2000 provides that priority will be given to a strategy to enable non-standard applicants, especially disadvantaged and mature students, to participate in third level education. In this regard, the latest progress report on Partnership 2000 outlines some of the current developments <Col N="630" /> in the university sector on access initiatives for disadvantaged students.</P>
      <P>Following the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education, the Higher Education Authority provided funding in 1996 and 1997 for initiatives in a number of colleges specifically relating to disadvantaged students.  These initiatives build on existing programmes and involve links with second level schools and local communities.  For this reason it will take some time for the effect of the programmes to be reflected in the actual members going on to higher education.</P>
      <P>The programmes will assist some students to meet the points requirement for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure.  The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for students entering by this method.  Support for the university proposals is very firmly based on the intention of meeting these targets and annual progress reports will be submitted to the Higher Education Authority on each of the programmes funded.</P>
      <P>While I accept that the figures for entrants from disadvantaged backgrounds to the university sector in the progress report are low, I do not consider them to be disappointing in light of my earlier comments and, accordingly, I do not propose to convene a national conference as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>These initiatives in the university sector are one element of the wide range of measures in place to improve participation at third level.  They include the development of early start centres, the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas, the breaking the cycle pilot programme, the home school community liaison scheme and the development of second chance education and training options through Youthreach and VTOS.</P>
      <P>Specially at third level, I introduced the new national certificate in technology course, which was developed by a joint education/industry task force and targeted in particular at non-standard applicants, and which commenced in January 1998 in nine institutes of technology.  I have also announced that the Government has given approval for the creation of a new third-level institution in Blanchardstown to serve the west of Dublin.  Membership of the board, which will be announced shortly, will be charged with completing strategic planning for the institution and making arrangements for the commencement of courses.  The new institution, to be called the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, will meet two very important needs, namely; to increase participation in third-level education in west Dublin, an area with one of the lowest participation rates in the country and to help meet the skills requirements of expanding industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate the multi-faceted nature of the initiatives under way which are <Col N="631" /> indicative of my commitment to tackle educational disadvantage.  I recently addressed a conference organised by USI on the matter.  In relation to the Deputy's request I will give further consideration to the convening of a conference on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 260 together.</P>
      <P>The community employment scheme is funded by FÁS and provides a part-time work experience programme for long-term unemployed people of 20 hours per week.  I have been informed by FÁS that the programme structure provides for an input of education-training modules of 25 days minimum duration.  The content of this input is agreed at local level with participants based on their vocational and personal development needs. This training input may also allow for certification to be achieved at a variety of levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, full-time education programmes, such as post leaving cert courses, are not a suitable option for participants while on a community employment programme.  However, it would be open to such participants to avail of part-time education courses in further or third level education subject to the normal entry and funding arrangements for part-time provision.  In addition, those who have completed a CE scheme <Col N="632" /> can progress to further full-time education or training programmes or the vocational training opportunity scheme.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees operate an adult literacy and community education scheme &mdash; ALCES &mdash; to provide special tuition for disadvantaged adults with literacy problems. The provision of funding for the scheme has recently been increased from £2.065 million per annum to £4.065 million.</P>
    <P>Additional modular inputs via part-time education options for all 40,000 plus participants on community employment programmes would have major resource implications.  The question of how best access to lifelong learning and adult literacy-education should be promoted will be among the issues to be dealt with in the forthcoming Green Paper on Adult Education.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 and 262 together.</P>
      <P>The trustees of the Ballycastle secondary school announced on 1 October 1997, that the school would be phased out over a two year period commencing in 1998.  There would be no intake of new pupils in September 1998 and the school would close in the year 2000.  The reasons given for closure were the low enrolment in the school and the major financial burden in sustaining it.</P>
      <P>I met a deputation representing the parents of pupils at the school on 14 January last.  The deputation stated that they intended to establish a management structure and hoped to rent the existing school building with a view to continuing the secondary school.  I indicated to the deputation that, as soon as they could confirm the availability of the building and the setting up of the necessary management structures, I would urgently consider their application.

      <P>The present staffing complement in Saint Kilian's senior national school consists of a principal and 15 teachers, one of whom is a remedial teacher.  This staffing level was determined by reference to the school's enrolment of 435 pupils in September 1996.  While final decisions have not yet been made regarding the 1998-99 staffing allocations, the school's September 1997 enrolment of 414 pupils seems unlikely to be sufficient to ensure the retention of its existing staffing complement.</P>
      <P>I note it is anticipated that the school will increase its enrolment in September 1998.  A significant enrolment increase may qualify the school for a post under the criteria for either developing school status or maximum class size guidelines.  Accordingly, when the staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1998-99 school year are announced, the school's projected enrolment for September 1998 should be brought to the attention of my Department's officials by the school authorities so that the staffing levels at the school may be reassessed.</P>

      <P>The proposed new primary school at Bunninadden, Ballymote, County Sligo, is currently going through the architectural planning stages.  My Department's architectural staff have requested the consultant quantity surveyor to prepare a cost plan for the project and it is expected that this will be completed shortly. When the cost plan is approved, the school manager will be provided with the documentation necessary to make an application for planning permission.  The level of grant assistance provided by any Department for projects of this nature is 85 per cent.  However, as an accurate costing for the scheme is not available at present, it is not possible to predict the amount of grant assistance in this case.  When all the planning work for the project has been completed, a decision on the tender and contract process will be taken in the light of other priority projects, and available capital funding.  At this stage, it is not possible to give a commencement date for the scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department has recently approved an all-in grant for the provision of additional accommodation for St. Paul's secondary school, Oughterard, County Galway.  The funding being provided by my Department for this project is not the usual method of providing grant aid to schools but the result of an agreement reached with the school authority.  The background to the project is that my Department was prepared to provide temporary accommodation for the school under the usual terms but the school authority wished to have the accommodation provided in a permanent structure.</P>
      <P>The building project is following the Department's standard design team procedures and is currently at Stages 4/5 of architectural planning, that is, detail design contract documents.  It is anticipated that the project will proceed to tender when this stage of planning has been completed to the Department's satisfaction.  This grant will be paid on production of certificates of practical completion from the consultant architect employed by the school authority.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some parents have had to raise money privately to employ a Montessori teacher in a remedial capacity; his views on whether this is clear recognition on the part of parents of the quality of the Montessori training for remedial teaching; and if he is willing to recognise Montessori for remedial purposes as an interim measure pending the outcome of the present forum on early education.</Quest>

      <P>I am anxious to ensure that all children with a remedial need have access to the necessary level of support through the remedial teaching service.  I am most anxious to avoid a situation where individual parents would find it necessary to fund such a service privately.  I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the remedial area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed to best effect. At present, a total of 1,242 remedial teachers are in place in the primary sector.  It is my intention to continue to develop the service.</P>
      <P>Irish primary school teachers, including remedial teachers, are class teachers as distinct from individual subject teachers and must, therefore, be qualified to teach all aspects of the curriculum.  Therefore, all teachers seeking recognition must achieve a standard and competence in the Irish language.  This standard can be achieved by undergoing and passing the Irish qualifications examinations &ldquo;An Scrúdú la hAghaidh Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge&rdquo; both written and oral or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>Teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three years' full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14, are already recognised by my Department as qualified to teach in special schools for students who are mentally handicapped, emotionally disturbed or hearing impaired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent National Forum on Early Childhood Education considered all aspects of early childhood education, including the Montessori method.  The outcome of the forum will have an important input to a White Paper on Early Childhood <Col N="638" /> Education which I intend to publish later this year.  It would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt the outcome of the forum by commenting on possible future roles for Montessori teachers at this stage.</P>

      <P>My primary responsibility as regards the premises concerned is to protect the public interest in it as a publicly owned asset.  In doing so it is also my objective to ensure the continuing use of the premises as a sport-leisure facility.  I am not satisfied that I can discharge my responsibility or meet that objective by entering into a lease with the company, which is now in receivership and to which a liquidator has been appointed.  I consider that the appropriate course to adopt is to regain possession of the property and to enter a new agreement with an appropriate tenant for the letting of the property as a sport-leisure facility.  To achieve vacant possession in the property, a notice to quit has been served on my behalf on all parties concerned with the property, including the company.</P>

Officials of my Department recently met representatives of the society to discuss their proposals in more detail.  I will be examining the proposals in question carefully as the Education (No. 2) Bill progresses through the various legislative stages in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that the Bill was produced following an extensive process of consultation with the partners in education.  As a result, the Bill has received a generally warm welcome.  I intend to continue this consultation process as the Bill proceeds through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The 15 psychologists appointed recently to improve psychological services to primary schools will take up duty over the next few months.  This current expansion of my Department's psychological service will almost double the number of primary schools having access to the help of an educational psychologist.</P>
      <P>The allocation of schools to the new psychologists has not yet been finalised.  However, the selection of the schools who will benefit from this expanded psychological service is being carefully considered by officials of my Department, including the primary inspectorate, who are in contact with schools on a daily basis and are, therefore, aware of the needs of individual schools.</P>

      <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's range of support services to address the problem of educational disadvantage, including <Col N="641" /> the home-school-community liaison scheme.  My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support necessary to enable them to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage.  My Department has received an application for computer room facilities at the school in question.  This application is being considered at present and an official from my Department will be in contact with the school authorities when a decision is reached.</P>
      <P>The recent National Forum on Early Childhood Education brought together service providers and experts in the field for the purpose of advising me on a strategy for the future development of early childhood education services.  My objective in holding the national forum was to allow all groups with an interest in the area of early childhood education to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the future development of services in this area.</P>
      <P>Following the conclusion of the national forum, an independent report of its proceedings and conclusions is being prepared by the independent secretariat and will be published under the authority of the secretary general to the forum.  It is my intention to follow this process with the publication of a White Paper on Early Childhood Education.</P>
      <P>The needs of the school referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered in the context of any development in early education services which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Education and Science, I would be very concerned at pressure being placed on schools and on school parents to become involved in the marketing and promotion of commercial products.  Indeed, as the Deputy's question indicates, there are three circulars which my Department has issued on this subject to school authorities i.e. Circulars 23/84, 7/87 and 38/91.</P>
      <P>Private companies, such as the one the Deputy mentions, are free to promote their business in accordance with accepted practices.  While the supply of vouchers towards the provision of computers in schools is one such practice, school authorities are required to ensure, as per the circulars to which I referred, that pressure is not placed on parents to purchase particular commercial products.  In this context, Circular 38/91 specifically requests school authorities, following consultation with staff, to formulate agreed school policies in relation to commercial promotions.  Such policies can assist school authorities to act prudently in taking steps to ensure that commercial products are not promoted and marketed through their schools.</P>

      <P>A report by Cooney-Carey Consultants <Col N="644" /> in 1994, commissioned by my Department, concluded that book rental schemes offer the most practical method of curtailing the cost of school books to parents at primary and post-primary levels.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, in the 1994-95 school year at primary level, the scheme of grants towards the cost of school textbooks was extended to include grants for schools designated as disadvantaged who chose to operate loan-rental schemes.  The scheme was further extended in the 1995-96 school year to all primary schools who chose to operate loan-rental schemes.</P>
      <P>Since 1994 additional grants have been provided to certain vocational education committees and certain second level schools which have been officially designated as disadvantaged to assist them in the introduction of book loan-rental schemes for needy pupils.  Details of these grant allocations are set out in the following appendix. In addition, allocations under the general second level school books for needy pupils grant scheme may be used by schools towards text book rental charges for needy pupils.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate that there are administrative implications in the operation of school book rental schemes, I encourage school management authorities and principals to adopt to the greatest extent possible, the suggestions for text book loan-rental schemes as outlined in the consultant's report, which was circulated to all schools and in my Department's circulars.</P>
      <P>The following table sets out the amounts paid at primary level towards loan rental schemes since 1994-95.  Data on individual primary schools who receive assistance under the loan-rental scheme is not readily available as in excess of 1,000 primary schools receive such assistance.</P>

The capital expenditure inflator laid down for 1998 under the heading building and construction is 2.9 per cent.  In previous years, the rates used were those given in the appropriate Department of Finance circulars.</P>

      <P>The final instalment of grant due to Sundays Well boys' national school, Strawberry Hill, Cork, for the erection of palisade fencing issued on 10 February 1998.  It has since emerged that the payable order has not been cashed and my Department is taking steps to cancel it and issue a replacement.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in contact with the consultant engaged on the project and has requested an invoice for the fees associated with the works.  This is expected shortly.  When this is received, a grant will be approved and the school will be notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>There is no go-slow within my Department and the project has not been delayed.</P>

      <P>In general terms, it is the policy of my Department to provide PE halls as part of the schedule of accommodation for all new post-primary schools.  PE halls are also provided when a major extension to a school which does not have <Col N="647" /> such a facility is being built.  In addition, my Department has a programme for providing PE halls as stand-alone projects at post-primary schools which do not already have this facility and it is anticipated that a number of such projects will proceed to construction during 1998.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in respect of the total number of projects is not readily available and I cannot justify assigning scarce staff resources towards its compilation. However, if the Deputy has a query about an individual project, I will be happy to provide the details.</P>

      <P>Currently, when new second level schools for more than 500 pupils are being constructed or existing schools extended, a PE hall of 393 square metres is provided.  Schools for fewer than 500 pupils are provided with 336 square metres.</P>

The exact dimensions will vary depending on whether the facility is stand alone or attached to the main body of a building.  Obviously, duplication is avoided to keep costs down.</P>

      <P>Physical education halls at second level schools are intended as a teaching space to impart the appropriate level of physical education skills to students: they are not intended as an area for competitive sport.</P>
      <P>The dimensions of a PE hall are determined by factors such as the number of students attending the school where the facility is located, the requirements for ancillary accommodation such a showers and changing areas, the necessity in some cases to provide a separate boiler house and whether the facility is stand-alone or attached to the main body of the school.</P>
