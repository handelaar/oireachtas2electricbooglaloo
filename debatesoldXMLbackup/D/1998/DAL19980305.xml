      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague Deputy Bradford for sharing his time with me.  I welcome this opportunity to compliment the Minister for continuing the policy of his predecessor to provide adequate funding, particularly for non-national roads.  It was a welcome development initiated by the former Minister which is being carried on by this Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which enables local authorities to compulsorily acquire land for the construction and maintenance of a road tunnel as part of their powers under the Roads Act, 1993, and similar powers under the Dublin Light Rail <Col N="506" /> Act, 1996.  While the 1993 Bill was introduced to comprehensively deal with the future development of our roads network, one could say it was short-sighted because it does not have a definite provision for the necessity of tunnelling as part of modern transport construction development.</P>
    <P>The three items highlighted in this Bill are important safeguards in response to the changing conditions and methods of road construction. Throughout this short Bill and in the Minister's Second Stage speech there is a reference to the power of local councils as road authorities.  I draw attention to a third layer involved in the administration of our roads, the National Roads Authority. The other two layers are the Minister and the Department and the local authorities.  I am disappointed with the activities of the National Roads Authority.  Some would classify it as a monster because it is practically inaccessible.  I am not sure if it accepts recommendations from outside local authorities, the Department or the Minister, but it is inaccessible to local authority members.  As an important agency dealing with the development of our roads network, which is closely related to the activities of local authority members, it is essential the Minister should in the near future make that Authority accessible to public representatives, local authority members and other members of the public.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority must be blamed for delaying certain projects.  I particularly highlight the position with regard to two instances concerning the N6 in County Galway.  One involves the bypass in Loughrea.  Galway County Council, its design team and the county engineer have repeatedly put forward excellent plans for that project.  It has reviewed and made changes to it on the recommendations of the Minister, the Department and the National Roads Authority, but that Authority, through its indecision and indecisiveness, has failed to clarify a matter, which, if dealt with, would allow the project to continue.  It has failed to decide whether it will be a dual or a single carriageway.  I have repeatedly contacted the authority since last July to ascertain its final decision but as yet, it has not said which it will be.  As a result, the congestion along the N6 at Loughrea is no different from that which occurs in Dublin, particularly on a Friday evening.  It has caused delays and has cost money to suppliers travelling east and west.  It has also caused disruption to local people who must pass through Loughrea.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority must take the blame for the notoriously dangerous stretch of the N6 from Aughrim to Cappataggle.  That road has taken 32 lives in recent years.  Because of the indecisiveness of the National Roads Authority, work has been stalled on that stretch of road. Galway County Council started work last year but was stopped this year and told to begin work on the other end of the road.  It has now started work on the eastern end of the road.  This highlights the indecision of the National Roads Authority which cannot decide whether to realign the <Col N="507" /> current route or create a new carriageway.  Will the Minister intervene as a matter of urgency and ensure finances are available to prevent further delay in the completion of this stretch of road to make it safe for road users?</P>
    <P>Land acquisition has rarely been a problem in rural areas.  It is inevitable that land acquisition powers will have to be available to local authorities in Dublin for the Luas project which is important not only to Dublin commuters, but will be a national asset which will alleviate much congestion. Today I saw a report in the media that the junior partners in Government have introduced a new study or plan for Dublin city traffic and for Luas.  It has suggested that tunnelling from St. Stephen's Green to the Broadstone station would cost an additional £50 million.  Not only will it involve additional cost, but it will also cause delay.  I am not sure if a precedent is being set in that the Progressive Democrats, the junior partners in Government, are producing a plan at this stage.  Is it a tactic to delay further the Government's decision to provide funding for this project which is important not only for Dublin, but for the country?</P>
    <P>We are approaching the date when the Minister will decide on allocations for LIS programmes and will indicate to the various local authorities their allocations for the coming year. I highlight this issue so the Minister will see the seriousness of the situation in County Galway where there is a five year backlog and delay in processing LIS schemes because of inadequate finances.  The benefits of the schemes are most notable in counties like Galway which has so many non-national and secondary roads.  There is no chance of improvements being carried out under regular road maintenance by local authorities because they cannot be financed to any great extent.  This scheme has been very valuable to counties like Galway so that people can improve to a reasonable standard access to their land and holdings and improve roads which would not be taken in charge by local authorities. It is important that a once-off substantial additional allocation is made available to County Galway to alleviate the serious backlog.</P>
    <P>The third provision in the Bill is particularly welcome in that it allows for a judicial review of ministerial decisions on motorway schemes and road related environmental impact statements.  It also declares certain roads to be motorways.  I welcome the Bill and have no hesitation in supporting its contents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important enabling and amending legislation.  For us in Dublin, it is a significant and welcome step forward because it removes a number of uncertainties and ambiguities.  There was a question mark over the port tunnel and the light rail projects, in relation to tunnelling and so on.  I am glad the Bill addresses that issue.  The port tunnel and the light rail projects should be expedited on the <Col N="508" /> enactment of this Bill.  Everybody knows the streets of Dublin are clogged with traffic.  The other morning I listened to AA Roadwatch and noted the M50 has become clogged many years ahead of projections.  That puts a question mark over our ability in the past to plan strategically for major projects.</P>
      <P>There is a proven need for the tunnel and I welcome the opportunity to address the issue. The Minister suggested we should not debate the rights or wrongs of the tunnel and I do not propose to do so.  I suggest the tunnel is vital if we are to remove much of the port related traffic from the streets of Dublin.  Those who live on the northside, in particular, will be aware there is almost nose to tail truck traffic on the Belfast and Derry roads at every hour of the day and night. The city is clogged with trucks and port related traffic.  We need to remove that traffic which is using up scarce road space.  Dublin Port is thriving and there has been a huge increase in employment there.  However, there is a limit to how much it can thrive unless we engage in the strategic planning, about which we are talking.</P>
      <P>It is important to endorse what the Minister said in that this Bill does not authorise the construction of the port tunnel.  Some people may be of the view that this amending legislation means the construction of the tunnel is inevitable and the authorities will ride roughshod over the wishes of communities on the northside and in Marino.  It is important we get the tunnel and the light rail projects right.  While I know it will involve additional expenditure, if we do not locate the portals of the tunnel as close as possible to the M50 interchange, we will do a grave disservice to the city and will make the lives of communities in the Santry area unbearable.  I have never understood why in the initial stages of planning, the portals of the tunnel were to be located beside Whitehall church.  I could never see the logic in bringing traffic as far as Whitehall. If I were a truck driver, I would not see why I should enter a tolled tunnel to get to the port when I could continue from Whitehall, down Clonliffe Road as far as the port.  It is important the issue of the tunnel portals be addressed with a view to having traffic enter near the M50. People living beside the proposed site for the portals, be they in Whitehall or Santry, will inevitably have poorer air quality.  Another good reason for locating the portals of the tunnel further out is that the level of noise emanating from the tunnel is bound to be unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>As regards the ventilation of the tunnel, I fail to understand why, in this age of high technology, a dreadful chimney stack type ventilation is proposed.  From my limited knowledge of tunnels on the Continent, it seems it must be possible to ventilate the tunnel through its length.  It would make the proposal more welcome to the communities affected and it would certainly be more environmentally suitable and acceptable.  I ask for these ideas to be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> I was involved in the Finglas North Road by-pass project which cost £10.6 million.  It was the first major road project where Dublin Corporation had to prepare an environmental impact statement.  It represented the first faltering steps towards consultation with local communities. They were faltering because none of us knew the parameters of the consultation process.  Some of the issues were dealt with successfully, but not all were addressed.</P>
    <P>The next major project was the construction of the M50.  I witnessed affected local communities trying to come to terms with a major road construction project without any major assistance of an independent nature.  Environmental impact statements were prepared and there was a certain level of consultation.  However, I remember my colleagues and I attending endless meetings with engineers where we questioned traffic counts and projections.  All we ever received were spreadsheets of numbers which were difficult to interpret. This resulted in an alarming level of concern about the impact of the M50 on places such as Santry and Ballymun.  As it turned out, there were both positives and negatives.  The expedition of the M50 resulted in smoother traffic flows through Collins Avenue and Ballymun.  The downside has been that a traffic calming scheme, the negotiations for which started prior to the construction of the M50, has still not been completed. This is because no clear mechanism is available to take account of the concerns of local groups.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the construction of the port tunnel as I believe it is the only way forward for the north side of the city.  We will have to examine how we deal with the southern leg sooner rather than later, but that is another day's work. Considerable consultation has taken place between the communities in Marino, Santry, Whitehall, Glasnevin and surrounding areas and the engineers and consultants in Dublin Corporation. Despite that, there are still great suspicions about what is intended.  Despite any assurances we give them, some people believe the tunnel project will be foisted on them whether they like it or not.  There is no clear mechanism by which these fears can be assuaged.  Members of Dublin City Council attempted to assist local communities concerned about the construction of the tunnel to carry out their own independent assessment of its impact.  I will speak about that later. The ability of those in power to address the fears of local communities has improved but we are still substantially deficient in our ability to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The light rail project is a huge one.  Regardless of whether it goes underground or is entirely overground, it will be very beneficial to Dublin. There are compelling reasons for having part of it underground.  It will also have disturbing effects on residential areas, such as Inchicore, and on business.  I am concerned about the impact on business during the construction phase, and I am not certain we have come to terms with the concerns <Col N="510" /> of local business.  I would prefer if the construction of the overground areas of the light rail project were proceeded with as soon as possible. In that regard, I welcome the discussion document published this morning by the junior partner in Government.  It gives an opportunity to discuss the light rail project again.  There are aspects of the project which could be proceeded with without much difficulty.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who cannot understand why our capital city does not have a rail link to Dublin Airport.  I am aware there is a great deal of pressure for the rail link to the airport to be a DART link from Malahide.  I would prefer a light rail link going through Ballymun or Finglas to the airport. The construction costs would not be as significant as building the link from Malahide to the airport. Given that a major regeneration of Ballymun is being undertaken, that the master plan is being exhibited this weekend and that it will take the next eight to ten years to complete a project which I am sure will be one of the most widely welcomed in the history of the State, it would be opportune to examine the desirability of having the Luas line running through the new town of Ballymun and serving Finglas and surrounding areas.  It would do a great deal for the economy of the north Dublin region and would enhance the north-south corridor.</P>
    <P>As regards the consultation required for major projects, I still believe we have not reached the optimum level in winning the hearts and minds of people concerned about the implications for them of these major projects.  I hear it from people in Santry when canvassing for my colleague, Michael Kennedy, in the Dublin North by-election and in the Whitehall area.  There is something unsatisfactory about the consultation process which is alienating people who would otherwise be very supportive of the project.  The process has to be transparent and seen to be so. The promoters of the project, whether the National Roads Authority, Iarnród Éireann or major conglomerates, must learn to listen to the objections of communities who are asking serious, well thought out questions and seeking honest answers.  There is a worrying level of suspicion which should be addressed.  We must address the need to win public confidence.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the inability of local communities to muster sufficient resources to prepare a counter case against local authorities or the National Roads Authority.  One cannot prepare a good case on money raised from raffles and coffee mornings.  We must attempt to create a level playing pitch for local communities.  The Minister should consider a mechanism whereby local communities are grant-aided to engage consultants and to draw up independent advice relating to the law, planning and traffic management.  There are eminent consultants whose integrity is beyond question whom many local communities would like to engage.</P>
    <P>Universities have a significant role to play in enabling communities to prepare cases.  I greatly <Col N="511" /> value the support given to local communities by Trinity College and DCU but this is done on an informal basis and I am not sure of its standing. Much good would come from a mechanism through which the Department of the Environment and Local Government provided grants to local communities as there would be a greater degree of confidence that the final product would be what everyone wished for.  There must always be compromise and I compliment the City Manager and his engineers for their attempts to engage communities in the hinterland of the proposed tunnel project in meaningful consultations. People are confident that, within the limited constraints, their concerns are being taken on board. The City Manager was more than willing to assist these groups.  However, he felt that existing legislation prevented him from making financial support available to them.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for a judicial review process.  I am not a legal expert but I welcome the inclusion in the Bill of another mechanism by which bona fide concerns can be addressed in a straightforward manner.  It became apparent early on to those of us living with the tunnel project that the M50, even when finished, will provide only limited relief to commuters.  I am not suggesting we should build wider roads but it seems that the M50 is a telling example of us not building enough roads.  The fact that the approaches to the west link toll bridge and the roundabouts are constantly backed up with traffic indicates that we failed to accurately project traffic levels or that there were unnecessary and unwise cutbacks in expenditure on the road.  I am not a proponent of roads as the only component of traffic policy.  However, the huge increase in the numbers of cars highlights the need for us to plan more strategically.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the welcome consultation process for quality bus corridors in Dublin. Public transport must flow more freely in the city. However, for whatever reason, there seems to be a crude approach to introducing these corridors against the wishes of residents and the business community.  Deputy Callely and I are engaged in consultation processes concerning these corridors. The Department of the Environment and Local Government should encourage local authorities to think more of the sensitivities of businesses and residents affected by these corridors. I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on its introduction.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am from the west but I love Dublin city.  However, it has major traffic problems which must be addressed.  Local authorities should discuss their needs before serving compulsory <Col N="512" /> purchase orders.  There is an opportunity for them to buy land if they offer the right price. However, they pay engineers, lawyers and valuers. If this money was paid to land owners many deals could be concluded more speedily.  The authorities offer small amounts of money instead of the market price.  If land prices are increasing so too should the prices offered by local authorities. Given some of the prices offered to land owners, it appears that some of those negotiating on behalf of authorities are living in the 1930s.</P>
      <P>The Minister should introduce an amendment to the Bill dealing with the issue of why Dublin city is allowed to be used by every protest organisation. Why can we not stop protests taking place every day?  Two weeks ago I was travelling down the quays when I came across a protest by people with horses and traps which were blocking the street.  I saw a lady crying in a taxi because she had missed her train as a result of being stuck in traffic for over an hour.  The Government and the local authorities in Dublin should stipulate that protests are only allowed on Sundays.  A couple of acres should be set aside in the Phoenix Park for those who wish to protest during the week. People are entitled to protest but they are not entitled to block the roads.  During that protest traffic as far as Heuston Station was unable to move.  This cannot continue and it is time the powers that be did something about it.</P>
      <P>This week's newspapers carried reports of interviews with undertakers who want funerals to be held later in the evening.  I support this proposal. A few days ago I had a 6.30 p.m. appointment in Beaumont Hospital which is only four or five miles from Leinster House.  I left at 6 p.m. but did not arrive at the hospital until 7.25 p.m. The current traffic problems cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>I wish the airport was located on the western side of Dublin as the road to Westport would be improved.  Complaints have been made that areas of Dublin have received funding under the second round of Structural Funds, yet areas in the west have not received their allocations under round one.  I am glad the powers under the Bill will rest with local authorities, not the National Roads Authority.  We should not have given away our powers in relation to roads to the National Roads Authority.  It is wrong that we can no longer debate with the Minister the position in regard to national primary roads.  If we want to ask questions about these roads we must go to the National Roads Authority.  Why do we have to raise these questions with an authority which has no representation in the House?  It is only recently that it has started to reply to correspondence. Consideration should be given to restoring these powers to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The road between Westport and Castlebar is 11 miles long.  In the past one could travel this distance in seven or eight minutes.  However, as the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt knows, this journey can now take up to 30 minutes if the <Col N="513" /> traffic is slow.  The National Roads Authority does not regard this road as a priority.  The Minister of State will also be aware that the condition of the Swinford to Ballina road has been a cause of much aggravation for many years.  We hoped the authority would allocate funding to the road this year.</P>
    <P>The greatest scandal of all is the Claremorris by-pass which was supposed to be constructed in 1996-97 but which we are now told will not be built until 1999.  I do not understand the reasons for this given that some parts of Dublin have received funding under the second round of Structural Funds.  I ask the Minister of State to raise the matter with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  It is time the west got its fair share of funding.</P>
    <P>I support the development of the Luas and port tunnel projects in Dublin as it is right that a capital city should have a proper transport system. However, people in the west are also entitled to a proper rail service and good roads.  If journey times to the west were shorter more investors would set up their businesses there.  Investment in Dublin leads to an increase in traffic.  It is possible to walk from Leinster House to the Pearse Street Garda Station in three or four minutes. However, on a Thursday evening or Friday morning this journey can take almost an hour by car. This cannot be allowed to continue.  I welcome the powers being given to local authorities to buy land which will be used to alleviate the traffic problems in Dublin.</P>
    <P>At times local authorities have a bad habit of not telling people what they are doing.  There is nothing wrong with telling people what is being done and the reasons for it.  Local authorities employ many people and they should be able to employ a PR person who will inform the public of what is being done.  When people are not aware what is being done they get suspicious. Local authorities do a good and honest job with the funding they receive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to LIS roads in the west.  These roads are used by the occupants of two or three houses but they are not taken over by the county council.  However, councillors can secure funding for such roads in the estimates. For example, Mayo County Council allocates £5,000 or £6,000 for these roads each year, while other councils select two or three roads for repair. I favour the system operated by other councils as it is not possible to complete work on all roads with an allocation of £5,000 or £6,000.  If the funding was allocated to five or six roads all the necessary work could be carried out and the council could take responsibility for them.  The people who live on these roads also make a contribution based on the rateable valuation.  However, if one person decides not to make a contribution then the work cannot proceed.  This is wrong.  There are many of these roads in the Ballycroy and Erris areas of north Mayo.</P>
    <P>I have raised on many occasions the damage caused to roads by coastal erosion.  It is not fair <Col N="514" /> to expect land owners to repair the damage caused to roads by coastal erosion.  This is a major issue in coastal areas and it will not go away.  The previous Government allocated much funding for county roads.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, for continuing this trend, which was begun by the previous Minister, Deputy Howlin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on a topic close to my heart. I am proud to have been suspended from the House on three occasions for trying to draw the attention of the then Government to the problems caused by bad roads.  We got the message across and there have been improvements, although they are not sufficient.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes powers to acquire land, including substratum, for the purpose of improving road structures and the construction of underground tunnels for roads or railways.  This relates in particular to Dublin city which has a major problem of which I am fully aware as I stay midweek in the north of the city.  It is a nightmare driving to the House at 9 a.m. We have problems in Cavan, but at least the traffic is kept moving. It takes three quarters of an hour to get from Collins Avenue to Leinster House at 9 a.m., most of which is spent sitting stationary in one's car. On occasion it is impossible to move even when the lights are green because the box is not clear, something which can be very frustrating.</P>
      <P>I have not taken part in the debate and would not be critical of anybody, but it must be acknowledged that there has been much discussion and apparently little action and no solution to the problem which has been ongoing for the past decade.  I am not faulting planners, but obviously they have been unable to keep abreast of the major development of the motor industry and the fact that households which had one car now have up to four.  Last night I was canvassing in Malahide and I noticed towards the end of the canvass when people were at home that up to four cars were parked in driveways.  All these cars come into the city in the morning and I began to realise why I am held up when driving to Leinster House.  I do not know whether the provision of a better bus service or taking cars off the road would solve the problem.  People like the comfort of their cars.  The problem must be tackled immediately and an underground rail service and improved bus service, including feeder services to the DART, must be examined.  People will respond when they see action being taken but become frustrated when they only see plans and discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the officials for the excellent plan which has been drawn up for the by-pass of Cavan town, a nine mile stretch of roadway through green land.  It will cost £12 million and will be completed by the end of 1999.  The by-pass will facilitate a major improvement to the movement of traffic from north of Cavan town to Navan or Dublin.  Another major development is the opening of Aghalane bridge to Northern Ireland which <Col N="515" /> will improve contact between the North and the Republic, particularly between Enniskillen and Cavan town.  I understand the costs involved, but the by-pass will be short in comparison to that of other large towns and the bottleneck in Cavan town was not acceptable, particularly to hauliers who experienced delays of up to half an hour in getting goods from the town, or north of it, to Navan, Dublin or Dublin Port.  There were similar delays for hauliers bringing goods to south County Cavan, including Ballyconnell and Swanlinbar. It could take between half an hour or an hour to get goods from one end of Cavan town to the other, a distance of half a mile.  In this context, I understand the good work being done.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise an issue with officials which impinges indirectly on my land in the context of by-passes.  Officials should realise they are cutting through virgin land and that landowners should be approached.  It is not good enough for engineers to start taking levels and embarking upon developments for site viewing purposes without firstly speaking to landowners, advising them what is taking place and getting their goodwill. This has not happened.  Temporary fences are suddenly erected without approaching or making an offer to the landowners whose land is to be acquired.  It is reasonable that somebody from the Department should meet the landowner, who is generally a farmer, advise him what is taking place, take him into the confidence of the Department, advise him that he will be compensated and ask him about the level of compensation desired. To take over without contacting the owner is not a good practice and causes much annoyance, the result of which is that good will ebbs and people become difficult and awkward, something I fully understand.  The matter has been overlooked, probably due to a lack of thought and foresight. If the approach I suggest is taken people will be happy and will understand what is happening.</P>
    <P>There was much difficulty about land being taken over and fences constructed in the case of the short by-pass from north of Belturbet to Aghalane. The impression was given that more land was being taken than would be acquired when the final fencing was erected and the road completed. People were annoyed.</P>
    <P>There is still a huge problem with county roads. People are entitled to a road to their home.  I understand and support the need for highways. However, there is a huge problem with the funding of county roads.  We have not yet received notification of local improvement or pilot schemes.  The situation is so desperate that people are prepared to make their own local contribution. The time to start a job is early in the year in order that the work can be completed.  I appeal to the Minister to make more funding available for local improvement and pilot schemes.  It affects only one or two households, but families are being deprived of the basic right of a road to their houses.  I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will fully support my appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Boylan's speech brought back many happy memories of Virginia, Cavan, Swanlinbar, Ballinagh, etc.  I am envious of this beautiful area of County Cavan.</P>
      <P>I give a cautious welcome to the Roads (Amendment) Bill, 1997.  I understand the primary purpose of the Bill is to clarify the power of local authorities as road authorities to compulsorily acquire a substratum of land for the construction and maintenance of a road tunnel as part of its powers under the Roads Act, 1993.  The Bill also amends the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, to provide a similar power in that legislation for light rail development and other matters.  Why is this being embarked upon now, particularly in light of the Lee tunnel project in Cork?  Suddenly there is a need to clarify powers. Perhaps the Minister will respond to this question by way of letter.</P>
      <P>This is a new area of exploration, particularly the power to compulsorily acquire a substratum of land.  I have had discussions with the Minister and have asked for clarification regarding the level, depth and distance from the foundation of a house where a substratum of land could be acquired.  I hope we will receive clarification on this matter before Committee Stage.  This is a very important issue and I am disappointed that such information is not available at present.  I hope the horse will be put before the cart prior to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The overall proposal to develop underground can be viewed as imaginative with exciting prospects for future transport needs.  It is essential that our transport systems meet the challenges of the 21st century and beyond, particularly in light of the unique economic development this country has enjoyed over the past decade.  We no longer talk of lack of investment, closures and crises.  It is clear we are emerging from a period of doubt. We now talk about the roar of the Celtic tiger, the growing economy and the need for further investment.</P>
      <P>We have seen the benefits of the growth in our economy in communities and society in general. People are spending money and we have seen additional cars on our roads.  The Fianna Fáil pledge on the economy is to have tighter management to maximise the long-term potential thereby ensuring improved living standards for all.</P>
      <P>In addition to the two primary issues the Bill deals with other issues.  It brings into line planning and other legislative rules in relation to legal challenges to decisions of the Minister on schemes for motorways, busways and protected roads and on roads-related environmental impact statements.  It also includes an enabling provision to formally declare a number of proposed public roads as motorways.  The roads concerned have already been approved under statutory motorway procedures but the provision is required to rectify legal difficulties which have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the busways, public transport services are improving.  We have witnessed the success of the Dublin Area Rapid Transport, which <Col N="517" /> has greatly benefited communities.  I had an input into the opening of the new Clontarf DART station and the benefits that has provided for the greater Dublin 3 area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of Bus Atha Cliath but some mechanism must be put in place to accommodate people's concerns about the alterations to bus routes and services.  There is a great deal of mutual benefit to be gained from such a mechanism.</P>
    <P>A large number of hackney licences were recently issued and there has been a massive 20 per cent increase in taxi licences in recent months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard 20 per cent as a massive increase, particularly when it occurs in a matter of weeks.  It is important that we ensure the PSV services that are available meet the demands of the general public.  My understanding, and I am open to challenge on this, is that they are not servicing the demands of the public in the city of Dublin, particularly on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays in the city of Dublin between the hours of 11.30 p.m. and 3 or 4 a.m. We should have State-sponsored, subsidised public service transport systems &mdash; I acknowledge the Nightlink service but that is inadequate &mdash; to meet public demand at this time of the day.  Late night bus services and the DART were operated on one occasion in the past.  People may say that running the DART late at night would pose security problems but the precedent exists and it proved to be successful.  We must develop these services to ensure they meet public demand.</P>
      <P>People know my position on the taxi industry. We have approximately 2,500 taxis to service the city of Dublin but even the taxi industry will acknowledge that is not a sufficient number to service peak demand on Friday and Saturday night around 12.30 a.m. when delays occur. Equally the industry will acknowledge that during the valley period, which is all day Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, problems can arise in relation to the number of taxis.  We have all witnessed taxis queuing to get a stop on the rank. Other taxi drivers go home because there are not any fares.  A happy medium must be struck to ensure demand is met during peak periods at the weekend and during the other weekday periods.</P>
      <P>I welcome the setting up by the Taoiseach of the transport forum bringing together, for the first time, people involved in the delivery of services and Departments such as the Environment and Local Government and Public Enterprise as well as other authorities such as the local county boroughs.  This forum will try to bring together the providers of public service vehicles in an effort to put in place a satisfactory service to meet the required demands.  I am optimistic progress will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital that the right course is taken in relation to the quality bus corridors and the <Col N="518" /> required infrastructure.  Quality bus corridors are a step in the right direction.  However, we must move to protect business houses and residential homes that require to use the areas identified as most suitable for quality bus corridors.  Equally, if we are to put quality bus corridors in place and spend a great deal of money in the process we must ensure that the buses provide the services demanded, particularly in the city of Dublin during the late night period.  A reply from the City Manager to a question on expenditure in relation to traffic matters revealed a figure of nearly £3.5 million, including more than £1.3 million in 1997 on quality bus corridors.</P>
    <P>We must have continued investment in our economy and the development of Dublin Port. Indeed, most people acknowledge the benefit of the principle of a port access route taking heavy goods vehicles from our residential roads to a dedicated port access for HGVs which merely want access to and from the port.  In striking the right balance we must take on board the concern for the environment which is central to all policy decisions of this Government.  I understand proposals of this nature will be eco-audited.</P>
    <P>We talk also of the importance of partnership, consensus and participation which Fianna Fáil has always favoured and which has proven to be the best way of mobilising the energies of the people in the pursuit of common objectives.  To this end, I look forward to the approach and philosophy Fianna Fáil guards as the correct formula, being put in place.</P>
    <P>An integral part of our political philosophy is the right of men, women and children to live in peace, protected by law, in their own homes.  The new power to compulsorily acquire a substratum of land for tunnel projects has and will continue to cause grave concern to the people who reside in areas where such projects are under consideration. I have first hand experience of this and while I welcome some of the reassurances given by the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, in his opening statement on the Roads (Amendment) Bill with regard to the proposed Dublin Port tunnel, I must emphasise the genuine concerns of residents along the line of the proposed port tunnel route from East Wall, Fairview, Marino, Whitehall, Beaumont and Santry, including Clontarf. Individual residents and the residents' associations representing those areas have endeavoured to put forward their case.  I pay special tribute to all who have aired their views for and against the proposal, particularly Marino Development Action Group, Clontarf Residents' Association, Drumcondra and District and the Combined Residents' Association.  I acknowledge the attempt by Dublin Corporation at discussions with residents and the consultative group meetings, which are regarded as a failed attempt.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one point which I have raised before.  Taking into account the funds, support and research available to the Dublin Port Project Team, Geoconsult-Arup, Ove-Arup, Dublin Corporation and the other authorities which have <Col N="519" /> demand-led funds available to put forward their case, there is an uphill battle for residents' associations or individual residents who wish to put forward their case, particularly if they are dependent on small voluntary subscriptions from a membership that may be on restricted income or pension.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to questions I asked over a prolonged period about funds.  A letter dated February 1996 from Dublin Corporation states: &ldquo;If, however, Residents' Associations wish to employ their own consultants or other professional assistance, that decision and the cost of engagement are a matter for themselves&rdquo;.  A reply from the Minister to a parliamentary question on 3 February 1998 states:</P>
    <P>The Minister is also empowered to certify that a contribution be made by a local authority towards costs and expenses reasonably incurred by any person in relation to an inquiry.  This power is exercisable after the inquiry has been held and a decision reached on the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have a letter from the Minister which refers to payment of costs to persons represented at a public inquiry into the motorway scheme for the Dublin port tunnel.  It states: &ldquo;Any person or group represented at the inquiry may apply for costs and I may certify that Dublin Corporation makes a contribution towards costs and expenses reasonably incurred&rdquo;.  This power may be exercised only after the inquiry has been held and a decision reached on the scheme.  Does anybody think that is fair?  If so, I would like to hear the reasons.  I ask the Minister and the Department to immediately review that aspect.</P>
    <P>There are valuable lessons to be learned from the manner in which the Dublin port tunnel project has been managed to date.  It certainly has not done much for public confidence in bureaucratic authority procedures.  While a number of people with whom I have been in contact on this issue are satisfied with the procedures, the vast majority are disenfranchised, disappointed and feel let down.  I am led to believe that the method used for test boring in Marino caused structural damage to some houses.  At a public meeting of the Marino Action Development Group held on 26 March 1996 two resolutions were passed: &ldquo;That this meeting deplores the action of Dublin Corporation in contemplating running traffic tunnels through the densely populated area of Marino and under their houses&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The meeting also deplores the ways and methods used in borings and site testings in our area without prior consultation with the residents involved&rdquo;.  I took the opportunity on that occasion to view the alleged damage caused and I was struck by the amount of damage to one or two of the houses I visited.  There is a better way to address this matter.</P>
    <P>This proposal goes back over a prolonged period of time.  I was happy to circulate to residents' associations a letter I received from Dublin Corporation outlining the proposal.  The route was indicated in bold print, from Whitehall to Booterstown <Col N="520" /> via Dublin port, mainly through open lands.  It stated that tunnels would be used where houses obstruct the line of the road, deep cuttings would minimise environmental impact and, it stressed, there would be no community severance. The bottom line from Dublin Corporation was that there was no alternative practical route available, but a new route was later found.  The cost was estimated at £130 million.  I would like to know what the cost would be today and the likely estimated cost of the current proposal for the A6 route which has been chosen by various authorities which do not represent the public.</P>
    <P>Why, when institutional lands are available, are they not used?  More money may be required to do that, but surely the Minister will provide that money.  I asked the Minister for the Environment and Local Government his views on access and transport routes available to the port and whether people's health and well being should take precedence over economic gain.</P>
    <P>I have received many letters from people along the proposed route who have indicated their concern, and the Minister is aware of them.  Various Ministers, including the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, wrote to me indicating that the Minister has a quasi-judicial function in this matter and cannot afford to enter into discussions on it.  I call on the Minister to review the project and to show initiative.  The common objective of the general public and the authorities should be taken into account in putting in place an appropriate port access.  I have no doubt if we do so our efforts will be applauded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I do not intend to use all my time because I am required to attend the committee dealing with the Finance Bill.  As a Deputy representing the constituency of Dublin North-Central I wish to put some of my views on record.  This Bill is primarily intended to facilitate construction of the Dublin port tunnel and I will address some of the issues that affect that project.</P>
      <P>First I wish to address one or two general issues which have been referred to by Deputy Callely and others.  The most important is the David and Goliath issue, funding for people who object to projects promoted by local authorities.  Before a motorway order can be made, a public inquiry must be held, at which it can be reasonably anticipated that a number of expert witnesses will be called and expert evidence given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation and the consultants it has employed have expended several million pounds of taxpayers' money over several years in preparing this scheme.  It is right that the scheme should be properly prepared and planned even when it costs money and requires expert assistance.  However, people living in areas such as Marino, East Wall and Whitehall who have consistently objected to <Col N="521" /> this project are placed in an impossible position. These are old areas of Dublin and many of the individuals concerned are elderly.  The residents' associations which have been rejuvenated by this issue have not been as active as they might have been in the past.  They do not have the funds to maintain meaningful opposition.  They have made serious and consistent efforts to raise money because they are rightly seeking expert evidence and advice, but they should not be placed in a position where they are required to do that.</P>
    <P>The Dublin city manager and other local authorities in similar circumstances should be given explicit legal power by elected members to grant aid people seeking to make a submission in circumstances such as the holding of a public inquiry, be it in relation to a motorway order or otherwise.  The previous Dublin city manager maintained he did not have that power and that even if Dublin Corporation decided to grant-aid objectors it would act <i>ultra vires.</i>  I have always publicly expressed my doubts about that, but as long as the city manager holds that view and has been given legal advice to that effect he presumably has no alternative but to follow it.  In view of this I ask the Minister to take on board the need to redress this balance because it will doubtless again arise.  We all accept that money cannot be thrown at people.  While there must be some kind of public control and auditing, we must give people the democratic right to object to major schemes of this kind which will impact seriously on their everyday lives.</P>
    <P>The NRA was established to take an overview of the major and primary road schemes in the country.  It is right that we should rely on local authorities in this area, who inevitably take a view which stops at the boundaries of their own areas.  However, the Minister is not accountable to the House for the activities of the NRA and it is not publicly accountable to anybody else.  This problem must be addressed.  Either the Minister is accountable for the NRA to this House or it must be made directly accountable.  How is compensation assessed regarding a substratum and how is the loss of amenity or property rights from houses to a substratum assessed?</P>
    <P>The port tunnel project is one of the largest construction projects ever attempted in the State and, presuming it proceeds, it will have a lasting effect on the city and the traffic flows.  The aims of the DPT scheme are laudable.  The problems of traffic congestion in Dublin are increasingly serious.  The city has seen many positive developments in the past ten years.  Much of the city centre has been rejuvenated, partly as a result of urban renewal schemes.  For the first time in many years people are returning to the city centre to live.  Many of the derelict sites which blighted the city for so long have been gradually replaced with buildings in which people are living and cultural and artistic life is undergoing a renaissance.</P>
    <P>The down side of this is the increasing number of cars coming into the city and blocking the streets.  Anybody travelling to this House during <Col N="522" /> rush hour at any time of the morning or evening will be aware of that.  Traffic and traffic congestion is a complex problem which requires an integrated solution.  The DTI produced a report a couple of years ago which is a fine attempt at tackling the problem through an integrated approach.</P>
    <P>We need a comprehensive Luas system.  The two lines currently planned are inadequate.  We should move as quickly as possible to put in place the mechanisms required before the third leg.  I do not understand why there has been an additional delay in doing that.  We also need to look at the possibility of other lines.  The budgetary situation in the country has not been as positive for many years.  Everybody accepts that we can afford to and must increase spending on infrastructural development, especially in the Dublin area.  This can be done without causing problems down the road.  I urge the Minister and his officials to look urgently at the Luas plans. Extension of the plan beyond the three proposed lines needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>Another part of the DTI plan is the quality bus corridors, which I support.  They are an excellent idea.  However, they must be implemented with sensitivity.  There are difficulties in my constituency, for example on Fairview Strand, largely because bus lanes are being placed in areas adjacent to businesses.  There is no need for a bus lane at times of the day when buses can normally pass freely.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Port access tunnel is an important part of the DTI recommendations.  While we need a dedicated port access route we must avoid urban motorways.  People must be discouraged from bringing their cars into the city centre.  I am concerned that, given the way this plan has been formulated, it will encourage the use of the port tunnel by motorists travelling to the city centre via the docks.  We should seek to avoid this.</P>
    <P>For commercial reasons, it is imperative that we continue to develop Dublin Port in the way it has been developing for several years.  The port now employs 3,500 people and contributes indirectly to many thousands of jobs nationally. It handles over two thirds of our sea trade.  In the last number of years there has been significant growth in the trade flowing through the port.  I compliment the staff and management of the port who have contributed to the significant development of the facility in recent years.  In 1995, the port experienced a 25 per cent increase in trade and, more important in the context of this debate, 6,000 HGVS a day were entering and leaving the port.  In the context of these figures there is no dispute about the need for a port access route.  It is vital for the future of the port and of Dublin.</P>
    <P>However, I object to the port access route which has been chosen and the construction which this Bill is intended to facilitate.  Initially, six possible routes, numbered A1 to A6, for the proposed port tunnel were proposed.  Some of these routes ran along or under institutional land largely owned by the Churches.  If there had been <Col N="523" /> proper and meaningful consultation at that stage with local representatives and local residents it might have been possible to reach agreement on one of these routes.  However, it became clear at an early stage that the project promoter and Dublin Corporation favoured a specific route, numbered A6, and were determined it would be selected.</P>
    <P>The A6 route is the most controversial as it locates the tunnel portal entrance near a residential area in Whitehall and involves tunnelling under 273 houses in Marino.  If it goes ahead, it will result in the closure of Fairview Park, a major facility on the northside of Dublin, for up to three years.  Most importantly, it will utilise a tunnelling method that has been involved in several serious tunnel collapses.  The most recent incident was during the construction of the Jubilee line in Heathrow when a tunnel collapsed causing several deaths.  There was also a spectacular accident during the construction of the U-bahn in Munich some years ago when a single decker bus upturned into a tunnel that was being built.  The method involves shooting concrete at high speed into the side of a tunnel which solidifies over the next 18 hours.  I concede there is controversy among engineers involved in this area of expertise but it is generally accepted that there is a risk, albeit small, and it should not be taken in residential areas.</P>
    <P>It quickly became obvious that the reason the A6 route was chosen was because it was the cheapest of the six options.  Ironically, the portal entrance has been shifted by general agreement and this has added approximately £30 million to the cost.  It may no longer be the case that it is the cheapest option.  The impression was given in the immediate area that the cost factor outweighed all environmental, health and safety concerns.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Port tunnel as currently proposed is flawed.  The choice of route is flawed and the degree of consultation with local residents, to which other Deputies referred, has been ineffective.  The proposed tunnelling method is inappropriate for use in residential areas.  These genuine and legitimate fears are held by people, many of them elderly, in my constituency.  Unfortunately, the project promoters have failed to take these concerns seriously.  It is fair to acknowledge that efforts have been made in the past year to 18 months by Dublin Corporation and the project promoters to consult local residents in a formal grouping.  However, the consultation in the early stages was not effective and this has contributed to the level of mistrust which exists.  Public consultation at that stage was more in the nature of public confrontation.</P>
    <P>I am interested to know how the Bill arose.  I recall attending a number of meetings of Dublin Corporation where councillors were assured by the City Manager that he foresaw no legal difficulty with regard to tunnelling.  I assume he was acting on the legal advice given to him by the law <Col N="524" /> agent.  I am not sure whether he sought advice from the Department of the Environment and Local Government or the Office of the Attorney General.  However, somebody has obviously decided there is a legal difficulty which needs to be clarified.  If that is the case, what is the position regarding tunnelling projects that have already taken place, for example, the Lee tunnel?  If there is a requirement to compulsorily acquire the substrata under land, what is the position regarding projects that have already started?</P>
    <P>I am surprised the Bill was published in the manner and at the time it became available.  It was circulated at the end of the last session on 16 December although it had not been previously signalled in any way.  It was not included in the Government's programme issued at the start of the last session and it was not signalled at any point during it.  This type of action inevitably fuels the high level of mistrust which already exists and which is easily understood.</P>
    <P>This matter has been bungled by the local authority in Dublin.  It has been badly handled and sold and there was a flawed consultative method. There are genuine reasons to be concerned about the project and I wish to highlight those concerns. The Minister has questions to answer not only in relation to this project in which he has a role, but also about the genesis of the Bill and other matters affecting the Dublin Port tunnel and the planning process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, the purpose of which is to smooth the way for tunnelling for the Dublin Port tunnel, Luas and other projects and to avoid a position where the projects are further delayed by court action and hassle.  The Bill seeks to avoid a possible block which some determined or misguided groups may try to put in the way of the projects.  I support the legislation because it will make it much easier and simpler to progress the plans.  It will also ensure that more time is not spent in the courts and fortunes are not spent on lawyers arguing the toss about aspects of the projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill states that substratum of land means any subsoil or anything beneath the surface of land required.  I am not a geologist and the Bill does not explain those terms.  I agree with the principle that the National Roads Authority and the State should be able to tunnel under people's property.  However, where does the substratum start?  I might know if I were a geologist, but does it start two inches, two feet, two metres or 20 metres beneath the surface?  Where does it start and end?  There is no problem if it involves depths of 10 or 20 metres.  However, it may be necessary to comply with regulations in this area and the Bill does not indicate the exact depth of the substrata or at what point CPOs will start. This aspect needs to be clarified.  The State should have the right to carry out this work, but rights also involve duties and responsibilities.  The Bill is designed to remove possible confusion and this matter may add to it rather than remove it <Col N="525" /> unless it is clarified.  The answer may be simple and I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell mentioned confusion and mistrust.  He suggested there was something wrong with the way the Bill was published before Christmas.  I do not understand the Deputy's point.  This is the first week in March and no guillotine was placed on the legislation.  The Bill was not rushed through the House when Members were at Christmas parties.  It does not matter when the legislation was published.  The Bill is only on Second Stage and people who have an interest in it or concerns about it have had more than ample time to consider it.  Members often complain that Second Stage debates of Bills are taken too quickly.  The guideline is two weeks but often that is not adhered to.  Second Stage debates are often taken before groups have had a chance to consider Bills, but that does not apply in this case because the Bill was published almost three months ago.</P>
    <P>I favour the concept of a port tunnel, perhaps because I was involved in many committees on the issue over the years.  I was a member of the DTI local authority committee and the steering committee.  This matter was discussed at length but we did not make much progress.  The DTI proposed an integrated strategy and much consultation with interest groups, residents' associations and others took place at that stage.  We must be careful or the entire process of producing strategies and undertaking consultation will get a bad name.</P>
    <P>There is no point getting people to give up their time and energy and to co-operate in trying to design what is best for the system if nothing is done afterwards.  The problem in Dublin and elsewhere is that shelves are full of great reports and studies but nothing has been done about them.  We cannot blame people who are frustrated. They did not bother to get involved in the process of consultation because they felt it was only another theoretical study.</P>
    <P>When a study is done that leads to a policy, that policy must be implemented.  There is no point in spending years planning if we do not act on that plan.</P>
    <P>Some residents' groups are very dedicated and have highly qualified people putting their time and energy into the cause.  However, we will never get total agreement.  If anything, our system is becoming almost too democratic, and if most people are on board, we should proceed with a project.  If people are inconvenienced, a form of compensation to the individual or community should be made available.  This matter also arose during the debate on the Waste Management Bill but nothing ever seems to happen.  One might get a nod from the city or county manager because one area is seen to be hard done by and he or she could do something for that area.  However, that is not enough.  This should be formalised.  If individuals or a community have done poorly because of a development, compensation should be offered to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> Deputy McDowell referred to the quality bus corridors.  Many people who did not participate in the formulation of the DTI are now demanding consultation when their area is concerned.  That is understandable, but if previous strategies were seen to be implemented, people would contribute to those strategies at an earlier stage.  I am horrified by the way the DTI is being presented.  Some groups, including certain political parties, are trying to unravel or tunnel under the DTI although they made little or no contribution to that strategy initially.  We must stop playing games with this initiative and get on with implementing it.</P>
    <P>I favour the port tunnel.  It does not go under my constituency, although the northern portals will be in my area.  If we moved the tunnel 100 metres, one housing estate would be happy while another would be up in arms.  If there was a location that would make everybody happy, we could move it there.  However, it is not a perfect world and there is no ideal site.  Eventually the common good will prevail.  Anything we construct will have to be done to best international standards, but it is a utopian dream to think that everybody will subscribe to it.  The benefits of the tunnel will not be as obvious to some as it is to others.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to the route, which should be selected by professionals.  I am not a geologist; experts who know about rock strata and mud types should make these decisions, not politicians who come under pressure from residents' groups.  We should not veer from decisions made on professional advice unless there are very good reasons for doing so.</P>
    <P>There are tunnels in every city in Europe.  I went on a local authority delegation to Europe to look at some, and we were brought down to the bowels of the earth beneath London where there are layers of tunnels.  We were allowed to inspect the work in so much detail that I was almost scared.  I would almost have preferred to see a video of the proceedings because I took a chunk of the mud that was being tunnelled through and I could stick my finger into it, though this was 40 metres under the surface.  That showed me London is built on mud, yet there are layers of tunnels there.  If it is possible to do this in soft mud, the Dublin tunnel, going through rock, must be a fairly simple engineering task.</P>
    <P>We then went to Oslo where there are road tunnels, as opposed to the London rail tunnels. None of the Oslo tunnels was three miles long but I was reassured that the people of Marino have nothing to worry about from the tunnelling point of view.  However, I was concerned by the possibility of air pollution, which may be a problem at both ends of the tunnel.  The Norwegians said they could not have a three mile tunnel and allow the fumes to blow out of it in any direction. They installed very sophisticated filtering systems; some of those systems stick up like ugly smokestacks while others are underground bypass chambers which are not visible above <Col N="527" /> ground.  We must provide those filter systems to reassure those living near the tunnel entrances.</P>
    <P>We must build this tunnel to best international standards but we must also allay the fears of the communities concerned.  One problem is the ease with which scare tactics can be used.  Those stirring up suspicion always have an advantage over officialdom, which can be slow to react.  It is easy to draw a frightening cartoon that will scare a community.</P>
    <P>On the issue of compensation, there will always be a certain amount of vibration when constructing a tunnel through rock.  When similar tunnelling was taking place in Oslo people were paid hotel expenses for three or four days regardless of whether they stayed in the hotel.  They did not have to produce receipts.  Perhaps we should do likewise here and compensate those on whom the project will have long-term effects.  We should be straight with people.  The construction of the tunnel will cause a certain amount of convenience to people in the area.</P>
    <P>Very little progress has been made on implementing the recommendations of the DTI and there is talk of a review.  People are making an industry out of devising strategies, compiling studies, consultants' reports and so on.  Such initiatives have a logic only if a decision is made on them.  I accept there have been many changes since the DTI completed its report five years ago. At that time people could not have known the economy would grow or that car sales would escalate to such an extent.  However, the public will become cynical if we engage in another round of consultations to devise a grand overall strategy. People should be told what was achieved from the last plan and how long it will take to meet all its objectives.  If the DTI is to be reviewed it should be done on an in-house basis rather than going back to the public, when we cannot show them what we have achieved so far.</P>
    <P>We must bite the bullet in respect of the transport problem.  People have more money and families are buying a second car.  People take their cars to work because it is more convenient.  We can either allow that to continue or do something about it.  If we want people to use public transport, we must loosen the strings on Dublin Bus and Irish Rail.  We cannot expect those organisations to bring vast numbers of people to and from work every day and only break even.  While many of the problems in the business sector are resolved by introducing urban renewal incentives, seaside resort schemes or some type of tax concession, we tend to believe that people can be transported to and from work on a break even basis.  There have been many innovative suggestions about how to encourage people to use public transport.  I do not bring my car in here merely because of the free parking.  I have a bike in the back shed, but I do not take it out to be photographed as often as other people.</P>

      <P>I can justify bringing my car in here because I usually attend meetings on my way home.  However, many people who work regular hours in offices or factories could use public transport.  We must take positive action to encourage people to leave their cars at home.  For example, employers could provide employees with commuter bus tickets at a cheaper rate, if not free.  Bus transport in Dublin has a bad image.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister can clarify where the substratum will start.  I support the two lane Dublin Port tunnel.  I do not support those who want it reduced in size or moved to somebody else's door.  We have made a decision on the matter and we should pull together to get it completed as soon as possible.  We must accept that people will be inconvenienced in the short-term, but the end product will be worthwhile.  We should then consult people about the next phase of an overall strategy for land use, transport and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  My contribution will focus on how it will impact on the north side of the city, the Dublin North-East constituency and Fingal County Council.</P>
      <P>The Bill will allow for the compulsory acquisition of a substratum of land for the construction of road motorways.  It will also allow for the further enhancement of the infrastructure required to service the ever-increasing volume of traffic as a result of the vibrant economy created in the past number of years.  The Government has shown some effort at last to address the serious business of the construction of motorways, light rail and the port tunnel.  However, I want action.</P>
      <P>In autumn 1995 a public inquiry was held in Swords about the construction of the section of the M1 from Rowan's Cross to join the section already constructed from the city to Dublin Airport. I understand the inspector's report was completed in the spring of 1996.  The Minister recently stated that the delay in making a decision was due to the complexity of the issues involved.  I am sure the issues raised were complex, but I am equally sure the Minister, who came fresh to the Department last year, is capable of dealing with those complexities.  The inspector held a hearing in autumn 1995 and, having considered the complex arguments, presented his report in spring 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that officials of the Department may wish to consider further the matters raised in the report, but it is unacceptable that the Department is frozen in inaction.  Communities need to know what the future holds for them.  People's livelihoods and homes will be affected by the route of this road.  The soon to be completed section of the M1 from Gormanston to the five roads, <Col N="529" /> bypassing the town of Balbriggan, will be of great benefit to the town.  It will allow it to develop as a community.  The diversion of traffic from Drogheda, Dundalk and Northern Ireland from the narrow main street will benefit commuters and commercial traffic.  However, the benefit will be short lived in assisting traffic movement if the next section of the motorway is not constructed. The capacity of the Swords bypass will not accommodate the expected growth in traffic. Equally, it is wrong that the volume of traffic should be allowed on what are inadequate carriageways.</P>
    <P>This Bill is required to allow for improved infrastructure to accommodate the growth of commercial traffic.  The need for the construction of the port tunnel is apparent.  The organisation and control of the increasing level of road traffic is important and should not be put on the long finger.  The public has a right to the safest road network possible and we are obliged to make that possible.  The current level of danger to those who use and live along the N1 is great and we must also have regard for the concerns of those on whom the proposed M1 route will impact.  Irrespective of whether one favours the current route or an imaginary alternative, it is generally accepted that this connecting section is a must.  I urge the Minister to make a decision so that those affected may get on with their business.</P>
    <P>I am aware of one family who will be required to vacate their home and farm if assent is given for the route.  The man is not prepared to invest further in his farm and his wife sees no point in for instance decorating their home until the paralysis caused by the Minister's inaction is put aside. I urge the Minister to make a decision on this route as soon as possible because delays inhibit investment and growth generation.</P>
    <P>The completion of the Grange Road in Baldoyle, which feeds into the M50, is of paramount importance.  Recently the residents blocked the roadway and the roads leading on to the M50 because they have become prisoners in their homes.  Given that promises had been made, for the past 20 years, that the road which runs through their estate would be completed they had no alternative but to take this action.  Completion of this road is very important because heavy traffic use it going into an industrial estate in Baldoyle. To facilitate the heavy traffic by widening of the bridge which crosses the main Belfast line near their homes and leads into Baldoyle.  Fingal County Council recently passed a section 59 motion and Dublin Corporation are in the process of passing one.  This will allow for the widening of the bridge and the roadworks through Grange Abbey estate to proceed.</P>
    <P>It is important to encourage people away from motorways and allow them to use public transport. Given that there is a growing population in Grange Abbey, Donaghmede and Baldoyle it would be ideal if, when the new line to Malahide is put in place, a halt was constructed beside the bridge in Baldoyle.  This would be of enormous <Col N="530" /> benefit to the local community and would get them to their places of work quickly.  The DART has been a great success.  A halt in this area would pay, would be of great benefit to the community and would take people off our roads.</P>
    <P>A traffic calming scheme was arranged for the Baldoyle area.  As in every other community this matter was debated at public meetings and only some agreed with it.  The ideal solution would be a road which would bypass Baldoyle from the Grange Road and continue towards the main road which feeds Baldoyle and Portmarnock. This road, and the road to which I have just referred, when constructed, will generate further traffic because to get on to the M50 people will come through Baldoyle village and make their way there.  While we are spending money it is important that a road to bypass Baldoyle from Grange Road to the main Strand Road would be constructed.  The money has been promised.  Will the Minister use his good offices to ensure that the money is made available as soon as possible to allow these works proceed.</P>
    <P>Dublin Port continues to grow.  I served as a director of the Dublin Port and Docks Board when the port was not doing well.  The management, to whom I pay tribute, have built up the port and it is now operating profitably.  It will not continue to operate profitably unless there are proper routes to and from the port.  People who operate trucking businesses, manufacturers and others, need to get their goods to port on time and at low cost.  At present it is almost impossible to get there on time especially during peak hours.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the port tunnel will go ahead but I am sad it has taken so long to happen. Deputy Ahern is right in saying one cannot please everyone.  Discussions have taken place with the people of Marino, Whitehall and other areas where portals will be erected.  Those people are certainly worried and I sympathise with them but one cannot hold up this development forever. The Minister should make a decision to have the tunnel erected.  Some residents have suggested the portals should be shifted towards the north. However, if we were to listen to every argument the portals would end up in some part of North County Dublin or further north and the tunnel will be of no use to anyone and would add another £13 million to the £177 million cost of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>When acquiring land for motorways we should look to the future.  Experts say the two-lane dual carriageways will be running close to capacity in 2017.  As a result we will have to add extra lanes in each direction in 2016.  To avoid anguish and grief, when acquiring land we should think to the future when motorways will require three laneways in each direction.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I urge the Minister to work towards completion of the port tunnel at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to clarify the power of local authorities as road <Col N="531" /> authorities to compulsorily acquire a substratum of land for the construction and maintenance of a road tunnel as part of their powers under the Roads Act, 1993.  Fine Gael welcomes this Bill and will not oppose it.</P>
      <P>Are we implying that from now on the land underneath a house will be owned by the house-holder? The Bill states that its primary purpose is to clarify the power of local authorities.  I assume that up to now there was uncertainty about the ownership of the land underneath the house.  Are we saying that from now on, by implication, the substratum of land underneath houses will be the property of the landowner?  Will there be other implications for water etc.  ?</P>
      <P>My party welcomes this Bill.  Traffic in Dublin is a nightmare but I do not want to repeat it <i>ad nauseam.</i>  I note the Minister for Finance is of the opinion that nothing will be done about traffic in Dublin until it grinds to a halt.  Many of his party colleagues have suggested that tax exemptions and other initiatives should be introduced.  The document my party published on the traffic problem in Dublin contains some good suggestions.  I accept Dublin Bus is doing its best but it needs a major cash injection to upgrade its bus fleet.  Its buses are uncomfortable, dirty, smelly and noisy. If cars are to be taken off the road, it must be made attractive for people to use buses which should be safe and run on time.  This is not happening.</P>
      <P>There are measures that can be taken now.  It has been suggested that tax exemptions should be introduced as an incentive to financial institutions to allow Dublin Bus and private bus owners to upgrade their fleets.  It would be money well spent but the Government is not in favour of this.</P>
      <P>It is a sign of underdevelopment that the vast bulk of the population of a country is concentrated in the capital city.  In Lima and other south American cities people have been drawn in from rural areas.  As a consequence of people being drawn into Dublin, rural areas are being denuded of people and resources.  There is a need for local improvement schemes to upgrade county roads. Last year Cork County Council received £120,000 for this purpose.  A total of 236 roads need to be upgraded.  With this sum it will be able to complete six projects per year.  It received 35 applications in 1997; 20 in 1996; 22 in 1995; 35 in 1994; 33 in 1993; 42 in 1992, and 27 in 1991.  Compared to a figure of £500 million which is to be spent on the Luas project £120,000 is a measly sum.  The Minister should increase it dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In urban areas there are bus shelters every few hundred yards but they are not constructed in rural areas because they are deemed uneconomic. A bus shelter will be constructed only if an advertiser is willing to act as sponsor.  An advertiser will do so only on roads on which there is much traffic and an advertisement will be seen.  There are many dangerous crossroads in rural areas on which there is no lighting or bus shelter.  People are expected to wait for buses in the rain and the <Col N="532" /> dark in winter.  I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that this is a serious problem for those living in rural areas.  They should be treated equally.</P>
    <P>Litter on county roads is a major issue.  Last week on a half mile stretch of road my wife collected eight large plastic bags of litter, including a dead cat in a plastic bag.  This is unbelievable. There is a need to put appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure county roads are cleaned up.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill for a judicial review.  We should proceed with care as it appears accountability is being devolved.  I cite as an example the construction of pylons by the ESB in east Cork where controversy is raging.  There is a danger that this will lead to public disorder.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Enterprise have tried to intervene but, to my knowledge, they have been snubbed.</P>
    <P>Although the Fermoy bypass is badly needed, the National Roads Authority has decided not to proceed with it.  Fermoy is one of the few places in the country where there is a right angle bend. Some evenings it can take the best part of a half an hour to pass through the town which is situated on a national road.  This is crazy.  The rail link between Midleton and Cork needs to be reopened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unbelievable at this late stage in the development of the Dublin port tunnel project which has been extensively studied, redesigned and placed on public display that it has dawned on the various arms of the State it is necessary to introduce this Bill.  It should have been introduced many years ago.  It is a source of great frustration that it seems to be taking forever to complete major infrastructural projects.  Everybody appreciates that Dublin Port provides an economic lifeline and that the tunnel project is long overdue to relieve the pressure on the city quays which are clogged from early morning to late in the evening with oil tankers and commercial traffic.  It is a national scandal &mdash; and beyond comprehension &mdash; that we are still talking about this project in 1998 and the potential for a further judicial review, High Court challenge and Supreme Court hearing.  The responsibility lies with consecutive Governments.</P>
      <P>The traffic problem in Dublin has been the subject of many studies by bodies such as the DTI. The underground rail option has also been the subject of review but little action has been taken. There are two new satellite towns in my constituency of Dublin West which I have the honour to represent.  It is projected that its population will grow rapidly and increase to 100,000 in a short few years.  Transport is, therefore, high on people's agendas.  The constituency is the location of a national rail distribution project which should be compatible with the Dublin port tunnel project.  There is a possibility that containers will be transported from Dublin port by rail to the ring road network which may lessen the need for a tunnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> Different Departments have responsibility for these projects.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government is responsible for the road network while the Department of Public Enterprise is responsible for the rail network. Implementation of transport policy in the greater Dublin area is fragmented between local authorities, Departments, State agencies, such as the National Roads Authority, and the Dublin Transportation Initiative office.  They endeavour to deal with what everybody agrees is a ridiculous situation.  Why has that happened and what will be done about it?  When will we say there have been enough studies and it is time to begin the work?  There is a need for consultation and proper dialogue.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Dublin Port tunnel project, Dublin Corporation had the necessary expertise. It decided what should be done, but that resulted in a public outcry and the plans were put back on display. Five options were put forward for the tunnel entry in Whitehall where there is a motorway and surely the place to commence the tunnel is at the motorway.  It is beyond me why this has become such a contentious issue, why those decisions cannot be fast tracked and why the common good does not supersede everything else.  It will be many years before that tunnel project will be in place to help alleviate traffic congestion in the capital.</P>
    <P>Regarding the motorway ring, I hope Deputy Cosgrave's prediction that further lanes will be required in the tunnel by the year 2016 is not based on the projection figures used for the Westlink toll bridge.  Those projections have been fast forwarded by approximately five years.  That toll bridge, which is a key link in the motorway network, is running to capacity four or five years in advance of what was predicted.</P>
    <P>The capabilities of our experts in road design, road planning and in completing the required work have been deplorable.  I hold that view for a number of reasons.  Traffic was hardly using the roundabout at the Red Cow Inn when efforts were made to widen the road by narrowing footpaths and devising all sorts of trimming gimmicks to relieve the traffic congestion that virtually commenced the day the road opened.  In my constituency footpaths have been narrowed at the Western Motorway at Palmerstown which has resulted in traffic disruption.  It was then decided to provide a bus lane for buses travelling in from Lucan which has required the cutting of intersection aisles where there are currently traffic lights. Why was the motorway not designed to accommodate that bus lane which could have been built five or six feet further in than it is?  People are happy to use public transport provided it will take them where they want to get in a reasonable time. However as soon as buses using that bus lane reach Heuston Railway Station they are into the tailback of traffic on the quays.  The time advantage gained by using the bus lane on the dual carriageway is quickly lost in a traffic bottleneck.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> Because there has been no progress to deal with that problem people who might use public transport do not use it.</P>
    <P>The rail service is an issue in the Dublin north by-election.  People on the doorsteps in Swords have said that when they travel by car to Malahide railway station they cannot get on the commuter rail service because there are not enough carriages.  The lack of integration between road transport and bus and rail services is frustrating and it represents a waste of taxpayers' money. The Minister for Finance, when dealing with the Finance Bill yesterday, made the honest comment that the greater Dublin area is gridlocking and it will probably have to become chaotic, which it is not far off now, before real action is taken.  Perhaps a written constitution in this area &mdash; which has merits &mdash; could be a major liability.</P>
    <P>The Southern Cross route is a major motorway that terminates on the Firhouse Road.  An extra loop to that motorway should have been built five years ago and I understand the contract for that work is about to commence.  The cost of those projects have escalated.  Substantial funds have been lying in Brussels waiting to be dispensed, but they were not drawn down until five to eight years later which involved an escalation in the capital cost of the project.  Public representatives at local and national level are frustrated because they know that a lack of funds was not the reason those projects did not proceed quickly enough.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of environmental transport movement.  Priority should be given to the public transport requirement to reduce the number of car trips, but as long as there is a lack of an integrated transport policy people will continue to use their cars.  Deputy Stanton referred to the rural versus the urban in regard to transport infrastructure.  If one were to stand at the side of the Naas dual carriageway, the Galway road or the Navan road between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., one would note that the number of motorists commuting to Dublin from the midlands has greatly increased.  Added to that is commuter traffic from western satellite towns.  That results in gridlock every morning on the Lucan bypass. One could predict the traffic report every morning. The only difference arises when a car breaks down on a freeway or there are wandering horses on the Lucan road, which is another matter.</P>
    <P>It is annoying that a lack of resources and finances are not the cause of the traffic congestion but the problem has arisen because we do not appear to be capable of getting to the root cause of it because of the fragmentation of the bodies responsible for transport.  I urge the Minister of State to return to the Department to seek to clear up this legal matter in this legislation.  He should consider the total picture.  Who has ultimate responsibility for transport movement in Dublin?  There is a need for the Government to introduce some co-ordination in this area.</P>
    <P>The present position cannot continue and is not acceptable.  I urge the Minister to communicate with his ministerial colleagues to bring forward <Col N="535" /> the provision of a rail link to reduce the number of heavy duty vehicles in Dublin city centre. Goods coming through Dublin Port should be transported by rail.  That would benefit the national rail network.  Goods would be transported from Dublin Port to west Dublin and would then be distributed nationally, preferably mainly by rail, which would reduce the number of heavy duty vehicles on our roads network.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation of our population could be achieved if a decent transport network was provided to the west coast and all areas in between. The growth of industries locating in west Dublin is due to multinationals like IBM, Hewlett Packard and Intel, which are all in or on the borders of my constituency and are creating employment and generating residential developments, availing of the transport infrastructure in place.  However, there is a need for a more balanced distribution of investment and population settlement.  That will not be achieved unless the necessary national transport infrastructure is in place.  Great progress has been made, but we are not here to compliment ourselves on what we have achieved.  We are here to strive to improve the position.</P>
    <P>We have had the Dunleer by-pass, the Athlone by-pass and a multiplicity of major industrial infrastructural development.  That is how decentralisation will be successful.  Major industrial projects want to be within a half hour's travel distance of the international airport and we may be able to encourage them to locate within an hour's travel distance of it.  If we are to succeed in developing a co-ordinated transportation policy in the eastern region, which is at the heart of this Bill, that must be achieved.  We need an integrated approach to take account of public transport, cars and heavy duty vehicles, but at this juncture there is a great deal of fragmentation in regard to who has responsibility for achieving targets. Looking at the history of this tunnel, one must ask if anyone is satisfied with the rate of progress.  When the project was first mooted and decided necessary, it would have been difficult to believe legislation would be introduced in 1998 to enable the project to proceed.</P>
    <P>We must have public consultation.  The Palmerstown by-pass was constructed in my constituency and 11 private residences were acquired and demolished.  The families concerned were compensated and relocated.  In Lucan four or five houses were located on the route of the by-pass. Naturally, the initial reaction of those affected and others was to object to the project.  The hearings, the inspector's report and modifications are part of the requirement of consultation, but I am concerned about the time it takes for these projects to be brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to the one million people in Dublin that a port tunnel project should be in place. I hope when the Minister responds to the points raised by other Deputies he will address the requirement to extend the width of the tunnel to take projected traffic flows in the year 2016.  Even <Col N="536" /> after considering the ideas, recommendations and information provided by economists, experts and so-called forward planners, we have found serious shortcomings because of the economic uplift. They are not keeping up with the requirements of a small capital city of one million people.  This is not large in international terms but it seems like a city of ten million because of the defects we have highlighted.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to incentives under various Governments, including incentives to build car parks in the city.  We provided this incentive as a short-term measure to resolve a car parking problem but now we want to find ways to discourage people from bringing their cars into the city.  I should like to see a coherent traffic programme for the greater Dublin area which would recognise the need to minimise the use of the car.  That will only happen if and when public transport is responsive to the needs of the population.</P>
    <P>I reside in Lucan in a community of 30,000.  We have asked Iarnród Éireann to open a commuter station at south Lucan.  It opened stations further up the line at Hazelhatch, for example, which has a population of perhaps 500, but in areas with a large population it seems to be beyond the company's ability to recognise the potential customer base.  It introduced the Arrow service which was welcome, but after a year it closed the station at Hazelhatch because people were not taking the train.  Further down the line places like north Clondalkin and Lucan have populations of 20,000 to 30,000.  The trains come to a grinding halt at Heuston Station.  There is an old rail link under the Phoenix Park linking up to the rest of the rail network but it is not in use.  Iarnród Éireann should be able to say why it is not in use.</P>
    <P>We are introducing Luas and we have the DART but we are not integrating them.  I do not see the logic in what is proposed.  We were to go over ground with Luas but the Government has now decided to study the underground option. Why was that not done initially?  That is another source of considerable frustration.  I urge the Minister and his colleagues to get to grips with the problem and come up with an integrated transport plan.</P>
    <P>The previous Taoiseach introduced Operation Freeflow because he got caught in traffic for almost an hour one day and could not get from one engagement to another.  As a result a crisis decision was made to introduce Operation Freeflow and the Garda authorities were asked to manage the traffic.  It seemed to work for a period of time but that crisis passed and we reverted to the old ways.  I would like to see these major infrastructural projects completed as soon as is practicable so that the people of this city will see that the Government, the local authorities and the transport authorities are doing something to resolve the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the previous speakers who were all of the same opinion, I am opposed to the north port tunnel and have consistently <Col N="537" /> made my views known at Dublin City Council and in public.  I am opposed to the tunnel for very good reasons.  I agree with the view of Professor Simon Perry that we should have explored an east-west tunnel, otherwise known as the Liffey tunnel.  It would have had direct access to the port which is essential.  It also would have serviced the industrial estates in the western suburbs.  That would have cleared the city quays which, as the previous speaker rightly said, are clogged up. That would have been the ideal solution but instead we have opted for a north port tunnel.  I believe it is a power trip by the road engineers who have always wanted it.</P>
      <P>We spoke about port access, which is essential, but now we are including cars.  As Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Lawlor said, it looks as if we will have to expand the tunnel, which does not make sense.  Let us have port access for trucks, but not cars.  It is clear that we are looking at a Trojan horse for the eastern by-pass.  It is time there was some honesty in this debate.  Will the Minister say if we are looking at an extension of the north port tunnel and the eastern by-pass?  It is essential that we address this problem now.  If not, we will be looking at two versions of the eastern by-pass &mdash; at cut and cover across Sandymount strand and a road on stilts &mdash; both of which are unacceptable.  We could look at the tunnelling option now which would mean tunnelling under the Liffey and Sandymount strand.  That would be extremely, perhaps prohibitively, expensive. That is the reason we should address that problem now, otherwise we will run into problems with the habitats directive and local opposition. People are still unhappy about the eastern by-pass.</P>
      <P>The problems in the Sandymount-Irishtown area will get progressively worse because of the docklands scheme which will bring over 20,000 people into the area.  A large proportion of these people will have cars which they will use because public transport in the area is appalling.  The No. 3 bus to Sandymount is probably one of the worst services in the country.  I have called time and time again for a quality bus corridor which has been refused on the grounds that the people in the area are not as affluent as those in Donnybrook and, therefore, do not have cars.  The idea is to encourage people to leave their cars at home.  While I understand the logic of that argument, it is flawed.  We need to cater for people who do not have access to cars and who are helping to relieve the traffic crisis by using the bus. That is why I reiterate my call for a quality bus corridor for the number 3 bus.  It is absolutely essential.  It is a form of discrimination that one section of Dublin 4, Donnybrook, is being catered for with a quality bus corridor while others, such as Ringsend and Irishtown, are ignored.  This must be re-examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tunnel vision is being adopted in dealing with the traffic crisis in Dublin.  Some £6 is spent on roads to every £1 on public transport.  That ratio says a great deal about our approach to traffic <Col N="538" /> in Dublin and in Ireland.  Examples in Germany, Holland and France, where there is efficient public transport, must be examined.  It makes for more efficient urban economies.  Dublin is losing approximately £500 million through traffic delays, and that does not take into account the health effects, of which I will speak later, and the damage to buildings from air pollution.  The cost of none of these has been calculated.  It makes economic sense to invest in public transport.  People have become very frustrated with traffic in Dublin. I listened to previous speakers, especially the Deputies representing Dublin North-Central, debating the port tunnel and crying their crocodile tears about the effect it will have on local people.  They had an opportunity when the Green Party proposed the east-west tunnel to Dublin City Council, yet they ignored it.  People should be careful before they are taken in by these Deputies.</P>
    <P>The issue of cycleways must be explored.  It is interesting that the Deputies who complained about the effect the tunnel will have are also those who obstructed the construction of cycleways in Clontarf.  That is regrettable.  Progress is very slow.  When I was Lord Mayor of Dublin, the Lord Mayor's commission on cycling examined the effect of cycling.  It found that 26,000 motorists could be taken off the roads in Dublin if a proper network of cycleways was constructed. That is happening very slowly and it is deeply frustrating for people who want a proper cycle network in Dublin.  Studies show many children do not cycle to school.  The commission discovered that two thirds of children in my constituency who live within a two mile radius of their school travel to it by car because it is dangerous on the roads and there are no cycleways.  We are in a vicious circle and we must break out of it immediately.  The will is there.  I see a change of attitude in the new director of traffic in Dublin Corporation, Mr. Owen Keegan, and the new city manager but it is happening very slowly and they are constantly faced with obstacles.</P>
    <P>There must be greater progress in traffic calming measures.  It seems possible we can have grandiose schemes for tunnels costing millions of pounds, yet we cannot do the small things right. We are still waiting for a proper traffic calming scheme in Sandymount in my constituency.  One has been installed in Ranelagh which is working reasonably well.  However, people in Terenure and Rathgar are crying out for traffic calming measures because the streets are dangerous, especially for their children.  Greater progress should be made and I ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to intervene and obtain a progress report on the situation.  I do not want to be too critical of the traffic section in Dublin Corporation.  The problem is it does not have sufficient resources.  It needs an injection of funding.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Noel Ahern speak of his conversion and I welcome his assertion that public transport must be financed.  People should also <Col N="539" /> be encouraged through measures in the Finance Bill to leave their cars at home.  This would mean examining the issues of benefits in kind and free car parking spaces.  The latter should be a no-no. People who have a bus pass, for example, should be given a tax allowance.  These are ideas which have been examined in other countries and which have worked well.  I am speaking of clean and efficient public transport.  The effect of the DART has been seen.  People will leave their cars behind if proper and efficient public transport is provided.</P>
    <P>The issue of Luas is being protracted and I do not know why.  I do not know whether it is the car lobby as I am unsure whether it has sufficient members to lobby so effectively as to stymie the project.  When I hear the Progressive Democrats calling for this project to be again put underground, I throw my hands up in despair.  This will just prolong the debate.  It is all right for Deputies from Clare, but it is deeply frustrating for those of us who represent this city.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may witness the traffic when he comes to Dublin, but it is becoming intolerable for those who must live here on a daily basis and deal with the air pollution.  The Dublin City Centre Business Association has identified traffic as the number one issue in the city.  It was crime, now it is traffic.  This Government is making a terrible mistake.  A great deal of incompetence is involved because, as I understand it, the underground route being studied follows the same line as the overground one.  That does not make sense.  The terrain is different and no borings have been taken, so I do not know what this report, which will be published in March, will reveal.  The idea of the route being put underground must be scrapped.  If anything should be put underground, it should be cars. There is potential there as it would leave the roads above free for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has not introduced a proper car maintenance test and that it has been delayed yet again.  We know from the latest figures from the Environmental Protection Agency that there is a serious air pollution problem in this city.  There are already problems with nitrogen dioxide; the World Health Organisation's limits have been broken on 15 occasions. It has now been discovered that there is a problem with Pm 10s, Pm 2.5s and volatile organic compounds.  This is a serious matter because, as World Health Organisation limits have been breached, it is clear that the deaths of some people in Dublin must be due to these pollutants. It is a serious matter for inner city dwellers. Schools in my constituency have a box full of inhalers in each classroom for children.  One in four children is suffering from asthma and the air <Col N="540" /> pollutants exacerbate this.  It is unacceptable and highly irresponsible to allow it.  We have a right to a clean environment and to breathe clean air. The Government is ignoring that right.  Buses which should be clean and efficient are the worst polluters because they spew out smoke.  A first step would be to have them running on natural gas but the Government is doing nothing about it.  Some £20,000 for an air quality management plan for this city is completely inadequate.  It must be examined urgently.</P>
    <P>If the philosophy of Deputies Cosgrave and Lawlor is adopted, whereby the road capacity is expanded to suit cars, a serious scenario would have to be faced.  It would mean the Glen of the Downs would be the first of many such cases. Roads all over Dublin and Ireland would have to be widened.  We should adopt a more far-sighted view as we approach the 21st century.  We are capitulating to the car lobby if we do not do so, and that is not the way to do business.  We should adopt a holistic approach to traffic problems and I hope the Government will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gormley for giving me the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  Roads such as the N2 and N3 are extremely important to Cavan-Monaghan as cars are the only form of transport in this region.  I welcome roads such as the M50 which allows us to transport goods.  Some rural dwellers are critical of such roads but they improve business opportunities.</P>
      <P>I will speak of the powers of the National Roads Authority and local authorities.  We have been trying to get an outer relief road or a bypass for Monaghan town which is on the N2.  However, there is a grey area between the powers of the local authority and the National Roads Authority. When the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, submitted the road network plans to Brussels he completely ignored the N2 and N3 and encouraged those travelling to Donegal town and Letterkenny to travel through Longford and Sligo.  That road has been dramatically improved but no funds have been granted for a bypass in Carrickmacross, Castleblayney or Monaghan town.  The situation in Monaghan town is critical. Two weeks ago we had a bomb scare on a Friday night.  There was no way for the emergency services to get out quickly if needed.  They were not needed in that case.  There was another bomb scare on Saturday night.  In view of this, I urge the Government to take up the plans put in place by Monaghan County Council for an outer relief road for Monaghan town where the emergency services could be based and on which traffic going to and from Letterkenny could flow freely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to be logical we must spend some money in rural Ireland as well as in the Dublin area.  I urge the Minister to look seriously at who has the responsibility to provide the outer relief road for Monaghan town.  Can he provide the finance for the road to Monaghan County Council? It will cost between £4 million and £5 million over <Col N="541" /> three years which is not a great deal of money. The road would relieve traffic congestion in Monaghan town and assist traffic travelling to and from Donegal, Derry and Tyrone.</P>
    <P>The road from Carrickmacross to Ardee has been improved.  However, the road through Carrickmacross is a nightmare.  The road from Castleblayney to Cashel is even worse.  The National Roads Authority seems to take the attitude that it can ignore this road because a bypass is planned for Castleblayney.  However, serious accidents may occur if something is not done to at least maintain the road.  It would be extremely unfortunate if lives are lost.</P>
    <P>We must continue to spend money on county and regional roads.  I welcome the increased funding for country and regional roads over the past three years.  Figures indicate that Cavan-Monaghan is one of the few areas which has experienced population decline.  We have no airports or railroads.  Money is being spent on this type of infrastructure in other counties and we are aggrieved that we do not receive similar amounts of money to subvent road improvements which are necessary to maintain industry in rural areas.</P>

      <P>The Roads (Amendment) Bill, 1997, will amend the Roads Act, 1993, mainly to allow a local authority to acquire a substratum. The Bill has a similar effect on the Dublin Transport (Light Rail) Act, 1996.  However, it is natural that Members have widened to debate to include matters relating to the national road and rail networks. The fact that so many Deputies have spoken on this Bill is indicative of the importance of both issues.</P>
      <P>Interesting legal arguments have come to light concerning the position in which local authorities now find themselves on substratum which they may need to acquire.  It seems there are considerable doubts as to whether the 1993 Act gave them powers to acquire substratum with or without land and buildings.  It is impossible to foresee all potential difficulties when preparing legislation. This legislation is indicative of that difficulty. However, it is encouraging that the Department and the Minister have introduced this legislation to address these doubts as comprehensively as possible.</P>

    <P>I took part in a thorough debate on the Roads Act, 1993.  It was a huge Bill with more than 80 sections and three Schedules.  There were many amendments on Committee Stage.  Nevertheless, there are serious weaknesses in that legislation which are being addressed in this Bill.  In view of the increasing workload of legislation coming before the Oireachtas, some of which is enacted in haste, it is inevitable that shortcomings will show up not long after legislation is passed.  We have recently seen this with respect to the Electoral Act which is topical because of the by elections. We have also seen it in the context of the Ethics in Public Office Act.  It seems that the clear legislative intentions of Government and all sides of the House have a different effect when legislation <Col N="542" /> is interpreted afterwards.  A difficulty also arises because of the number of committees to which legislation is now referred and the problems faced by members in being present for Bills in which they are interested.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends section 47 of the 1993 Act to enable a motorway authority, in the first instance, to specify a substratum of land in its motorway plan.  Section 4 amends section 52 of the same Act to the same effect in relation to the Minister's decision on that motorway project.  There is also the question of conferring motorway status on roads.  This continues as heretofore.  As I understand it, it is not amended by this legislation in so far as it affects the substratum.  A full motorway scheme and comprehensive environmental assessment will have to be prepared and submitted to the Minister for any piece of motorway to which the Bill refers.  It is very important that this continues to be the case.</P>
    <P>I have serious doubts about the quality of some environmental impact statements.  I suspect that some statements reflect and support the views of the authority or body which commissioned them. There is a belief that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  I am concerned that environmental impact statements are not required to meet a certain standard which can be easily verified.  I do not know how this can be done but it should be done.  When an environmental impact statement is required the local authority or private individual involved in the planning process pays well known consultants a huge amount of money to prepare the statement.  However, there do not seem to be standards which the statement must meet.  There are certainly no requirements in relation to the data provided in the statement. This makes it impossible to check the veracity of the information in the detail required.  This is a crucial element of the work involved in planning large projects and the provisions dealing with the building of motorways in the l993 Act and continued in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the way in which the opportunity for the public to make submissions is handled. The public is normally presented with highly technical and complicated documents to be examined and on which to make observations.  If we are serious about public involvement we must give the public and local bodies an opportunity to make an input at a much earlier stage of the process. I would go so far as to say that the input of the public is meaningless if it starts with the examination of technical material, maps and reports which can only be read by highly qualified people.</P>
    <P>This also applies to the preparation of county development plans.  These are very important documents and it should be relatively easy to give local communities a say in their preparation.  Up to now a draft plan was prepared by people with the relevant technical expertise and there was little involvement by local authority members who are part-time and have other demands on their time.  The public were invited to make a submission <Col N="543" /> only after the plan had been prepared.  I am delighted a number of communities in my county have decided, in co-operation with the local authority, to make suggestions before a plan is prepared.  This should be the normal procedure in all areas in which the public have a right to be involved.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the public inquiry procedure. Questions arise about whether the procedure is working or is well conducted.  Is it governed by sufficiently strict guidelines, or are ordinary people replaced in the process by expensive professional and legal personnel?  If so, this removes the process from the public and increases the cost.  If I am correct about environmental impact assessments and other public processes, then questions must be asked about the quality of any reports which are submitted.  There should be proper consultation across a range of issues where public involvement is desirable so that democratic rights can be upheld and developed.</P>
    <P>I smiled when Deputy Gormley referred to the traffic problems in Dublin.  He may have thought I was unsympathetic but this is not so.  I was thinking of the routes where there has been a significant deterioration in the flow of traffic during my five and a half years as a Member of the House.  However, there are other routes where the traffic flows relatively freely.  It should not be beyond the imagination of the authorities to make substantial improvements without incurring huge expenditure in infrastructural works.  Some infrastructural works are necessary and it is a good idea for them to be debated properly by the House, local authorities and local communities in advance of any action.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to alter the judicial review procedure.  The Minister said that an action challenging the validity of a decision by him on a motorway scheme or on a roads related environmental impact statement would have to be by way of judicial review and that the same timescale which currently applies to An Bord Pleanála would apply, that is it must be instituted within two months.  There is an interesting provision that the High Court will not grant leave to apply for a review unless it is satisfied there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision challenged is invalid.  This is restrictive.  It would be difficult to establish at this stage that a decision should be quashed, but we will have to rely on the wisdom of the courts to decide that matter. The High Court decision will be final unless it allows an appeal to the Supreme Court.  Concerns have been expressed about the major delays in projects occasioned by the reference of matters to the court after the provisions of the l993 Act have been gone through.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the l996 Act it was pointed out that if some of the light rail network was put underground specific provision would have to be made to give the local authority the right to acquire the substratum.  This point was <Col N="544" /> debated at some length but it was not provided for as adequately as it should have been.  Some people may say this project is outside my area of concern but I welcome the independent analysis of the options.  There are concerns about the delays involved but it is vital that the best option is taken and that it addresses the problems in key areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill reflects the capacity of the Oireachtas to respond to difficulties in legislation.  In the past Governments were reluctant to accept that there were shortcomings in relatively recent legislation. This is an unhealthy way to deal with legislation. If legislation is found to have shortcomings then it ought to be addressed by way of amendment at the earliest opportunity.  Otherwise it will throw up other problems which may be difficult to resolve at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill ostensibly provides power to compulsorily purchase substratum land required for the port tunnel and perhaps for Luas if it ever sees the light of day.  I have no difficulty with this as such power should exist, subject to the same conditions which apply to the compulsory acquisition of land in the normal manner. The port tunnel is necessary and I know that Dublin Port is handling volumes of traffic as high as those predicted for the second decade of 2000. Those who travel in the port area will appreciate the need for urgently addressing the volume of heavy goods vehicles and the traffic to and from the port.  In the context of Luas, the issue is not what this Bill provides but if such a system will ever come to fruition.  The decision of the Government to put the Luas project on the long finger, consequently putting it at risk, is the worst decision by Government in relation to traffic in the city.  Luas will haunt Government candidates canvassing in the city in the local elections of June 1999.  The city is choked by traffic.  There was some hope that Luas would alleviate the problem by providing a desperately required public transport system.  The Government's decision to put the project on hold is having appalling consequences for the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have serious difficulty with and am absolutely opposed to section 5 of the Bill.  The section, inserted in a Bill ostensibly about compulsory purchase of underground land, restricts the right of the public to have access to the courts in relation to road and motorway schemes.  The summary by the Minister of State is accurate in its interpretation of the section.  It provides that a judicial review of a Minister's decision to make a road or motorway order must be instituted within two months from the date on which notice of the decision is first published.  However, some aspects of a road or motorway scheme may not become apparent until after that time, making it a very restrictive provision.  A residents' association or local group must assemble its argument and legal case and commit itself to legal action within two months.  The High Court can then decide whether there are grounds for hearing the case.  As the <Col N="545" /> Minister said, the High Court will not grant leave to apply for a review unless it is satisfied there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision challenged is invalid or ought to be quashed.  Deputy Killeen correctly noted that this sets a very high standard of proof.  The Bill further provides that the decision of the High Court will be final and may only be appealed to the Supreme Court on a point of law in cases where the High Court certifies that this may be done.  This effectively means that the decision of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on a motorway or road scheme is virtually unchallengeable.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that this is similar to the type of provision which applies in relation to the planning and waste management legislation.  This may be so, but the public has access to an independent appeals body in relation to planning and waste management.  There is no access to an independent appeal in the case of a motorway or road scheme.  If somebody decides to build a house or other structure close to a person's home in, for example, Kilternan or Sandyford, an appeal can be lodged with the planning authority.  If the person is not satisfied with the decision, he or she can make an appeal to An Bord Pleanála and, subsequently, can pursue the issue through the courts.  However, there is no planning process if the local authority or National Roads Authority decides to build a motorway.  In the case of a motorway the local authority can draw up a scheme following which the Minister can establish a public inquiry to hear the opinions of those aggrieved by it.  However, the ultimate decision is made by the Minister.  What is wrong is that, effectively, the Minister is the developer, paymaster, planning authority and appeals board. The Minister makes roads policy, appoints the National Roads Authority, provides funding, has a supervisory role in many respects over the local authority and makes the final decision as to whether the motorway goes ahead and the form in which it proceeds.  The Minister is also the final adjudicator in the inquiry.</P>
    <P>Up to now a certain discipline has been imposed on the Minister in relation to his functions in this area.  Aggrieved people could go to court and use their legal rights to exercise discipline over the manner in which the Minister proceeds.  This right is severely restricted in the Bill in a fundamentally undemocratic manner, particularly in the context of the Roads Act, 1993, which, in turn, removed many of the rights of the public in relation to road schemes.</P>
    <P>In relation to the development of roads, there ought to be a procedure analogous to the planning system which allows for public involvement and has an independent appeals mechanism.  The public should have the right to an independent appeal of a decision made by a Minister on a motorway scheme through An Bord Pleanála or another appeals body established for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> Deputy Olivia Mitchell and I are actively involved in the proposed south eastern motorway which will run through both our constituencies, the inquiry for which was held recently.  I compliment the inspector who carried out the inquiry in a very fair, patient and thorough manner.  He will be reporting in due course to the Minister who will then have to make a decision.  I agree with Deputy Killeen that, in some respects, there processes are being gradually taken over by the legal profession.  It was instructive to see how the inquiry operated.  A panel of briefs represented various interests during the course of the inquiry. I, Deputy Mitchell, other Members and public representatives represented residents' associations and made our case.  Representatives of residents' associations and small community groups explained to the inspector how the motorway would affect them.  The briefs were in the corridor with the senior officials of the county council making side agreements which were subsequently reported to the inspector.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the inspector makes his report to the Minister, and no doubt he will reflect the concerns raised by the community groups, residents' associations and individual householders, the same regard will be had for the concerns expressed by the people who went to that inquiry but who were not in a position to afford the fees payable to members of the legal profession.  I do not want to see what is intended as a public process being one where if people have the money to afford legal assistance they get one type of treatment at the inquiry, and this is no reflection on the inspector, but if they are a member of a residents' association or a community group, they are treated in a different way.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with some of the issues which arose in that context and where this legislation, particularly in relation to section 5, is fundamentally flawed.  Issues will come before the Minister from that inquiry on which he will have to adjudicate. One of those, for example, will be the selection of the route at the Leopardstown end.  I do not want to bore the Minister of State with the details of this &mdash; it would take longer than the time available to me &mdash; but the fundamental argument rests on the choice of two different routes. The route chosen is known as route A which will take the proposed motorway through part of Leopardstown Racecourse and almost across the back gardens of a number of houses, including council housing schemes in the Leopardstown-Ballyogan area.</P>
    <P>Five years ago, Dublin County Council said that route A should not be chosen and selected route B. The then Minister for the Environment instructed the county council to reconsider route A and to conduct an environmental impact study on that route.  The issue has now come full circle in that the motorway scheme is proposed at route A. Residents' associations stated at the inquiry that they did not want route A but that route was selected by the county council five years ago.  The <Col N="547" /> decision now rests with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  In the absence of an independent appeals system, is it right that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, or his Department, who originally ordained that the route should be route A, should be the final arbiter?</P>
    <P>A second issue which will arise relates to noise pollution.  This State does not have an official noise standard.  The 68 decibel UK standard is being used by the Department.  The case was made to the inquiry that it is not the appropriate standard for this country because tolerance to noise is likely to be less in a country which does not have as much experience of traffic noise as our neighbour.  Does the Minister intend to introduce a lower standard since he has not yet made the regulations?</P>
    <P>Householders along the proposed route of the motorway have argued consistently that they should be provided with double glazing in order to reduce the impact of noise.  Will the Minister, who is the paymaster for this scheme, be in a position to decide objectively on the type of noise abatement measures that should be taken?  The same issue will arise in relation to the provision of pedestrian bridges, small reroutings that will have to be done on some of the adjoining roads, junctions and so on.</P>
    <P>All of the issues which arose in the context of the motorway inquiry will go back to the Minister who initiated the scheme, set certain guidelines for it and appointed the National Roads Authority which is charged with responsibility for developing our primary road network he is the paymaster.  By virtue of his or her competing functions, and this is not a reflection on the integrity of the individuals holding the office, no Minister for the Environment is in a position to objectively adjudicate on the final form of a motorway scheme, particularly in circumstances where the Bill before us will effectively abolish the right of the public to go to the courts for a judicial review, except in very limited circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is a compelling case for putting in place an independent appeals system in relation to road developments.  If the Office of Public Works has to apply for planning permission to erect something on top of a mountain, or if the Department of Justice wants to build a new Garda station or the Department of Defence an Army barracks, they must go through the planning process.  What is so precious about the road network, some of which, including motorway and major road schemes, has an enormous impact on local areas, that there is no equivalent of the appeals system? There is no due process in the real sense for the public in relation to a motorway scheme.  The current process which involves the scheme being proposed in a local authority, then sent to the Minister, followed by the holding of a public inquiry &mdash; all of which goes back to the Minister for a final decision &mdash; is not due process.  It is not <Col N="548" /> fair or independent and it ought to be replaced with an independent appeals system.</P>
    <P>Unless an independent appeals system is put in place which will allow the public a fair hearing, as they have with An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency, I will oppose section 5 of the Bill which denies public access to the courts, restricts public rights in relation to roads and motorway schemes and is profoundly undemocratic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a short contribution on this legislation. The primary purpose of the Bill is to clarify the power of road authorities to compulsorily acquire a substratum of land for the construction and maintenance of road tunnel as part of their powers under the Roads Act, 1993.  That Act was important legislation which merited detailed consideration in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The addition of this legislation will enhance that Act.</P>
      <P>The further development of our economy and the creation of employment is dependent on an adequate transport network.  Since 1989, substantial progress has been achieved with the national primary network.  I welcome the commencement in my own constituency of the £13 million Cavan by-pass project which will be of major significance to the economy of County Cavan and to the entire north-east and north west region.  If we are to attract inward investment and export products a modern national primary route is essential. The elimination of traffic delays is essential if firms based in the regions are to remain competitive.</P>
      <P>I and the other public representatives in Cavan-Monaghan are very appreciative of Minister Dempsey's support for the Cavan by-pass project and his help in ensuring that substantial funding was provided for this project in 1998.  I remind the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, and his officials, that other sections of the N3 need substantial upgrading and I hope the Department and the National Roads Authority will advance those proposals.  From Butlersbridge to Belturbet and further west of Belturbet, the road network is not adequate to cater for heavy volumes of traffic.</P>
      <P>The N3 is of particular significance in the context of North-South development.  The blowing up of Aughalane Bridge outside Belturbet in 1972 resulted in the N3, the main Dublin-Donegal national primary road, ending in a cul-de-sac. Huge problems were experienced by the communities of west Cavan and south Fermanagh because of the severing of that main artery.  I am sure Deputy Barrett, former Minister for Defence, will be aware of the difficulties experienced by local communities in going about their daily work and social activities.  Many farmers in Cavan and Fermanagh had to travel 20 or 25 miles to do simple tasks on their farms.  Thankfully, work has commenced on rebuilding that bridge and building a new road from Belturbet to the bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> That project will be of major significance for Fermanagh and Cavan.  Many Government Departments and officials, as well as public representatives in the constituency, have been to the fore in pushing for advancement of the project and we are glad construction is under way.  The project will be completed in November and I hope at that time a just and lasting settlement to our political difficulties will have been achieved. As a person from the immediate area, I am aware that local communities on both sides of the Border will cherish the day when traffic will be able to drive once again across Woodford river.</P>
    <P>Last week at a sub-committee meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body there were detailed discussions on the need to improve the road and rail network on this island.  We met deputations from various interest groups and State agencies.  I pointed out to them the need to provide an adequate North-South road network, from the centre of south Ulster to the midlands. The road network from Ballygawley to Monaghan, Enniskillen, Cavan, Granard, Edgewardstown and Athlone, through the midlands is inadequate to cater for the substantial volumes of traffic using it.  I hope, with greater economic co-operation and further development of the economy North and South, that road will carry more and heavier traffic.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Department in its long-term planning, in conjunction with the National Roads Authority, to lay the ground work for developing a national primary route that will cater for the needs of south Tyrone, Fermanagh, Monaghan, Cavan and into the province of Leinster. I hope the Government has the foresight to put in place proper infrastructure.  I am confident there will be great development of the economy in that part of the country as a result of the peace process and the settlement which, I hope, will be put in place this year.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions in this House I spoke at length about the need to improve the regional and county road network.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I, as well as other public representatives have used every opportunity to highlight the difficulties facing counties such as Cavan and Monaghan, which have a small mileage of national primary roads and a huge mileage of regional and country roads.  Both counties face serious road problems.  We welcome the Minister's increased allocation for road funding this year, but when that is used, unfortunately, there will still be a substantial mileage of road in both counties in an appalling state.</P>
    <P>Many people going about their daily work and social activities experience great difficulties in travelling on roads that are practically impassable. Roads should be maintained to a proper standard.  I appeal to the Minister and his officials to provide an increased level of funding each year to ensure roads, particularly in rural areas, are in good condition so that employment will be maintained and generated in those areas.  A basic requirement to attract industry and encourage <Col N="550" /> existing industry to expand is an adequate transport network.</P>
    <P>The recent National Economic and Social Council report instanced County Cavan as facing particular difficulties because of lack of a proper road network.  Southern Border counties have suffered immeasurable damage for the past 27 years because of the political difficulties in the province of Ulster.  Year after year we were told by Governments and State agencies that it was difficult to attract inward investment to southern Border counties since a bad image was portrayed of that region because of the political difficulties. I hope the era of violence is behind us.  Inward investment is needed for employment creation. Fortunately, a great number of jobs have been created in recent years by inward investment, but unfortunately none of them has come to the Cavan-Monaghan area or to the Border region in general.  If we are to attract inward investment proper infrastructure, an essential part of which is the road network, must be in place.  The main industries in Cavan and Monaghan are centred on regional roads which are unable to carry traffic at a desirable speed to get products to airports and ports in good time and at minimum cost.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as it will enhance the legislation enacted in 1993.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, the Minister of State, Department officials and the National Roads Authority to give favourable and urgent consideration to developing a national primary route from south Ulster to Leinster through the midlands.  The Minister should ensure that the needs of counties such as Cavan and Monaghan, where extra investment in roads is needed, are given particular attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to use this occasion to follow on the points made by my colleague in the constituency, Deputy Gilmore, concerning the proposed south-eastern motorway.  I ask the Minister to comment on the weakness in the planning area regarding building major roads.  As the Minister is aware from his days as a member of a local authority, each local authority is obliged to draw up a development plan.  The development plan is gospel in that any subsequent decisions taken by the executive or the officials must be in accordance with the development plan.  While decisions may be appealed to An Bord Pleanála, that body is not legally obliged to adhere to a development plan.  An Bord Pleanála seldom, if ever, grants planning permission where a development plan indicates that land is not zoned for that purpose.</P>
      <P>On the question of major roads, Deputy Gilmore referred to the southeastern motorway.  The initial report presented to the county council some years ago indicated that the road now proposed was not the most suitable.  There was no mention in the development plan for the county that the road to be constructed would be the line now proposed for the motorway.  How do we explain this to our electors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> In areas such as Leopardstown, Ballyogan and The Gallops house prices are at a premium and many young couples have struggled hard to purchase their homes.  However, it is now proposed that a major motorway will be constructed at the back of their houses although it was not indicated on any development plan.  This is contrary to the principle of development plans, which are meant to indicate to the public projections made by the local authority over a five year period.  If somebody buys a house in a housing estate on the basis that a proposed road is to be constructed elsewhere but then finds it has been shifted if makes a joke of the planning process.</P>
    <P>There is now a huge democratic deficit in this area because elected local representatives have effectively no say in these matters.  The Minister should consider tightening up provisions before Committee Stage.  He should provide guarantees and assurances to the public that major developments, such as new roads, housing or industries, will be clearly indicated to ensure that those purchasing properties or developing businesses will know of planned roads in advance.  Nobody, the NRA, the Minister or the local authority, should have the right to change planned new roads when due notice was not given to those who purchased properties in the area.</P>
    <P>Leopardstown racecourse is the last remaining race track in Dublin and renowned throughout Europe.  It is of great advantage to the Dublin region and the country in terms of encouraging tourism and holds major racing events.  Yet, it is now proposed to construct a major motorway through the six furlong track, which will destroy the environment and take away areas where parking is needed.  The dislocation will be enormous and I hate to think of the cost of compensation.</P>
    <P>There was a public outcry when developments of this kind were proposed for other areas.  When the public becomes fully aware of what is proposed for Leopardstown there will rightly be an outcry because the land in the area and it natural beauty are irreplaceable.  There are alternative routes.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State look at the points that have been made, especially with regard to the need for due notice to the public in respect of major developments in the future?  They must be clearly indicated on development plans so that people will not find, having purchased a property, that something which was never intended and not indicated on a development plan happens beside them which will destroy their property, increase noise levels and create other inconveniences. While I accept that road building will inconvenience some, fair play indicates that, at a minimum, we should insist that development projects be clearly indicated on a development plan.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  Although short, the Bill <Col N="552" /> addresses a number of important matters.  The Roads Act, 1993, is the legislative foundation for much of the infrastructural work being undertaken to meet the economic and social aspirations of the people.  It is important, therefore, that when difficulties arise with the operation of the legislation, they are brought to this House for consideration and appropriate action.  That is what this Bill is about.</P>
      <P>In responding to the debate I wish to focus on the main issues raised by Deputies.  There will be a full opportunity to consider the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage.  While I will not have the opportunity here to cover all the points raised, I assure Deputies that all their concerns will be addressed at that Stage.</P>
      <P>I welcome the general support for the measures in the Bill.  Taken together they will significantly enhance the statutory basis for road development in a way which fully respects the concerns that can arise in relation to the major road infrastructure projects.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the main Opposition Party, Fine Gael, supports the measures in the Bill, especially the proposals to clarify and put beyond doubt the powers of local authorities to acquire substratum of land to facilitate the provision and maintenance of road tunnels.  This is one of the principal elements in the Bill and, as pointed out by several Deputies, is especially relevant to the proposed Dublin Port tunnel project.</P>
      <P>During the debate a range of views were expressed about the proposal being developed by Dublin Corporation and the NRA for the new port access route.  Some strongly supported seeking its urgent provision and others reflected the concerns of residents in the vicinity of the route. Deputies Haughey and Callely outlined the concerns of residents in the Marino area.  I have no doubt they are genuine and that the residents are entitled to have their viewpoint and objections fully considered before any decision is taken on the port tunnel proposal.</P>
      <P>With a view to allaying these concerns I reiterate that the Bill does not authorise the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel.  Whether the project goes ahead and in what form will be decided through the statutory motorway scheme and the environmental impact assessment procedures set out in the Roads Act, 1993.  A full motorway scheme and a comprehensive environmental impact statement will have to be prepared by the corporation and submitted to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  The public will have to be given an adequate opportunity to make submissions on the project and its environmental impact.  A public inquiry will have to be held at which all views can be heard and a report will have to prepared on the inquiry and submitted for decision.  The final decision on the proposed port tunnel will, therefore, be made another day and as part of a different process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Dublin Port access route, Deputy Mitchell also raised the need for interim measures to be taken for ever increasing <Col N="553" /> HGV traffic volumes using the port.  The Deputy can be assured that the strategy set out in the final report of the DTI envisaged that the main infrastructure projects will be complemented by a range of traffic management measures.  I have no doubt that her suggestion for priority measures to facilitate HGV traffic in and out of the port will be fully considered by the local authority, Dublin Corporation and the Dublin transport office.</P>

      <Quest>if the proposals he announced on 12 January 1998 for significant reductions in tax on vehicles used for public transport will come into effect at the same time as the obligatory increases of 3 per cent in motor taxation which he has imposed on local authorities in 1998 and on 1 January 1999; the amount of the reductions; the effect, if any, they will have on general motor tax revenue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The reductions planned in motor taxation for public service vehicles, which are the first phase of a &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of motor taxation rates, will come into effect at the same time as the 3 per cent increase generally becomes operative in 1998 for other vehicle categories. There will be an across the board increase of 3 per cent for all tax categories on 1 January 1999.  The precise amount of the reductions will be set out in the Bill to give effect to the changes which I intend to publish shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate what is meant by public service vehicles?  I assume it will cover buses.  Will it cover buses in private fleets, taxis and hackney cabs?  Will it apply to any other categories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in his assumption.  It will cover what are termed under <Col N="554" /> the motor taxation code as large public service vehicles.  These include public and private buses which carry persons for reward, other vehicles, such as minibuses owned by youth or community organisations or used exclusively for persons belonging to the organisations, and school buses. The regulations will also cover taxis and hackney cabs which are referred to as small public service vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it include buses owned by organisations such as the Irish Wheelchair Association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is intended that it will cover all minibuses and similar vehicles used by youth, community and voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the approximate size of the special reduction?  Will it be at the same level thereafter or does he intend to review it with a view to increasing the tax advantage for public service vehicles if the system is working?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an initial step in &ldquo;greening&rdquo; the motor taxation rates.  It will operate in 1998 and 1999.  Following an assessment of its success, it is intended to further &ldquo;green&rdquo; the motor taxation system.  The effectiveness of this approach will be taken into account, but further differentiation of taxes on heavy goods vehicles and more heavily polluting cars is being considered generally.  The Deputy is aware of the EU proposal being considered by the transport directorate at present.  This suggests tax differentiation in favour of less polluting heavy goods vehicles. Ireland supports moves in that direction.  If measures arise from that examination, they will be implemented in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to distinguish in the measure between petrol, diesel and LPG engines?  Does he intend to examine any of the alternative technologies now available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be part of our considerations in the long-term.  Initially, the measure involves a straightforward reduction in certain categories, including public service vehicles.  This will happen immediately but the Deputy's suggestion will be considered in the future as the taxation system is &ldquo;greened&rdquo; further.</P>

      <P>The main issues on the agenda of the conference will be implementation of the environmental action programme for Central and Eastern Europe; the report, commonly known as the Dobris+3 Assessment, of the European Environment Agency on the state of the European environment; a draft convention on access to information and public participation in environmental decision making; draft protocols on control of emissions of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants; implementation of pan-European biodiversity and landscape strategy; European energy conservation initiative, and the programme for the phase-out of leaded petrol.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that this is not the appropriate forum for such an item.  However, I assure the Deputy that if an opportunity arises or can be manufactured, the issue of nuclear safety and energy will be raised.  The Deputy will be aware from his time in the Department of the Environment that various other means and conferences are used to raise this matter on an ongoing basis, including direct contact with the UK authorities.  If an opportunity presents itself at this conference, the matter will be raised, as it has been raised elsewhere in the past.  We will try to ensure that the issue is highlighted.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is most appropriate to raise the greatest threat to our environment, the Sellafield/THORP complex which is only a few miles from the capital city, at a pan-European conference on the environment? The complex stores highly active liquid waste which is liable to explode.  This would have dire consequences for Ireland and large parts of Europe.  It is a nonsense not to include this primary threat and source of pollution to our environment at a European conference on the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the issue of nuclear safety and the threat posed by nuclear energy is dealt with at a number of other fora.  The Deputy is aware from his time in the Department of the various fora and means by which it is raised.  The Aarhus conference relates <Col N="556" /> primarily to East-West co-operation on environmental protection and this will be the focus of attention.  I note the Deputy's comments and will raise the matter if the opportunity arises.  The previous conference in Sofia during October 1995 did not address the nuclear issue either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The conference will address east-west environmental issues.  Given the experience of Chernobyl and the extent of similar tragedies waiting to happen, does the Minister agree that it would be appropriate to have the nuclear threat to the environment on the agenda at this conference? It is of no value to say it has not been discussed previously at this level.  Does the Minister agree that the nuclear industry uses its muscle before these conferences to ensure the nuclear issue is kept off the agenda unless the efficiency of that industry, rather than the threat it poses, is at stake?  The Minister should revisit this issue with the organisers of the conference and at least state Ireland's case with a view to having the threat of the nuclear industry discussed at the conference.  If he does so I will be satisfied that he is trying to get the matter debated at the proper forum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I and other members of the Government will raise the issue of Sellafield and the nuclear industry, but if I have the opportunity to raise this matter I will do so in order to restate our general opposition to nuclear energy installations as well as reiterating our wish for a Europe-wide nuclear safety organisation.  This is not the appropriate forum for raising specific issues, though I will try to ensure that the matter is raised during the conference.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, he has taken to examine methods to reduce emissions of the three additional greenhouse gases which were not considered prior to the Kyoto conference in December 1997; the target reductions in emissions of the six gases he is considering; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As a first step towards controlling emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs, perfluorocarbons, PFCs, and sulphur hexafluoride SF 6 relevant data are required so that national inventories and projections may be compiled.  I refer to the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 240 of 24 February 1998, which indicated that the Environmental Protection Agency, at my Department's request, is working on the compilation of data on the importation and use of these gases. This will include data on emissions and projections for the commitment period 2008-2012 contained in the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.</P>
      <P>In addition to the work on inventories and projections, l hope shortly to receive the findings of the consultancy study commissioned by my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise to identify additional policies and measures to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the scope for the intensification of existing policies and measures.  This study is addressing all greenhouse gases, including HFCs, PFCs and SF6 and all sectors of the economy.  The consultancy study, together with the necessary inventories and projections, will facilitate the putting in place of the necessary measures to limit and/or reduce these emissions.  At EU level, consideration is also being given to the adoption of common and co-ordinated policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including HFCs, PFCs and SF 6 emissions.</P>
      <P>The Kyoto Protocol adopted on 11 December 1997 sets, <i>inter alia,</i> a legally binding target for the member states of the EU to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases &mdash; carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N20), HFCs, PFCs and SF6 &mdash; by 8 per cent below 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012.  The protocol does not set separate targets for each gas and it is a matter for each party to achieve its target by the emission limitations and reductions considered most appropriate overall.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the EU as a whole will meet the target using provisions in the protocol concerning joint fulfilment and on the basis of agreed internal burden sharing.  The internal burden sharing arrangement is now subject to review at EU level in the light of the Kyoto outcome, with particular regard to the inclusion of three additional gases &mdash; HFCs, PFCs and SF 6 &mdash; the timeframe involved and the provisions regarding the use of sinks to absorb CO2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has asked all other relevant Government Departments for an update of the data necessary for the EPA also to prepare revised inventories and projections for the three main greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N20.  These, together with the inventories and projections for the three additional gases, will be taken into consideration in Ireland's participation in the EU <Col N="558" /> internal burden sharing discussions.  It is expected that the discussions will be finalised by June. Inventories and projections of emissions of CO62, CH4 and N20, previously prepared, are contained in Ireland's Second National Communication under the Convention, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>I have previously indicated my intention to adhere to the level of ambition implicit in Ireland's indicative national growth limitation target of 15 per cent, which was part of the internal burden sharing agreement associated with the EU negotiating position in respect of the three main greenhouse gases &mdash; CO2, CH4 and N20.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Ireland continue to be committed to the 15 per cent reduction over 1990 levels that we had ambitions for prior to the Kyoto Protocol? Where do we stand within Europe?  Will Europe stay with the 8 per cent target or will it go further?  There is an ideal opportunity to investigate more energy efficient methods of developing new technology and I would not like Europe to sit under the 8 per cent umbrella.  We must set our sights further and work harder in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  I do not think the EU will regard 8 per cent as a lesser target.  There are now six gases instead of three and I said, while discussing the Kyoto Protocol, that I was impressed with the EU's commitment to the targets it has set for itself.  The EU never regarded the commitment to a 15 per cent reduction as a unilateral commitment.  We will make any adjustments necessary by studies being carried out here and similar studies are being carried out in other EU countries.  By June we hope to be able to agree the internal burden sharing in the EU.  It will then be a matter of ensuring that the other parties to the protocol agree that they will be bound by it.  To my knowledge, the EU will not adopt the Kyoto Protocol on a unilateral basis.  It will want everyone to agree to it.  That was the purpose of the Kyoto conference.  The Deputy and I are at one on this matter.  We do not intend to lower our sights.  We intend to adhere to the position we stated previously and we will work towards that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to get specific information on sinks or levels of CO 2 or greenhouse gas emissions.  Russia's level of greenhouse gas emissions is 30 per cent below its 1990 level which leaves plenty of scope for the USA and Japan within a trade block.  The USA and Japan might not have to implement any reduction in emissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a possibility, but it would not be in keeping with the spirit of the Kyoto principle.  Initial discussions have taken place on the question of sinks and trading.  There are scientific ways of measuring the amount of CO 2 emissions <Col N="559" /> absorbed by forestry, but trading is a much more difficult problem.  The EU's position in Kyoto was to try to minimise the amount of trading that could take place in what was called the hot air of the Ukraine and Russia.  The levels of emissions in those countries have reduced somewhat since 1990.  It would not be in keeping with the spirit of the protocol if a country did not adhere to its commitment to reduce emissions simply by trading or the use of sinks.  We will try to avoid doing that.  Sinks have an advantage from our point of view.  We could reduce CO 2 emissions through our afforestation programme, but that is not our intention.  Certain industries may have to be facilitated, but I believe all Members want us to make a genuine effort to reduce emissions.  The main contributors should invest in clean technology and new environmentally friendly ways of production rather than looking for a relatively easy way out by using sinks or trading.</P>

      <P>The draft EU Water Framework Directive presented by the European Commission in February 1997 provided for full cost recovery for water use, including sewerage services and environmental and resource costs, with some exceptions which would allow for a basic level of domestic water use at an affordable price.</P>
      <P>Since the outset, the Commission has been advised of Ireland's opposition to the proposed charging provisions as they relate to domestic consumers.  I and officials of my Department have continued to reiterate at every appropriate opportunity Ireland's objections in this regard.  In July 1997 I wrote to the EU Environment Commissioner indicating this Government's position on the matter and I stated that we would not reconsider the issue of water charges for Irish consumers.  I also made our position known to the UK Minister for the Environment in the course of our discussions on the UK's EU Presidency programme.</P>
      <P>We have also maintained our opposition to charging domestic consumers in the course of consideration of the Commission's proposals at meetings at official level preparatory to consideration of the proposals by the Council of Environment Ministers.  It is my intention to continue to oppose any provisions which seek to reintroduce charging for domestic uses of water in Ireland.</P>

      <Col N="560" /> During discussions on 28 November 1997 in relation to EU Regional and Cohesion funding for infrastructural projects, the Commissioner for Regional Affairs referred to the Commission's decision to reduce the Cohesion aid rate for Irish environmental projects from 85 per cent to 80 per cent on account of the decision to abolish charges for public domestic water supplies and referred to the difficulties created <i>vis-à-vis</i>&ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle.  In reply, I reaffirmed and explained the Government's policy on the matter.</P>
    <P>At the launch of my Department's 1998 water and sewerage investment programme in Killaloe on 2 February 1998, I reaffirmed to the Commission official present in the clearest possible terms the Government's policy on non-charging for domestic water supplies.</P>

The Minister will be aware that the previous Government abolished water charges.  Can he assure us that, having regard to what is happening in Europe, the Government will not allow the reimposition of water charges? Is the Government at one on this issue?  Are all sections of it opposed to water charges?  I am talking about the position of the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, who seemed to imply that she is in favour of such charges.

      <P>The Deputy said he and his party have always been opposed to water charges. While the Deputy may have held this view for a number of years, it is not clear his party always held that view.  It put local authorities in a position where they had to impose these charges.</P>
      <P>The Government has not changed its position on water charges.  We intend to maintain the position outlined in the programme for Government.  Our arguments against water charges are soundly based on the principle of subsidiarity.  We believe it is a matter for national Governments to decide whether to impose charges.  We are making it clear to the EU that we regard the imposition of charges as in conflict with subsidiary principles.</P>

      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister's reply to the supplementary from Deputy Stagg and the number of times he has told the Commissioner of the Government's <Col N="561" /> opposition to the reintroduction of charges.  Will he state categorically that domestic householders will not be charged for the use of water and the provision of sewage treatment services because there seems to be some ambiguity between the Government and the Minister, particularly in his reply to Deputy Stagg, that there might be an imposition of charges by the EU?</P>

Is it the Minister's view that the European Commission sees this as the end of the matter?  It has reduced from 85 per cent to 80 per cent the amount of grants made available to some programmes.  Will there be further reductions in the various grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I do not have the gift of foresight, I cannot say whether this is the end of the matter.  Since February 1997 the framework directive on water policy, which introduced the concept of charges for water, has been under discussion. The initial position of the Commission was that: &ldquo;by 20.10 member states shall ensure full cost recovery for all costs for services provided for water uses overall and by economic sector, broken down at least into households, industry and agriculture&rdquo;.  That was its position as outlined on 25 February 1997.  There are ongoing discussions on that EU Directive and I expect further discussion on it at the March council meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the discussions I have had with the Commission, my first contact was in July 1997 when the Commissioner wrote to congratulate me on my appointment as Minister for the Environment and Local Government and requested that I revisit the decision of the previous Government on the position of water charges.  I replied thanking the Commissioner for her good wishes and explained fully the Government decision. This was not a discussion but an exchange of letters. The other two occasions have been outlined in the question.  When Mr. Verstringer was here and the matter was raised with him at a press conference he made the EU position clear.  I availed of the opportunity to reiterate our position in relation to charges.  It has been stated by the EU that we are the only member state that does not impose charges for domestic water.  That is not the case.  In Luxembourg there is opposition in <Col N="562" /> principle to imposing water charges.  Its Government ruled out the imposition of water charges three years ago and in Greece there are no charges.  We have been arguing on the principle of subsidiarity and from the point of view of social and public health considerations and that it is in conflict with our policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree his position in Europe would be more credible if, for the past 15 years or more, his party had not made all the arguments in favour of water charges and supported their imposition at national and local level?  I think the Minister is telling us there is a real threat that the European Union will reimpose water charges, which traditionally have been supported by Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil refused to abolish water charges when my party was in Government with it, despite repeated requests. What is the position concerning the draft framework directive on water?  If it has to be passed by a majority vote will Ireland have a veto on it and, if passed in its present form, what will be the consequences?</P>

      <P>The average waiting time for a driving test is 25 weeks.  However, applicants needing an early test for urgent reasons such as employment are generally tested within ten weeks or less.  My Department's customer service action plan has set service delivery targets which aim to ensure, by end l998, an offer of a test in virtually all cases <Col N="564" /> within 15 weeks of application and, by end l999, an offer of a test within ten weeks of application.</P>
      <P>The delays have arisen from a substantial increase in the overall intake of driving test applications which in the past two years has increased by 20 per cent over previous levels.  My Department addressed the problem by introducing Saturday testing.  We are also taking steps to strengthen the permanent driver testing corps and conclude the negotiation of productivity measures which will permit the engagement of further testers on a contract basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sorry state of affairs.  The Minister of State has informed us that the average waiting time is six months.  I understand in Dublin it is eight months.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure varies among the 48 test centres between 19 and 31 weeks.  Generally, the waiting time is between 24 and 26 weeks but in some areas it can be as high as eight months.</P>
      <P>The backlog is attributable to a considerable increase in the past two years in the overall number of test applications which has increased from 94,385 in l993 to 118,144 in l997.  Applications are currently running at an all time high of 3,200 per week, on average.  It will be necessary to engage testers on 12 month contracts to eliminate the backlog.  The necessary arrangements are in train. Productivity measures to produce an additional 9,000 tests per annum are being negotiated with the driver testers' union.  I hope the negotiations which have been prolonged will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion in the near future.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the arrangements for the engagement of contract testers, a competition to recruit additional permanent testers to strengthen the permanent driver testing corps will be held. The established driver testing corps is 70 testers, six supervisors and a chief tester.  There are currently 67 testers but because of extended sick leave the effective strength is 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is made to facilitate applicants requiring an early test for urgent reasons such as employment and they are generally tested within ten weeks or less.  My Department's customer service <Col N="565" /> action plan under the strategic management initiative has set service delivery targets for driver testing.  The aim is to ensure, by end 1998, an offer of a test in 95 per cent of cases within 15 weeks of application and, by end 1999, in all cases within ten weeks of application.  If the negotiations between the driver testers' union and officials of the Department are brought to a successful conclusion soon, I expect we will be able to achieve these targets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that the proposals of the High Level Group on Road Safety for a national road safety strategy will be finalised <Col N="567" /> shortly, prior to the approval of the strategy by the Government and its publication.  The new strategy will provide a framework for co-ordinating and reinforcing existing policies and measures on road safety and for developing new instruments and approaches.  A similar strategic approach to road safety has been adopted by some of the leading countries in Europe and I am confident it will also benefit Irish performance.</P>
      <P>In the meantime action on road safety is being intensified through, for example, special enforcement campaigns under the direction of the Garda National Traffic Policy Bureau, a substantially increased grant in 1998 to the National Safety Council and an increased provision by the National Roads Authority in 1998 for its low cost safety measures programme and other road safety related measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention of the Minister of State to publish that report before Easter, which would appear to be in line with previous replies he gave to this question?  Will he confirm how many people have been killed on our roads so far this year?  Is he aware it is well established that the biggest contributor to the carnage on our roads is speed?  Apart from the report which is to be considered, what are he and his Department doing to address the serious problem of speed on our roads and the resultant carnage, death and injury arising from it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the report will be available fairly soon.  I may have it before Easter and, after it has been considered by the Government, it is intended to publish it.  For quite some time speed has been identified as one of the major factors resulting in fatalities arising from road accidents.  It is too early to identify any trend of road deaths in 1998, but provisional figures for the period to 2 March this year indicate that 63 people have died in road accidents &mdash; 28 drivers, eight passengers, 18 pedestrians, four motorcyclists and four pedal cyclists.  It is a terrible tragedy for the families involved and for this country that so many of our citizens lose their lives on our roads.  We have a duty and a responsibility to ensure we put in place everything we possibly can to ensure that number of road deaths is reduced. The Government is committing substantial resources to this and is examining every possible way in which it can introduce new measures which would help to make our roads safer for those who use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drivers' habits and attitudes contribute to many of these accidents.  With speed clearly identified as a major cause of accidents, we can only continue to appeal to motorists and all road users to exercise maximum care, to have respect for other road users, to comply with the existing speed limits and to adhere to proper procedures when bringing a vehicle out on to the road.  One cannot imagine the extent of the tragedy these accidents bring into homes.  There is nothing <Col N="568" /> worse than for a loved one to be suddenly taken away or maimed for life.  That has become a feature of modern life because there is so much traffic on our roads.</P>
    <P>The only hopeful sign, if it could be deemed that, is that accident data in the context of greatly increased road traffic indicate the appeals for greater care have had some effect.  In 1978 when 678 people died in road accidents 18,000 million kilometres were travelled while in 1996 when 453 people died approximately 34,000 million kilometres were travelled.  Our roads system carried the same traffic volume in 1996 that had been predicted for it in the year 2000.  Despite the enormous increase in the number of miles travelled in that period at least the overall numbers have been falling.  However, that does not mean the position is acceptable or in any way satisfactory. We must continue to strive to make our roads death free.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the information the Minister has given the House.  Given what we know about the level of road accidents, the number of road deaths and the pattern that has been established over many years, why is the Department of the Environment and Local Government still approving road proposals in some cases with no footpaths, no pedestrian crossings and insufficient regard for the safety of pedestrians and cyclists?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confining myself to the question of safety.  Is it the case that the way in which roads are funded is resulting in roads which are manifestly unsafe and where the bias is against the pedestrian and the cyclist?  Has the Minister considered discussing with the motor industry the possibility of putting physical restraints on vehicles to prevent them from going over certain speeds?  Advertisements in the newspapers and the motor industry are promoting the high speeds at which cars may travel as a means of selling them.  Surely, it is time physical restraints were put on vehicles to prevent them from travelling at the speeds which are causing deaths on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not accepted that road development policy and spending on roads has contributed to the rise in the number of accidents. One of the fundamental objectives of the Operational Programme for Transport is the provision of a safe and efficient national road network.  The National Roads Authority is charged with the implementation of this objective.  Local authorities also play a major role and have statutory responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads and must ensure, as far as possible, the provision of a safe and efficient network of non-national or local roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> As the House will know, almost £277 million has been provided by the Government and local authorities for this work in 1998.  I reject Deputy Gilmore's suggestion that the local authorities or the Department are in some way responsible for the accidents on the roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Road users have a responsibility to use their vehicles in a manner which is at all times safe and proper and which relates to the conditions of the road on which they are driving. If the Deputy wants me to list all the measures taken up to now by previous Governments and supported by this one, I will.  I refer to the initiative taken which involves the Taoiseach, the Minister, myself and the high level group on road safety.  I hope new measures will emerge from the national strategy which is being designed. Although the Government and the Department can lay down regulations and take action on improving roads and removing black spots and can introduce measures to reduce the possibilities of accidents happening, it boils down to road users.</P>
      <P>I was driving on a dual carriageway last week on the way to the by-election campaign in Limerick when I was passed on the inside by a car just before a roundabout.  The car proceeded at some speed on to the roundabout.  There were no injuries as a result of his reckless driving but he demolished a sign as he travelled around the roundabout. Human nature and human error are factors over which the Department or regulations have no control.</P>

      <P>Although the Minister said substantial resources are being provided for road safety, I am sure he will agree resources are not limitless. Does he agree that better use could be made of some of the resources?  Does he agree the use of speed traps on the best roads is not always the best action to take?  Speed limits are the same on bad roads as on good ones but the danger from speeding is much greater on the worst roads and that is where the most serious accidents occur. The Minister will be aware of an example in north Kildare-south Meath.  Is the Minister of State aware of a system being put in place where a 50 miles per hour speed limit is being imposed on a seven kilometre stretch of road with a great amount of road signage?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, the National Safety Council was established for the purpose of promoting road safety and it is generously funded by the Government and the insurance federation.  The Garda are playing an important role in promoting and enforcing road safety and in introducing new measures for enforcement.  The National Safety Council carries out special campaigns to draw the travelling publics' attention to the need to take care on our roads, particularly at times of heavy volume of traffic such as the holiday periods.  The Deputy can take it that this matter already occupies the minds of people in the National Safety Council and that is standard practice.  In the run-up to last Christmas the Government gave it additional substantial funds to enable it to step up the level of road safety promotions it was undertaking in that critical period of dark winter nights and the holiday season when huge volumes of people travel home from abroad for Christmas.  We are conscious of the need to support the National Safety Council and its work and we have done so by <Col N="571" /> additional finance over and above what was originally provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a clear necessity for a strategic and co-ordinated approach to land use planning on a regional basis.  The need is particularly acute in the greater Dublin area given the influence which the capital exerts on the adjoining counties.  On my Department's initiative, the preparation of strategic planning guidelines for the Dublin and mid-east regions is now under way.  The guidelines are being drawn up by the local and regional authorities involved, in consultation with my Department and the Dublin Transportation Office.  Consultants are being engaged to prepare the guidelines over the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>The guidelines will address, in accordance with the principles of sustainable development, all the relevant socio-economic, infrastructural and environmental factors and provide a comprehensive overall framework for the physical development of the Dublin and mid-east regions over the next decade or so.  The guidelines will address the population to be accommodated in the greater Dublin area with an indicative distribution of that population and locations for commercial and industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister informed the House that the guidelines were due to be published within 12 months.  Does that mean they will have no impact on the proposed planning legislation, which the Taoiseach informed the House is due to be published in the autumn.</P>
      <P>How can planning guidelines be implemented when the vast majority of development plans in the seven counties mentioned are now completed and will be implemented between now and the years 2002 and 2003?  How can the guidelines have any effect until after that period of time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure when the guidelines are finalised and drawn up the local authorities in the areas to which they will apply will take them into account and, where necessary, adapt and revise their development plans accordingly.  All relevant local authorities are involved in the process of drawing up the guidelines at both the level of elected members and officials, Development plans are being reviewed or have recently been reviewed, but that is not a good reason to delay the publication of the guidelines.  I am confident that, when they are in place, local authorities will take note of them and, if there is any immediate need to change their development plans, they will undertake to do so.  I am sure everyone would agree that as Dublin has such an effect on neighbouring counties, its local authorities should not <Col N="573" /> be allowed to proceed with their development plans in isolation.  Given the difficulties which might arise from such a scenario, I am sure the local authorities will take note of what the guidelines suggest.</P>

If issues arise in the guidelines which need a legislative framework, they will be included in the consolidating legislation.  The planning guidelines are strategic; they are not specific planning legislation.  They are guidelines for local authorities to aid discussion in terms of overall structural needs and population distribution. However, legislation may be needed and that will be dealt with in the consolidating legislation.</P>

      <P>I raised the matter of the Local Government Planning and Development (No. 2) Bill with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business. I thought I spoke distinctly but the Taoiseach obviously misheard me because he replied about an architectural Bill which was not what I asked about.  I presume the Bill will come before the House between mid-year and the autumn.  I do not know why we are getting guidelines which will not be enforceable by law.  Some county councils need the force of law to make them carry out their plans properly.  I am not sure why the Minister does not give us the Bill now and introduce guidelines arising from the legislation. Would that not give us the legislative framework for regional planning rather than simple guidelines? Is it the case that we must act sooner than legislation would be available?  I support the thinking of the Minister on regional planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his final comment.  Members of the House support this approach.  I will not have the planning and <Col N="574" /> development Bill before the House before the middle of the year because we engaged in the widest possible consultation.  We had a convention at which the Deputy's party was represented along with members of local authorities.  We all realise that a considerable number of issue have to be addressed.  The convention dealt with and discussed these issues.  We have legislative provisions to promote co-ordination and planning in the greater Dublin area and elsewhere.  Each local authority must consult neighbouring authorities when putting its draft development plan forward for the three month consultation period.</P>
      <P>The Dublin and mid-east regional authorities have a function to promote co-ordination in the provision of public services.  Under the Local Government Act, 1993, the Dublin Act, local authorities must co-ordinate plans with each other.  There is a legislative base for co-ordination. The guidelines are meant to be strategic. It is the equivalent of a large development plan for the region rather than its individual components. I do not anticipate huge problems in implementing the strategy or the guidelines. However, as the Deputy rightly says, we may need a legislative base for regional planning. We will have it in the consolidation Bill if necessary.</P>

      <P>Given that the greater Dublin area has spilled beyond the county boundaries and the commuter belt is, effectively, an arc encompassing Dundalk, Athlone and north Wexford, has the Minister any plans to establish an authority which would oversee strategic planning for the area?  Are there any plans to recast the regional bodies and areas which seem to overlap, such as regional authorities, health boards, IDA regions and so on?  Are there plans to recast the regional structures to reflect the reality of the greater Dublin area and the commuter belt as it has developed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to recast the regional boundaries to cover the huge area referred to by the Deputy.  I accept the Deputy's point regarding the commuter belt as opposed to the greater Dublin area.  However, we are addressing the problems concerning the greater Dublin region.  This is not the only region in which this type of exercise will need to be carried out.  Similar exercises are being conducted in areas such as Limerick, Galway and Cork.  I have no plans to create an authority to cover the area.</P>
      <P>In the context of local government reform I have plans to examine regional boundaries with a view to recasting them in some way to ensure, in so far as is possible, that the various bodies mentioned have similar boundaries.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; The measures contained in the Bill represent an important step in a new drive to streamline, modernise and further extend our maritime law. As a seafaring nation it is essential that our shipping industry, whether large-scale commercial or recreational, is soundly underpinned with modern and up-to-date legislation.  I intend to address as a matter of priority the upgrading of our legislative system to reflect fully modern requirements in relation to safety and EU and international labour rules and to bring penalties for infringements of the law at sea into line with present day norms.</P>
      <P>The Bill increases the penalties for breaches of safety regulations; removes out-of-date constraints on, and penal sanctions for, merchant seamen; allows EU nationals to register ships in Ireland; and provides special exemptions for certain categories of small passenger vessels.  The general body of maritime law has been modernised extensively in recent years.  However, certain important provisions are still governed by legislation passed in the last century.  This legislation clearly does not take account of important reforms introduced in the International Labour Organisation and Council of Europe and through the European Union.  It also contains levels of fines which are out of date and does not provide sufficient incentives to commercial ship operators and owners to adhere to safety and environmental standards in the operation of vessels.  This is unsatisfactory and I am moving to bring in specific modernising provisions to ensure that Ireland has in place a modern and efficient legislative regime for shipping.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the Bill will increase the maximum fine for offences involving breaches of safety regulations and codes to £10,000 or two years in prison or both; remove legal constraints on seamen who engage in trade disputes &mdash; current legislation, while not enforced, can envisage criminal liability arising from participation in trade disputes; delete penal and out-of-date sanctions for disciplinary and other offences by seamen &mdash; for example, under the current legislation, seamen can be forcibly detained on board a ship by the master of the vessel where disciplinary offences have occurred; allow nationals of other states in the EU to enter the Irish register; and exempt certain small categories of small passenger boats from licensing requirements in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will allow for the modernisation of the working conditions of seafarers and permit their involvement in legitimate trade disputes.  It removes any perceived threat from out-of-date penal sanctions where seamen might engage in absences without leave, in desertion or other disciplinary offences.  It also amends the Mercantile Marine Act, 1955, to bring Ireland's law on the <Col N="577" /> registration of ships and recreational craft into line with the requirements of European treaties.</P>
    <P>While certain clearly outdated provisions have remained too long on the Statute Book, l am sure the House will agree that there has never been any intention on Ireland's part to seek to circumvent or evade the application of appropriate and progressive development of international maritime law.  In spirit and in practice, Ireland is at the forefront of developing progressive initiatives at IMO and EU level.  We have taken steps in recent years to extensively modernise the great bulk of Irish maritime law in keeping with the latest international developments and thinking. However, sometimes priorities, particularly in the area of safety, have to be set and it can happen that the updating of certain legislation is delayed. Such is the case in relation to the amendments proposed in the Bill relating to provisions of the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act, 1875, and the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 and 1906. I propose to formally repeal and amend these provisions in order to comply fully with the letter and spirit of enlightened modern thinking.</P>
    <P>My proposals in the Bill to widen the nationality provisions in the Mercantile Marine Act, 1955, to enable all EU citizens and bodies corporate have direct access to the Irish Ship Register follow from a recent European Court judgment.  The Irish authorities' view was that the requirements of EU law were satisfied because all EU citizens and corporate bodies were entitled to enter the Irish Ship Register following incorporatisation in Ireland.  However, the European Court of Justice ruled that the Irish register must be opened to direct access without the prior need to incorporate in Ireland.  This legislation is, therefore, urgently needed so that we can comply with the court's judgment.  However, I intend to seek Government approval as soon as practicable to further modernise the legislation dealing with the Irish Ship Register.  This will, of course, be done in full consultation with all the relevant interests. I also intend to carry out a major reform of the way we conduct marine accident investigations.  It is my intention that they be clearer, speedier, more relevant and, above all, contribute better to prevention of accidents and loss of life at sea.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that I and my Department have been active in promoting measures to make shipping operations more competitive and the employment of seafarers more attractive.  I recently instituted a major overhaul of seafarer training in Ireland so that seafarers will be second to none in quality and professionalism. More recently, I secured the agreement of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to proposals in the Finance Bill which will, for the first time, give recognition in the income tax code to the difficult competitive position of seafarers.  A £5,000 personal income tax allowance, together with a relaxation of the foreign earnings deduction scheme for certain seafarers, have been included, on my suggestion, in the Finance Bill. These concessions, together with the employers' <Col N="578" /> PRSI reductions, are aimed at encouraging employment of Irish and EU seafarers on Irish and EU registered ships and will help make seafaring a more attractive career and encourage more competitive work practices.</P>
    <P>The Commission has made approval of all these State aids to the shipping sector contingent on the present amendment regarding nationality provisions being enacted as worded in the Bill. For this reason, l ask the indulgence of the House to progress this provision in advance of my planned more comprehensive revision of the 1955 Mercantile Marine Act.  As I already said, l will progress new ship registration legislation as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>Another important and pressing requirement is that we amend the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992. This Act requires passenger boats carrying not more than 12 passengers for reward be licensed regardless of the circumstances of that carriage. The scope of &ldquo;passenger boat&rdquo; in that legislation means that an employer owning or hiring a boat for the purpose of transporting his employees to their place of work must be licensed.  Experience of the practical implementation of the licensing requirements indicates that the relevant section inadvertently embraces certain passenger carrying operations where licensing was not envisaged and is not deemed appropriate, such as pilot boats transporting pilots to ships, dredging operations, vessels used for dumping at sea, fish farm workboats, wildlife survey vessels and vessels used in the maintenance of lighthouses.</P>
    <P>The provisions of that Act could also be invoked to preclude vessels from operating in emergency situations.  This could hinder the work of the people who are working to prevent accidents. Persons providing a boat to the emergency services where no licensed boat is immediately available, or where it is impractical to use a licensed vessel, will not find themselves in the position of being prosecuted for providing an unlicensed boat.  Safety in maritime transport is always paramount and if we are to regulate safety in passenger ferries there must be licensing and certification procedures.  I am conscious of this and will ensure that any vessels exempted under the proposed provisions will meet certain minimum conditions and will not be inappropriate to the purposes for which they are used.  I assure the House, therefore, that there will be no diminution in the safety of persons transported on vessels which it is proposed to exempt.</P>
    <P>Section 680 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, deals with the prosecution of offences, under that Act.  I have amended the provision dealing with the level of fines and duration of imprisonment and brought the language in line with current usage.  For reasons of safety and accident prevention, l am extending the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, to ferry boats working in chains.  These are vessels which use traction power based on land and cables or chains to draw themselves across narrow sections of waterway.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> It gives me great pleasure to commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome most of the provisions of the Bill, many of which were in preparation during my period in office.  I am glad the Minister has an opportunity of bringing them forward in this Bill.  He will agree that many of the old Acts date to the 19th century and that it is rather confusing when trying to follow legislation concerning merchant shipping.  It is extremely difficult to refer to old Acts and amendments of various sections.  I hope, in the not so distant future, there will be updating and consolidation of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Shipping is far different today than in the 19th century, and repealing the penalties for seamen is to be welcomed.  The conditions under which people work today are far different from those that pertained in the 1800s.</P>
      <P>As Minister I had the pleasure of encouraging the shipping sector.  I think the Minister will agree that shipping was in decline.  Ireland, as an island nation, should never allow such decline or a situation where maritime skills would be lost.  In the course of my examination of the industry it was clear that, with proper encouragement and some breaks in terms of the purchase or leasing of new vessels, the fleet could be increased and that there is plenty of business available to the Irish shipping industry if it is allowed compete on an equal footing with other countries.</P>
      <P>It is in the interest of Ireland and the EU to have a common approach to safety standards, conditions of vessels, etc.  Often we are uncompetitive because people are underpaid and forced to work in appalling conditions, something I regard as uncivilised in many respects, and not because we are over charging.  An EU approach to standards applied within the Union is important.  Those who wish to use our ports should be forced to adhere to standards set by us to eliminate the possibility of slave and cheap labour from Third World countries.</P>
      <P>We all have a keen interest in safety at sea. From the point of view of the environment and the type of goods being carried on the sea, it is vitally important that legislation be modernised to deal with the type of catastrophes which could occur if certain standards are not applied.  We have a long way to go in getting common agreement within the EU to setting standards concerning safety and the protection of the environment. Some applicant countries are being monitored by the Commission as they have very large shipping registers.  It is important that before accession their standards are aligned to those currently applied in the EU.  We can ensure these standards are adhered to by applying them to ships entering our ports and allowing for checks to be carried out with powers to detain vessels which fall short of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very important issue in the shipping sector is employment.  It is the only such profession <Col N="580" /> in which those who are trained are guaranteed a job.  I compliment the work being done in Cork in training cadets for the merchant navy.  I was delighted to assist them in getting experience aboard ships as part of their training, something the Government of which I was a member ensured.  We have had to compete with Britain where grants were being paid to ship owners in order that cadets could gain such experience.  We are turning out excellent cadets and it is delightful to see them getting very good jobs when fully qualified.</P>
    <P>We should also take action in the context of able seamen.  Perhaps the same qualifications as apply to cadets are not necessary.  I hope the Minister, in approaching the training of sea persons, will ensure courses are run in second level colleges and PLCs in areas likely to attract potential applicants.  It would be silly to establish training centres where people from areas of low income would have to travel or be provided with accommodation.  Courses could be established in a number of vocational colleges throughout the country with standards being set in line with those of the EU.  Students could receive certificates indicating completion of training and, subsequently, be taken on board ship for the latter part of their qualifications.</P>
    <P>There is guaranteed employment in this area &mdash; in fact there is a great shortage of trained individuals in merchant shipping.  This is why EU ship owners are forced to look outside the EU for labour. We should examine the area of shipping at a time when the EU is promoting employment as a key target, as mentioned in the Treaty of Amsterdam. We know there is a shortage of labour and that jobs are available.  Ireland can lead the charge by setting standards and forcing the issue at the Transport Council which the Minister attends when dealing with maritime issues.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision in the Finance Bill of a personal allowance for seafarers and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  I did some of the fore running for him before leaving office, but I know it was not easy and was only done after much consultation with ship owners, trade unions and the Departments of Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs.  We went some way towards reducing employer's PRSI payments in last year's Finance Act.  The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs was very forthcoming in this respect.  I am delighted the Department of Finance has seen sense at last and supports the Minister's proposal. I hope that will help us ensure that Irish people have an equal opportunity of employment and that it will be attractive to people to take up the jobs that are available.  When travelling on ferries, which I do frequently, one would have to listen closely to hear an Irish accent.  I hope those providing that service would also see fit to employ Irish people who do excellent work and have a great tradition in the whole seafaring area.  Anything we can do to encourage people back into the maritime life is welcome.  As an island nation <Col N="581" /> we have had these skills for centuries and it is important that we get back to using them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a number of Irish shipping companies are doing well and indeed expanding.  The whole area of short sea shipping will be developed more in the future because it is now becoming obvious in Europe that the carriage of goods by road is not always the most attractive means of getting goods from one place to another.  There are proposals to put some of that traffic back on the sea.  That can be done without destroying the environment or having to build or develop additional major road networks throughout Europe.  There is vast potential in the shipping area for employment and for business in the future and Ireland should be prepared to avail of those opportunities as they arise.</P>
    <P>I do not have any problems with section 2 which repeals antiquated penalties on seafarers which applied in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. I understand the Minister's position in relation to section 3 which allows for the registration of ships on the Irish Ship Register by companies not incorporated in this country.  We must accept that is a reality now that we are part of the European Union.  The fact that the companies are not registered in Ireland should not prevent them from being entered on the Irish Ship Register, provided they are resident in an EU member state and adhere to European standards.  I do not see any great difficulty with that section and I am aware that the Minister is obliged to introduce it in order for us to avail of the improvements in the lot of seafarers by way of tax reductions and other State aids to the shipping industry.  It is appropriate, therefore, to get the agreement of the Commission to allow us to introduce these incentives in return for updating our legislation to comply with European legislation.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned, however, in relation to section 4 which amends the 1992 Merchant Shipping Act and adds section 14a to that Act. The Minister referred to various companies transporting employees to their place of work, dredging operations, vessels used for dumping at sea, fish farm work boats, wildlife survey vessels and vessels used in the maintenance of lighthouses. My understanding of the licensing provision for passenger boats in the 1992 Act was to ensure that vessels taking to sea were in a safe and sound condition.  A licence was issued by the Minister which I believe was for a period of two years, and some inspection would have to be carried out also.  I have always maintained that there are sufficient marine surveyors in private practice in this country who are capable of doing that, provided they were entered on a register and approved by the marine surveyors in the Department.  These marine surveyors operating in the private sector could carry out inspections provided they were properly qualified and approved by the Department. They could charge an appropriate fee for carrying out an inspection which would be done very quickly.  The problem of long delays and a shortage of staff in the public sector would not <Col N="582" /> arise.  The marine surveyors employed in the Department could then get on with their work, which is in a supervisory capacity, in ensuring that the overall system worked properly.  To ask them to inspect passenger and fishing vessels, which will need to be examined also in terms of safety at sea, is unacceptable.  I urge the Minister to seriously consider this matter which I tried to progress when I was in office.</P>
    <P>We must be conscious of the need for ongoing inspection and to provide vessels for passengers that are in a safe condition.  Regardless of whether a person is employed by somebody or a paying passenger travelling to an island or whatever, the vessel should be safe.  The fact that a person is somebody's employee should not mean that standards would be lower than we would expect if somebody was paying to go from A to B. I do not understand why it is necessary to include this provision provided that vessels can be inspected quickly.  If somebody has a vessel which is used for dredging operations or dumping at sea, which will soon be a thing of the past because our modern legislation will prevent dumping at sea in the future &mdash; I was glad to introduce that legislation &mdash; or if a person works for the Wildlife Service or the Commissioners of Irish Lights, which have always set the highest standards in relation to safety, or if one is transporting employees in any sector, the vessels being used should be safe.  The only way we can do that is to have a licensing system and, under the 1992 Act, the Minister has power to issue that licence. We are talking about passenger boats which are not licensed to carry more than 12 paying passengers. They are relatively small vessels and if they are carrying employees they should be inspected. I await to hear from the Minister on that when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>An exception could be made if, in an emergency, a member of the Garda Síochána, one of the Minister's inspectors or a surveyor had to use a vessel.  However, we should not send out the message that if one is an employee being ferried from A to B, the vessel does not have to be inspected as if the passenger was being carried for reward.  I understand what the Minister said but it does not make sense that standards should be lower simply because people are being ferried in connection with their employment.  I accept, however, that the provisions of that Act could also be invoked to preclude vessels from operating in emergencies.  That would be unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see ongoing legislation in the merchant shipping area.  From past experience, I am aware the Minister is dedicated to achieving the objectives I tried to achieve when in office, to provide greater opportunities for employment in this sector and to help the shipping industry expand and compete within Europe.  I welcome the Bill, but ask the Minister reconsider the provisions in section 4 which amends the 1992 Act. <Col N="583" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it forward.  For many years legislation in the area of merchant shipping lagged behind.  I recall that when I worked in that section of the then Department of Transport and Power we struggled to redraft 18th century legislation. I welcome the fact that the progress made in the past decade is continuing under this Minister, who is to be complimented.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been extensive modernisation in legislation dealing with merchant shipping.  The Bill recognises that the position of merchant shipping is changing rapidly.  The Minister is changing extraordinary and antiquated procedures.  I am not sure if keel hauling is still permissible, but it will probably be abolished by this Bill.  Under old legislation, a person could be clapped in irons for a certain length of time and captains had extraordinary rights.  Some of the vestigial attitudes, particularly in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, still exist in merchant shipping legislation.  It is extraordinary that, as we approach the 21st century, we are finally talking about removing the legal constraints on seamen who engage in trade disputes.</P>
      <P>In my family there is much history of the sea.  I recall stories being told about the early part of this century when men were literally left ashore in foreign ports by ship owners because they dared to become involved or encourage men to become involved in trade union activities.  I welcome the fact the Minister is bringing this legislation from the 18th to the 20th century.  Legislation which imposes criminal liability on a person who encourages a trade dispute among seamen has not been enforced in recent years, but it is of concern that it is still on the Statute Book and the Minister is to be complimented on getting rid of it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in fines for breaches of safety.  There is always a temptation, although not by good operators &mdash; the previous speaker referred to the excellent record of Irish Lights &mdash; to operate on the margins and to adopt a loose attitude towards people's safety.  Under the Bill, breaches of safety will be subject to severe penalty, as is entirely appropriate.  When earlier legislation was going through the House I suggested it would be a good idea if a procedure was in place to automatically increase, in line with inflation, the levels of fines to keep them at a point where they are punitively high.  Other sanctions relating to the rights of masters of vessels and disciplinary action against staff belong to the British Navy of the 18th century.  They do not belong in modern merchant shipping legislation and I am pleased those provisions are being abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised it is necessary to introduce a change to allow nationals of other EU states to enter the Irish register.  I would have thought that under the provisions relating to freedom to provide services, the right to establish the relevant articles of the Treaty of Rome would have existed because of case law in the European Court, but <Col N="584" /> the Minister is making prudent provision for an innovation.  As long as operators entering the Irish register operate to the highest standards, additional shipping companies will be welcome on the register.  It is not many years since the potential problem was that there would be virtually no Irish registered shipping.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to two matters which I welcome.  I am aware from contacts with Deputy Barrett when he was in office that he was anxious to introduce a taxation measure for seamen.  That is a long overdue provision.  It helped contribute to the fact that there are many people unwilling to undergo the rigours of life as a seaman.  I compliment the Minister and his predecessor on the work in that regard.  The Minister has been involved in a number of initiatives on seafarer training and I welcome those initiatives.  It is pathetic that, as an island nation, we may have to look abroad to recruit people to our Naval Service. That is bizarre and it should not happen. The Minister is right in recognising that this matter needs attention.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister might go a little further. Cadet training and officer training is very important.  The thinking always was that if the officer corps existed, the remaining crew could be put together with relative ease, but there is need for non-officer training, for training of able bodied seamen and deck crew.  There are jobs in that area.  There are towns with seafaring traditions where there are high levels of unemployment and, with relatively small investment, young men and women could be brought into the merchant shipping sector.</P>
    <P>In addition to the initiatives that have been taken, perhaps the Minister, in co-operation with vocational education committees, Regional Technical Colleges and new colleges of technology, will put in place, even on a pilot basis, a number of schemes.  I hope I will be forgiven for being parochial, but I would mention County Wicklow VEC which has been seeking co-operation for a training programme based in Arklow, a town with a fine seafaring tradition and with one of the biggest private fleets in the country.  From talking to shipping operators there and to the VEC and Regional Technical College, there is potential in that area.  If the Department takes the initiative in that regard, valuable training could be introduced for seamen without huge investment.</P>
    <P>I share the concern about section 4.  Obviously in the case of an emergency one does not want to be bureaucratic and interfere with an emergency service, but if employers, particularly unscrupulous employers, are released from their liabilities and responsibilities there could be a catastrophe in the event that a non-seaworthy vessel is used to ferry workers.  I am aware the Minister is as concerned as I and other Members on the issue of safety, and while I generally welcome the Bill I have a niggling doubt about that provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who spoke in <Col N="585" /> the debate.  Deputy Barrett recognised many of the provisions in the Bill because when he was Minister for the Marine he was anxious to see them brought forward.  He is happy to see them introduced now.  I agree with the Deputy that consolidation should be done wherever possible. I have always been keen on consolidation and I am trying to undertake some at present.  Knowing the difficulties, I will do everything possible to advance consolidation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is also aware that I introduced two consolidation Bills when I was Minister for Social Welfare.  Much legislation will be brought up to date in the larger Bill to follow. It will then be easier to consolidate thereafter.</P>
      <P>I agree with the comments made by Deputy Barrett regarding the fleet and increasing the fleet and employment.  The Irish fleet is diminishing and the numbers employed have been diminishing substantially.  That is wrong because we are a maritime country.</P>
      <P>I am glad that when Deputy Barrett was Minister for the Marine he secured improvements in PRSI and I am happy that we have secured financial agreement which recognise the needs in this area.  While there are many technicalities to be resolved it will lead to an improved and more competitive position for our shipping and for those who work on the boats, not only the cadets &mdash; I agree with Deputy Barrett's remarks here &mdash; but for the able seamen, where there are many jobs and where we have a great tradition in that area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett and Deputy Roche mentioned the vocational education committees.  I will keep their views in mind.  It is an area that should be followed up.  I will refer it to the task force which has been established to look at the whole training issue because it is so important.  It will urgently undertake its work.  The suggestions made here are relevant to its deliberations.  For example, Deputy Barrett's suggestions about engendering an interest in going further with VEC, PLC and further specialised courses will be pursued at EU level.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roche referred to the position in Arklow, which has an important seafaring tradition. The vocational education committees could have a function there and they should be approached. The task force will also deal with that area.</P>
      <P>With regard to the section 4 issue, provision was made in the Bill because difficulties arose with the implementation of the 1992 Act.  It was felt that flexibility was needed in these areas and that it would be adequate for a Minister to introduce regulations to cover them without legislation. Some of these areas have special circumstances which need to be catered for.  I will look closely at this for Committee Stage when the matter can be discussed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have explained the question of entering the <Col N="586" /> register.  We require companies to be incorporated in Ireland.  Deputy Barrett referred to the marine survey officers and the inspections.  It did not take me long in office to have similar views. I am looking at the matter.  It is a good and realistic idea.  We will look at how it is done because there is no point in saying we cannot cover various things if they can be covered in other ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>A few weeks before Christmas I attended with the Taoiseach a presentation by MSF union on the general history of ESOPs and employee share ownership plans.  I understand that the Taoiseach and I were the only two public representative present.  The Taoiseach made some interesting comments about the operation of ESOPs and the role they play in the US in encouraging partnership, especially at factory and company level and the role they could play in the social partnership.  He looked forward to their development in this country.</P>
      <P>Before the general election Deputies interacted closely with their constituents, some of whom work in Telecom Éireann and are members of the Communication Workers' Union.  At that time the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste made an explicit written promise to the workers of Telecom Éireann, including those in my constituency and on whose behalf I speak, that they would fully honour the proposal to have an ESOP of 14.9 per cent of the restructured Telecom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The target date was 31 January yet we are now approaching the middle of March without agreement. I understand from today's newspaper that the company has been valued by the Minister's <Col N="587" /> valuers, Morgan Stanley, at approximately £2.4 billion.  On that basis and given the 9.9 per cent outstanding employees share ownership, the employees would need to raise approximately £240 million.  On the basis of that valuation it would appear that a deal is not possible if we cannot advance the situation.  Coopers and Lybrand on behalf of Telecom Éireann and Keelin on behalf of the Communication Workers' Union have valued the company at approximately £1.5 billion.  With the surrender of the worker's bonus over the next number of years and with capitalisation of their pensions they will have to raise approximately £50 million, which they are prepared to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach referred to the basis of securing a fair price from the employees for this shareholding in their company.  It appears to me and my constituents who are Telecom Éireann workers that the £1.5 billion valuation is a fair price.  However, an advance could be made even if an amount midway between the Morgan Stanley, Coopers &amp; Lybrand or Keelin valuations was adopted.</P>
    <P>The home of ESOPs is the United States.  It has operated there extremely successfully in many brilliant companies.  Special concessions are given to companies which introduce an ESOP involving deductible income under the taxation system.  If the Minister is not prepared to consider a fairer price for the employee shareholding, will she consider, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, an addition to the Finance Bill?  This would enable a settlement to be reached under which the employees' contribution would still be approximately £50 million.</P>
    <P>Many of my constituents who are proud workers for Telecom Éireann are exasperated at this stage.  The Minister has been working on this issue for the past nine months and the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have made strong commitments on it.  However, it has not been finalised and the workers want to know when the issue will be advanced and a deal will be cut.  The Minister has an opportunity in the context of social partnership, to which the Labour Party and I hope the Government is committed, of bringing forward a fair partnership in this company between the employees and management.  As we face an era of restructuring in which there will be significant change in the telecommunications area, the Minister has an opportunity to build a main plank in social partnership.  She would then have the distinction of being the Minister who brought about the first major ESOP deal in the public sector and laid down a formula for the future development of partnerships in Ireland.  I urge the Minister to conclude the deal as soon as possible and to put to rest the fears of my constituents.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this matter and the Chair for allowing it to be <Col N="588" /> debated.  I am committed to an ESOP for Telecom Éireann workers and I hope such schemes will also be developed in other companies in the semi-State sector.  This area is being closely examined by many other companies which are awaiting the outcome of the current discussions.</P>
      <P>The Government has been in office for eight months but intensive negotiations on this issue did not begin until just before Christmas.  They have been ongoing since then.  The main players from the various areas in the company are engaged in detailed talks in my Department this afternoon.  I have been in my office all day and various matters have been referred to me in the context of the progression of the talks which have reached a crucial stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan and many other members of his party were committed to ensuring that an ESOP was agreed in Telecom Éireann.  However, that did not happen prior to the last election despite many months of negotiations.  A point was reached when the then Minister said &ldquo;no&rdquo; and the process went no further.  The Deputy is aware of this and I do not wish to rub it in because I want a successful outcome to the current discussions.</P>
      <P>In labour matters generally, one does not seek to disturb talks when they reach a crucial stage. The current negotiations are at a sensitive point and are intense.  I spoke to an official engaged in the talks before I came to the House and it would be incorrect of me to outline the exact stage they have reached.</P>

There is also much goodwill on my part and that of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.

    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to debate this matter.  The Deputy tabled his matter yesterday <Col N="589" /> so it was not based on information he read this morning in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  He was obviously tuned in to the matter prior to the article.  This is how democracy operates.  The coalition of trade unions has taken an extremely co-ordinated approach.  It is definite about what its members want and it is good at negotiation. Our side is also good at negotiation and I am hopeful of a satisfactory outcome within a short period.</P>

      <P>Even people who are not involved in farming are aware that there has been a disastrous collapse in lamb prices.

This has a direct impact on the income of sheep farmers.  In the days of the Celtic tiger, nobody is taking a 30 per cent cut, but that has happened to sheep farmers.</P>
      <P>Another sinister development with regard to Irish meat on the European market is the new move towards nationalisation of food.  The French market is paying ten francs a kilo more for its own lamb than for Irish lamb of comparable quality. This differential of 50p a pound is almost unprecedented. The ewe premium which directly supplements the income of sheep farmers has also been reduced.  At the end of 1995, it was £20.59; it is now £12.42, which is a 40 per cent drop.  In addition, a large number of ewes from Northern Ireland are getting into the system in the South. There are about 1.1 million ewes in Northern Ireland.  Their slaughtering requirements are for less than 500,000 and they send less than 100,000 to the UK.  It is estimated that the rest come south, which has a debilitating effect on our prices.</P>
      <P>This is the critical time of year when spring lamb comes on the market, so it is necessary to take any possible steps to improve the price structure. The Minister promised before the election that he would introduce what is known as the extensification premium, which has not applied to sheep until now.  He said that he would extend this programme to sheep producers.  I am aware that he has made efforts to do so in Brussels, but there is widespread belief that he has not applied himself as efficiently to this task as he could have done by contacting his fellow Ministers for Agriculture and pushing for acceptance of this measure in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> Another premium, the rural world premium, is applicable only in disadvantaged areas at present. The Minister could make a strong case for its application in areas that are not disadvantaged. The ewe premium top-up could be considered where the average price in any EU State falls below the average EU price, which is the situation in Ireland at present.  Headage payments in disadvantaged areas should be introduced for sheep.</P>
    <P>Other schemes that could be considered include the aids to private storage scheme.  It is believed that private storage, if introduced over the coming five to seven months, could reduce the large overhang of hoggets on the market. That overhang is part of the problem, and the APS scheme, which the Minister is working on, could help the situation.  Lamb imports into the EU are opening the market more and more to New Zealand and other producers to the detriment of EU producers.  This should be better controlled; it need not necessarily be phased out, but these imports tend to come on the market in vast quantities, and that should be better managed within the rules of trade.  The Minister cannot do everything, but there is a list of measures from which he can select a proposal to sustain prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who is at a meeting. This will be a learning experience for me.</P>
      <P>Sheepmeat prices in 1997 were very satisfactory for much of the year.  Prices in January, February and March, and from mid June to mid October were at record levels.  This is a period in which nearly 701 of 1997 lambs were sold.  Averaged over the whole year, the 1997 Irish market price was 2 per cent above the 1996 price which in turn was 21 per cent better than the 1995 average price.  However, it is fair to say that in the closing stages of 1997 and in the early part of 1998 the market situation for sheepmeat in Ireland has deteriorated.  Following two years of very good prices, November, December and January saw an unusual drop in market prices.  The poorer prices of late 1997 have set a low floor for 1998 prices. Prices for the year to date are almost 30 per cent below the &mdash; albeit buoyant &mdash; prices of this time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties on the market stem to a great extent from a large overhang of unsold lamb on the UK and to a lesser extent on the Irish markets. The particularly large stocks of unsold lambs in the UK and Northern Ireland, as a result of the strength of the currency, have depressed UK prices.  This has increased competition for Irish product on the French market.  The overhang on the Irish market, though smaller than that on the UK market, is nevertheless contributing to the problem also.  There has been comment on the ewe premium which is the main form of EU market support.  As Deputies will know, the premium is a market balancing mechanism which goes some way towards bridging the gap between institutional <Col N="591" /> and market prices averaged across the EU.  It is set annually and its level depends on the situation in the market in a particular year.  The 1997 ewe premium has been set at £12.42, and has been compared unfavourably with the 1995 premium of £20.59. The reality is that in 1995 the average market price paid for a 20 kg lamb was £42.36, which with the premium of £20.59 gave a return of £62.95, whereas in 1997 the average market price for such a lamb was £52 which, with the premium of £12.42, gave a return of £64.42. On average, the Irish sheep producer was better off in 1997.</P>
    <P>It is the case that there are producers now in difficulty, primarily those who bought store lambs in 1997 at high prices for a Mediterranean market which turned out to be more problematic than anticipated.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food is fully conscious of the position of sheep farmers who are in this position at present and is also intent on protecting the 1998 spring lamb market.  He has therefore already taken urgent action to address the core of the problem by seeking to have a quantity of 1997 season lambs taken off the market to allow market equilibrium be restored and to boost market confidence over the coming months.</P>
    <P>His Department has made a strong case to the EU Commission for an immediate scheme of aid for private storage.  In view of the fact that the problem is to a large extent of UK origin, it is essential that the UK are also part of the solution. The Department has therefore had high level contact with their counterparts in London to ensure that they give full backing to an APS scheme at EU level.  An APS scheme which would remove a certain quantity of hoggets from the market until the summer would allow a breathing space in which market prices could be restored to a more satisfactory level.  The EU Commission, in response to a request from Ireland and from the UK, has convened a special meeting of the Sheepmeat Management Committee in Brussels tomorrow, at which it is expected that an APS programme for Ireland and the UK will be discussed.  The speedy availability of this market support should contribute substantially to alleviating the present problem.</P>
    <P>In a wider perspective, l am conscious that in common with the rest of the EU, many enterprises in the Irish sheepmeat industry are going through a relatively difficult time despite good investments, hard work and state of the art management techniques.  There is a need to build on the huge gains made in the past in terms of building up a major export oriented industry. There is also a need to improve the overall EU support system to better reflect the needs of the Irish sheepmeat sector.  In this connection, Ireland has requested a top up premium, as suggested by the Deputy, and an extensification premium for sheep, arguing that the ewe premium support system must be sufficiently flexible to compensate producers who suffer poor prices <Col N="592" /> because of structural handicaps such as distance from the market and high self sufficiency.</P>
    <P>There is much that the industry can achieve in partnership to improve the future prospects of the sector and to secure the prosperity of producers and processors alike.  To this end the Minister for Agriculture and Food has recently established the Sheepmeat Forum, consisting of representatives of producers processors, Teagasc, An Bord Bia and his own Department, to evaluate the future direction of the sheepmeat sector, and assess how the industry can collectively address the challenges it faces.</P>
    <P>The forum has already held a very useful first meeting and the Minister anticipates that the exchange of ideas and views will lead to a very fruitful partnership allowing a better based, stronger industry to flourish.</P>
    <P>There is much which can be done in the area of marketing, particularly on our main market which is France, which consumes 300,000 tonnes of sheepmeat each year.  An Bord Bia is actively working to enhance the image of Irish sheepmeat on that market, including the planned launch of branded Irish lamb there.  This will be promoted in the context of the SIAL food fair as well as promoted through programmes linked to the Tour de France in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to 1996 public health nurses participated greatly in the implementation of the childhood immunisation programme.  I refer to the three in one and polio injections given to babies at two months, four months, six months and the MMR &mdash; measles, mumps and rubella &mdash; injection, which is given from 15 months onwards.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1996, public health nurses were informed of a baby's existence, could communicate with the mother and ensure that the baby was immunised.  It is a busy time for a family and it can be difficult to keep track of a child &mdash; two months is nothing when one has a small baby. The public health nurses worked well in ensuring babies were immunised.</P>
      <P>After 1996, however, the situation changed.  In consultation with GPs, but not with public health nurses, the Department of Health implemented a new scheme in 1996 under which GPs were made responsible for administering the immunisation. Public health nurses refused to participate in the scheme because they had not been consulted when it was drawn up or were not informed of the changes.  Prior to l996 they administered the immunisation as part of their job.  GPs are now paid a fee to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter in the form of written questions to the Minister on a number of occasions.  It is not surprising the scheme is not effective as a <Col N="593" /> major prong, the public health nurses, is missing. The original uptake target was 95 per cent, but the figures from the Department of Health and Children indicate that the figure may be as low as 65 per cent in some cases, which is alarming. We have the necessary information and a vaccination scheme in place, but there is not a proper mechanism to ensure children are immunised. Public health nurses have called for a major review of what they consider a flawed vaccination programme.  GPs claim they are doing all they can to implement the scheme but are hampered by the nurses' refusal to work under it.  The INO has refused to take part in the initiation process of infants although it is advising parents to have their children immunised.</P>
    <P>Approximately 45,000 babies are born each year.  If there was only a 65 per cent take-up in some cases, have some babies not been immunised? Figures indicate there has been an increase of the incidence of whooping cough, but the immunisation scheme cannot be blamed for that. How does the Minister propose to resolve this difficulty to ensure public health nurses participate in the scheme and that all babies are immunised?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by the Minister for Health and Children to take this matter on the Adjournment.  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  She has identified the difficulties pertaining to the immunisation scheme, particularly the role of public health nurses.  The Minister is particularly conscious of this problem.</P>
      <P>The Review Group on Primary Childhood Immunisation was established in November 1993 to review the administration of the childhood immunisation programme and to make recommendations on measures, having regard to both cost and quality issues, on options to improve the uptake of immunisations.</P>
      <P>The group was established against a background of relatively low uptake of the recommended primary childhood immunisations in certain areas of the county and among specific groups, and a parallel high incidence of certain infectious diseases.  The group recommended that the general practitioner should be the principal health professional involved in delivery of primary childhood immunisations.  His or her role as the family doctor means the GP is ideally placed to encourage parents to have their children immunised, to provide advice and information taking account of the medical history of the child and family, to administer the immunisations, to deal with any reactions and to follow up children who do not attend for immunisation.</P>
      <P>The aim of the immunisation programme is to eliminate, as far as possible, such conditions as diphtheria, tetanus, polio, hib disease, measles, mumps, rubella and pertussis.  The review group concluded that it may be possible to eradicate these diseases if an uptake level of 95 per cent of the child population is achieved and maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1995 agreement was reached <Col N="594" /> between the Department of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation on the administration of the programme.  This agreement had immediate effect.  Health boards were required to make substantial changes in the delivery of the primary childhood immunisation programme in a very short period.  In addition, the detailed arrangements for the new system had to be developed. These related to the payment structure, development of computer programmes, claim form and record systems.  A sum of £2 million was allocated to health boards in 1996 to cover the net additional costs of the new programme.  The additional amount allocated in 1997 was £757,000 and in 1998 a further sum of £556,000 has been provided in respect of the additional cost of the programme.  This brings the total additional funding in 1998 to £3.313 million.</P>
    <P>The target of 95 per cent immunisation of the age group has not yet been achieved.  Returns from seven of the eight health boards indicate that uptake levels for completed DPT immunisations among children aged 18 months range from 72 per cent to 88 per cent.  The Mid-Western Health Board has reported an uptake level of 42 per cent for children aged 12 months, but has advised that the actual uptake is significantly better as the board has a large backlog of claims from general practitioners to be processed.  The Minister for Health and Children has been advised that additional staff resources have been put in place to address this problem.</P>
    <P>One of the main difficulties being experienced relates to the non-cooperation of public health nurses in the operation of the new system.  The public health nurses have always played a key role in the advocation, promotion and education of parents on the benefits of immunisation. Under the new scheme they are required to identify the contracting GP whom the parent wishes to immunise his or her child and to follow up children who do not attend for immunisation. However, public health nurses are not carrying out these duties, they feel aggrieved because they were not involved in the review process.</P>
    <P>Officials from the Department of Health and Children met the Irish Nurses' Organisation on several occasions in an attempt to resolve the issue.  The Department has proposed that the technical steering group, established to provide a mechanism for resolving any outstanding issues arising in the implementation of the new programme, should be reconstituted as an advisory group and its existing membership, which consists of the Irish Medical Organisation, health boards and the Department, should be extended to include two nominees from the INO.  The INO welcomed this proposal, but refused to lift the ban on public health nurses' co-operation because of failure to reach agreement on a range of other issues, including annual leave and personal security, introduced by the INO.  It should be noted that these additional issues do not concern childhood immunisation and span the entire health service.  Some of the issues are currently <Col N="595" /> under consideration by the commission on nursing.</P>
    <P>The primary childhood immunisation programme has been designed to be convenient for parents and is free.  Health boards are making every effort to ensure parents are aware of this and that they realise the importance of availing of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children is anxious to resolve the difficulties identified in the Deputy's contribution, particularly those relating to the participation of public health nurses in the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will be pleased to deal with an issue that relates to his Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister met the board of management and the principal of this school when he visited Kilnamartyra.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to put on the record the problems that exist in this school and to appeal to the Minister, when making decisions about the allocation of primary school building projects for l998, to look favourably on this request.  The conditions in the school are the worst I have seen in any school in my constituency for a long time.  It is difficult to comprehend how two teachers can get on with the job of teaching pupils given the difficulties under which they operate.</P>
      <P>The condition of the school building places the children at serious health and safety risk and interferes with their education.  Overcrowding in the classrooms is such that children have to climb over tables to move around.  There are three children at desks for two and some have their backs to the blackboard constantly.  Two classrooms are divided by a partition and the noise from one classroom constantly intrudes on the other.  This obviously makes teaching very difficult.</P>
      <P>There is also a serious problem of dampness through the roof, walls and the chimney breast. As a result books cannot be stored and charts and maps cannot be hung on the walls.  Soot stains ooze through the chimney breast which serves as the main heating system for the school.  The flat mineral felt roof on the computer art room is leaking and in urgent need or replacement.  Windows and doors are in such a state of decay that vermin regularly enter the building.  No hot water is provided in the building.  Toilets are open drained urinals.  The toilet bowls are in a poor state of repair and the flat roof is in danger of collapse.  The doors to the toilets are old latch doors which infants are unable to manage.  The tiles in the hallway are chipped, broken and dangerous.  External fascias and gutters are rotting, roof tiles are falling and the yard surface is chipped, broken and dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some work carried out by the Office of Public Works two years ago was left unfinished to the <Col N="596" /> extent that the Department of Education and Science has refused to pay the final part of the grant due.  Fumes from the boiler room are admitted to the classroom through holes left in the wall after the repairs.</P>
    <P>The building throughout clearly fails to comply with even minimum health and safety standards and constitutes a fire hazard.  It is essential the Department of Education and Science acts quickly to address the problems along the lines recommended by the board of management.</P>
    <P>The board of management has carried out a significant number of improvements, financed from parish resources in recent years.  These include the provision of a new computer art room; the extension of a play area through the purchase of an adjacent field, fencing and layout of which is nearing completion; the purchase of a new computer and photocopier, a new TV and video, an encyclopaedia and library books and complete repainting and decorating externally and internally.  Much of this work has been undone due to the serious state of disrepair of the building.  Alterations to the main entrance have been carried out to improve safety and extra parking spaces have been provided.  This has involved considerable investment by the board of management and the parish, but the works outlined earlier are beyond their capacity.</P>
    <P>I have outlined in graphic detail the problems at this rural school.  I appeal to the Minister to do what he can.  I recognise he has a particular sympathy for schools in rural areas and I hope he can give a favourable reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this case.  I understand and acknowledge the difficulties the school is encountering as a result of the conditions outlined by the Deputy in graphic detail.  It is not acceptable that children should have to accept such conditions.  The advice in 1996 was that the devolved grant scheme should be used for minor works such as the replacement of doors, windows and so on.  Given that the school has only 42 pupils that grant is limited.  I accept there is a long-term accommodation problem for two classrooms and that we are talking about an additional classroom for the school.</P>
      <P>The capital programme for 1998 has been increased by approximately 40 per cent over the 1997 allocation, which amounts to about £40 million. We are committed to many projects because of work already in progress for which we must pay.</P>
      <P>Given that this is not a huge project I will go back to the Department and have a further look at the situation with a view to responding sympathetically. I acknowledge the difficulties outlined by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Growth in road traffic volumes, which has been closely following economic performance, presents an obvious challenge for sustainable development in Ireland.  Policy responses must be based on an integrated approach to transport requirements.  This involves increased investment in road infrastructure, but also improvement of public transport, management of road transport demand, promotion of alternative transport modes and better co-ordination of transport and land use planning. These matters are being addressed through the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99 and in urban transport initiatives such as the DTI and will be increasingly relevant to transport policy in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Investment in the construction and improvement of national roads is being accelerated in 1998, with some £263 million available for the programme; this is the highest ever allocation for national roads and an increase of more than 13 per cent on the 1997 provision.  I understand new projects to start this year under the NRA programme will include the Kildare bypass; the Nenagh bypass; Hurlers Cross-Newmarket-on-Fergus; the M50 southern cross route; and the Blackpool bypass.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, a national roads needs study, which is soon to be completed, will provide a comprehensive assessment of the work required to complete the national road network.  It will form an important input to negotiations on EU funding post-1999 and to policy development in relation to national roads generally.</P>
      <P>As regards non-national roads, it is a major priority of the Government to ensure completion of the restoration programme, within the originally established ten year timeframe, ending in 2005.  To this end, I have provided a record £200 million in non-national road grants in 1998, an increase of nearly 18 per cent on the original 1997 allocation.  This provision will enable county councils to progress all their restoration improvement schemes envisaged for 1998, according to schedules established by them in 1997, and on average almost 90 per cent of 1999 schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>A wide range of measures is being pursued by my Department to promote recycling in <Col N="600" /> the context of the ongoing implementation of national strategy and the Waste Management Act, 1996.  A number were set out in the reply to Question No. 10 of 14 October 1997.</P>
      <P>The measures taken since July 1997 include the making of the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations, 1997, to support and promote the recovery of waste plastics from farms. Measures have been taken to promote awareness of, and compliance with, these regulations and the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, which relate to packaging waste.  These included the publication of information notices in newspapers and written communication with waste collectors and local authorities, who have received extensive guidance notes on the regulations, information on packaging producers, and model forms of declarations and notices to assist implementation and enforcement.  My Department liaises with local authorities and with the approved bodies, Repak Ltd.  and the Irish Farm Films Producers Group, for the purpose of monitoring and developing their activities in relation to waste recovery.  I also launched a report on the use of shredded newspaper as a bedding material for dairy cows.</P>
      <P>In November 1997 I approved grants to a value of some £1.7 million in respect of 11 major local authority and private sector projects for recycling infrastructure for non-hazardous waste.  In January 1998 I approved grants to a value of some £2.1 million in relation to eight private sector projects for the provision of facilities for the recovery or disposal of hazardous waste.  These grants are funded by the European Regional Development Fund and are provided under the Operational Programme for Environment Services.  My Department is continuing to encourage local authorities to develop waste management strategy studies on an inter-authority basis and to develop alternatives to the disposal of waste to landfill.</P>
      <P>The Government programme contains a specific commitment to reduce dependence on landfills and, within 15 years, to divert 50 per cent of household waste to alternative treatment routes. The Minister supports the proposed EU Directive on landfill which will require member states to develop national strategies to divert the major portion of biodegradable waste from landfill.</P>
      <P>A full statement on national waste management policy will be published this year to address in detail the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives in this area generally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>There has been a significant growth in road traffic volumes in Ireland in recent years and this is giving rise to increases in journey times in peak urban conditions.  While this has obvious implications for urban air quality, monitoring data show that overall air quality is generally good and all mandatory national and EU ambient standards, including in Dublin and Cork, continue to be met.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of pollutants not currently the subject of air quality standards is being developed in prospect of new EU requirements, at present being considered under Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management and a proposed subsidiary directive relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air. Preliminary work by the Environmental Protection Agency shows a potential problem in relation to PM 10 and this must be factored into updated national and local strategies to prevent and reduce air pollution.</P>
      <P>Air quality management planning is a local authority function under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, and I understand that the preparation of a comprehensive air quality management plan for the greater Dublin area is being co-ordinated by Dublin Corporation and is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>Traffic management strategies for the major urban areas, including Dublin and Cork, have regard to environmental factors.  Major road improvements for these areas are also designed to bring benefits in terms of environmental quality.</P>

      <P>My Department has advised local authorities that housing for persons with disabilities should normally be met by the provision of houses designed to meet their known specific needs.  The authority should consult the persons concerned where known and their medical and para-medical advisers, as well as the various published guidelines such as those issued by the National Rehabilitation Board.  Where a dwelling to meet specific needs is being provided as part of a local authority housing scheme, every effort should be made to identify the needs of the future occupant at the earliest possible stage.</P>
      <P>In relation to the design of houses, local authorities have been advised that they should eliminate unnecessary barriers to facilitate future adaptations where required.  My Department's current guidelines list a number of design aspects which facilitate ease of adaptation at a future date. These guidelines are currently being revised and the intention is that greater emphasis will be placed on adaptable design.  In relation to complementary social housing options, such as the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme and extensions to local authority houses, authorities have been advised to take account of the needs of the individuals involved, and the guidelines of the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
      <P>Returns submitted by local authorities indicate a total of 3,225 disabled persons' dwellings in the local authority housing stock at 31 December 1996, the latest date for which information is available.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to Question No. 220 of 3 February 1998, a major investment programme to upgrade and extend public and private water supplies is currently under way.  Since the start of the National Development Plan in 1994 over £217 million has been expended on this programme. The 1998 water and sewerage services investment programme, which I announced at the start of February and which provided for an overall increase in spending for 1998 of 13 per cent over 1997, will allow for further improvements in public and group water supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> The 1996 report on the State of the Environment in Ireland, prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency, estimates that the total water produced by public water supply schemes is about 284 million gallons per day.  An additional 11 million gallons per day is provided by group schemes.  The report also estimates that domestic and commercial water requirements amount to approximately 55 gallons of water per person per day and the overall volume of water required by manufacturing industry at about 53 million gallons per day.  The agency's 1996 report on the Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland contains information in relation to the daily usage and treatment processes for most of the public drinking water supplies monitored.</P>
    <P>The amount of storage capacity and the treatment level required varies from scheme to scheme and, while there are no national figures relating to the amount of storage capacity, requirements are addressed on a scheme by scheme basis.  Major studies have been carried out in recent years into the water supply requirements for the Dublin Region, and Galway and Waterford cities.  Studies are under way for Cork and Limerick cities and a number of other towns and counties across the country.  In addition, my Department has received Cohesion Funding to undertake a national water audit entailing the collection and analysis of data for each of the medium to large public water supplies which have not yet been the subject of a study to assess the adequacy of existing systems for each area served and to make recommendations as to the appropriate approach for improving inadequate supplies.  I will be appointing consultants later this year to undertake this study.  In the case of private group water supplies, local authorities will be developing, in partnership with the private group scheme sector, strategic rural water plans which will contain, as one of their elements, an examination of future demands and a recommendation as to how these should best be met.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, however, from the information already available that there will be a requirement for continued substantial investment in water schemes over the next ten years to provide the necessary infrastructure to sustain our current high level of economic growth and to meet environmental and public health needs.</P>

      <P>It is expected that in excess of 100 of the 203 schemes included in the 1998 water and sewerage services investment programme will be completed by the end of 1999. Twenty seven of the schemes included in the programme will receive co-financing under the current Community Support Framework through the Operational Programme for Environmental Services and the INTERREG II Initiative.  A further 78 schemes are being co-funded by the Cohesion Fund either in their entirety or elements of them. I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement listing these schemes.  The European Commission have indicated in discussions with my Department their intention to approve a number of additional schemes in 1998 and 1999 for Cohesion Funding.  The remaining schemes in the 1998 programme will be funded solely by the Exchequer though it is proposed that a number of these, which will be at construction in the post 1999 period, will be submitted for co-financing under the next round of EU funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>Designations under the new urban renewal scheme which is due to come into operation on 1 August 1998 will be considered on the basis of integrated area plans prepared by local authorities for areas of greatest priority in urban renewal terms.  Guidelines for the new scheme set out the criteria to be used by local authorities in the selection of areas for such integrated area plans and provide guidance on the content of these plans.  A copy of these guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> The specified deadline for the submission of plans to my Department is 31 March next.  A broadly based expert advisory panel, which I established last year, will assess the integrated area plans when received and make recommendations to me in relation to the designation of areas for tax incentives.  An announcement in regard to the new scheme and the areas designated will be made in advance of 1 August.</P>

      <P>The shared ownership system facilitates access to full home ownership in a number of stages to those who cannot afford full ownership in one step in the traditional way.  Initially, equity in the house is shared between the shared owner and the local authority.  Persons buying under shared ownership acquire, subject to the terms of the scheme, the benefits and responsibilities of home onwership from the outset and are not tenants of the local authority.</P>
      <P>The remaining equity in the house may be bought from the local authority in stages over a period of 25 years.  The question of a tenant purchase scheme does not arise in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a stated objective of national recycling policy to divert some 100,000 tonnes of organic waste away from landfill by means of composting by 1999.  Many measures are being taken to promote waste composting.  Financial assistance has been allocated to local authorities under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99 for the provision of composting facilities and, in one instance, towards the development of a pilot project to collect organic waste from households for composting.</P>
      <P>A number of local authorities are now actively involved in composting developments.  For example, Dublin Corporation provides a facility for the acceptance of garden waste which deals with some 50,000 tonnes of waste per annum. Limerick Corporation has been approved for grant assistance from the European Regional Development Fund via my Department, for a project involving the separate collection of organic waste from householders, following which it is to be composted at a central facility. This project is expected to divert some 15,000 tonnes of waste to composting.  Cork Corporation and Cork County Council are jointly proposing to develop a central waste management facility for the segregation, treatment and composting of municipal waste.  The facility will involve the composting of some 35,000 tonnes of wet organic waste.</P>
      <P>Several local authorities have provided home composters to householders with a view to separation and composting of organic waste at source. Some private sector companies have also been approved for grant assistance from the European Regional Development Fund for the development of relevant projects.</P>
      <P>Future measures to advance the diversion of organic waste from landfill to recycling will be considered in the context of the proposed EU Directive on Landfill which will require member states to develop national strategies for the diversion of the major portion of biodegradable waste from landfill.</P>
      <P>Public information on household composting and on organic waste treatment is distributed by ENFO, the Department's environmental information service, and by local authorities.</P>

      <P>The present position, in which only one organisation stands designated as an issuing authority for international driving permits, has operated since 1992 and arose from the virtual cessation of licence applications to a second formerly designated organisation.  My Department has recently received a request from a different organisation to be designated as an issuing authority for international driving permits.  This request will de determined shortly.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in designating an issuing authority for international driving permits, is not an undertaking within the meaning of the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996.  The fee for an international driving permit &mdash; £4 &mdash; is fixed by the relevant statutory instrument and may not be varied by designated licensing authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>It is intended to bring car testing into operation early next year.  Testing will be carried out at dedicated test centres under the control of a contractor to be appointed on a national basis following an EU-wide competitive tendering process. Test centres will be strategically located to facilitate access and mobile test centres may be used in more remote areas.  Subject to these and other requirements regarding service standards, the location and staffing of test centres will be a matter for the appointment contractor.  Testing will be introduced on a phased basis; details of this phasing will be finalised later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The above proposals have already been communicated to, and noted by, the European Commission. They have also been signalled to the interested public, including the motor industry, in press releases and briefings.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 206 and 212 of 17 February 1998.  As I explained in that reply, the EU negotiating position in advance of the Kyoto Conference in December 1997 proposed that developing countries parties, individually or jointly, should reduce emission levels for carbon dioxide, CO 2, methane, CH 4, and nitrous oxide, N 2 O, together by at least 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent below 1990 levels by 2005 and 2010 respectively. This was not a unilateral commitment and was subject to comparable commitments by other developed countries.</P>
      <P>The Kyoto Protocol the the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted on 11 December 1997, sets, <i>inter alia</i>, a legally binding target for the member states of the EU to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases &mdash; CH 2, CH 4, N 2O, hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs, perfluorocarbons, PFCs, and sulphur hexafluoride, SF 6 &mdash; by 8 per cent below 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012.  It is intended that the EU will meet the target using provisions in the protocol concerning joint fulfilment and on the basis of agreed internal burden sharing.</P>
      <P>In December 1997 the Council of Environment Ministers was advised that the European Commission will present to the Council an analysis of the move from an objective of -15 per cent for three gases to an objective of -8 per cent for the six gases now covered by the protocol so that the effects can be assessed precisely.  The analysis will also need to take account of the provisions regarding the use of sinks to absorb CO 2 and other provisions of the protocol.  In addition, the Commisison will review its communication Climate Change &mdash; The EU Approach for Kyoto, published in October 1997, which concluded &ldquo;that the (EU) emission reduction targets are technically feasible and economically manageable in the EU only if all industrialised countries make comparable reduction efforts&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will be actively participating at EU level in the detailed consideration of the issues involved having regard to the conclusion to the analysis and review now under way by the Commission. <Col N="612" /> I have already indicated my intention to adhere to the level of ambition implicit in Ireland's indicative national growth limitation target of 15 per cent which was part of the internal burden sharing agreement associated with the EU negotiating position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>An assessment of the numbers of homeless people was carried out by local authorities in March 1996 in conjunction with their assessment of housing needs.  It showed a total of 2,501 homeless people, mainly men, but including some women and other family members.  The needs of homeless children are the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Three assessments of homelessness have taken place and the next one is due in March 1999.  I am satisfied that the figures disclosed by the assessments reflect the general level of homelessness at the time of the assessments.  In the preparation of the guidelines, etc., for local authorities for the next assessment of housing need, I will be considering the scope there may be to improve the reliability of the assessments in relation to homelessness and, in particular, whether there is a need for a separate more detailed assessment for the Dublin area where the incidence of homelessness is greatest.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a wide range of powers to enable them to provide an effective response to the accommodation needs of homeless persons. The maintenance of the local authority housing programme at a high and consistent level in recent years benefits the homeless in common with other housing needs.  A substantial part of the accommodation provided under the voluntary housing schemes, administered by local authorities, has been for homeless persons.  The terms and conditions of the schemes were recently significantly improved and they will continue to play an important part in meeting housing needs, including those of homeless people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities also have powers under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, to provide or fund the cost of accommodation for homeless people.  This includes contributions to voluntary bodies providing such accommodation and meeting the cost of accommodation arranged directly by local authorities themselves or by health boards on their behalf.  My Department recoups 90 per cent of these costs to local authorities and the amounts recouped have increased steadily <Col N="613" /> over the years &mdash; from £7,000 in 1989 to £6 million in 1997.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he intends to take to address the huge disparity between the councillor to elector ratio in parts of Dublin and in some other parts of the country prior to the next local government elections, having regard to the impact on Seanad elections; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no constitutional or statutory requirements relating to equality of representation between different local authorities.  Local authorities operate within their own administrative areas and the main priority is that each of them has sufficient members to carry out its functions effectively.  Complete equality of representation, bearing in mind demographic features as between urban and rural areas, would be difficult to achieve and could result in reductions in some authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have established two boundary committees whose terms of reference include reviewing the population to councillors ratio within local authorities but do not provide for any increase or decrease in the number of elected members in any authority.  The boundary committees' reports will be considered as the basis for a revision of <Col N="615" /> the local electoral areas for use at the local elections to be held in June 1999.</P>
    <P>I will be bringing forward comprehensive legislation to modernise local government law and to underpin the major programme for the renewal of local government.  The Bill will present an opportunity for the House to discuss the question of representation between local authorities.</P>

      <P>Housing authorities are responsible for the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of halting sites and group housing schemes for travellers.  In view of the costs involved, a scheme of financial assistance to local authorities in respect of the management and maintenance of such accommodation was introduced in 1997 and is being continued in 1998.  Under the scheme, eligible costs are recouped by my Department at rates ranging from 50 per cent to 75 per cent depending on the type of maintenance expenditure.  Funds were reserved in 1997 for a number of pilot initiatives which would encourage partnership arrangements between travellers and local authorities for the management of accommodation.  I intend to invite proposals for further such initiatives in 1998.</P>
      <P>The standards for the provision of accommodation are being improved and revised guidelines for the provision of residential caravan parks were issued by my Department in October 1997. The guidelines emphasise the need for best practice in design and operation with a view to improved management and maintenance of sites.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>A working group chaired by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, is now examining the whole question of women's access to labour market opportunities.  It should report to the Government later this year.  The group includes social partner representation, and the National Women's Council of Ireland.  The group's recommendations will assist the Government plan our strategy for the integration of women into all forms of employment, including self-employment, consistent with commitments in the programme for Government and Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With particular regard to training the general principle applied is that FÁS training programmes are open to all persons who are unemployed and seeking work.  However, priority of access is given to persons on the live register, regardless of gender.  The participation rate of women in FÁS courses is over 43 per cent and rising.  FÁS is also undertaking a number of <Col N="621" /> initiatives geared to the reintegration of women to the labour market.  These include &ldquo;return to work&rdquo; and &ldquo;enterprise training&rdquo; courses and a NOW, new opportunities for women, programme which aims to provide locally-based training in partnership with community groups.</P>
    <P>FÁS is also very conscious of the need for childcare facilities for women returning to work, and contributes over £5 million per annum to community-based childcare provision by way of support for community employment projects. Over 130 CE projects have such a childcare dimension.  Many of these facilities provide community-based childcare for women undertaking education or training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>A range of EU Community initiatives were adopted for the 1994-99 phase.  These included the ADAPT initiative dealing with technological change and the EMPLOYMENT initiative dealing with several specified socially excluded groups.  In Ireland, as in all other member states, operational programmes covering the implementation of both initiatives were then negotiated and agreed with the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EMPLOYMENT initiative aims to combat exclusion, disadvantage and inequality on the labour market.  It has four distinctive but interrelated strands.  HORIZON is targeted towards people experiencing difficulties on the labour market due to disability or other forms of social and economic disadvantage; Integra focuses on the reintegration into employment of people experiencing extreme disadvantage on the labour market; NOW promotes equality of opportunity for women; and Youthstart primarily seeks to address labour market disadvantage in respect of young people under 20 who leave the formal education <Col N="622" /> and/or systems poorly qualified or unqualified.</P>
    <P>Applicants for EMPLOYMENT funding self-select the strand most appropriate to the target group for which they seek project support.  The EMPLOYMENT initiative is being implemented in two phases.  The first public call for proposals was held in January-February 1995 which resulted in the receipt of 728 applications.  Following a rigorous selection process, 132 projects were approved for European Social Fund aid amounting to £26 million to operate in the period 1996 to 1997.  These projects provided training, guidance and other interventions to more than 25,000 people.</P>
    <P>As the strand which caters specifically for people with disability, HORIZON provided training and other interventions for 673 people in 1996, of which 334 were women.  By mid-1997, 553 women were among the 1,153 participants in HORIZON.  End of year figures are not yet available.</P>
    <P>Following the second call for proposals in January 1997, 447 aplications were received seeking approximately £120 million.  The total ESF budget available is approximately £33 million.  At this stage, the following number of projects have been approved for the period up to the end of 1999: HORIZON, 40; INTEGRA, 31; NOW, 32; and YOUTHSTART, 23.  In line with the equality of opportunity objective, almost all projects applying to HORIZON cater for both men and women.  In fact, two projects will cater exclusively for women.</P>
    <P>Only one organisation submitted applications dealing specifically with disability under NOW. Neither of its two proposals were recommended for funding by the broadly based and independent selection committee established to examine proposals.  During the assessment and selection phase for all project proposals submitted under the EMPLOYMENT initiative, consideration was given to the capacity of all projects to cater for people with disability.  It is, therefore, probable that women with disability will participate in a number of NOW projects but until participants have been recruited, it will not be possible to identify the number.</P>
    <P>ADAPT is a separate Community initiative supported by the European Social Fund, aimed at people in employment.  Its primary focus is on the preservation of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.  It aims to support and help organisations and workers to anticipate and prepare for industrial change.  In parallel with the EMPLOYMENT initiative, a public call for proposals was made in January 1995 and resulted in the receipt of 240 applications.  Forty-four proposals were approved for funding in the period 1996 to 1997 with a budget of approximately £8.8 million One project was funded under the &ldquo;Training Systems Development&rdquo; measure of the Operational Programme <Col N="623" /> and focused specifically on the employment needs of people with disabilities.  Its aim was to train personnel in mainstream employer organisations to equip them with the skills for training people with learning disabilities.  The project was completed in December 1997.</P>
    <P>A further call for project proposals in January 1996 resulted in the receipt of 152 proposals of which 32 have been approved for funding.  The total budget for the period is approximately £9.9 million.  Only one promoter submitted an application dealing specifically with disability.  This project was not recommended by the broadly based independent selection committee.</P>
    <P>The ADAPT initiative is aimed at people in employment and does not distinguish between able-bodied and disabled people.  The various calls for proposals and other publicity for both EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT since 1994 identified the various strands such as HORIZON for the disabled under which funding was available. Equally, as evidenced by the fact of projects involving the disabled in other stands of EMPLOYMENT and the ADAPT initiatives there was and is no barrier against such projects.</P>

      <P>My Department currently operates two schemes of grant aid for investment under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99, promoting the growth of trees in both urban and amenity areas as follows.</P>
      <P>The urban woodland scheme is confined to local authorities and to land owned or managed by them.  It covers the improvement of existing woodlands, the establishment of new woodlands and the provision within such woodlands of facilities such as paths, walks, play areas, seats, signs etc.  Community involvement, which has been shown in other countries to be vital to the success of urban woodland projects is being particularly encouraged.</P>
      <P>The amenity woodland scheme is open to other woodland owners and covers the improvement of existing woodlands and the provision of recreational or amenity facilities in relation to e.g. equestrian activities, walking, rambling, orienteering and a variety of activity sports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also part funds the Tree Council of Ireland who organise National Tree Week which, is taking place this week, 1-7 March.  Tree week is a celebration of all aspects of trees and <Col N="624" /> woodlands and involves local communities, schools, public bodies, the corporate sector and voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Statutory controls on lobster fishing have been introduced in recent years to underpin voluntary stock conservation, management and development initiatives.  Specifically, the sale of lobsters below a specified minimum size has been banned and lobsters which are &ldquo;V notched&rdquo; must be returned to the sea for breeding purposes.</P>
      <P>Proposals have been made by certain sections of the lobster fishing industry that additional statutory controls in the form of specific lobster fishing licences should be introduced as a further protection and incentive.  While I am sympathetic to the underlying objective, there are complex legal and practical implications inherent in this approach.</P>
      <P>These are being assessed by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and BIM and I assure the Deputy that there will be detailed ongoing consultation with lobster fishermen with the aim of working out an agreed and achievable framework within which the industry can go forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are regular departmental contacts and meetings with the EU Commission by means of which the Commission is kept fully aware of developments on the light rail project. In some cases these are initiated by departmental staff and in other cases by Commission officials. The most recent meeting was on 9 February 1998.</P>
      <P>In addition, the formal monitoring committees, on which the Commission is represented, are kept up to date with developments in relation to the transport projects.  The position on light rail was outlined at the monitoring committee for the Community Support Framework (CSF) on 29 July 1997 and on 11 December 1997 and at the meeting of the monitoring committee for the operational programme for transport on 23 October 1997.</P>
      <P>I also briefed Commissioner Wulf-Mathies in relation to the project at my meeting with her on 28 November last.</P>
      <P>There are also regular meetings of the monitoring group for the light rail project which is chaired by my Department and on which the Commission is represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my statements to this House on light rail I have always made it clear that there are timetables to be met in qualifying for EU aid.  Under EU Structural Funds regulations only expenditure incurred up to end 2000 is eligible for grant assistance but the Commission has a discretion to extend this deadline for a further year.  Such a decision would facilitate the full draw down of EU funds in respect of the project, based on a completion date of the end of 2001.  There is also <Col N="627" /> a requirement that commitments be entered into before the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>As I have stated previously in replies to parliamentary questions, a review of EU funding allocated for the light rail project will take place shortly when the results of the study of the underground option are available.  Among the issues which will be taken into account in the review will be the likely implementation timetable for the light rail system and the optional use of the EU funding in the period to 2001.</P>

      <P>There was no service on the Dublin-Donegal public service obligation air route during the period 13 February-1 March 1998.  This was due to the cessation of services by the air carrier which had been operating the route, EI Air Exports Ltd., trading as Ireland Airways, following the appointment by the High Court of a provisional liquidator to that company.</P>
      <P>Following examination of a number of offers submitted by airlines to my Department for operation of the route up to the end of 1998, I decided to award the operating contract for the route to Aer Arann.  Service on the route by Aer Arann started on 2 March 1998.  This is an interim arrangement pending the holding of a competition under EU regulations to secure an operator for the route.</P>

      <P>The hygiene and public health requirements in the plants referred to by the Deputy for which my Department has responsibility are set down in EU legislation.  The legislation does not provide specifically for E.coli testing.  However, there is a general requirement on the operators of the plants to observe general hygiene standards which are such as to prevent E.coli contamination. There is also a legal obligation on the operators to carry out microbiological testing of product to ensure that it is fit for human consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently published regulations under the Abattoirs Act, 1988, which prevent the sale to slaughter plants of cattle which fail to meet the minimum standards of cleanliness.  The purpose <Col N="631" /> of this measures it to reduce the risk of E.coli and salmonella contamination within the plant.</P>
    <P>I have also provided funded this year for a wide ranging E.coli testing programme at all levels throughout the beef industry.  This testing is being targeted during the period of increased risk.</P>
    <P>As regard salmonella, my Department implements a testing programme in the poultry plants under its control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners as follows.  Since the enactment of the 1995 legislation, 2,622 companies have identified themselves as neither resident in the State nor carrying on a trade in the State followng receipt of notices from Revenue.  A breakdown of the territories in which the central management and control is carried out could not be provided in the time available. However, from a sample of cases examined the following territories were indicated &mdash; Jersey, Sark, Isle of Man, Turkey, Cyprus, Hong Kong and a number of Eastern European countries.</P>
      <P>Section 58 of the Finance Act, 1995 came into law on the passing of the Finance Act, 1995 with effect from 6 April 1995.  No prosecutions have been taken against Irish registered non-resident companies for failure to comply with the section. Unless a company declares itself to be non-resident, there is no way of identifying it as such from the details filed with the Companies Registration Office.  The companies which identify themselves as non-resident are likely to do so as part of their compliance with section 58 of the Finance Act, 1995.  Non-resident companies which do not identify themselves as such cannot be distinguished from other companies on the register.  The issue is further complicated by the fact that companies on the register which are not non-resident have no obligation to furnish information until such time as they commence to carry on a trade.  In any event, because of the very nature of the non-resident companies, there is usually nobody in the State against whom prosecutions can be initiated.</P>
      <P>Because it is not possible for Revenue to know the residence status of a newly registered company, there are limitations on their ability to monitor compliance with the section.  I would point out, however, that a formal notice requesting information under the section is issued by Revenue to all newly registered companies. These notices are issued according as Revenue receive notifications, in batches from the Companies Registration Office of the incorporation of new companies.  As the Deputy will be aware the question of new measures in relation to the activities of non-resident companies is under active consideration.</P>

Previously, an executive officer competition was advertised in 1995, from which appointments are still being made.  At this stage, I would expect that the next open executive officer competition would be advertised next autumn.</P>
      <P>An open clerical assistant competition &mdash; clerical, typing and data entry &mdash; was advertised in 1994 and a clerical assistant &mdash; typing &mdash; competition in 1997.  An open clerical officer competition has not been held since 1986.  However, as a result of restructuring, a single clerical grade entitled &ldquo;clerical officer&rdquo; has replaced, <i>inter alia,</i> the grades of clerical assistant and clerical officer. It is envisaged that an open competition for positions in this clerical officer grade will be held this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the majority of social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes. Apart from the specific payments mentioned in the followng paragraph, all taxable social welfare payments fall within the provisions of Schedule E of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, previously the Income Tax Act, 1967, and before that, the Income Tax Act, 1918.  Consequently, the majority of social welfare payments have been taxable in the State from the date on which the payments were introduced.</P>
      <P>Disability benefit &mdash; DB &mdash; and occupational injury benefit became reckonable as income for tax purposes with effect from 6 April 1993, and unemployment benefit &mdash; UB &mdash; and pay-related benefit with effect from 6 April 1994.  The normal practice is that taxation applies in full to a payment from the date from which it becomes liable to tax.  However, in order to improve the position of those adversely affected by extending taxation to DB and UB, certain changes have since been introduced.  To assist families, the child dependant additions payable with both DB and UB were exempted from income tax from 6 April 1995. The first £10 per week of UB was disregarded for tax purposes also from 6 April 1995.  In the context of Partnership 2000 it was agreed that the first three weeks of DB in a tax year would be exempt from tax from 6 April 1997 and the first six weeks from 6 April 1998.</P>

      <P>The employment support scheme &mdash; ESS &mdash; enables people with a disability, whose work productivity is less than average, to secure employment by providing a subsidy to employers.  The scheme is administered by the National Rehabilitation Board &mdash; NRB &mdash; which selects suitable candidates for placement, undertakes the relevant productivity assessments and arranges for payment of the appropriate subsidy to employers. The current number of places taken up on the ESS is 388.  The number of applications for assistance under the ESS averages 13 per month, 1997 figures.  The average time to approve and activate applications for entry to the scheme is two weeks.</P>
      <P>The current budget for the employment support scheme for 1998 is £1,189,000.  There is no maximum amount of assistance in respect of any one person.  However, the NRB agrees with a prospective employer a subsidy level of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the going rate for the job; the rate of subsidy is based on the productivity level of the individual in question. Agreement, in principle, has been reached whereby the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will assume responsibility for the ESS.  This transfer of responsibility, which is subject to adequate transfer of resources, will ensure that the scheme is better placed to become integrated with the mainstream employment support measures offered by the State and a distinct separate measure from the medical model of supported work.  It is anticipated that mechanisms to provide additional funding to develop the scheme will be put in place in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the acute financial crisis affecting the Dublin branch of the Spina Bifida Society and of the fall-off in their ability to raise voluntary funding, in view of the competition from the national lottery and other difficulties; if his attention has further been drawn to its submission to the health board for the development of new services; and whether he can provide assistance to this invaluable organisation.</Quest>

      <P>Organisations such as the Dublin branch of the Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Association are funded by the health boards under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, in respect of services provided in the functional area of the relevant board. I note that the branch has already been in touch with the Eastern Health Board about the matter and that a meeting was held with senior health board officers on Monday last.  I understand that the parties have agreed to carry out a complete review of the role, work and financing of the organisation with a view to agreeing its core service activity and associated funding to ensure its future viability.</P>
      <P>In practice, it is difficult to assess the impact of the national lottery on charitable fundraising or to separate the national lottery impact from other effects such as the decline of popular appeal of some charitable purposes.  Some evidence suggests that public contributions to charitable bodies generally have continued to grow since the introduction of the national lottery.  Charities and the voluntary sector generally have been significant beneficiaries of lottery funding.</P>

      <P>I am making funding available to the Midland Health Board this year to enable it develop a new regional school of general nursing, which will be located in Tullamore General Hospital.  The establishment of the new school will facilitate the recruitment of staff for the Midland Health Board's nursing services.  It will also enhance the capacity of the board to provide continuing education and training opportunities for its nursing staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Midland Health Board is currently engaged in discussions with An Bord Altranais and Athlone Institute of Technology with a view to the new school having an initial intake of 20 student nurses to the general nursing registration/diploma programme in the autumn. When the new school is fully operational, there will be a total of 60 students on the programme <Col N="637" /> at any one time.  This will be in addition to the new nursing and other staff that will be appointed to the school in Tullamore.</P>
    <P>As the Midland Health Board has already forged close links with Athlone Institute of Technology, it is proposed that the board will work in partnership with the Institute in the development and delivery of the registration/diploma programme for student nurses.  The location for the delivery of the third-level lectures component of the programme is the subject of ongoing discussions between the board and the institute.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to introduce legislation requiring local authorities to produce local greenhouse gas inventories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of its commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC), Ireland submits annual national greenhouse gas inventories to the FCCC Secretariat. These are prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency, in accordance with the standard guidelines approved under the Convention which require that greenhouse gas emissions and removals are calculated on a national basis according to specified categories.  National greenhouse gas inventories for the years 1990-1994 and 1995 (provisional), which were prepared in <Col N="639" /> accordance with these guidelines, are contained in Ireland's Second National Communication under the UN FCCC, a copy of which was made available to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>As far as the transport sector is concerned, the national communication refers to measures being taken to improve the efficiency of the road and rail networks, promote public transport and other alternatives to the private car in major urban areas (including Dublin), and reduce the age profile and increase the fuel efficiency of private cars. It also discusses the DTI Strategy for Dublin which, when fully implemented, will secure a significant shift towards the use of public transport in the area.</P>
    <P>A consultancy study, commissioned jointly by the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Public Enterprise, to identify and evaluate the scope for intensifying existing, and developing additional, policies and measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions is expected to be completed shortly.</P>

In that capacity, the authority is responsible for issuing guidance and direction to local authorities and for allocating grants.</P>
      <P>The maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in their areas is a matter for the road authorities concerned, to be funded from their own resources supplemented by annual grants from my Department.  These grants are allocated subject to general conditions and guidelines as set out in the memorandum on grants for non-national roads 1996-1999, which issued to all road authorities in June 1996, and in subsequent circular letters.  As the Deputy will be aware, I recently allocated a record total of almost £200 million in non-national road grants to road authorities for 1998.</P>

      <P>The provisional outturn for expenditure under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme on rent and mortgage interest supplements in 1997 was £85.4 million broken down as follows: rent supplements, £75.3 million; mortgage interest supplements, £10.1 million.</P>

    <P>Bed and breakfast costs in relation to homeless people are met by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people, who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention, and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of last December 10,330 people were in receipt of a carer's allowance at a cost of over £36 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1990, the allowance has been improved and expanded progressively over the years.  As announced in the budget, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance is being increased from next June by £5, from £70,50 to £75.50 for those over the age of 66, and £3 for carers under 66 from £70.50 to £73.50.</P>
      <P>In addition, the budget also provided for three additional improvements for carers.  The first two of these are of a more technical nature and benefit a small number of people viz. a disregard of non-national disability pensions up to the maximum level of the old age contributory pension in assessing means and the payment of carer's allowance for six weeks after death to carers whose spouse was not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  The third improvement is the provision of a free travel pass to all those in receipt of carer's allowance in their own right, which potentially could be of benefit to all carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently reviewed the operation of the condition whereby the carer is required to provide the care-recipient with full-time care and attention and have decided to adopt a more flexible approach.  Carers may now attend educational or training courses or participate in voluntary or community based activities for around ten hours per week provided the carer makes adequate provision for the care-recipient in his-her absence. <Col N="645" /> These new arrangements come into effect immediately.</P>
    <P>In its &ldquo;Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo; the Government is committed to:</P>
    <P>&mdash; progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.</P>
    <P>In line with these commitments, an overall review of the carer's allowance is being carried out within my Department.  This review is considering the purpose and development of the scheme, both in terms of its current operation and its future development.  It will also examine the potential for the development of provision for carers through the social insurance system and the role of the private sector.  The review is expected to be completed by the middle of this year and it will be published.  Any changes in the scheme, such as a relaxation of the means testing arrangements, would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Last November I established a steering group, representative of the Partners in Education, to report to me on the establishment of a Teaching Council in Ireland.  The steering group is being assisted in its work by a technical working group.  Both groups are being chaired by Dr. Séamus McGuinness of Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The technical working group is preparing its report for the consideration of the steering group. It has to date met on nine occasions, and are meeting on a weekly basis.</P>
      <P>In deciding the composition of the groups I was careful to ensure that all the major partners in education were given an opportunity to be involved in this important work.  Accordingly, it has not been necessary for the groups to request additional submissions.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that the group's report would be available to me in the coming months.  I look forward to it proving a valuable basis for drafting legislation in this important area.</P>

      <P>The deeds of variation provide for the establishment of representative boards of management in primary schools.  They arose out of an agreement reached between the representatives of patrons of schools, parents, management bodies and teacher unions on the governance of primary schools.  I have accepted that agreement.  As part of the agreement the partners provided the broad outlines of documents, draft deeds of variation, which would be necessary to give legal effect to their agreement and which would form part of the legal instruments relating to the establishment and operation of schools.  These documents were then referred by my Department to the Attorney General's Office for consideration of legal and constitutional issues and an officer of the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office drafted the documents in proper legal format.</P>
      <P>Copies of the documents are available from my Department without charge.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the reason there is a shortage of primary teachers, particularly for the purposes of substitution, in view of the fact that the enrolment level of primary schools is known four years in advance, the teacher training course is of three years duration and the number of substitute teachers required each year is relatively stable; the way in which his Department is responding to the shortage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of variable factors impinge on the relationship between the supply and demand of primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The supply of available teachers is influenced by factors such as the participation rate of teachers on career breaks and job-sharing schemes, the number of teachers opting for retirement before reaching age 65 and the overall absentee rate within schools due to sickness and maternity.  The number of pupils, which determines the level of demand for teachers, is affected by factors such as birth rate fluctuations, emigration and immigration and the age at which parents decide to send their children to school.</P>
      <P>The retention of the entire demographic dividend within primary schools under a policy initiated by my predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke, has also had a significant positive impact on the availability of trained teachers.</P>
      <P>My recent decision to grant recognition to primary teachers who trained outside this State to teach in special schools, and to teach special classes in mainstream schools without the requirement for the Irish language qualification, will provide a new source of trained primary teachers.</P>
      <P>The supply panel scheme is an important mechanism to enable boards of management to obtain the services of qualified teachers to cover mainly short-term absences on certified sick leave.  In January of this year, this scheme was extended by the addition of a further 30 teachers employed in 11 schools throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The overall supply of teachers will be examined very carefully in the context of determining the intake to the colleges of education for the 1998-99 school year.</P>

      <P>The information available in my Department indicates that there are 272 sets of legal proceedings where I, as Minister, am a defendant. These cases are at various stages in the legal process and some will have effectively lapsed due to failure of the plaintiffs to proceed with them.</P>
      <P>No record is kept of cases in which legal action is threatened.  There would be very little benefit in keeping such records as there are many instances where litigation is threatened but not proceeded with.  Where the matter at issue is the provision of education facilities or an appropriate standard of education, my Department makes all reasonable efforts, in consultation with parents and school authorities, to meet the needs of children. Most cases are resolved in this way, without recourse to litigation.</P>
      <P>Of the 272 cases referred to above, 48 relate to the provision of education facilities or an appropriate standard of education.</P>
