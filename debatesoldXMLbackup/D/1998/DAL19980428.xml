    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a short meeting with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies on 20 April last, at which we discussed the Northern Ireland Agreement and the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Agenda 2000 proposals, I outlined to the Commissioner the requirement for appropriate transitional agreements on Structural and Cohesion funding, and our strong objections to the agriculture proposals as they currently stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his short reply; it must have been a brief meeting.  Will he confirm that the Commissioner gave him an ultimatum that this country would lose £140 million in funds if the Government did not make a decision on Luas and proceed with it forthwith?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner did not lay down any ultimatum to me.  The meeting lasted an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>If no ultimatum was given, was the matter discussed with the Commissioner and, if so, what was the nature of that discussion?  Given that the report of the expert group was delivered to the Government only last Friday, how is it in a position to make a decision and hold a press conference today if the matter did not arise with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies?  Is that why it is coming up so quickly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, there is a press conference on the matter this afternoon and perhaps she should wait to see what happens there.</P>

      <P>Why is this House not more entitled to know than the media?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that when decisions are made the House will know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of all the issues in the Community Support Framework were discussed with the Commissioner.  In answer to a question from me, she stated it was important that all the outstanding issues should be dealt with for the June meeting, in so far as that is possible, because it is the Commission's wish to deal with those issues this year so that these matters can be completed in the course of 1999.  An extension past next year is only available for certain limited projects and the Commissioner and the Government are anxious to process as many of these issues as we can.  For the Deputy's information, there are between eight and ten items which we must try to complete over the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Taoiseach's discussion with the Commissioner, did she raise the funding for the proposed national conference centre?  Did she or her officials express concern about the decision-making process on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue was raised in terms of making sure we are in a position to take up the funding available.  I reported to the Commissioner that we were having delays in the ongoing process but we did not discuss the contents of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach indicate the ten or so items outstanding which need to be clarified between now and next year and which could possibly be carried beyond 1999 when the CSF ends?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have none of the information with me but among them are Luas, the conference centre and three or four sewerage schemes.  The others are all environmental matters which have to be completed.  Most of the delays would be as a result of third party objections or a consultation process which has not been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Commissioner confirm or indicate strongly that it might be the Commission's view that, in the event that internal administrative arrangements led to failure to execute a decision on the conference centre, the £25 million available from the EU could not be diverted to another project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get into the detail of that decision but my reading is that the money is for that project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If, for whatever reason &mdash; as two <Col N="115" /> Administrations have been involved, I am not inclined to kick footballs &mdash; forces which are not democratically represented in this House fail to make a clear decision that is not subject to a legal challenge, will the Taoiseach confirm that the European Commission has indicated clearly that the £25 million cannot be veered towards any other project, be it roads, sanitary services or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken the view on these projects that the moneys should be used for the purposes for which they were approved.  It will be open to us to make the case to the Community Support Framework review committee in June that they should be altered but that is not a practice of which I am supportive.  The moneys were negotiated for specific purposes and they should be used for those purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will accept that it is stretching credulity to ask us to accept that he did not discuss the Luas project with the Commissioner given that it was one of the 12 items included in the basket of items&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me help the Deputy.  It was indicated that the report on the Luas project would be made available shortly.  That is what the discussion amounted to.  The report was made available at the weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach ask about the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for clarifying the matter.  He appeared to indicate that it was not discussed.  In light of the admission that the Luas project was discussed, did he undertake with the Commissioner to look at the question, as the previous Government did, of extending the Luas project to Ballymun?  Does the Government's decision of this morning include a timetable for the extension of the Luas project to that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioner for Regional Affairs, Monika Wulf-Mathies, was in Dublin on Monday to meet a number of Ministers. She asked if she could meet me and I was delighted to do so.  She went through in great detail with relevant Ministers the various issues that she wished to discuss.  The greater part of the time I spent with her was taken up with a discussion of the Northern Ireland Agreement and the Commission's role.  Everything else was dealt with briefly.  At a press conference presently the Minister for Public Enterprise will outline the proposals in the report on the Luas project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Why can she not outline them here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be clear to the Deputy that there are still matters under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach or the Minister for Public Enterprise, as a result of today's Cabinet meeting, been in further contact by telephone with the Commissioner or her offices to advise of the Government's conclusions on the report on the Luas project?  When will the report be made available to Members of the House?  Will the Taoiseach agree that it is in violation of the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act that it has not yet been circulated and acknowledge that it is a contempt to the House that the announcement will be made outside it at 3 p.m.?  Will he accept that it will be the first time in world history that a train will have done a U-turn?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is on the wrong track.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In believing that the Government received the report yesterday &mdash; most of my colleagues received it today &mdash; the Deputy is probably giving us more credit than we deserve for the speed of our decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Have decisions been made today regarding what is to happen the Luas project?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue arises directly out of the Taoiseach's reply; as the Taoiseach's reply dealt with it, I am entitled to raise it as a supplementary. I will be very brief.  Will the Taoiseach advise the House whether the Government decided today to give the green light to Luas and to get it back on track or has it derailed the project? The House is entitled to know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ruled that specific questions on Luas do not relate to this question, which is about a meeting with the EU Commissioner. Only supplementary questions arising from that question are allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to be argumentative but it is my understanding that it is a long-standing rule of the House that when the Taoiseach deals with an issue in a direct reply, supplementary questions can be asked on the issue which he raised.  That is all I am trying to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is, in any case, offering to reply on the issue.  We are entitled to know whether this project is still on track or whether it has been derailed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not agree with the way in which the House operated.  I know it is not your wish, Sir, for Taoisigh to do what was done by previous Taoisigh, which was to stick strictly to the reply and give no further information.  If the House wished me to do that I would give far shorter replies and the Ceann Comhairle, would then have no option but to apply the precedent of the House, which would mean I would not have answered any of the questions I have answered during the past 17 minutes.</P>
      <P>The Government discussed the matter referred to by Deputy Shatter today.  Most members of the Government received the report either last night or this morning.  The Government decided today on the decision making process it will operate on this matter.  The report will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Did the Taoiseach discuss with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies the burning issue of Objective 1 status for the west and the Border counties?  Did he apprise her that when in Opposition he gave a clear, unequivocal commitment to having the west and the Border counties included in Objective 1 status?  Did he apprise her that in the <Col N="118" /> Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, he said Objective 1 status would be sought for the west, the Border regions and all other rural areas suffering from population decline for the post 1999 period?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That the Taoiseach's colleague announced a deep sea port for the west and north-west region last week is not relevant to Commissioner Wulf-Mathies but in regard to the Commissioner controlling the funding for the national conference centre, the independent product management board was unable to deal with the conclusion of the tender submitted because of lack of clarity on account of a Government decision last year about disposal of lands in the Dublin docklands area and a letter from CIE which indicated it had the right to dispose of land. Has that matter been resolved?  It was the stumbling block which prevented the independent board from arriving at a conclusion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In my address to the GAA at its annual congress on Saturday, 18 April, I conveyed my desire to see an end to all contention between the GAA and the security forces in Northern Ireland.  At a time when we are engaged in the process of bringing people of all traditions closer together and seeking to encourage the development of a new shared sense of identity, it is now opportune for both sides to make positive gestures in line with the spirit of the recently concluded agreement.</P>
      <P>I know the GAA &mdash; an organisation which has played such a key role in the unfolding chapters of our history &mdash; will not be found wanting. Neither have I made any secret that I would like to see the entire grounds of the Crossmaglen Rangers GAA Club restored to them by the security forces.  My views on this matter have been conveyed to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mowlam, who has indicated that an early meeting will take place on the issue.  In the context of the Agreement and the programme of de-escalation of security measures for which it provides, including the removal of security installations, such a move would be a positive step.  The time is now right and I look forward to positive outcomes in both cases.</P>
      <P>It has not been the practice, and I do not intend now to report on my meetings with members of the Diplomatic Corps &mdash; such as my recent meeting with ambassador Jean Kennedy-Smith.  I do not propose to comment further on the meeting other than to say that I availed of the opportunity to convey to the ambassador the Government's deep appreciation of her personal contribution to the peace process and to thank her for her exemplary service as ambassador.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat confused as to why Question No. 2 was included with two questions about the GAA pitch at Crossmaglen.  Was that <Col N="120" /> matter discussed with the US ambassador?  Will the Taoiseach indicate the content of his discussions with the ambassador regarding a possible visit by President Clinton to this country, either before or after the referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long standing practice in the House that the Taoiseach does not give details of meetings with the diplomatic corps.  I met the ambassador at her request to brief her in detail regarding the Northern Ireland Agreement and other meetings she knew I had both at the time of and after the Agreement.  I do not wish to report on those.</P>
      <P>I answered a question on the possibility of a visit by President Clinton last week.  Mr. Jim Steinberg visited the Department this morning and met the secretary general and others.  He has also visited Northern Ireland and will report back to the President.  I consider it unlikely that the President will visit here before 22 May.  I am not sure what will happen after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach recently raised with the relevant British authorities the continued use by the British Army of Crossmaglen Rangers GAA grounds on the basis that alternative areas in the vicinity of Crossmaglen not owned or used by the GAA could provide the British military authorities with the type of facilities they need?  Will he agree its occupation of that ground is tantamount to a continuous provocation by the British Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I have continuously raised this issue.  Last summer the view was that if a further ceasefire was implemented the matter would be looked at and when the ceasefire was announced the view was that if we moved towards an agreement it would certainly be given consideration.  I have continued to raise this issue at all levels and I table it as an agenda item when we are going through the list.  It is an appropriate time now to address it.</P>
      <P>The Crossmaglen Rangers Club is very successful, undertakes a great deal of activities for young people in the community and involves people who have never been involved in violent activities. In spite of all the difficulties, the members have gone about their every day business, but this is affecting the development of their club.  I and previous Governments have pointed this out to the British authorities at all levels and through the Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam, who has been as helpful as she can be but this is ultimately a security decision for the GOC of the forces in Northern Ireland in conjunction with the RUC. The circumstances exist for them to consider alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Quinn will be aware, the argument that has been used for a long time is that not alone has the British Army taken up the site, but there has been considerable excavation of it and other developments of which nobody knows the <Col N="121" /> extent, but it is commonly felt this is not as simple a post as it would seem from the Crossmaglen Rangers pitch.  I hope they can move to an alternative site as that would be helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I misunderstood the Taoiseach and I want him to clarify the position, but can I take it from what he said that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that ultimately a decision on the utilisation of this site is exclusively a matter for the GOC of the British Army and the Secretary of State or any other member of the British Cabinet has no control over the British Army as to whether it squats on this land as distinct from any other land that may meet the same operational needs?  Is the British Army acting unilaterally in this and is it the case that the British Cabinet has no control in directing it to move off this site?  Is that what the Taoiseach told me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that for the past 30 years operational decisions on these matters, particularly this matter which has been raised by so many people, have been a matter for the GOC. There has been political will among some Secretaries of State down through the years to move this on, but there has never been a compromising position from GOCs.  If we are to make progress in this area, we need the co-operation of the Secretary of State, the head of the RUC and the GOC for Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the Secretary of State, has the Taoiseach discussed this matter directly with the British Prime Minister at any stage?  Will he seek a time frame for the removal of this British Army outpost?  Did he give a commitment to the Secretary of State during the course of his discussions that if the British Army removes this outpost he will request the GAA to remove Rule 21 from its constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this issue with everybody in authority, including the British Prime Minister.  A meeting is due to take place shortly at which I hope we can make some progress, but I do not want to set any time limits.  I have not had any discussions at any time about Rule 21 with the British Government or any of its officials.  I am not in a position to make any commitments about Rule 21 which is entirely a matter for Cumann Lúthchleas Gael and its members.  It is none of my business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that Rule 21 is a stand alone measure?  Irrespective of what happens regarding the position in Crossmaglen, does he accept that Rule 21 in its current form is unacceptable and that until the <Col N="122" /> GAA constitution is changed, Rule 21 casts a cloud over the Gaelic Athletic Association in the Republic and beyond?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy obviously has not listened to me.  I said that Rule 21 is a matter for Cumann Lúthchleas Gael.  I understand it will hold a conference at the end of May to discuss it. I stated in response to Deputy Deenihan that there is no connection in my mind, or the minds of any officials to whom I spoke, with the issues that arise in Crossmaglen.  Rule 21 may be changed or not changed by the members of Cumann Lúthchleas Gael.  It is not a matter for me.  I have no right to trade off the rules of a national organisation and it would be entirely wrong of me to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the continued occupation by the British army of the Crossmaglen Rangers' pitch is a provocation and an insult not only to the members of the GAA in Crossmaglen but also to the organisation's members throughout the island and particularly in the North?</P>
      <P>Am I correct that the Taoiseach agrees that any link between leaving Crossmaglen Rangers' pitch and any other matter, such as Rule 21, would be an insult to the members of the GAA?  The occupation of the pitch is such an insult and a provocation that it should end at the earliest possible moment irrespective of any other matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy regarding the second part of his question.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's other point, as I said to Deputy Quinn, it would be extremely helpful to the entire community and the membership of the GAA nationally, particularly the members of Crossmaglen Rangers, if after all these years the British army found somewhere else to locate its outpost.  I am not in a position to comment on whether it believes it requires the outpost for security reasons.  However, it would helpful if it found another location in the vicinity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the first three days of the operation of the Act, Tuesday, 21 April to Thursday, 23 April, my Department received two requests in writing <Col N="123" /> for information and two telephone requests for application forms.</P>
    <P>The number of staff allocated to deal with requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act in my Department is 14 key decision makers across the divisions in my Department mainly at assistant principal officer level, one executive officer, who is the Freedom of Information liaison officer and who is responsible for receiving and monitoring the requests, one assistant secretary and one principal officer responsible for the internal review procedure. The staff involved will carry out these functions within existing staff allocations and additional staff have not been recruited specifically for the operation of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>It remains to be seen over the next few months whether there will be a requirement for additional staff resources.  It is too early to measure the level of requests at this stage or to anticipate the volume of requests that may be received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Did any of the four requests relate to information about the Office of the Attorney General or the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  Will the Taoiseach outline what restrictions are placed on information about those offices?  To what extent was an effort made in the few days before 21 April to close off files so that they would not be available to the public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information whatsoever that any effort was made to close off files; certainly nothing was brought to my attention.  I do not have the details of the two requests, but if the Deputy wishes I will get them.  In terms of the conditions for the Attorney General's office, they are as per the legislation and the guidelines.  I have a note on that which I can give the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is responsible to the House to answer questions on the offices of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Is he aware of what he can or cannot tell the House regarding the information those offices may give to members of the public? That is a crucial area of policy of which the Taoiseach should be aware and his back up notes should have that information.  He has been asked how many times this information has been requested.</P>

      <P>The precise information requested by the Deputy is not readily available.  The CSO Farm Structure Survey collects data on the farm workforce and relevant data are available since 1980.  Farmers are asked to classify whether farmwork is their sole occupation, major occupation or subsidiary occupation.</P>

    <P>I propose to circulate two tables in the Official Report.  The first table shows the number of full-time and part-time farmers in 1980, 1991 and 1995.  The table shows that in 1995 there were 152,909 farmers in the State, 101,145 of which were full-time and 51,763 part-time.  In this table, <Col N="126" /> farmers who indicated that farmwork was their sole occupation have been classified as full-time farmers, while those who indicated that farmwork was their major or subsidiary occupation have been treated as part-time farmers.  It should also be noted that someone who indicates that farming is the sole occupation may not be fully occupied throughout the year.</P>
    <P>The total number of farmers shown in the first table is classified by age group in the second table, although the precise categories requested by the Deputy are not available for the years in question.</P>

      <P>In 1980, there were 222,655 full-time and part-time farmers and by 1995 the figure had fallen to 152,909.  I have some other interesting figures which show the age profile of farmers is changing.  There were 17,000 farmers under the age of 35 in 1980, while there are now 20,000 under the age of 35.  In round figures, there were over 47,000 farmers over the age of 65 in 1980, while there are now 32,000.  The numbers are falling, as is the age profile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of the Cabinet committee is to give political direction and leadership and to demonstrate the collective commitment of the Government to dealing with problems of social exclusion.  The committee is meeting on a monthly basis to assess progress on the strategies being employed to deal with poverty and disadvantage, namely, the national anti-poverty strategy, the national drugs strategy and the Local Urban and Rural Development Operational Programme, and resolve any policy or organisational problems which might inhibit an effective response.</P>
      <P>During the latter part of 1997, the committee reviewed the findings of relevant Ministers on the extent of the needs of young people in the most disadvantaged areas, particularly those areas where a serious drug problem exists.  As a result of proposals subsequently submitted to Government, a programme for young people at risk has been established, the centrepiece of which is a Young People's Facilities and Services Fund to which £30 million is being provided over the next three years.  This fund will be used to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in severely disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>At least £20 million from the fund will be targeted at those areas particularly affected by the heroin problem.  The fund is additional to the £10 million already approved by Government towards the implementation of the action plans of the 13 local drug task forces.</P>
      <P>The detailed arrangements for the operation of the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund have been considered by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs and an announcement will be made shortly on the guidelines for the operation of the fund in the drugs task force areas.</P>
      <P>As a further measure to ensure the co-ordination of measures to support young people at risk, the Government has appointed my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to be Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in addition to Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the guidance of the Cabinet committee, the secretariat of the national anti-poverty strategy in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has sought and received baseline documents from Government Departments outlining the policy areas within their remit which impact on social inclusion.  Work has commenced on identifying opportunities for co-operation between Departments across these areas.  Work is currently continuing on the preparation of guidelines <Col N="128" /> for proofing policies for their impact on poverty. A discussion document is being drafted and the national anti-poverty strategy interdepartmental committee is due to meet with the social partners to progress the issue.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that a considerable amount of work needs to be done in raising awareness about the causes, nature and extent of poverty in Ireland.  Accordingly, an information and public education strategy has been approved to address this need.  In tandem with this, a training programme has been organised for departmental national anti-poverty strategy liaison officers.</P>
    <P>In the areas of local development, the committee has focused on the need to enhance the effectiveness of local initiatives by securing greater co-ordination and integration in the delivery of State services in deprived areas.  In this context, the committee has mandated the interdepartmental policy committee on local development, chaired by me, to launch a pilot integrated services project.</P>
    <P>The aim of this project is to develop new procedures to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by statutory authorities to the needs of communities with the greatest level of disadvantage.  It is the Government's intention that a successful model evolved during this project will be extended to other urban areas of major disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a number of supplementary questions and I hope the Chair will give me the time to pursue them.  When will money be available from the £30 million provided by the Government?  In other words, how soon will the draft guidelines be finalised, presented to Government and applications sought for use of that money?  Will the Minister of State indicate if the baseline documents have been submitted by all Departments and which Departments, if any, are outstanding?  Is it intended to place these documents in the Oireachtas Library so that Deputies can see the work these Departments are doing in relation to the national anti-poverty strategy?  In relation to the pilot project and the delivery of integrated State services, has it been decided where that project will be established and for how long it will run?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">

      <P>With regard to the £30 million fund, the guidelines have been approved by the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion.  I will be making an announcement on that shortly.</P>
      <P>Some baseline documents have been received but I do not have the detail requested by the Deputy.  I will provide that by way of a separate response.</P>
      <P>The pilot project is being developed by the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development which I chair and I am responsible for reporting the progress of the pilot project to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion.</P>

Another is the Fatima Mansions flat complexes. There is one in the north inner city.  The fourth is in Togher in Cork.  That information has been freely available.</P>

      <P>I intend to ask a supplementary.  It strikes me that, since the Freedom of Information Act came in, the Government has adopted a policy of giving us as little information in the House as possible and forcing us to use the freedom of information legislation to get information that was heretofore given in this House.  I have a specific question for the Minister of State.  Within the past two or three weeks, an advertisement was placed in the newspapers under the banner of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation with a view to setting up yet another expert group to deal with the use of money in areas of disadvantage, in tackling drug addiction etc.  Where does the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation <Col N="132" /> come in under the programme on social inclusion and drugs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>That issue is based in the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation because I am Minister of State at that Department.  The advertisement referred to by the Deputy relates to our proposals to carry out an evaluation of the National Drugs Strategy and the local drugs task forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>In his initial reply the Minister of State said that the purpose of the Cabinet sub-committee was to give political direction and leadership.  In view of that, could the Minister of State give us the Cabinet sub-committee's assessment of the extent of the heroin problem, in particular in Dublin?  Is it getting worse or better? What is the Cabinet's sub-committee's assessment of the number of people addicted to heroin in Dublin?  Is it, as reported recently, at an all time high of 12,000?  Are the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána represented on the Cabinet sub-committee and what is their assessment of the level of supply of heroin in Dublin?  What changes in strategy, if any, have they introduced since the Government took office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is represented on the Cabinet sub-committee by its Minister.  The Deputy is well aware that no definitive figures are available from any quarter as to the total number of drug abusers but there are estimates of between 8,000 and 12,000.  It is a very difficult figure to compile because some abusers present for treatment but others do not, for one reason or another, and it is very difficult to track their numbers and compile an accurate figure.  I assure the House that, based on my report, the Government is fighting the misuse of drugs on all fronts.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has had recent success with the Garda Síochána making drug seizures and taking other actions with which the Deputy will be familiar.</P>
      <P>We are expanding the treatment services through our local drugs task forces by opening treatment centres, involving communities and empowering them, through the provision of resources, to fight against the scourge of drug misuse.  We are making progress because we are implementing the programmes put forward by the 13 local drugs task forces.  I have also indicated our attack on social exclusion and disadvantage. Areas of high disadvantage, with which the Deputy is very familiar, are often areas of high drug misuse, particularly heroin abuse.  I believe this Government is fighting back in a co-ordinated way on all fronts and with some success but we have a long way to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful if I indicated the general background against which the Government has to consider the current Garda pay claims.  Since 1987 successive Governments have followed a policy of pay moderation both in the private sector and in the public service where pay accounts for half of current public expenditure.  This policy, which has been embodied by consensus in the wider context of national programmes, has contributed in no small way to low inflation and improved international competitiveness and has restored order to the public finances.  As a result, Governments have been able to direct Exchequer resources towards improvements in services and reductions in taxation which have benefited the community as a whole.  The imperative to maintain this policy has become more pressing with our approaching accession to EMU.  Control must be maintained over public expenditure if we are to meet the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, which comes into operation on 1 January next year, and participate successfully in EMU.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy will argue with me about the success of the policies followed over the past ten years or so.  The current buoyant state of the economy is evidence in itself.  However, we cannot afford to become complacent about our recent economic growth.  The Celtic tiger can all too easily become a paper tiger if we depart from the sound economic policies and the national consensus approach which brought it into being in the first place.  Pay moderation has been such a key ingredient in our success that it is difficult even to comprehend a 39 per cent pay claim in the current economic environment.</P>
      <P>The guidelines adopted by the Government side in the negotiations with the Garda associations were dictated by the approach to PCW local bargaining for the generality of public service groups.  That is a reasonable and fair approach.  To go beyond it would risk a reopening of PCW deals already completed and that could have enormous consequences not only for public expenditure but also for the pay climate generally in the economy.  That is a road we cannot travel and it is unrealistic of any group to expect us to do so.  I am sure the Deputy will fully appreciate the implications of the situation from his own experience as Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>The offer of a 5.5 per cent increase to the associations was by reference to the general PCW local bargaining norm for the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> However, the offer also provided for ongoing discussions to explore what further possibilities could be identified from productivity and savings. On the invitation of the independent chairperson, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors has chosen to pursue this avenue but the Garda Representative Association has opted for industrial action instead.  The Government is extremely disappointed at the position adopted by the Garda Representative Association.  Management has indicated that it is available to continue discussions on the basis put forward by the chairperson.  I strongly urge the association to desist from its current action, which cannot be for the good of the force in the long run, and to resume discussions.  I am sure a solution which is fair to the members of the Garda Síochána and which acknowledges the interest of the community at large is possible.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he agree that the Government is reaping the whirlwind which it sowed prior to the last election, when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, then in Opposition, actively encouraged gardaí to submit extravagant claims and to take rigorous action against the Government of the day, and that the current Government's difficulty is that it is now seen by the GRA to be in breach of commitments it made prior to the election?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the situation which pertained prior to the last election.  The then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on justice, now the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, met with the associations.  I was Opposition spokesperson on finance and I remember well the carefully worded letter issued prior to the election to the Garda Representative Association and the other associations representing gardaí.  It is incorrect to say gardaí were given any indication we would go a certain route.</P>
      <P>During the course of that election campaign, various representations were made on a personal level and approaches were made to Fianna Fáil front bench members &mdash; myself and others &mdash; to deviate from that approach.  As the Deputy knows well, during the heat of an election campaign there is often the temptation for politicians, especially those in Opposition, to follow a route for political expediency, but we resisted that.  I am certain of that because as Opposition spokesperson on finance I was cognisant of what we would be likely to set off.  However, the previous Government made decisions which have a bearing on the current situation, and Deputy Noonan, the former Minister for Health, and Deputy Quinn, the former Minister for Finance and now Leader of the Labour Party, would know of some of those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gardaí with a case to make should return to the negotiating table.  A reasonable proposition was put forward by the independent chairperson, Mr. Brennan, last Saturday week.  The Association <Col N="135" /> of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors has returned to the table on that basis and I ask the Garda Representative Association to do likewise.</P>

Is he also aware that Fianna Fáil's director of elections in the last election campaign was effectively simultaneously running the Garda campaign?</P>

I am satisfied that my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, gave no such nods and winks to any of the Garda associations.  That is on the record and I am very clear about it.  It would have been far easier to go in the other direction but we did not go that way prior to the last general election.  I am certain of that.</P>

Is he aware the GRA claims it has a letter signed by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice stating that phase one of its negotiation process under the PCW will be completed without regard to any productivity agreement or changes in practice carried out by the GRA?  Is he further aware that it claims to have this letter in its headquarters in Phibsboro and rely on it for its negotiating stance?  It claims the Government is in breach of an agreement by not complying with the terms of the letter which I have no doubt was sent by Mr. Dalton with the full knowledge and compliance of the Minister and the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Representative Association could be in no doubt as to the Government's line in this regard.  People may ask why the Government has been so adamant on the matter.  As I outlined in my reply, it would be beyond comprehension to do anything else because, as pointed out by representatives of other public service unions at conferences last weekend, if the 39 per cent claim submitted by the GRA or anything above the PCW norm were conceded, it would set off a raft of claims.  Deputy Noonan will be aware from his time as Minister for Health that the agreement with the nursing associations was considered by other sectors in the public service despite the best efforts of the then Government to ring fence it.  As a trade union leader stated last week, if major concessions <Col N="136" /> were made on Garda pay, all bets would then be off in regard to pay in the public service. These realities must be known to the GRA.  It would be incorrect of me to give any other impression either inside or outside the House to the representatives of the GRA.  It is not possible for the Government to concede to anything like its demands.  It will be possible for the official side to resume negotiations only on the basis set out by Mr. Declan Brennan last Saturday week.  That is the only way the negotiations can continue. That offer has been accepted by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and I ask the Garda Representative Association to resume the talks on that basis.</P>

There is an equal obligation on the Minister to prevent the predicted chaos we will face next Friday when the majority of ordinary members of the Garda Síochána intend to ring in sick and leave citizens unprotected.  What does the Minister intend to do to ensure this chaos does not commence on Friday and continue on several subsequent days?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to engage in a policy of appeasement which will set off a raft of public sector pay claims that will take us back to the mid-1980s when we were effectively financially bankrupt.  Neither I nor the Government is prepared to do that.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that this is a serious matter in the ambit of overall Government economic policy.  I outlined in my reply the serious position that could arise if a pay claim of the order of magnitude sought by the Garda were conceded.  We are 16 months past the completion date for the PCW, but the gardaí are pursuing this claim under that agreement.  The GRA was one of the first groups to accept a settlement under the PCW.  However, because the average norm settled under the PCW turned out to be 5.5 per cent it has re-entered the negotiations, even though its claim was settled earlier. It is not possible for the Government to concede its claim.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Noonan appreciates the difficulty in this respect as it relates to the overall public finances.  In the interest of having a coherent economic policy and public sector pay policy, the Government cannot concede to anything like what the Garda Representative Association is seeking.  This matter can be resolved only on the basis of the formula put forward by Mr. Brennan last Saturday week. That is the only basis on which these negotiations can resume.</P>

The 1997 budget had not been disposed of by 1998 when the 1998 budget was introduced.  The Irish situation was reviewed during debates at the monetary committee.  The communiqué expressed the form of words which I have just outlined when it came to the March <Col N="139" /> revaluation.  This has been the procedure with all other member states' budgets.

There was not one meeting to discuss the Irish budgetary situation or that of any other member state.  There was no homing in on the Irish situation. What was under consideration for some time was the fact that the Irish spot rate of exchange was far from the central rate agreed previously and most other currencies were trading at or near their central rate.

He will be able to give this matter his full attention and speed up the process.  I hope that the Bill will be published before the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware from various Dublin Regional Authority publications and from a motion passed by Dublin City Council on 2 March of general concerns of the Dublin Regional Authority and Dublin local authorities about the possible implications of the European Commission's Agenda 2000 for structural funding in Dublin.  I understand that the concerns relate to the treatment of Dublin in the next round of <Col N="142" /> funding <i>vis-a -vis</i> other regions in Ireland and the ability to fund outstanding development needs in the Dublin area, including those of disadvantaged communities.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of preparing a national development plan for the period 2000-6, I have invited regional authorities, including the Dublin Regional Authority, to submit priorities to my Department by the end of next June for post-1999 Structural and Cohesion Fund investment in their regions. There is likely to be a considerable reduction in the global level of structural funding available to Ireland in the next round due to the significant improvement in Ireland's GDP <i>per capita</i> compared to the European average.  Eligibility for Objective 1 status for Structural Funds is confined to regions below 75 per cent of GDP and Ireland as a whole will be considerably in excess of this figure for the purposes of eligibility under the next round.  The necessity to maintain tight control on public expenditure and to observe the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact will also constrain the public contribution to funding in the next programming period.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to considering the position of those regions of Ireland which may still be below the 75 per cent criterion for Objective 1 status.  This consideration will have to take account of the fact that the Commission must agree to any change in the country's single region status and of the overriding objective of maximising Structural Fund transfers to Ireland as a whole under the next round.  I have asked the regional authorities in preparing their submissions to take account of these considerations, among other things, and to prioritise their investment proposals accordingly.</P>
      <P>When I receive the Dublin and regional authority submissions generally their relative merits will be carefully assessed as part of the planning process.  The actual level of structural funding for Ireland in 2000-2006 will not be known until the outcome of the negotiations involving the member states on the Commission's draft framework regulations and financial framework is known, probably next year.  The Government will not be in a position to finalise the national development plan until then.  It is the Government's intention that Dublin, with the other regions of Ireland, will benefit from Structural and Cohesion Fund investment in the next round, subject to the constraints I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister answered questions some months ago he seemed to indicate the Government was still pursing a policy of treating Ireland as one region for Structural and Cohesion Fund purposes.  Will he confirm the Government is pursuing the opposite policy and is seeking to retain Objective 1 status for, perhaps, three regions, to the obvious disadvantage of those areas in which roughly two-thirds of the population live?</P>

      <P>I have never given the definitive line the Government is likely to pursue because it has not yet decided on its strategy. What I have said on a number of occasions, inside and outside the House, is that the Government's objective in this round of Structural Funds will be to secure for Ireland the optimum level of funding. If that means going down the route of sub-regionalisation, subject to the Commission's agreement, that is the route the Government will go.  I explained outside the House, before Commissioner Wulf-Mathies came to Dublin some months ago and recently, that there are difficulties in going down the sub-regionalisation route. Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, when speaking after the publication of the regulations in mid-March, indicated her objections to the subregional route including devolved administration, regional structures and so on.  For the last round the whole country had Objective 1 status.  The Commission's proposals refer to Ireland as an Objective 1 region in transition.  The Government's objective is to conduct the negotiations on the basis of securing the optimum level of funding for Ireland.  We have not yet decided by what route to proceed but our decision will be based on the route we think will secure the greatest level of funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems the Minister is saying he and the Department would wish to take the route of sub-regionalisation but that he does not think the Commission will allow it.  Will the Minister agree, notwithstanding the fact that the average GDP per capita in Dublin may well be higher than the European average, that there are still centres and local communities in this city in which there is dire poverty?  That is a whole area which Structural and Cohesion Funds have not addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has highlighted a very important point that there are areas which are well below the average level of wealth in the Dublin area.  Many people are under the impression that one can pick and choose pockets and say that area is well below the average for the region, and well below the national average. It will not be possible to go down to those microlevels and sub-regionalise that type of distinction. Whether we go down the route of having Ireland treated as an Objective 1 country in transition or the route of sub-regionalisation, it will not be possible to pick and choose pockets as intimated by the Deputy.  It might be possible, subject to the Commission's agreement, to have some regions treated as Objective 1 regions.  I have said repeatedly that the Government's objective is to secure the maximum amount of funding and we will decide on the best way to achieve that when everything is on the table.  If the maximum amount of money that can be secured for Ireland is through having Ireland treated as a single region in transition, that is the route the Government will take.  If on the other hand, and subject <Col N="144" /> to agreement by the Commission, the sub-regionalisation route is the proper way to go to secure the maximum amount of funding, that is the route we will take.  When speaking on this matter I have always explained the difficulties of going down the sub-regionalisation route because it will have to be agreed to by the Commission. Commissioner Wulf-Mathies is against that route. It is early days in the negotiations and it will probably be well into 1999 before the Agenda 2000 package is finalised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that due to the decline in farm incomes many rural areas are suffering from the effects of depopulation and loss of competitiveness and as a result the IDA finds it difficult to encourage industrialists to set up in many of these regions?  Unless this disparity is offset in the next round of Structural Funds these areas will continue to lose their competitiveness. The strategy in the negotiations for the next round should be to ensure that areas which have fallen behind under the present programme have an opportunity to catch up.  There will be major problems if Dublin, the east coast, Limerick, Cork, Galway and Waterford continue to grow to the deprivation of the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there are many parts of the country where the levels of economic activity, wealth levels and deprivation are well below that for the rest of the country.  The National Development Plan should address many of those issues.  It continues to be the job of Government to skew investment in a particular plan to a particular region.  That is the job of Government notwithstanding the electoral pressures brought to bear on Deputies and administrators.  If there are regions which are not doing well it is the job of Government to divert resources to that region. We cannot look to Europe at all times and ask it to look after these regions.  The European model is to provide a certain sum but it is the Government's job to draw up plans on the basis of its priorities.  Everything is relative.  Were I to visit Deputy Deenihan's constituency I would be told that for certain parts of his county Objective 1 status is required.  I drove to and from Belmullet last night.  That is an area that needs a great deal of funding and prioritisation by the Government.</P>
      <P>People in Waterford say their area should be regarded as a special case also.  Deputy McDowell, who is rational, sane and takes an objective line on most of these matters, has made a great case for many parts of Dublin.  The Government must ultimately decide on its national plan, secure the maximum level of funding and divert it to the areas of the country with most need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 32, 44 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>Recent developments in the domestic and EU banking sectors, both in terms of competition and the regulatory environment, mean the State's policy in banking no longer requires it to be directly involved in the sector in an ownership capacity. Moreover, given the impact which EMU will have in terms of increasing competition within the sector, the <i>status quo</i> with regard to State ownership is not an option for ACC and ICC banks in the long-term.  It was against this background that the Government authorised me to enter into discussions with the boards, management and staff of these banks regarding their future including, in principle, the option of disposing of up to 100 per cent of the State's interest in the banks.  In setting out this position to the boards, management and staff unions, I also explained that any process for the disposal of the State's interest must be open, transparent and non-discriminatory.</P>
      <P>Following my initial meetings with the stakeholders in both banks in December, I received submissions from them and I hope shortly to discuss these submissions with them.  These submissions represent a valuable contribution to the process in which we are now engaged.  While there is much common ground between the parties, there are clear differences regarding the preferred option of each.</P>
      <P>To date, I have approached this matter in an open and inclusive way, engaging with the board, management and staff unions in each of the banks on the issues.  I appreciate the constructive response I have received to date and I hope that, with continuing good will and a clear appreciation for the issues concerning each of the parties involved, we can make good progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the specific proposal regarding a merger of ACC Bank and TSB Bank, I have not received any proposal from the trustees of TSB, which would be the first step in any restructuring <Col N="146" /> involving that bank.  Neither have I any indication that such a proposal is likely.  From previous questions I have answered in this House, Deputies will be aware that, under the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, it is the trustees alone who initiate a change in the status of the TSB and that I can only authorise a proposal coming from them subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>What is the present state of play in respect of ACC and ICC?  The Minister has been authorised to enter discussions and negotiations and to negotiate up to, in principle, a 100 per cent disposal of the companies, but where does it now stand?  Has it been set aside for the moment or is it being actively pursued?  Does he think he will be in a position before the end of this calendar year to bring forward proposals about the disposal of either or both of these institutions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I initiated these discussions I intimated I would like to have it out of the way by the end of this calendar year, but that was on the basis that we would probably have proposals from the staff side by the end of January, which was the position when I met all the stakeholders last December.  That did not prove possible and it was only recently that the final proposals came from one of the institutions on the staff side.  Various things held them up &mdash; they had to engage consultants and there were other difficulties.  Now we have proposals from all the stakeholders &mdash; the management of both institutions and staff and trade union interests &mdash; and it should be possible to progress further.  Recently I had discussions within the Department and in the next few weeks I will go back to all the stakeholders for further discussions.  I hope to advance the matter considerably before the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear in my reply and previously that the procedure must be open, transparent and non-discriminatory, which would get over the point of the Deputy's question &mdash; that is, after the disposal of ACC and ICC no one would be able to bring a legal case on the basis that he or she was not allowed to compete or make a proposal.  Nothing will be hidden in these proposals, not that anything could be these days. <Col N="147" /> The process will be open, we will have further discussions with the stakeholders now that all their proposals are on the table and advance the cause from there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it fair to say, therefore, that there are only two options &mdash; either the two banks are put up for tender or they are floated? If so, it is fanciful for the staff unions to raise notions of restructuring because the Minister cannot do it.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that this is a dispute about pay.  As regards the efforts which have been made to resolve it, following intensive discussions which I and officials of my Department had with the Garda associations late last year, a mechanism was found whereby Garda pay issues could be discussed.  The mechanism was related to the Government decision in late <Col N="148" /> November last to establish a steering group to implement the Garda SMI report.</P>
      <P>One of the tasks of the steering group was to oversee the bottom up review of the force, including numbers, structure, deployment and optimum garda-civilian mix.  Because of the priority of this task, a subcommittee was set up by the steering group to carry it out.  The chairman of the bottom up review committee, Mr. Declan Brennan, was to be a member of the steering group.  He was also to be appointed to chair discussions between officials and staff representatives on issues of pay.</P>
      <P>The discussions commenced, under the chairmanship of Mr. Brennan, just before Christmas. Following a number of meetings, the official side made an offer of a 5.5 per cent pay increase in separate discussions on 1 April l988 with the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors. Neither association was satisfied with the offer and withdrew from the talks.</P>
      <P>At their annual delegate conference on 7-8 April l998 the AGSI delegates decided to start a campaign of non co-operation with new developments and tasks not normally appropriate to their rank.  The GRA, separately, threatened a campaign of industrial action.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the pay talks subsequently invited the GRA and the AGSI to separate meetings to discuss developments.  Arising out of these contacts, the chairman made a recommendation that the offer to the associations be increased to 7 per cent stating that he was satisfied, based on discussions to that date, that productivity discussions due to take place would yield savings that would justify at that stage an increase to 7 per cent.  He recommended that an offer of this amount should form the basis for a resumption of talks.  His recommendation was accepted by the Minister for Finance and me on 18 April l998. Its substance was conveyed immediately to the general secretaries of both associations.</P>
      <P>The AGSI returned to the negotiating table on 23 April l998 and discussions on its pay claim have resumed.  However, the GRA decided not to return and current indications are that its executive has decided that a form of mass protest should be engaged in on 1 May l998 which would be aimed at seriously reducing the number of gardaí making themselves available for duty on that day.  No formal notification has been received either by the Garda Commissioner or my Department from the GRA as to the precise nature of the planned protest and there are no firm indications at this point as to the level of support any such protest may attract.  The Garda authorities are monitoring the situation closely and will gear their strategies for the provision of effective services to the public on 1 May l998 on the basis of their ongoing assessment of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and I are in constant contact with the Garda authorities and the pay negotiating teams are on standby for an immediate resumption of discussions should the GRA <Col N="149" /> decide to veer away from the serious course now contemplated and return instead to the negotiating table.  I have appealed in the past to the GRA to return to the negotiating table and I do so again now.  I hope Deputies on all sides of the House will join me in that appeal.  I am aware that all Members of the House and all rightminded people outside it would see it as an extremely grave development if members of the largest Garda association, for the first time in the distinguished history of the force, left their posts <i>en masse</i> leaving their fellow citizens without the level and quality of service which we all value, respect and need.  Traditionally, one of the greatest strengths of the force has been its relationship with the community it serves.  Members of the force should think long and hard about taking steps now which are designed to cause difficulties for that community and also for their colleagues in the force.</P>
    <P>It is in the nature of things that disputes of this kind are portrayed as a dispute between the Government of the day and a particular association but the Government's only concern in this matter is the public interest.  It would fail in its duty if it came to a settlement with a sector which would jeopardise the economic progress we have made.  That is what we are being asked to do. Other public service unions have made clear privately what they see as the inevitable implications of the Government adopting such an approach.  It is not in the long-term interests of the community, including members of the Garda and their families, that the economic progress we have made should be jeopardised in this way.</P>
    <P>Having appealed to the GRA to reconsider its planned protest, I appeal to Members of the House and those outside it who may have an influence on public opinion.  I ask that it be recognised that there are no easy solutions.  There is no doubt that, if the Government were to concede a further increase in the offer already made to the GRA while its members remain on protest outside the negotiating process, the damage to the economy would be enormous.  The Government cannot undermine the economic progress which has been achieved and maintained in recent years through the good sense and restraint shown by thousands of other workers and employers in the private and public sectors, progress which is designed to secure and has secured a better future for ourselves and our children.</P>
    <P>I ask also that it be made clear in commenting on this situation that there is still time for a calm assessment of the issues involved.  On the one hand, people can choose to go down the road of taking unprecedented disruptive action against the community which would be seen by many as out of all proportion with what is at issue and, unfortunately, undermining, for short-term reasons, the long and proud tradition of the Garda Síochána.  On the other hand, we can keep a sense of proportion and return to the negotiating table to see what progress can be made.</P>
    <P>I am sure many gardaí will see the sense of opting <Col N="150" /> for negotiation rather than confrontation. They are part of the community which they have served well.  They have a pay offer which is generous by any standard and they have the option of returning to the negotiating table.  What they cannot have is the concession of a pay deal while on protest and outside of the negotiating process when we know that the consequences of making that concession would be economic chaos.</P>
    <P>Members will appreciate that I cannot negotiate a settlement to the dispute across the floor of the House.  There will be limits, therefore, to what I will be able to say in answer to supplementaries. It would be helpful if the message came from all sides of the House that, while we recognise that the issue of Garda pay has to be addressed, the way forward does not lie in members of the force taking disruptive action against the interests of their colleagues in the force.  As with any industrial dispute, this one can only be resolved by negotiation through the mechanisms which exist.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept it is a rather unedifying spectacle to see a Minister simultaneously wringing his hands and washing them of the issue?  Does he not accept he bears responsibility, in his office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and for his role as Opposition spokesman on Justice when he clearly indicated and gave encouragement to the Garda on this issue?</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister, yet again, to state what measures he will take to ensure adequate policing services are available to the public on Friday.  He does not need a formal statement from any organisation to be aware there is considerable anger among the Garda.  What is he doing to protect the public interest?  He must accept he has responsibility for this issue and cannot walk away from it.  This is a long-standing issue and no Member underestimates how difficult it is to resolve it, but it must be resolved.  The Minister's answer gives very little hope.</P>

I want answers to the two questions which I came into the House to ask but which were not answered. The Minister has an obligation to set out the position plainly and to reply succinctly to those two fundamental questions.</P>

Successive Governments have made serious efforts to reduce taxes.

It would also lead to an irresponsible handling of the public sector pay issue and the economy.  That will not happen under this Government, now or in the future.

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for having saved the House from total farce.  There was a certain reassurance when the Minister was known as the Minister for zero tolerance.  Would he not accept that it is deeply disturbing for people to realise that, if he continues with his present approach, he will become the Minister for zero policing?  Will he indicate his plans for Friday?  Is it true, as reported today in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> that there are no scheduled meetings planned <Col N="156" /> between the Minister, senior Garda authorities and the GRA?</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Minister appreciates how alarming this situation is for the public.  Did he hear the statement from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, which is alarmed at what is in prospect for Friday?  What preparations has he put in place?  What areas will be disturbed and what services will not be provided as a result of this dispute and as a result of his failure to cope with the large-scale withdrawal of Garda personnel that is likely to occur?  We and members of the public must know what will happen on Friday to allow for preparations.</P>

      <P>I have made it repeatedly clear in the course of this dispute that the GRA are most welcome to return to the negotiating table.  The dispute will not be resolved outside the gates of this House or on a platform outside Buswells Hotel.  It will ultimately be resolved around the negotiating table.  Rather than engage in what can only be a disruptive day for society I again appeal to members of the GRA to follow the example of their senior colleagues in the AGSI and return to the negotiating table to see if this matter can be resolved amicably and within the public sector pay guidelines.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific measure which Deputy McManus insists on raising again, I have outlined to the House that discussions are under way and that plans are advanced, and in some cases in place, to deal with the situation should it arise.  No Minister for Justice has attended this House and laid out strategies which the Garda Síochána may be putting in place to deal with given situations whereby vulnerable members of the public might require the utmost security of the State.  I assure the public that everything possible will be done to ensure that an adequate police force is in place to protect those who are vulnerable and to ensure that, in so far as it is possible, people will feel safe.</P>

      <P>I can perhaps be forgiven as I listen to the Minister, knowing that when I was Minister he was at the front gates of this House inciting the gardaí to make as much noise as they could about pay rises.  It was reported to me verbally by gardaí at the time that he assured them they would be looked after when Fianna Fáil returned to Government.  Is the Minister aware the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors has recalled its adjourned conference for next Thursday?  At that meeting neither the Minister nor I know what decision the sergeants will take in relation to the Friday action called by the GRA.  Can the Minister confirm to the House he will be depending on the sergeants, superintendents, chief superintendents, assistant commissioners, inspectors, deputy commissioners and the Commissioner to fill in for 8,500 gardaí given that there are only approximately 2,000 members in the senior ranks?  What discussion has the Minister had with the chief superintendents, the <Col N="157" /> superintendents and the inspectors about filling the rosters for next Friday?  Are sufficient numbers in those ranks qualified to drive squad cars, to answer telephones and to deal with public queries?  What discussions has the Minister had with them on pay for filling in for their colleagues who will be out sick next Friday?</P>

Has he met senior Garda personnel and the Minister for Defence in regard to the possible deployment of the Army, if Army reserves or resources are required next Friday, which could well be the case?

    </Speaker>
    <P>The list of legislation circulated by the Whip's Office on 20 April stated that in the event of <Col N="164" /> legislation being necessary arising from the agreement in Northern Ireland, other legislation would be displaced by the preparation of such Bills.  Will the Taoiseach prepare a programme of legislation which will be necessary under the Agreement and present a timetable to the House?  It is important to demonstrate to all concerned, North and South, that we are serious about the implementation of the Agreement.  I understand from the Agreement that the type of legislation which will be necessary relates to a commitment to establish a human rights commission and the commitment to proceed as quickly as possible to ratify the Council of Europe framework convention on national minorities.  It also includes the implementation of enhanced employment equality legislation, the introduction of equal status legislation, the continuation of further active steps to demonstrate respect for the different traditions on the island and the amendment of the Offences Against the State Act.  I presume this will abolish the offence of demonstrating outside Leinster House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All aspects of the Luas project, including the original plans and the extensions, will be taken into account by the Government in its decision.  A great number of extensions have been visualised not only in current reports but in recent reports, and Ballymun is one of those.  It will take many years before most of those will be dealt with and we should not mislead the public &mdash; I made that point when I was Leader of the Opposition.  On the second aspect, I will bring forward legislation, but it is too early to say what that legislation will involve.  There is a marker down that the time and resources of the draftsman are limited and whatever Bills will be required for the Agreement will take precedence over others.</P>

      <P>It is clear from what Deputy Howlin said that the Government was preparing for a different result from the Atkins report.  That is a better explanation of why the Cabinet was thwarted today in making a decision.  On 17 February, on the Refugee (Amendment) Bill, the Taoiseach said that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would make an announcement on the matter shortly.  He is so <Col N="166" /> busy with other matters he made no announcement but he set up a committee.  Worthy as that committee is in dealing with refugees and given the increase in racism in our community, will the Taoiseach say when the Refugee (Amendment) Bill will be before the House so that the issue of refugees can be handled expeditiously?  Within a few miles of this House the Garda reports many instances of racism and violence against people who are seeking asylum.  When will the legislation be before the House to rectify the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said previously on the Order of Business, the Minister decided some time ago to examine the issue again because clearly the legislation promised would not deal with the extent of the problem.  As soon as that examination is complete, which I hope will be shortly, the Minister will make a comprehensive statement on the matter.  If we were to continue along the present lines we would not deal with the matter in a suitable way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <P>As Deputies will know, the rapid escalation in <Col N="190" /> house prices over the past few years has had serious adverse implications for first time buyers. Furthermore, excessive house price increases carry potentially serious implications for the wider economy in terms of possible inflationary effects and the dangers of excessive personal borrowing. It was necessary, therefore, for the Government to take action in this area and a comprehensive range of measures in relation to the housing market was announced by the Government last Thursday.</P>
    <P>The extent of sustained economic growth over the past five years or so has been unprecedented in the history of this State.  However, the level of house price increases over the same period has been an unwelcome side effect of our rapid growth in incomes and employment, demographic changes and historically low interest rates.</P>
    <P>In formulating policies to tackle the problem of major house price increases, we are, in effect, addressing a key element in managing the effects of major economic and social development in Ireland.  The approach we take can have implications not only within the housing sector, but throughout the economy.  It is essential that such decisions are based on thorough analysis of all the relevant factors and rigorous asessment of the likely implications.  The report on House Prices by Peter Bacon and Associates has provided us with an independent expert analysis of the situation and a sound platform on which to formulate a balanced well targeted package of measures to address this critical issue, which has become a matter of serious public concern.  I join with various commentators in complimenting the authors for their excellent report.</P>
    <P>The consultants point out correctly that &ldquo;there is not a simple formula available to address the issue of house price increases&rdquo;.  The strong economic and demographic fundamentals that I referred to earlier are the primary forces driving prices.  Traditional responses such as interest rate increases are not now feasible in the run-up to monetary union.  It follows that there is no single measure available in the short term to counter the fundamental factors that have given rise to rapid increses in demand and prices.  In essence, there can be no quick fix solutions to the present housing situation and, instead, there must be a well-targeted combination of measures.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to two key priorities that must be addressed in approaching this matter.  First and foremost is the question of affordability of housing, especially for lower income groups.  The scale of recent price increases has presented difficulties even for those prospective buyers who would normally be regarded as having good incomes.  The Government is not prepared to countenance the possible development of a situation where the goal of home ownership might be pushed beyond the reach of a significant proportion of households who reasonably aspire to it.</P>
    <P>Second, it is vital to ensure that the long-term <Col N="191" /> strength, stability and balance of the housing sector is not jeopardised by excessive overheating or distortions in the market of which recent price developments are symptomatic.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report has given clear recognition to these key priorities and the package of measures announced last Thursday will help restore balance to the housing market.  It will also help to remove another significant factor that has been fuelling price escalation, namely, the expectation or &mdash; depending on one's perspective &mdash; fear of further major price increases.  The publication of the report, with the Government's speedy response, will help take much of the hype out of the market.  It is not without significance that as the publication of the report approached, there were increasingly frequent comments to the effect that the market &ldquo;is about to right itself and that prices are set to stabilise soon&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government has formulated a balanced range of actions designed to remove factors &mdash; on both the demand and supply side &mdash; which are identified in the report as causing overheating, bottlenecks or distortions in the housing market. The Government's response consists broadly of a three-pronged approach.  First, measures to increase the potential supply of housing, which involves increasing the availability of serviced land by the removal of infrastructural constraints, promoting increased densities at appropriate locations, encouraging faster release of serviced land for residential development and achieving better movement within the existing housing stock.  Second, measures must be taken to address factors causing overheating or distortions in the market.  A key issue here, as emphasised in the report, is the need to dampen excessive investor demand and thereby help restore better balance between supply and demand.  Third, measures must also be taken to improve the position of prospective first-time buyers.</P>
    <P>I will now discuss the taxation measures proposed in the consultants' report and acted on by Government.  The Government's response document entitled &ldquo;Action on House Prices&rdquo;, which was launched last Thursday, is designed to help restore balance to the housing market and provide for orderly growth of housing output into the coming years.  Before dealing in detail with the stamp duty measures contained in the financial resolution before the House I would like to outline the other tax measures which are part of this overall package.</P>
    <P>The consultants recommended the removal of the deductibility of interest on borrowings for residential property against rental income for the purpose of personal income tax.  The Government has accepted this recommendation.  Accordingly, investors will no longer be entitled to a deduction for tax purposes in respect of interest on borrowings used on or after last Thursday to purchase, improve or repair residential property. This measure will apply to individuals, partnerships and companies who take out loans for the <Col N="192" /> purpose of purchasing, improving or repairing investment residential property.  This measure will directly address the situation identified in the report that investors were to some extent replacing first-time buyers in the market, which development goes totally against the thrust of housing policy objectives accepted over recent decades.</P>
    <P>Pipeline cases have been catered for, however, where a binding contract in writing was in place before 23 April 1998 to purchase an investment residential property and the borrowed money is employed for that purpose by 30 September 1998. If these conditions are met the new restrictions will not apply.  In addition, the restrictions will not apply to interest on borrowed money used in the improvement or repair of residential property owned by the investor before last Thursday or which are covered by the arrangements for pipeline cases.  I believe that arrangements are fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The consultants recommended that to encourage the supply of serviced land zoned residential, there should be a temporary reduction in the rate of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent for disposals made during the next four years.  Thereafter, a rate of 60 per cent would apply to the disposal of such land where the temporary reduction had not been availed of.  It is intended to legislate immediately for this supply side measure by making the new reduced rate applicable to disposals of such qualifying land made on or after 23 April 1998.</P>
    <P>The consultants recommended the repeal of section 23 relief from a current date.  However, under the new urban renewal scheme to be introduced on 1 August 1998, tax incentives will not be available in any new urban designated area on a blanket basis as was the position up to now. Instead, the case for the applicability of section 23 will be critically evaluated and the possible impact on house prices will be a factor in considering whether section 23 would apply for any particular area.  Accordingly, section 23 relief will in future apply only in specific areas where it can be proven to be absolutely necessary for the achievement of the objectives of the integrated area plans under this new urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to shortly bring before the House a special Finance Bill to legislate for all the tax changes announced in the Government's response to the consultants' report.</P>
    <P>I will now turn specifically to the financial resolution dealing with the announced changes in the stamp duty regime for residential property. This resolution provides for significant reductions in the rates of stamp duty charged on the transfer of second-hand residential property and the imposition of stamp duty on certain new residential property.  The consultants' report highlighted that the high rates of stamp duty, particularly the 7 per cent, 8 per cent and 9 per cent rates introduced in 1997, had caused a significant bottleneck in the market and, as a result, dampened the potential supply of second-hand housing to the <Col N="193" /> market.  In addition, the consultants argued that the existing rate-band structure posed a significant barrier to entry for first-time buyers of second-hand housing.  For these reasons the Government announced the fundamental changes to the stamp duty regime last Thursday as part of the overall package.</P>
    <P>The existing rate-band structure will continue to apply for non-residential property as it is felt that in view of the significant Exchequer costs that would be involved, there is no justification for reducing the rates applying to non-residential property.  All conveyances for residential property dated on or after 23 April 1998 will benefit from the following stamp duty rates.  All residential property valued up to £60,000 will now be exempt; residential property in excess of £60,000 and up to £100,000 will be liable at 3 per cent; residential property in excess of £100,000 and up to £170,000 will be liable at 4 per cent; residential property in excess of £170,000 and up to £250,000 will be liable at 5 per cent; residential property in excess of £250,000 and up to £500,000 will be liable for stamp duty at 7 per cent; while residential property valued in excess of £500,000 will continue to be liable at 9 per cent stamp duty.</P>
    <P>This rebalancing of the rate-band structure will help to increase effective market supply, reduce the cost burden faced by buyers and increase the options available to first-time buyers.  These reductions in the stamp duty rates will encourage existing house owners to trade up and thereby provide houses for purchase by first-time owner occupiers further down the price scale.  The measures are weighted to favour first-time purchasers who would normally be buying at the lower end of the market, that is, the rate applying for property valued between £60,000 and £100,000, has been halved, where the rates at the upper end have not been reduced.</P>
    <P>In addition to this new rate-band structure for residential property, I propose levying stamp duty on the purchase of all new residential property by a purchaser who is not an owner occupier.  This is in line with the consultants' report and the above rates will apply as appropriate in such cases.</P>
    <P>The rationale for such a change is as follows. As I indicated earlier, the consultants noted that rapid price escalation has attracted an increasingly wide range of personal investors into residential property.  This has had the effect of pricing lower income purchasers, who wish to buy their own house or apartment, out of the market.  The strong investor demand is, according to the consultants, a source of overheating in the housing market and the report has warned against the possibility of a &ldquo;speculative bubble&rdquo; fuelled by expectations of short-term gains from further price increases.  The Government acted now, in the manner outlined above, to dampen market expectations, restore market normality and ensure that owner occupiers were not further driven out of the housing market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> The continuation of the long-standing tax exemption for new houses under a certain limit to owner occupiers represents a targeting of this relief to those most in need of it.</P>
    <P>As with the other measures, pipeline cases are being catered for as follows.  Existing reliefs will continue for new houses and apartments bought by non-owner occupiers, where contracts evidenced in writing have been entered into prior to 23 April 1998 and where the conveyance has been completed no later than 30 September 1998.  In all other cases, purchases of a new residential property will attract existing relief only if the purchaser does not intend letting the property within the first five years of ownership.  Also, upon notification to Revenue that the property has been let within that period, the individual will have to pay the amount of stamp duty that would have been paid at the outset had they purchased it as an investor.</P>
    <P>These stamp duty measures alone are estimated to cost the Exchequer in net terms about £37 million in 1998 and £63 million in a full year, on a static basis.  This is based on an annual gross cost of £78 million with additional revenue of £15 million being recouped from the purchasing of new housing by non-owner occupiers.  The annual cost to the Exchequer of the reduction in the CGT rate is estimated at £7 million, while it is anticipated that the removal of the deductibility of interest on borrowings will yield £26 million. Overall, the total Exchequer cost of all the taxation measures on a full year basis is estimated to be somewhere in the region of £44 million annually.</P>
    <P>Rapid price increases have greatly increased the burden of stamp duty and made it a distorting factor in the market.  The consultants have identified that existing stamp duty rates present a significant barrier to entry to the second-hand house market by first-time purchasers and, by increasing transaction costs, militate against mobility in the housing market.  New building represents only a small proportion of the overall housing stock, so good turnover of existing houses is essential.  The significant reductions in stamp duty will help boost the supply of existing houses on the market.</P>
    <P>The imposition of stamp duty on new houses for investors, with other measures in the package, is intended to discourage investment demand in residential property and thus to reduce overheating in the market.  The reductions in stamp duty are not simply a give-away gesture on the part of the Government.  There are very strong economic arguments behind this, as pointed out by the consultants. As I indicated, high stamp duty rates had become a significant bottleneck to market mobility, a distorting factor between new and second-hand houses and a particular barrier to entry to the second-hand market for first-time buyers.  The reduced rates will help to increase effective market supply, reduce the cost burden faced by buyers and increase the options open to first time buyers.  For instance, as already mentioned in the case of second-hand houses costing <Col N="195" /> between £60,000 and £100,000, the rate of stamp duty is being halved.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward these taxation measures, the Government is proposing a balanced package of measures aimed at dampening house price inflation and thereby restoring better balance between supply and demand.  In doing so it has been necessary to redress the imbalance which now exists between those buying a house to live in and those buying purely for investment reasons.  The actions of the latter if left unchecked could, in the view of the consultants, bring about a speculative bubble.  There are wider economic issues at stake here since the recent trends in house prices cannot be allowed to destabilise the consensus which has been carefully nurtured over a long period between all the relevant social partners. To those who argue that these measures will not address the current housing situation, or that measures will increase rents, there is no proof that there will be any such effect.  In fact, by making owner-occupied housing more affordable the demand for rental property may stabilise.</P>
    <P>The package must be looked at in its totality and it would not be wise to engage in an exercise in cherrypicking to avoid offending certain sectors. At the outset, I stated that the Government took action in a comprehensive macroeconomic way to restore balance and sanity to the housing market.  Consequently, I recommend this package to the House and move this financial resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

      <P>There is, as everybody knows, a housing crisis in Dublin, and it is quickly spreading to the rest of the country.  The price of even the most modest home has gone well beyond the reach of most young couples.  Young people such as nurses, teachers, gardaí, middle-grade civil servants and persons in private industry or on the average industrial wage can no longer expect to own their own homes.  Rising house prices are fuelling inflation and are a serious threat to social partnership.  Already, a leading Civil Service union has called on the Government to take action or face the prospect of wage demands well in excess of those agreed in Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>When on budget day I predicted that rapidly rising prices would put our economic prosperity at risk unless the Government took action, I was greeted with smirks from the Government benches. Nobody is smirking now.  The housing crisis, if it continues, will undermine our prosperity, wreck social consensus and make the task of local authorities, especially their housing departments, well nigh impossible.  The Government is at last taking action.  It may be too little, too late.  The measures proposed may not work as expected. They may indeed have the opposite effect from what was intended, but we must at least call for one small cheer for the Government because at least, and at last, it is taking some action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its action is based on the Bacon report and because of this, if for no other reason, the package proposed must be taken seriously.  The Bacon <Col N="196" /> report is a good analysis of the problem and makes very clear recommendations.  The Government has not accepted all Dr. Bacon's recommendations, in particular, those in relation to section 23 tax relief.  The Government has modified other proposals, but it has stuck to the fundamental analysis that the housing problem in Dublin is essentially a problem of supply and that, by increasing supply and reducing demand, the market will be brought into equilibrium.</P>
    <P>I would like to examine first those measures in the Government's proposals which are designed to increase supply.  These are generally welcome proposals.  Increased capital to service land with sewers, water and roads is welcome.  The amount being allocated through the Department of the Environment is small but at least it will be used to service more zoned land and bring extra zoned serviced land to the market.  Public-private initiatives to service land are also welcome.  Again the amount of money being dedicated is quite small &mdash; £5 million is the amount suggested &mdash; which will be made available by the Minister for the Environment.  That is a nugatory amount in the context of the problem, but if it is intended to set up the first public-private initiative on serviced land by way of pilot scheme, at least it can be examined on that basis.  However, amounts of money being dedicated to bring further serviced land into play so that houses can be built are quite small, and we should not exaggerate the effect such amounts of money will have on a total housing market which is a multimillion, if not a multibillion pound market at the moment.</P>
    <P>I also welcome proposals for increased density. In accordance with Dr. Bacon's recommendations, increased density will have to be coupled with better design.  It is not enough just to say we now have between seven and ten units to the acre, that we can have 19 or 20, and that once we come to the brown sites in the city centre we can talk about 280 to 290 building units to the acre by way of apartments, if not high rise, moderate rise developments.  The whole area of design and how higher densities fit into the landscape and the street scape have to be examined very carefully. We are not in the business of organising the ghettoes of the 21st century when this plan is put into effect.  The Minister must take that very seriously. His colleague in the Department of the Environment and Local Government must take it equally seriously because we have had experiments before with high rise developments to meet a crisis when the late Deputy Neil Blaney was Minister for the Environment and the Ballymun scheme was put in place.  It is arguable that even though Ballymun is high rise, it is low density, because there are vast, useless open spaces now dedicated to foddering wandering horses.  By any standards it was a disaster of urban planning. Yet our predecessors here on all sides welcomed the initiative as a tremendous Government response to the housing crisis of the day when local authority waiting lists were of such magnitude that no one had any expectation of getting a <Col N="197" /> local authority house.  Very often the conventional wisdom of one generation becomes the ghetto of the next generation.  I caution the Minister to continue his interest in housing policy and ensure that proper discussion takes place about the proper design, layout and social infrastructure to back up any high density developments in the new brown field sites which are being identified, particularly in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the intention to develop such brown field sites.  We have a problem in that the population of Dublin and other cities is spreading out to the margins and people no longer live in any great numbers near the city centre.  There is some movement now back between the canals, but that has to be reinforced.  The bringing into play of brown field sites which are not to be used for industrial or business purposes is very welcome indeed.  There is great potential for it in the docks area and from there to Ringsend, which is one of the projects that was very dear to the heart of the Minister's predecessor in office, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.</P>
    <P>The proposals to reduce stamp duty, which are the subject of the financial resolution being discussed today are welcome, but I would give them a conditional welcome.</P>
    <P>However, one supply side measure is deplorable. The Minister for Finance reduced the rate of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent in the budget on all assets with one exception, namely, the sale of development land which was maintained at 40 per cent.  The Government has been lobbied by developers since budget day to apply this reduction in capital gains tax to development land.  Now, under the guise of a housing package and behind the smokescreen provided by the housing crisis, the Government has given into a particular lobby group.  Development land which is sold in the next four years will have a capital gains tax rate of only 20 per cent. I do not believe this will do anything for persons who cannot afford a house and will merely increase the profits of speculators.</P>

      <P>I know that, but it is a peculiarly independent report.  When a consultant completes a report, he submits it.  This consultant seems to have been retained to fight the case in the media as well.  Will the Minister inform us what level of discussion took place before the recommendations were entered in the report and what kind of cross-pollination took place between the political side, the administrative side and the consultants before the report was published?  This is not a criticism of Dr. Bacon but, by any standards, the Government is getting great value from him.  Not only did he produce the report, he proceeded to sell it to the media on behalf of the Government.  I have never seen an independent consultant behaving in that way before.  It is particularly interesting.  It is very useful that he <Col N="198" /> recommended this in his report because the Minister can say he is implementing a recommendation from an independent report.  If it has been independently compiled, then it is a bad recommendation.</P>
      <P>The notion that building land will be taxed at 60 per cent after four years is codology.  If zoned service land is brought on to the market over the next four years by giving people the carrot of 20 per cent capital gains tax, does the Minister think, if the rate is raised to 60 per cent in four years' time, that people will not hold on to the land and lobby furiously?  Housing policy should be developed for the next generation.  Proceeding on a stop-start basis, where there will be an abundance of building land for the next four years and then none, suggests the next generation of young people do not need houses.  I will lay any odds that the 60 per cent measure will never materialise. It may appear in the Minister's proposed Finance Bill but I do not believe there is any reality to it nor do I believe the market can work with it.  It is a false stick accompanying a welcome carrot for speculators.</P>
      <P>The Government's proposals on stamp duty are miscast.  Any reduction in taxation is welcome and I welcome the reductions proposed in the financial resolution.  However, I do not believe the changes will reduce the price of houses.  In fact, prices may increase further as purchasers may use their savings on stamp duty to increase their bid on their desired house.  The proposal put forward by Fine Gael would have more impact on the market.  The crucial problem is that faced by first time buyers.  Resources should be targeted to assist this group.  I still believe first time buyers of second-hand houses should be exempt from stamp duty for houses up to a value of £100,000. I will propose an amendment along those lines when the Minister introduces the Finance Bill to give effect to these taxation measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government fought shy of implementing Dr. Bacon's proposals in respect of section 23 relief.  While the Minister commented briefly on it, he did not explain why the Government did not implement the proposal.  I would like him to explain why the Government thought this was not an appropriate proposal to put into effect, especially when interest relief on rented accommodation is being abolished.  It seems to me that commercial investors tend to invest in section 23 accommodation while smaller investors invest in three bedroom, semi-detached houses.  They are severely penalised by these proposals while the big investor is protected.  Once more we have a situation where the person who can buy three, four or five apartments in the Customs House dock site will still be able to offset rental income against the purchase price and can continue in business.  However, the small investor, who has paid for his or her mortgage and is making provision for the future by buying a semi-detached house in another housing estate, will be hammered as they will only receive mortgage interest relief.  It is like the budget: the bigger one is, the <Col N="199" /> better one will be protected by the Government. Capital gains tax will be reduced by 20 per cent if one has a land bank for building.  If one is a section 23 investor, everything will be fine as one's potential investment will be maintained. However, if one is in the smaller end of the housing market and one buys a small, three bedroom, semi-detached house in a new estate in Tallaght in the hope that three or four nurses will rent it, one will no longer get interest relief on the mortgage.  I strongly question that on social grounds.</P>
    <P>The proposal to abolish interest relief is where Dr. Bacon's analysis runs into trouble.  I will not argue against it on the grounds of equity but on the basis of his analysis.  He treats supply and demand as if the <i>status quo</i> were a datum, as if supply will remain at current levels, and that any additional measures will give an additional supply. He argues as if measures to reduce demand will have no effect on supply.  However, the Minister, who is no mean economist himself, knows supply and demand are always linked.  The theory in the Bacon report seems to be that, if the private investor is removed from the new housing market, more houses will become available for owner-occupiers and that the other measures in the Government package will further increase the number of new houses available and that the new interaction of supply and demand will reduce house prices.</P>
    <P>However, it is just as likely that, when the small investor is taken out of the new house market, the builder will adjust by reducing supply.  If a builder owns land and has a building programme of 70 houses a year, of which 40 per cent go to the small investor, as soon as that demand reduces, as happens in the normal marketplace, supply will be adjusted downwards.  It is a fallacy to think the supply of houses will remain intact and that everything the Minister is doing today and in subsequent measures will simply add to the supply. There is a danger there will be a reduction in the supply of houses when the builders and developers make their decision after the small investor goes out of the market.  Equilibrium may not be reached at a lower house price in 18 months' time but possibly at a higher price.  The difficulty is not that there is a shortage of land, zoned land or even zoned serviced land but a shortage in the supply of houses.  No matter what sticks and carrots are used, until extra houses are available the supply problem will not be solved.  If the small investors are removed, the builders will adjust downwards and that is the biggest fear.</P>
    <P>There is also the fear that, if the small investors are removed, there will be a scarcity of houses for people to rent.  Such people usually band together in threes and fours to rent accommodation in towns and cities around the country.  There will be a scarcity and pressure will be put on rents. While we are advancing the case of owner-occupiers above all others, single people who have no intention of buying their own homes also need a <Col N="200" /> place to lay their heads at night.  It is not enough for the Minister to state that this will have no effect on rents.  The fact is that any solicitor to whom one speaks says they have had cancellations in the past week.  There is no doubt the measure will work, but how it will work and whether it will be to the advantage of the purchaser remains to be seen.  Markets are tricky and we had experience of that in Government when we abolished residential property tax.  We feared the market would go out of control so stamp duty was increased, not as a revenue collection measure but to dampen the market.  I do not believe it achieved that and I am uncertain what the removal of residential property tax did to prices either.  I suspect it was one of the causes of the rise in prices.  The analysis omits the real possibility that if the private investor moves out of the housing market, builders will reduce the supply of houses to meet a lesser demand.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that in the transitional period a person will have to have an irrevocable contract. That is unfair.  I know precedents have been set but such measures were introduced in the past for the purpose of collecting revenue.  They were introduced on budget day to avoid loss or leakage of revenue.  On this occasion the intention is to dampen down the market.  I believe a person who has paid £2,000 to £3,000 in a booking deposit &mdash; and can prove that &mdash; has become sufficiently involved in the transaction not to be caught by the abolition of interest relief.</P>
    <P>They are far enough down the line in the transaction not to be caught by the abolition of interest relief.  Will the Minister re-examine this matter?  In the normal process, a person looks at a house, puts a bid on it, an agreement is drawn up with the auctioneer and a booking deposit of £3,000 or £4,000 is paid.  It takes several months for a contract to be signed and the non-returnable 10 per cent is paid up front.  At a later stage conveyancing takes place and the balance of the money is paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made strong provision for the person who has signed the contract and paid 10 per cent.  He has given them until December to complete the transaction and pay the rest of the money.  However, he has made no provision for the person who has legitimately bought a house, signed the agreement and paid the booking deposit.  The cut-off point for such people is purely arbitrary.  A case was brought to my attention today where a purchaser signed a contract, paid the 10 per cent and the contract was sent to the vendor's solicitor, but the boom came before the vendor had signed with that person's solicitor.</P>
    <P>The Government would lose very little in revenue by making the adjustments I have suggested. The transitional period should include persons who can prove they have paid a booking deposit. One would need a receipt for the money paid and letters from the solicitor and the auctioneer.  The Government would gain a lot of good will if it adopted that measure.  People who have legitimately concluded transactions, even if a booking <Col N="201" /> deposit is returnable, should not be caught by this measure, particularly when they may have sold another property and made arrangements with a building society or a bank to take out a loan. When drafting the Finance Bill, will the Minister be easy on people who have legitimately purchased properties, but have not gone into the definition of the irrevocable contract with the 10 per cent paid up front?</P>
    <P>We can deal with the detail of the stamp duty resolution at a later stage.  I understand a Committee Stage type debate will take place from 8.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. tonight and we will have another day out.  As we are all putting our programmes together for the remainder of the year, can the Minister tell us when the Finance Bill will be published? I am not tying him to a date, I merely want an indication of when it might be published.</P>

      <P>It will hardly surprise the Minister that, in regard to the likely effect of the deductibility of interest, I side more with the Minister than with Deputy Noonan, but I will deal with that matter later.</P>
      <P>Today's financial resolution arises directly from the report commissioned by the Government from Peter Bacon and Associates.  Dr. Bacon and his associates have done us a considerable service in setting out a detailed analysis of the housing crisis.  The report assesses experience and developments in the housing market in the past and, more particularly, examines current and future needs.  On foot of this analysis, Dr. Bacon made a number of recommendations, most of which have since been accepted by Government.  The resolution before the House is only one of those recommendations and cannot be dealt with in isolation. I agree with those who have stated this stands or falls as a package and it is on that basis I wish to debate the matter today.</P>
      <P>Dr. Bacon has given us much in the way of facts, figures, details and analysis, all of which are helpful.  Most of the major factors which brought about the current explosion in house prices have been obvious for some months.  Anyone with half an eye on the housing market has known for some time that a worryingly high percentage of new housing units in Dublin, be they apartments or houses, are being bought by people for passive investment purposes.  We have known for some time that demographic changes and, in particular, net immigration are producing a bulge in demand which is putting up prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government knew this, and a great deal more, six months ago when it commissioned Dr. Bacon to produce a report.  It appears to find it almost impossible to make a decision without setting up a working party, interdepartmental group, <Col N="202" /> commission or consultancy to advise it on what it should do.  Much of the time the delay makes little or no difference, but in this instance, the six month delay in taking action has had a disastrous effect, not least in Dublin and Galway.  House prices in both those cities have risen by nearly 20 per cent in the six months since the consultants were asked to commission a report.  The bald fact is that while the Government dithered many thousands of people, particularly young couples and single people, have been priced out of the housing market.  Many people could have aspired to buy a house for £75,000 or £80,000 last October, but now find the average cost of £95,000 or £100,000 impossible.  These people can blame Government inaction over the last six months for their predicament.</P>
    <P>This was not for lack of advice.  During the debate on the Finance Bill, Deputy Noonan and I proposed increases in taxation as part of an effort to deal with the demand problem.  The Minister is well aware that it is most unusual for an Opposition party to suggest increases in taxation. I proposed that we should reverse the reduction in CGT introduced last December as it applies to house property.  I also suggested that we should impose stamp duty on new houses for people other than first time buyers.  The Minister has belatedly agreed to do the latter while he still maintains his ideological standpoint on CGT.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with some of the recommendations made by Bacon and approved by the Minister. We must first ask ourselves a simple question. Is it, or should it be, a matter of political priority to encourage the traditional aspiration of Irish people to own and occupy their own homes? The simple answer is yes.  More particularly, we should offer people a choice of accommodation that meets their needs and aspirations.  The structure of our society is changing.  There are a greater number of household units, many consisting of one or two people.  The opposite is also true, in that fewer households consist of a large number of people.  There is every indication that this trend will continue into the future.</P>
    <P>This trend is particularly strong in the local authority or voluntary sector.  A very large percentage of those on local authority housing lists are single parents, senior citizens or others living alone or with one other person.  That the housing lists should be dominated by such people is in part a reflection of their means.  It also reflects that the private housing market does not adequately cater for people in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I will now deal in detail with the recommendations in the report and the action taken by the Government.  The programme is unsurprisingly a mixed bag.  Some parts, such as the changes in the incentivisation of passive investment, are good. Other parts, if by and large inoffensive, are unconvincing.  In that regard I refer in particular to the measure before the House dealing with stamp duty.  Elements such as the reduction in CGT, are unconvincing and potentially offensive <Col N="203" /> and other elements, such as the meagre effort to deal with the voluntary and local authority housing sector, are utterly inadequate.</P>
    <P>The rate of stamp duty is dictated by the price of a house or apartment.  The rates and thresholds were set many years ago and have not been changed since, despite the fact that house prices have multiplied in the meantime.  The Exchequer take from stamp duty has increased enormously in recent years.  When it was first introduced, the 6 per cent rate applied, in effect, only to bigger or luxury houses.  Obviously, this is no longer the case in that virtually any urban house or apartment now attracts stamp duty at 6 per cent or more.</P>
    <P>It is not difficult to see why Ministers were not motivated to change the stamp duty regime in the past.  The tax attracted very little public disapproval because most people paid it only once or twice in their lifetimes.  Also, the Exchequer was short of money and the take from stamp duty made a significant contribution.  That said, times have changed.  Income tax and VAT revenues are buoyant and it is possible to examine the stamp duty regime in a more dispassionate and equitable way.  On that basis alone, the moves made by the Minister are justifiable.  That is not to say, however, that the reductions in stamp duty will have the effect claimed by the Minister.  The reduction in stamp duty on second-hand houses applies to all purchasers not just to first time buyers. The failure to focus on first time buyers is a fatal flaw.</P>
    <P>Dr. Bacon sets out the current problem in the housing market in succinct terms.  In one of the myriad of graphs and statistics he sets out an affordability index.  One of the bottom lines is very stark.  A married couple with one earner on one and a half times the average industrial wage &mdash; approximately £20,000 &mdash; could easily afford a house in Dublin ten years ago whereas they would now find it &mdash; to use Dr. Bacon's word &mdash; impossible.  Surely this is what today's debate is about.  Surely it is first time buyers we should be seeking to help.  By failing to focus the reduction in stamp duty on first time buyers the Minister is missing the point.  For as long as I can remember there has been a distinction in the treatment of new and second-hand houses for stamp duty purposes. No stamp duty has been payable on new houses up to a certain size whereas all second-hand houses attract stamp duty at different rates. It is worth remembering why this distinction was made.  It was made primarily, if not exclusively, to encourage the construction industry.</P>
    <P>Construction is a labour intensive industry and it is also an industry which produces positive knock-on effects.  For a long time the industry was working below capacity and there was good reason to provide incentives to encourage construction, not only from the point of view of the housing market, but also from the point of view of the economy.  However, that reasoning is now redundant.  The industry is working at full stretch, <Col N="204" /> profit margins are enormous and labour shortages are becoming more prevalent.  This position was unimaginable ten years ago.  Home owners have to wait months before they can get a builder to carry out basic home improvements or to build an extension.  Large infrastructural projects are increasingly being taken up by builders based outside the State because domestic industry does not have the time or capacity to take up the job. More strikingly, builders are finding it increasingly difficult to get skilled workers to work on site.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves in a situation unimaginable a few years ago where Irish builders are advertising in the UK for people to come home and work. In short, the differentiation in the treatment of new and old houses in terms of stamp duty as a means of encouraging the construction industry is no longer necessary.  That is not to say that it will not be necessary in the future but for the moment it is redundant.  We need to target stamp duty relief at purchasers and first time buyers in particular. First time buyers will normally look to buy a house for £100,000 or less.  Why should the first time buyer of a new house costing £100,000 pay no stamp duty whereas the same buyer will pay £3,000 stamp duty if they choose to buy a second-hand house?  Where is the logic in this and why the distinction?  I would be interested to hear the Minister's thoughts on that question.</P>
    <P>The Minister's central argument is that the reductions in stamp duty will free up supply by addressing a blockage which exists.  The first part of this proposition is difficult to understand.  If the Minister is right that the reduction in stamp duty will very likely increase the number of transactions, this is turn will increase the range of choice available to buyers but it will hardly increase the supply.  The supply of second-hand houses is more or less fixed.  By increasing the number of transactions we will increase the choice available to potential purchasers, including first time buyers, and the profits of those who deal in property. However, ultimately it does not address the problem of too many buyers chasing too few houses.</P>
    <P>A common part of the analysis offered by commentators in recent days has been that there is a blockage in the price range of £150,000 to £170,000.  The suggestion is that this came about when higher rates of stamp duty were imposed following the abolition of RPT.  There may or may not be such a blockage.  Dr. Bacon's report sets out almost no evidence in relation to this matter.  It would be interesting to know what has happened to the number of housing transactions in that price range in recent years.  I read the report carefully but could find no evidence that there has been any notable difficulty at this price level.  Surely the Revenue Commissioners must have figures for the number of transactions in particular price ranges and perhaps the Minister can help us in that regard.</P>
    <P>The real problem with the reduction in stamp duty is that it may not be the buyer who gets the benefit.  Those who are in the market or who have <Col N="205" /> signed contracts have just got a windfall benefit from Dr. Bacon and the Minister and fair play to them.  However, I wonder what the position will be in one year.  We are all familiar with the situation where one goes to an auction with £100,000. Human nature being what it is people tend to overshoot the limit and go to £102,000 or £103,000.  If they have an extra £3,000 to spend what is to say that they will not now go to £106,000 or £107,000?  What is to say that the stamp duty benefit will not ultimately derive to the vendor rather than the purchaser?</P>
    <P>Dr. Bacon has some interesting reflections on the new house purchaser's grant.  He confirms the popular assessment that the £3,000 grant has added to the capital price of houses.  What is to say that the reduction in stamp duty will not have a similar effect?  Are we not at risk of ratcheting up the prices and giving most of the benefits to the vendors?  I hope I am wrong but my doubts are shared by many in the housing business.</P>
    <P>The other side of what is being done today concerns the imposition of stamp duty on some purchasers of new houses.  I suggested something similar during debate on the Finance Bill and I am happy to support the Minister in what he is proposing.  In recent days commentators have tended to concentrate on the supply side problems in the housing market and they are right in many ways.  However, there is one factor which is distorting the demand side of the equation.  An increasing number of units are being purchased for passive investment purposes.  There are no hard statistics but it is accepted that between 20 and 40 per cent of housing units in Dublin and Galway are being purchased for investment purposes. In some cases this is intended as a long-term provision for retirement or pension.  In other cases it is a speculative investment intended to bring about a short-term gain.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to give the impression that this sort of investment is and always has been a bad thing &mdash; far from it.  Parts of this city would not have been developed were it not for investors and the tax incentives which encouraged them.  There are still plenty of under-developed parts of this country where these incentives are appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is equally clear that given the current state of the housing market and the construction industry there are a number of untargeted, unfocused incentives which are unnecessary.  Worse than that, these incentives are giving investors or potential investors a comparative advantage which is pricing first time buyers out of the market. It is very well for property owners and investors to say that they should be able to make a few bob out of the booming economy but we cannot lose sight of the fact that there is a major downside which is that many first time buyers can no longer compete with investors, particularly when it comes to buying new houses and apartments. For those of us in politics it has become a simple choice &mdash; do we wish to encourage people to make a few bob out of property or do we want <Col N="206" /> to help people to buy their own houses?  The answer is surely clear.</P>
    <P>This country needs entrepreneurs, risk takers and investors.  However, let us be honest.  Investment in property is the antithesis of all that. There is virtually no risk.  Passive investment in property is a ticket to ride paid for, in part, by the taxpayer.  We all know what has been happening. One borrows money, buys a house or apartment, writes off the borrowing costs against income tax and one gets the tenants to pay the rest of the mortgage if not a little more.  In the meantime the capital value of the property is zooming up and one stands to make a tidy fortune when one sells the property.  There is nothing improper of immoral about this.  What is improper and inappropriate is that this risk-free, one-way bet should be underpinned by the taxpayer. In that regard I support the action taken by the Minister in terms of the deductibility of interest for income tax purposes.</P>
    <P>As an aside, the Minister will forgive me for saying that I am surprised he has chosen to go down this road.  Until such time as I see the precise terms of the Finance Bill I will continue to retain a small doubt in the back of my mind that he will follow through on the commitments he has made.  The thinking behind what is proposed is contrary to the thinking which inspired the Minister to slash CGT by 50 per cent last December. That reduction added fuel to the fire.  It can only have served to encourage people to invest in property.  Now, perversely, the Minister is taking a number of steps to do the opposite.  How he can reconcile the two is beyond me.</P>
    <P>The Minister rejected the recommendation of Dr. Bacon to abolish section 23 relief.  He says he will look at the application of section 23 in a more critical way in the future and I am prepared to accept his word.  However, he is stirring up trouble for himself and his successors.  It is inevitable that most local authorities will look to have the possibility of section 23 relief available to them in drawing up local plans.  It will then become a matter for the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to decide whether it is appropriate in each case.  This is not a sound and sensible way to do business.  It would have been cleaner and more straightforward to accept Dr. Bacon's recommendation and abolish the relief.  That is what the Minister should have done.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made in recent days that some of the measures the Minister has proposed will have a detrimental effect on the rental sector.  My mind is not closed to this argument but I find it unconvincing.  The private rental sector makes up only 17 per cent of the total housing market and the percentage has fallen considerably in recent years.  There is much evidence to suggest that many people who are renting would prefer to buy their own house.  We all know people who are renting a house simply because they cannot afford to buy one.  It surely follows that if more people are in a position to afford <Col N="207" /> their own house the pressure on the rental sector will diminish.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has also been made that builders will simply switch their attention to the commercial sector.  This argument ignores some very basic facts.  The cost of building materials and labour has scarcely increased in the past two years. The price of new houses has increased because landowners are making more money and because builders are making more profits.  Dr. Bacon's report sets out several practices such as the phased release of developments and rezoning which have clearly added to builders' profits. There have been plenty of examples in this city and elsewhere of new estates where the price of the first houses built was substantially less than that of the last houses built.  Nobody can seriously suggest the cost to the builder has increased significantly in the meantime.  What has happened is that builders have taken the opportunity to get a windfall super-normal profit.  In plain man's language they made a killing.</P>
    <P>If the measures proposed by the Minister are effective they will reduce the opportunity for super-normal profits.  If they do not have this effect the measures will have failed.  To suggest this would make it unprofitable to build apartment blocks or other units designed particularly for rental use is patently absurd.  The profits available will continue to be considerable for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>In fairness to those who have expressed concern we should perhaps accept that to some degree we are in uncharted territory.  My personal predisposition is to believe that the dire warnings about disaster for the rental sector are at least exaggerated if not entirely wrong.  In fairness to all concerned this is something we should keep under review in future years.  There is a great deal more of what Dr. Bacon's proposes that I would like to deal with but unfortunately time does not permit.  I am conscious I will have the opportunity to do so in a couple of weeks' time.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will not oppose the changes in stamp duty.  They are probably justified on the grounds that no changes have been made for many years but that does not mean I am convinced that the changes will have the effects claimed by Dr. Bacon and the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate arises from the publication of the Bacon report on house prices.  I congratulate Dr. Bacon and his associates on the fine report they have produced, although there are some aspects of the report with which I do not entirely agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before us and the package of measures to which the Minister referred are intended to calm the housing market and to make houses more affordable, especially for first time buyers.  Unfortunately, this measure which is before the House and the package announced last week will not make it significantly easier for a young working couple to buy a home of their <Col N="208" /> own.  The Government's package on house prices has come far too late and does not go far enough to bring stability and affordability into the housing market.  In many respects the principal beneficiaries of the package will be builders, developers and landowners rather than those who are trying to scrape together enough money to buy a family home.</P>
    <P>The changes in stamp duty and section 23 should have been made in the budget and it should not have required a consultant's report to tell the Government what every family trying to buy a house already knows, that investment buying has been distorting the market for some time. The Government is seriously misunderstanding and underestimating the scale of the housing crisis.  For the first time in the history of the State young middle class couples cannot afford to buy a home of their own.  Young working people are ensnared in a housing and incomes trap.  They are not earning enough to buy a house because prices are too high and earning too much to qualify for public housing because the income eligibility limits are too low.  In many cases they are ripped off in the private rented sector, in some cases paying £200 per week to the same investors who have bid them out of the market.</P>
    <P>The victims of the housing crisis are the young people in the so-called baby boom generation. This is the generation of confident young Irish people of whom we are all proud but it is a generation which, in many respects, has drawn the short straw.  They are the same young people who had to endure huge class sizes at school and had to go through the cruel points race to get into third level education.  Now they are graduating to a society which proclaims economic prosperity but which cannot give them the basic entitlement of owning a home of their own.  What status do these young people have in a so-called successful economy if they are denied the right to buy a house?  How can we continue to claim to remain a home-owning democracy if only the very well off can afford to buy a house?  How hollow is the constitutional right to property if home ownership for many people on low and middle incomes is becoming a thing of the past?</P>
    <P>The housing crisis has the potential to destroy social cohesion and to seriously disrupt economic progress.  The Government has not yet grasped just how serious the crisis is and just how angry many of its victims are becoming.  Couples who go out every Saturday to look at potential homes are frustrated because the price of the house continues to move faster than their means.  Some 40,000 families who are in need of public or social housing are condemned to wait for years in impossible physical and family circumstances.  A growing number of people are paying huge rents for limited accommodation in the private rented sector.  Tenants of private rented accommodation are being evicted in increasing numbers because the owners of their properties are either selling or converting them to benefit from the property boom.  There is a growing pool of homeless persons <Col N="209" /> in hostels and bed and breakfast accommodation whose needs are far greater than most housing authorities can hope to meet.  What was needed from the Government was urgent action to deal in a comprehensive way with the housing crisis in its entirety.  What we have got is a delayed reaction which does not fully implement the limited package which was recommended in the Bacon report and which concentrates only on some aspects of the private housing market.</P>
    <P>The specific measure does not abolish stamp duty on second-hand houses for first time buyers. It is typical of the Government that the measure before us does more for the better off home owner who is trading up than for the young couple trying to buy a home for the first time.  Under this measure, somebody who is buying a house for almost £500,000 will get a reduction in stamp duty worth almost £10,000 whereas a person who is buying a former council house for £80,000, for example, will still have to pay stamp duty.  The limit at which stamp duty is being exempted is £60,000.  There are no houses in my constituency or in many other parts of the country which are available for £60,000 or under.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the stamp duty problem which has been ignored, that is the problem encountered by families who have to move home due to changes in jobs or job transfers and who may have to change twice, three or four times to follow their employment.  Every time they change and buy a second hand house they will have to pay the full whack of stamp duty.  It is a pity the opportunity of this measure was not availed of to provide some redress for those people.</P>
    <P>Section 23 relief is not being ended, as recommended in the Bacon report.  It remains to be seen how restricted in practice section 23 will be when confined to the integrated area plans.</P>
    <P>The abolition of interest relief on rental income will probably somewhat discourage the small investor in once off properties but it will do nothing to limit the distortion of the housing market by big time investors who are buying up multiple properties with surplus cash and who are not relying on borrowings.  An examination of the housing statistics of the Department of the Environment and Local Government will show there is an increasing number of people who are buying property and an increasing number of properties are being bought without the assistance of a loan. They are being bought by people who are doing well in this economy and have a great deal of money to spend and are buying up multiple properties &mdash; apartments and so on &mdash; with their spare money.  These people are not affected by the measures before the House.</P>
    <P>The reduction in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent announced in the budget has contributed to the increase in investment activity in the housing market.  Instead of reversing that decision the Government has extended this windfall to the owners of development land.  The owner of rezoned residential land will not only reap a huge profit from the rezoning decision but <Col N="210" /> his capital gains tax bill on the disposal of the land will be cut in half.  This is a far cry from the recommendations of the Kenny report on building land, almost 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>The measures being introduced to increase the supply of houses represent another gain for builders and developers.  They will get an additional £15 million subsidy towards servicing the land, a £5 million subsidy for road infrastructure, increased housing densities and a fast tracking of the planning process.  All these measures are costs to the taxpayer, as is the change in stamp duty, without any corresponding measures to restrict profiteering in the housing market.  The costs announced by the Minister were £63 million for the stamp duty measure, £44 million for the tax measures, £20 million for the servicing subsidies, plus administrative costs, which means the total package will cost the taxpayer £130 million without any return from the industry or an attempt to bring profiteering in the building and residential property market under control.</P>
    <P>Last year the cost of building increased by about 3 per cent but the price of new houses went up by 25 per cent.  Someone is making huge additional profits yet no attempt is made by Government to control the unjustifiable increases in new house prices beyond the increase in the cost of building them.  It should be possible to control the price of new houses by reference to the cost of building and still allow for reasonable profits for builders and developers.</P>
    <P>Profiteering in the housing market is not confined to the difference between cost and sale. There is increasing evidence that builders and estate agents are shamefully exploiting first time buyers.  A deposit no longer holds the price and many first time buyers who have paid a deposit come back some months later to find the price of their house has jumped by £20,000 in the period in which it was built.  Legislation should be introduced to outlaw this price gazumping.  The Bacon report and the Minister seem to be relying on the introduction of a code of practice in the industry but, given the reaction of some building industry interests to the rather timid measures now proposed, I have no great confidence that a code of practice will be introduced or, if introduced, that it will be successful.</P>
    <P>The focus thus far in the public debate on house prices has been on how to stop them increasing further.  Even if the Government's measures cause house price increases to slow down &mdash; and I doubt they will do that to any great extent &mdash; many families have already been priced out of home ownership and additional measures are needed to enable those people to provide basic shelter needs for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>First, the private rented sector will have to be more effectively regulated.  Existing regulations on rent books, registration and standards must be enforced because at present they are not.  Legislation to provide some security of tenure must be introduced.  Such legislation was promised five <Col N="211" /> years ago during the sale of the Mespil House flats but it has still not been delivered.</P>
    <P>Second, there must be a massive increase in the social housing programme.  The existing public housing programme, which is producing about 3,500 new housing starts per annum, is clearly inadequate because 40,000 families are in need of public housing.  In addition, new social housing methods are required to provide houses for those on low to middle incomes who cannot now afford to buy on the housing market and whose incomes are marginally above the limit at which they can enter the public housing lists.  I welcome the increase in eligibility for the shared ownership scheme.  However, that increase should be extended to other public housing programmes and social housing schemes.</P>
    <P>Legislation must be introduced to underpin the objectives of local authorities such as my own, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which is seeking to establish a 10 per cent social housing component in all new private housing developments.  Co-operative housing, the use of new types of house tenure and the restructuring of housing subsidies and incentives are all part of a complete shake up of housing policy which is urgently required to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The housing crisis we have experienced for some time is the illness which will kill the Celtic tiger.  The provision of shelter for oneself is a basic human need and people expect to be able to do it, but it is not possible at present.  The measures introduced by the Government deal only with a part of the private housing sector and will not significantly improve the prospects of young couples buying a home of their own.  We must also deal with the people who have already been squeezed out of the housing market.  I am disappointed that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister of State responsible for housing have neither introduced nor announced the intention to introduce new social housing measures to deal with this problem.  The huge number of people living with relatives in overcrowded conditions or in overpriced and sub-standard private rented accommodation even yet entertain some hope that they may be able to buy housing if the market stabilises, that the Government will do something to assist them or that their local authority will house them.  As time rolls by and more people come to realise that housing is not being provided, either as a result of rising prices or inadequate provision of social and public housing, this area will give rise to enormous tension and pressure, which the Government has seriously underestimated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  To say the Dublin housing market has gone crazy is not to overstate the case.  We all have first hand evidence of this phenomenon &mdash; in Ringsend-Irishtown, where I live, a house which cost £50,000 six years <Col N="212" /> ago is now worth between £130,000 and £150,000. This has fundamental implications for our planning, environment, quality of life, towns and cities, young couples and families, communities and society.</P>
      <P>The most significant feature of the Irish housing stock is the level of home ownership, which is the highest in Europe.  The promotion of home ownership has long been an aim of State policy and it can be argued convincingly that the high levels of ownership are due to this policy alone, as manifested through tax incentives and cash grants and the absence of security of tenure in the private rented sector.  Home ownership confers many benefits, both to the household and to society, especially in the stability and pride in place which it brings.</P>
      <P>However, this policy increasingly marginalises those who are not homeowners.  The promotion of home ownership is not inherently problematic but our worry is that it has been promoted at the expense of other tenures and that the sector of the population which cannot afford to buy accommodation has suffered as a result.  There is a disturbing trend towards ever increasing social segregation in housing which reflects and contributes to greater polarisation within society.  The shortcomings of national and local housing policies have exacerbated urban decay and environmental degradation.  These trends have been further exacerbated by rampant house price inflation in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Government's response to this crisis has been too much delayed, is limited in its ambitions and may in the long-term result in effects that are as bad as, if not worse than, what currently exists. The Government's response to date highlights the lack of a coherent and co-ordinated housing policy.  The primary aim of this policy should be to ensure that every person has access to secure, comfortable accommodation in an appropriate place and in a clean and pleasant environment.</P>
      <P>The right to adequate accommodation should be stated in legislation.  Moves should be made to determine whether such a right is implicit in the Constitution and, if not, a suitable constitutional amendment should be moved.</P>
      <P>Alternatives to greenfield site developments must be facilitated.  Only small developments should be permitted.  Planning permission for housing schemes should be dependent on the provision on a mixture of housing sizes and tenures. This is vital to counter the increasing polarisation of our society and the ghettoisation of certain groups.  The crucial element in the planning process must be proper assessment of housing need so that current problems can be dealt with and potential problems forestalled.  Planning laws should be altered to allow people work more from home as we move away from the conventional notion of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential to lower housing costs.  We propose the introduction of a scheme under which lands which have been increased in price by local authority works or because of planning decisions <Col N="213" /> and which are in areas designated by the High Court could be acquired by local authorities and the owners compensated by reference to existing use value.</P>
    <P>Most of the cost of housing to the individual and the community stems from the rate of interest on housing loans.  We propose that alternatives to interest, for example, the introduction of fixed handling charges, should be investigated and the scope of the Housing Finance Agency should be re-examined and redeveloped.  The greater availability of fixed interest loans over longer periods should be encouraged.  The reintroduction of the system of certificates of reasonable value as a means of assessing house construction costs should be provided for in an attempt to curb developer profit margins.  In addition to these major changes, any uncompetitive practices in ancillary services related to house purchase, such as surveying or conveyancing, should be ended.</P>
    <P>The current substantial State subsidies of housing are inefficient and unjust.  With regard to efficiency, they generally encourage the construction of new buildings rather than the renewal of old ones, thus causing unnecessary waste of resources and worsening problems of urban sprawl and inner city decay and thereby increasing the price of accommodation.</P>
    <P>On taxation, in the event of our proposals on land price stabilisation not being accepted, the Green Party will seek the introduction of a windfall tax on the increase in value of development land caused through local authority rezoning or proximity to other development.  Mortgage interest relief should only be available at the standard rate of income tax and should be fully matched by similar relief for those in the private rental sector.  The inequities have been well documented in that mortgage interest relief discriminates in favour of owner occupiers over the holders of other housing tenures.  It is also believed to increase the price of all accommodation and to direct private investment toward housing and away from more useful areas.</P>
    <P>It is hard to see how what is being suggested in regard to further capital gains tax cuts is supposed to help first time buyers.  That said, this is a Government that does not need any help in furthering regressive tax policies.  If the interest exists to tackle the anomalies in capital taxation, attention should be drawn to how inheritance tax on property is affecting those on low and middle incomes, particularly in light of rampant house price inflation.  This is apparent in my constituency. Many of my constituents in Ranelagh, Rathmines and Donnybrook have contacted me about this problem.</P>
    <P>Greater subsidies, whether in money, sites or materials, should be directed towards non-profit housing organisations, including housing co-operatives and voluntary housing associations.  In this regard, we welcome the increased subsidies for local authority shared ownership schemes.  In addition, there should be funding for schemes <Col N="214" /> which promote housing renovation and refurbishment and self-build schemes under which local authorities subsidise the cost of sites and-or materials for people on low incomes to build their own homes.</P>
    <P>In general, the Green Party supports the replacement of all stamp duties on housing with economic charges for the administrative processes involved in house purchase.  Government proposals in this regard, while welcome, are too half-hearted with the abolition of stamp duties for houses up to the value of £60,000 not even reflecting current average house prices.  The Green Party preference would be to promote a site value tax as opposed to a property based tax like the former domestic rates which discouraged the improvement and upkeep of houses.</P>
    <P>In considering housing design and construction, two themes are of primary importance &mdash; the environment and conservation of resources and the changing nature of households.  The Greens believe it is important that building materials come from local renewable sources.  Household sizes are decreasing and the composition of households is also changing with an increase in the number of single parents.  These changes must be recognised in the design of houses in the private and public sectors with more emphasis on smaller dwellings and greater flexibility to meet the special needs of some groups.</P>
    <P>Proposals for greater housing density are viewed with concern by the Green Party because no distinction is made between greenfield development which increases urban sprawl and brownfield development which assists urban renewal.  Housing density cannot be addressed without properly addressing the issue of housing type.  The primary aim of urban renewal should be the maintenance and development of local communities.  Emphasis should be placed on the provision of low cost housing in inner city areas so that local people will not be excluded from new accommodation.</P>
    <P>We welcome the measure being proposed in relation to section 23 relief.  As long time critics of many of the flaws which undermined earlier urban renewal schemes, we are happy to see that many of those criticisms are now being accepted and given legislative redress.</P>
    <P>Imaginative housing policy can play a part in the regeneration of rural communities.  This has been demonstrated by the work of the voluntary agency, Rural Resettlement Ireland.  There should be greater involvement and greater Government support in helping to move people from towns and cities to the countryside where there is much vacant and derelict accommodation.</P>
    <P>Unless current housing policies are radically changed, it is likely that a two tier housing system will develop.  The upper tier will comprise owner occupied accommodation with householders in paid employment and the private rented accommodation occupied transiently by future owner occupiers.  The lower tier will comprise local authority <Col N="215" /> housing and low quality private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Guardian</i> yesterday an economist from a British university stated that, having looked at the economies in Europe in which there is a low rate of home ownership &mdash; he referred specifically to Switzerland and Holland &mdash; he has come to the view that low rates of home ownership are a help in terms of economic competitiveness.  As we enter the new millennium, in a new Ireland, in order to compete we may need a lower rate of home ownership.  That would be regrettable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In Cork, where building costs amount to £57 per square foot, one can purchase an apartment for £120 per square foot.  In Dublin it can cost anything up to £300 per square foot. That is the magnitude of the problem confronting us.  Builders in the capital are making huge profits which is a major factor in the increased price of residential accommodation in Dublin.  A bad example has been set in Dublin which is reflecting on the rest of the country.  I hope on Committee Stage to make a few suggestions to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are engaging in a Committee Stage style debate at 8.30 p.m. and I am sure the Chair will be open to any requests in that regard.  I will use the hour between 8.30 p.m. and 9.30 p.m. to elaborate on some of the points raised by Deputies.</P>
      <P>Dr. Bacon and his consultancy team looked at the whole problem in this area in order to try to develop a package of measures but he says quite clearly that no one individual measure taken alone will make a difference.  It is basically a question of supply and demand.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that the market rules in these matters.  It is no secret to the House, the public and, least of all, the officials in my Department that I believe in the market and market principles.  Many of the proposals in the report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we had persuaded the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not yet, and I do not think that will happen while I am in politics.  Bacon and associates are also convinced by market forces. The report, and the Government's response to it, are an attempt to tweak the market for a period of time to stop this mad escalation of prices by addressing some of the problems and redressing the existing imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out when I moved the resolution, if we allowed house prices to continue to rise at current rates, given Irish people's propensity to own their homes we would soon arrive at a very serious situation because people would inevitably come under pressure to meet their repayments. That pressure would filter over into pay adjustments which would decrease competitiveness.  We <Col N="216" /> would then lose our world market share which could set off an inflationary spiral.  That would also give rise to problems in the public sector pay area and Government finances, because public sector pay constitutes an ever increasing proportion of total Government current expenditure. That would create other difficulties which would mean we would have to reduce some social programmes to which we are committed.  We would also have to curtail tax reduction programmes which are an integral part of the partnership approach.</P>
    <P>The Government, in attempting to address this matter and taking on board the Bacon report, has tried to tweak the market in order to take some of the heat out of it.  However, neither Dr. Bacon nor I believe that any individual measure on its own can address this problem for all time.  People should bear that in mind when assessing the Government's response to this matter.  It seems, from the comments of some Members, that many people can take umbrage or offence at some of the individual measures and point out their downsides. However, as I said when I moved the resolution, we should not cherrypick measures because inevitably there will be hard luck stories.</P>
    <P>We are also trying, as far as possible, in the stamp duty regulations and in the Finance Bill, which will come before the House in a fortnight's time and which I hope to publish next week, to have transitional arrangements which should be adequate.  However, there are inevitably hard luck stories when any new scheme with cut off levels is introduced.  We must try to balance those as best we can with the overall objective of the Bacon report, which has been adopted by the Government, and the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Noonan's comments on the supply of and demand for residential property, I take heart from Deputy McDowell's comments that supply will not be cut.  The issue is clear.  If investors are taken out of the market, owner occupiers will be in a better position to purchase.  I find it hard to believe the supply will dry up because investors leave the market.  It is fair to say builders will not be able to charge as much, but I do not think there is any doubt they will be willing to sell to owner occupiers, many of whom have been priced out of the market by investors, as noted by Deputy Gilmore.</P>
    <P>Deputies Noonan and McDowell gave a cautious welcome to the reduction in stamp duty rates but felt measures could be better targeted for first time buyers.  A total relief for first time buyers of second-hand houses would cost in the region of £55 million.  Vendors would know if they were selling to first time buyers and that measure might lead to an overall increase in the price of second-hand houses for first time buyers. It was thought better to reduce the rates generally in order to open up mobility so that a first time buyer could get a leg on the housing ladder by buying a house vacated by an existing owner who decided to trade up because of the general reduction in stamp duty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> I readily recognise there is a danger that stamp duty reductions will be pocketed by the seller.  I referred to that danger on Committee Stage of the recent Finance Bill, and it has also been pointed out by other commentators.  However, as I said, this package of measures is to be taken together.</P>
    <P>The total stamp duty yield for property up to £60,000 in value was £38 million in 1997.  It is estimated that houses accounted for about 70 per cent of that yield.  This suggests that many houses costing less than £60,000 are sold, although I accept that the greater proportion of such houses are outside Dublin.  I hope the stamp duty exemption which I am introducing for such houses will make it more attractive to buy houses in need of refurbishment and thus increase the supply the houses available for owner occupation.</P>
    <P>One Deputy queried why most new houses were traditionally exempt from stamp duty.  One of the reasons is that new housing is subject to VAT at 12.5 per cent while second-hand houses are not.</P>
    <P>I agree that high standards of planning design and layout are required to ensure a good quality living environment in higher density developments. This point was made by Deputy Noonan and is of considerable importance to me. I represent North Kildare, which is the most densely populated area of that county.  There has been a major debate over the past two years between residents' groups and the councillors of Kildare County Council in regard to the rezoning of land.  This debate has held up development in the county but I have said publicly on many occasions that there are definitely two sides to the argument.  The question of housing density has been one of the points debated.  I am very conscious that when one refers to housing density, as the Bacon report does, one must bear in mind people's living environment.  I accept, however, that with good planning and design it should be possible to increase housing density.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government has commenced an initiative to promote higher densities, particularly in brown field sites near town centres, public transport nodes and access points, and has consulted with planning authorities, the architectural, planning and auctioneering professions and the house building industry in relation to the greater Dublin area.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has indicated planning guidelines will be issued in relation to residential densities.  In advance of this, planning authorities will be requested to promote increased densities in appropriate locations and will be advised of the safeguards required and the steps which should be taken in this direction.</P>
    <P>Deputies Noonan and McDowell said they were not in favour of the reduction in capital gains tax on the disposal of serviced land which is zoned residential.  I should point out this measure was proposed by the consultants whose report has been praised by several commentators.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> It is a targeted measure aimed at increasing the supply of land for housing.  As everyone recognises, the basic problem in the housing market is caused by an excess of demand over supply.  I am delighted Dr. Bacon came to the conclusion I reached a long time ago, which I put into effect on 3 December 1997, that high rates of any tax keep down supply.  I will be happy to continue to debate this point on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has not introduced the necessary proposals as speedily as I would wish to develop sport in Ireland.  Almost 12 months after his appointment we are still waiting for him to publish a drug testing and education programme for sport, the publication of the review of the report on outdoor leisure facilities and, of course, the most vital element in the development of sport, the long promised independent statutory sports council.</P>
      <P>When I was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for youth affairs and sport in December 1994 I quickly discovered that there was no overall plan for sport in Ireland.  I also realised that sport was not attracting adequate Exchequer or national lottery funding because of the absence of such a plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a businessman or businesswoman approaches a bank without an overall business plan he or she will not attract the necessary financial resources to develop his or her business.  A similar situation existed for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation because, in the absence of a plan, his efforts to attract sufficient funding was badly hindered. Many of the decisions made on sport were <Col N="219" /> of an <i>ad hoc</i> nature.  I quickly decided this had to change and I therefore set about developing a national plan for sport to ensure that, first, funding for sport is utilised to its optimum value; second, there is a formal plan to provide an attractive opportunity to participate in sport; and third, we enhance the avenues open to our sports people to develop their talents to their full capacity.</P>
    <P>John Treacy was appointed to compile a national plan and after wide consultation involving public meetings throughout the country and the receipt of almost 400 detailed submissions from organisations, the national plan was finalised and published in February 1997.  The establishment of the new statutory sports council was to be the key development consequent on the work of the strategy group which produced the plan.  The mandate for the new statutory sports council can be summarised as the promotion, co-ordination and development of sport in Ireland, and especially the playing of a lead role in this regard.</P>
    <P>The six main strands of the work of the new council, as recommended in the national plan, would be to deal first, with sport for young people; second, recreational sport or sport for all; third, high performance sport; fourth, sports facilities and natural resources; fifth, sports training and development; and sixth, the co-ordination of sport throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>Proposals contained in the Bill to achieve these objectives are included in the main functions of the proposed council as set out.  These functions are, first, to prepare and review periodically a national programme of action; second, to exercise a national management function in relation to ensuring the implementation of the national programme; third, to control and administer the funding of all national lottery funding allocated to sport and related activities; fourth, to prepare in relation to every financial year a statement based, as far as possible, on the national programme and including the requirements and proposals of every sporting and recreational institution in receipt of moneys from the State; fifth, to submit a statement, together with the council's observations and recommendations, to the Minister for further consideration after consultation with the Minister for Finance; sixth, to publish details of the financial allocations finally approved as a sports budget for the year in question, together with a report on the current status of a national policy for sport and the implementation of the national programmes, and these to be laid by the Minister before the Houses of the Oireachtas; and seventh, to advise on proposals for the provision of new facilities or the improvement of existing facilities and to report, as a major function, appreciation of the value of sport.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that Irish people love their sport and either play or follow a wide range of sporting activities.  However, sport has not yet managed to attract the necessary resources to <Col N="220" /> cater adequately for their sporting needs, which cover a wide range of activities including organised competitive sport, recreational sport and active leisure pursuits within the sport for all concept.</P>
    <P>The value of participation in sport and active leisure pursuits and the physical, psychological and social development of individuals is well documented and accepted.  Irish people have become increasingly concerned about issues affecting health and well being and are more aware than ever of the value and pleasure of physical exercise in sport.  However, this is not always accompanied by a readiness to take part in any form of regular exercise.  There is a need, therefore, to translate this awareness into regular participation.</P>
    <P>To achieve a balanced lifestyle, involvement in sport is essential because it is necessary for healthy living, enjoyment and socialisation.  It also has the capacity to promote increased economic activity, not only through the manufacture and supply of equipment but as an important and growing service industry within the community and as an asset in attracting foreign tourists.</P>
    <P>Outstanding performance by Irish sportspersons in the international arena increases morale at home and enhances the country's prestige and image internationally.  I congratulate Catherina McKiernan on her performance last Sunday.  It lifted the morale of people throughout the country, which was reflected in the joy and celebration at her success.</P>
    <P>A very important issue is the pressure on young people, who are often the target of drug pushers and criminals.  With youth services, sport provides an alternative source of entertainment, activity and interest for them.  They are the greatest preventative element in the fight against crime and drugs.  A modest investment in sport and recreation, especially in the activities of young people, avoids the need for even greater investment in prisons and health services to deal with the problems that can arise with young people subsequently if they are not attracted into positive activities.  That has been borne out in our communities and in every town and city.</P>
    <P>The main aims of any sports policy must be to facilitate individuals and groups to participate in physical recreation and sporting activity and to offer appropriate opportunities for every person, regardless of sex, age or ability, to continue the practice of sport and physical recreation throughout their life.  The basic aim of sports policy and the sports council will be to continue to ensure that people with an interest and ability have a chance to improve their standards of performance in sport and to make sport a career.</P>
    <P>The submissions received by the group which formulated the national plan for sport showed the depth of interest and involvement by thousands of volunteers throughout the country in a national effort which has not been properly supported, financed or developed.  The benefits of sporting activities and the breath and depth of <Col N="221" /> voluntary activity can be enhanced and supported by the work of a statutory council and can be evaluated in terms of health and lifestyle through the enhancement of levels of health and well being, the reduction of levels of illness and disease and the reduction of the incidence of accidents.</P>
    <P>The co-operation which exists between the two sports councils can be brought to a new level under the Northern Ireland Agreement in a social context, through the creation of a spirit of co-operation between the peoples of all of this island, irrespective of status, gender or ability, and through providing a positive alternative to a life of crime and social disaster.  Great potential exists to develop a programme of capital investment for Border areas and a programme of co-operation in relation to activities that would bring together coaching systems that often do not have the same accreditation.  There should be a specific programme where the Northern Ireland Sports Council and the proposed statutory sports council could come together to share a programme of development for all of the island.</P>
    <P>In the area of culture sport can be a significant and enriching part of Irish culture and identity. In the area of education it can be promoted through the development of physical potential as an essential part of the lifelong education of Irish people.  In the area of tourism it can be developed through providing a source of tourism earnings. Studies have shown that at least one third of visitors take part in some sports related activity during their stay and the availability of sports facilities is a major factor in decisions to holiday here.</P>
    <P>In terms of economic spin-off, sport is an important source of employment with major potential for expansion, which has not been positively exploited.  Sports related activities generate in excess of 11,000 full-time and part-time jobs or 8,000 full-time equivalent jobs.  The inclusion of sports spending on media, travel and tourism raises that figure to more than 18,000 full-time jobs together with the accompanying benefits to the State through PAYE, PRSI, VAT and other taxes.</P>
    <P>In the publication of the National Plan for Sport, of which the proposal for a statutory sports council is an integral part, the previous Government set aside £1.6 million per annum over a period of three years to allow the sports council to develop its activities.  Those moneys cover the cost of a technical sports team within the sports council who would launch and develop the work of the council.</P>
    <P>With the publication of the National Plan for Sport in February 1997, it was generally accepted by all political parties, which were all consulted, that a greater political effort should be made to develop sport and leisure here and that there should be greater co-ordination and centralisation of planning within Government, as many activities within the sport and the leisure sector were scattered through a number of Departments. For example, greyhound and horse racing <Col N="222" /> are the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Health and Children has certain responsibilities for sport in its health promotion campaigns, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation has responsibility to attract major sporting events to this country and the Department of Education and Science has responsibility for the development of sport in our schools.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to develop a greater level of participation in sport and leisure among all our children and that a proper introduction to sport and recreation is given to children at the earliest possible time in the education system.  I have used the argument that if a child develops an interest in sport at an early time in school, that child will remain involved throughout his or her life. Despite being in Government for nearly a year, I am concerned that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Minister for Education and Science have made no solid decisions on the role of sport in our educational system starting at primary level.  The unfortunate position is that at primary school level there are no official physical education sessions.  A number of aspirational speeches have been made, but I have been waiting months for the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation to give a commitment on one of the key principles of the National Plan for Sport, the development of sport in a greater way in our primary schools.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science should insist that the minimum specific time period per week for sport is adhered to in all primary schools.  At present, the regulations require that each primary school designate possibly one half hour per week to physical education, but I question if that is being adhered to.  I ask that this matter be examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science, who seems to have a bottomless source of funding, should have announced the appointment of physical education teachers in primary schools, especially those schools which are seriously disadvantaged. As a start the Minister could introduce a flexible system whereby physical education teachers could be appointed and shared among a number of primary schools in an area or shared between primary schools and secondary schools who may already have physical education teachers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation announced he will launch a new capital recreation scheme plan in the autumn.  I hope he will take into account the exercise initiated some time ago when I asked that a quantitative and qualitative analysis be carried out on facilities throughout the country.  The lack of facilities is a serious problem for many schools and a scheme should be developed where existing facilities and sports halls, which may be open for a few hours Monday to Friday and closed at the weekends, could be available to communities and community-based facilities should be available to <Col N="223" /> schools.  A little flexibility and an imaginative capital programme along those lines would deal with the problem over a period of years.</P>
    <P>It is only the presence of a statutory sports council with the necessary resources and staff, in conjunction with the relevant Ministers, that can drive a programme such as this.  There are about 850 physical education teachers in secondary schools throughout the country and only 50 per cent of all schools have a physical education teacher.  There is an urgent need for increased funding for more designated physical education teachers and every school should have access to a physical education teacher.  Recreation, physical education and sport are not among the current leaving certificate subjects, but they should be made part of that curriculum as quickly as possible and should be accredited, as the old axiom of no accreditation and very little evaluation is true in this case.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the large number of school sports facilities which remain closed and unused at evening time and at weekends. Insurance problems are often barriers to the use of those facilities, but often those problems are used as an excuse to keep those facilities closed to the surrounding community.  There is evidence of that in a very disadvantaged area in my city where ultra modern facilities are closed from Friday 3 p.m. No only are the gates padlocked, but the bars of the gate are greased to stop young people gaining access to those facilities.  We all have a responsibility to ensure that practice is eliminated.  If we made the maximum use of existing facilities, we could run an effective capital programme.</P>
    <P>This country needs a statutory sports council to deal with problems that confront our athletes who wish to compete at the highest national and international level and athletes who have disabilities and who need to develop their skills and abilities.  We need a statutory sports council to deal with the developing role of the National Coaching and Training Centre in the University of Limerick, which has its own board and is a vital cog in the development of sport in Ireland.  We need a statutory sports council sooner rather than later to deal with the issue of national, regional and local capital projects such as a 50 metre pool and a national stadium.</P>
    <P>A statutory sports council is the best body to deal with the various Government Departments and local authorities involved in the spatial development of our cities and towns.  A council could be the catalyst to bring about a total review of planning and development of lands in relation to, for example, the housing programme.</P>
    <P>Serious and grievous mistakes of the past must never be repeated in our towns and cities.  Any future major developments, such as housing schemes, must include adequate sport and recreational facilities.  There should not be random open spaces but planned facilities in housing estates.  The planning Acts and regulations must <Col N="224" /> be changed to give the planning authorities powers to impose conditions which will ensure the provision of sporting and recreation facilities in new developments and that private developers make a contribution towards the provision of such facilities.</P>
    <P>Exchequer and lottery funding for sport through the years has been inadequate to meet the needs of organisations and communities.  The publication and implementation of the national plan for sport must bring about greater State investment in the development of facilities. However, public investment must be coupled with private investment.  Only a statutory sports council with the expertise and staff can provide adequate structures to ensure that significant incentives can be put in place to attract private investment in sport.</P>
    <P>A new approach to the provision of facilities must be put in place with the use of State funding coupled with private investment.  Therefore, one of the priority issues to be confronted by a statutory sports council would be the encouragement of private enterprise funding.  The council must ensure that Government provides a greater incentive for private investors to invest in or donate funds to projects approved by it.  These incentives should include tax relief and allowances similar to the urban renewal and Temple Bar schemes.  Contributions to approved projects by private investors should be allowed for tax purposes and the use of covenants for sport and recreation projects should be considered. However, in terms of qualification for schemes, the sports council should be the certifying authority and co-operate with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure proper control of the schemes.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which proposes the establishment of a national sports council, provides the structures which will allow all this to happen over a number of years.  The previous Government brought about major changes in the funding arrangements for sporting organisations.  It also put forward the proposal to create new structures as outlined in the national plan for sport.  The impetus provided at the time must not be slowed down by lack of decisions.  I ask the Government to accept the Bill on Second Stage.  We should not divide politically on it and any differences can be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals outlined in the Bill by Fine Gael is that the allocation of capital grants to sporting projects from the national lottery should be taken out of the political arena.  All previous Governments have acted in good faith in the allocation of national lottery funds to sporting organisations.  However, the perception in the community is that political connections secure funding for projects rather than the merit of the projects.  The national sports council should have the responsibility of deciding how these funds should be allocated and 25 per cent of total national lottery funds should be allocated to sport over a number of years.  This was recommended <Col N="225" /> by the national plan for sport as the minimum public funding required for the proper development of sport in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a positive measure.  The Government and the Opposition should work in co-operation to develop an effective statutory council which would deliver a sporting infrastructure and a system which would address the needs of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which proposes the establishment of a national sports council.  I congratulate Deputy Allen on his research and the work he put into the Bill.  He gained his expertise in this area during his time as Minister of State with responsibility for sport.  Deputy Allen brought sport into the political arena during his time in office and applied the influence of politics to the co-ordination and development of sport.  He raised awareness of sport in the political arena.  He brought about the realisation that politicians and the Government have a role to play in developing sport.</P>
      <P>Sport has always been important in people's lives.  It was played in prehistoric times and is featured in various legends, for example, the legend of Fionn Mac Cumhaill.  The art of hurling has been modified and developed but it existed in prehistoric times.  People have been engaged in sport throughout the centuries and it is time it was developed in a co-ordinated manner.  Sport is most important to communities.  In rural areas, it is often the driving force behind the leadership of the communities.  The GAA has an important role in rural areas but other sporting organisations, particularly soccer and rugby associations, also play a major part.  I come from the Limerick city area where rugby is a major sport.  We had a great outing in Dublin last weekend and showed the people of this city how it should be played.  I hope they learn from us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Sport is an important issue in communities. People who are leaders in the sporting arena often become leaders in their communities and take on various roles.  It is surprising how often people who are good at sport and are involved in its administration become involved in community councils, the farming organisations and trade unions.  Sport plays an important part in urban and rural communities in terms of their development at local level.  I come from a rural area and I am most conscious of the contribution of sporting organisations to the life and pride of small local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sport is most important for children in terms of developing competitiveness, team work and the need to co-operate towards the objective of participating in and winning games.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Allen, mentioned the need to introduce young children to sport in a proper manner.  In this regard I pay special tribute to the work of the community games organisation <Col N="226" /> in developing sport.  I have been heavily involved in that area for many years at county level in Limerick and I am aware of the excellent work the organisation has done for young children who would not otherwise have had the opportunity to participate in various sports.  This is particularly the case for girls.  Boys had the opportunity to get involved in hurling, football or soccer at a young age but in rural areas there was often no outlet for young girls.  The community games organisation changed that position.  From age seven upwards they can participate fully in games, such as hockey, camogie, football and a range of other sports.</P>
    <P>Before the community games organisation, some children in rural areas did not know how to play certain sports, such as rounders.  However, people from the county organisation showed them how to play the games at an early age. Young people in rural and certain urban areas would not have had this opportunity but for the involvement, work and self-sacrifice of all those involved in the community games organisation since its foundation.</P>
    <P>We are now considering sport for all, right up to old age.  All people should have the opportunity to become involved in leisure activities involving sport.  The increase in the number of people playing golf is evident and it is particularly attractive to people over 30 years.  It is important that there is an opportunity for participation in sport for those who are past the age for competitive games.  Such an opportunity was available only to the elite in former times.</P>
    <P>Sport is very important for our national prestige. Deputy Allen mentioned successes such as Shannon and Garryowen last week.  Catherina McKiernan's victory brought national prestige to this country.  We all feel proud when our international athletes represent us with success abroad.  There was a great upsurge of emotion when Michelle Smith-de Bruin won Olympic medals and when Jack Charlton and his team won important games.  The nation is very proud of those achievements.</P>
    <P>Sport has a vital role to play in our lives.  It is important that a body such as the National Sports Council of Ireland, as proposed by Deputy Allen, should have full authority to co-ordinate, develop and plan for the future of sport and ensure adequate funding is available from the Government. Professional submissions should be presented to justify a greater level of funding for sport.  Funding from the taxpayer must be fully justified and evaluated.  A body such as that proposed would have a strong role in developing sport and the taxpayer would be proud to contribute to it.  The present level of funding, while much improved on that of previous decades, is totally inadequate.  Without the success of the national lottery, the cupboard would be bare.  The national lottery has encouraged and helped many local communities in developing sports facilities which their economic base would not allow them to do. Small communities and rural parishes have provided <Col N="227" /> excellent facilities with the help of the national lottery, to which I pay tribute.</P>
    <P>Young people, particularly young males, are under much pressure from society.  Greater involvement in sport would allow those people to express their frustrations and facilitate their well-being. As a person who has considered the pressures on young people through my involvement in the suicide association, I am amazed at the changes in society and the pressures on young people.  There are educational pressures, but society puts other pressures on young people which force them into alcohol and drug taking as a way of coping.  There is also peer pressure on young people to take alcohol and drugs.  Young people should be encouraged to express their frustrations through sports activities.</P>
    <P>I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Perry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Allen on this very important legislation, an Act to make provision for the promotion, co-ordination and development of sport in Ireland and for these purposes to establish a body to be known as the National Sports Council of Ireland to define the functions and provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.  Deputy Allen, in introducing this Private Members' Bill, aims to establish the National Sports Council of Ireland as a statutory independent State-sponsored body. That council would replace the existing Irish Sports Council and would be responsible for allocating national lottery funding to sports projects. The main proposal of the Bill, to take out of the political arena the allocation of capital grants to sporting projects from the national lottery, is a very important step.  The second main proposal is to restore funding so that 25 per cent of total lottery funds is allocated to sport, which is crucial. The national plan for sports recommended as a minimum requirement the proper development of sports throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael introduced this Bill to give effect to the national plan for sport recommendations because the Government failed to bring forward the necessary legislation, even though most of the preparatory work had been done by the previous Government.  I was disappointed the Minister, Deputy McDaid, indicated today that he would bring forward a Bill later in the year.  Now is the time to introduce such a Bill.  As we approach the new millennium, sport should be one of our biggest industries because it has a great deal to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lack of money and lack of planning are the major difficulties facing the development of sport. Lack of planning and structures in Government spending on sport was highlighted last year by one of the most comprehensive studies ever undertaken.  The overall thrust of the report, which amounted to 109 pages, is that there is a piecemeal approach to sport.  Funding for facilities and coaching, particularly at community <Col N="228" /> level, comes from a variety of sources such as the national lottery, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, local authorities and the private sector.  There are no structured links between those diverse groups.  There must be a co-ordinated approach to the funding of sport.  At present applications are made to various bodies for funding.  A comprehensive group dealing exclusively with applications would be much fairer.  There is need for the development of all sports facilities in the Republic.</P>
    <P>As a person who sold national lottery tickets, I am disappointed that in the past week, out of an allocation of £4 million to sports, not one application was granted in Sligo.  Three important applications were refused, one of which came from Banada where an application for £5,000 was turned down.  In Carrowroe in Sligo an application for a major sports facility incorporating soccer, Gaelic games and an all-purpose athletic track was turned down.  On my way to Dublin I heard on the radio that the institute of technology in Sligo applied for funding for an all-weather track on the college campus and that too was turned down.  I agree that 25 per cent of national lottery funding should be channelled into sport, but there should be a fair spread of funding throughout the country.  Applications should be considered on the basis of the number of national lottery ticket sales per county.  It is sad that not one pound of funding was granted to those much needed projects in Sligo.</P>
    <P>This week I was saddened to hear that the Equestrian games, which were due to be held in Ireland this year, had been abandoned because of a shortfall of £2.5 million.  This competition would have been staged at Punchestown and would have given a much needed boost to the equine industry, which needs a major promotion.</P>
    <P>It is sad that funding was not made available for the Youth Olympic Games.  Some 104 athletes and 35 officials were due to take part in this event.  We talk of buoyancy in the economy, surplus funds and huge sales of lottery tickets.  Funds since 1987 when the lottery started have declined. I compliment Deputy Allen on bringing forward this important Bill.  It would give control of funding to a statutory body which would assess each application.  I appeal to the Minister to accept Deputy Allen's Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend the apologies of Deputy McDaid, Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, for being unavailable this evening as he is on pressing Government business.  He asked me to come to the House on his behalf, which I <Col N="229" /> am pleased to do because I have a considerable interest in the area of sport and recreation and how it can impact on the lives of individuals and communities.  I will return to this issue in the course of my contribution.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Allen's speech in introducing the Bill and I commend him on his work in preparing it.  There is common ground between the Deputy and the Government on the desirability of legislation.  We also share the same overall objective of establishing an effective and dynamic sports council which will guide the development of sport into the 21st century. We both recognise the potential which sport has to offer in improving our society and are equally committed to ensuring that the State plays its part in capitalising on that potential.</P>
      <P>Having said that, it is still imperative for me to reject the Deputy's recent accusations that the Minister was engaging in a public relations stunt by presenting the heads of a Bill to the Government on the same day as he was publishing his Private Members' Bill.  Such comments demean the work he has undertaken in preparing this Bill and the public will not thank us for engaging in such politicising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also suggested that his Bill is a response to alleged Government inaction in bringing forward its own legislative proposals to give effect to recommendations in the National Plan for Sport.  As he well knows, nothing is further from the truth.  The importance of establishing a statutory sports council has been well recognised by this Government and is an intrinsic part of the programme for Government.  Work is well under way on the drafting of our sports council Bill and I am confident the Government's Bill will be brought to the House in the very near future.</P>
      <P>I am sure we can all agree that the question of who brings forward a Bill is unimportant. What is important, and what we are answerable to the public for, is the quality, effectiveness and durability of any legislation which we introduce.  In this respect, I am satisfied that the legislation which the Government proposes to bring to the House will represent the best way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot overstate the importance of getting right the various core components of any legislation that breaks new ground in institutional development.  In this regard, the Bill before the House is not the right beginning.  It lacks the clarity and precision required of such important legislation. At times, it is far too specific and at other times far too general.  It is poorly drafted and lacks balance, as between the need for having a council which, on the one hand, is in a position where it can exercise discretion in delivery of its services and on the other is fully accountable and responsible to the Minister and the Oireachtas for its actions.  In summary, the Bill is unworkable. <Col N="230" /> The resulting sports council would be totally ineffective in developing sport in the manner desired by both myself and the Deputy.</P>
    <P>An example should illustrate my point.  In relation to functions, the type of sports council proposed by the Deputy will be one very large organisation given the extent and nature of the functions he ascribes to it.  It will be involved in advising, promoting, co-ordinating, developing, preparing, managing, disseminating, controlling, administering, participating, organising, etc.  Furthermore, the Deputy proposes that the Minister be empowered to confer such additional functions on the council as he may consider necessary. I do not believe there are any additional functions available.  While I fully agree with the Deputy that we must have checks and balances in relation to the activities of the council, it is vital that we avoid tying the council up in a bureaucratic knot, which would be the result of the Deputy's Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government's legislative proposals for the establishment of a statutory sports council are at an advanced stage with the parliamentary draftsman's office.  These proposals, and not the Bill before the House, will see the creation of a dynamic statutory sports council responsible for the development of sport into the next century and one which will better meet the needs of the sports sector.</P>
    <P>I ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing his Bill on the understanding that the Minister will lose no time in bringing forward his Bill to the House.  I hope we will have his support when the Bill is introduced and I am sure the Minister will listen to all reasonable points put forward by him in the course of these debates.  If, on the other hand, the Deputy presses this to a vote on Second Stage, the Government will have no alternative but to oppose it.</P>
    <P>This is the first Government to recognise the value of sport and its potential for contributing to an improved society.  The Taoiseach stated in the Dáil on 26 June 1997:</P>
    <P>There will be a new Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation to which I propose to transfer responsibility for local development subject to further consideration and consultation. Sport is for the first time being given full Cabinet status.  I feel strongly that sport has the same importance for national well-being as, for example, arts and culture.  Recent successes have given us an international profile, which is also helpful to the promotion of our tourism industry.  We are not only talking about elite sports people who tend to receive the commentary but also giving people the opportunity to reach their potential.</P>
    <P>Reflecting this Government's general dynamic approach to the development and promotion of sport, the sports council Bill has been specifically included in the programme for Government.  It is concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to rapid action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> Let me give some examples of what has been achieved in the area of sport in the short time since the Minister and I took office, demonstrating that this Government has brought a new drive and momentum to the development of sport.  I emphasise that the Bill which the Minister will soon bring forward is but one of a series of measures towards this end.  It is part of a holistic approach which this Government has adopted to developing sport.  Essential for the success of this holistic approach is that all elements are developed in an integrated and unified manner.</P>
    <P>Sport has come to occupy an increasingly significant place in modern life worldwide.  Its impact extends far beyond the playing pitches and athletic grounds.  It has obvious benefits in promoting individual health and fitness as well as having a growing commercial and economic significance. Sporting achievements provide a morale boost for the country at large, focus international attention on our country and promote our image as an attractive place to visit and to invest in to generate new jobs.  Our high achievers in sport are excellent ambassadors for modern Ireland, typifying as they do the self-confidence and commitment of today's generation of young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has had the following achievements. He has been able to secure a doubling in Government funding for sport from £13 million in 1997 to £26 million this year.  Work is well advanced on a new card scheme for high performance athletes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Already started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; which is well advanced and will support and develop the higher performance sector of sport, including emerging young sports people.  It will also include scientific and medical support, career counselling, etc.  Work is also well advanced on a national anti-doping programme. Funding for national governing bodies has already been allocated and £4.9 million in national lottery grants has been allocated to over 220 projects throughout the country under the existing sports capital programme.  A review of the programme has begun in line with the commitment in the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>Excluding the Croke Park project, spending on sport will increase by 46 per cent this year.  As the first Cabinet Minister for Sport, the Minister is very proud of the fact that this is the biggest annual budget ever allocated by a Government for assisting developments in sport.</P>
      <P>The increase will allow the development of important new initiatives.  For example, the Government is particularly committed to tackling drug abuse in sport.  The Sports Council Anti-Doping Advisory Committee sent its report to the Minister before Christmas, and it is intended to make an important announcement in this regard in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost there.  The Deputy should be patient.  Crucially, and for the first time, money to tackle drug abuse in sport has been provided by the Government.</P>
      <P>The additional funding will also allow the Minister to introduce and systemise a range of supports to our most talented sportspersons.  The scheme, which is at an advanced stage of development, will be known as the international carding scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>It will assist top sportspersons to realise their full potential and to perform successfully at the highest international levels.</P>
      <P>Some £3.6 million was recently allocated to sports governing bodies.  These grants will go towards helping to meet a range of costs including organisational development, participation in major international events, hosting international events in Ireland and various equipment costs. The overall increased allocation allows for a 17 per cent increase in assistance for international competitions and training, reflecting the beginning of the build-up to the Centennial Olympics in Sydney.  All these grants have been approved under a new, revised allocation system launched last January to replace the previous fragmented system built up piecemeal, especially since the mid-1980s.</P>
      <P>The previous system required governing bodies to make separate applications for grant assistance under various different headings, such as organisation development, provision for international events, equipment grants, etc.  Under the new arrangement, these requirements are covered within a single composite application.  This benefits the governing bodies in that it facilitates better planning and targeting of programmes by the individual bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That was all done also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, the recent allocation is the earliest governing bodies have been made aware of the total level of funding available to them for any one year.</P>
      <P>This approach will further evolve over the next few years whereby strategic plans to be prepared by the governing bodies will also be taken into account when determining funding allocations. These plans will be required to be consistent with the Government policy priorities on sport including increased participation by young people, women and people with disabilities and increased participation in sport in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the £4.9 million recently allocated to over 220 new projects throughout the country under the sports capital programme, now under review, the Minister also secured an increase of £3 million in funding, £9 million in <Col N="233" /> total, available this year for expenditure on projects previously approved and due for completion by the end of the year.  This increase will facilitate speedy payment to clubs and groups who are currently completing or who have completed work on projects approved for grant-aid, including many approved prior to 1998.</P>
    <P>The sports capital programme provides national lottery funding towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  It is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of sport and recreational facilities and currently comprises the major facilities and recreational facilities schemes.</P>
    <P>The development of a quality infrastructure is crucial to the future of sport which makes this programme so important.  That is why my Department, having completed the examination of all applications on hands under the existing programme, is now beginning the review of the programme which the Minister announced in February last.  Once again, this is just part of the ongoing developments under way in the Department which aim to achieve the key priorities for sport and leisure as set out in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium. The review should be completed later this year when revised schemes will be widely publicised with clear eligibility criteria, and it will then be open to clubs and organisations to reapply for funding.</P>
    <P>A highlight during 1997 was the Government's decision to support the bid of Special Olympics Ireland to host the Special Olympics in 2003.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <P>As we all know, the Ryder Cup event has been won for Ireland for the year 2005 and the Government has committed almost £0.5 million over each of the next eight years to ensure the event is organised to the highest standards and the promotional value is maximised.  Enormous world-wide exposure for Irish golf will result from this outstanding achievement.  Indeed, in the past few weeks, agreement was reached with the Swedish Academy to use Ireland as a training camp for golfers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the Minister's key objectives is to broaden access to sport.  There is a great need to increase the level of participation in sports and leisure in the most deprived and disadvantaged areas.  We all recognise that sports and leisure alone cannot solve the drugs and crime problem. However, by providing motivation to young people in these areas, they can help foster a sense of confidence and self-esteem which can only assist in playing a vital role in the battle against drugs and crime.  The development of proper <Col N="234" /> facilities and the creation of a local level infrastructure will support the wider participation in sports and leisure activities.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, I have special responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's response to the drugs problem.  I am acutely aware of the benefits of sport as a preventative strategy in our efforts to tackle problem drug use, particularly among young people.</P>
    <P>The increased availability of drugs and their accessibility &mdash; due to reduced cost and prevailing social attitudes &mdash; has resulted in a situation where young people have become the most vulnerable category in terms of the threat drugs pose to individual communities and to society in general.  Sport plays a key role in reaching out to children and young people who are unattached and isolated from their communities and from the formal education and training services. Active involvement in sport and physical recreation has an important preventative role in relation to drug abuse, as well as anti-social behaviour and crime.</P>
    <P>Sports clubs &mdash; working in co-operation with other youth and community groups, statutory services and formal education &mdash; help to provide a coherent network of challenging and attractive opportunities for the marginalised, socially detached and economically deprived young person.</P>

      <P>I simply want to confirm that this Government provided the funding of £30 million. That was not easy to achieve but I am glad to have been part of the process whereby that money was provided.  The purpose of the fund is to develop youth sport and leisure facilities and amenities in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to exist.</P>
      <P>We are conscious that the provision of these facilities in itself will not necessarily attract young disadvantaged people &mdash; at risk of becoming involved in drugs &mdash; into more healthy and productive pursuits.  For that reason, the fund will also assist the development of strategies and services to encourage young people to use the facilities and amenities which will be provided under this initiative.  A sum of £30 million has been committed by the Government to the fund over the period 1998-2000 to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects.  Some £20 million of this amount is being targeted at those areas particularly affected by the heroin problem.  We are also actively encouraging the participation of the corporate sector in this initiative.  I am well aware that there is a huge willingness on the part of business to contribute to the social and economic development of our young people.  The detailed arrangements for the operation of the fund are currently being finalised and I will announce them in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The Government's sports council Bill will be introduced shortly and I can assure the House that it reflects detailed and careful consideration of the issues.  That is not to say that when the Bill is published the Minister will regard all of its provisions as written in stone &mdash; though they will be very solidly based &mdash; or that the Minister will not reflect carefully on what is said in this debate on Deputy Allen's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also spoken at some length about this Government's achievements in developing sport in the short period since its formation last year. These achievements are already a glowing testimony to this Government's belief in the importance of sport, not alone in terms of the achievements of our star performers but also with regard to the potential of sport for tackling the major <Col N="236" /> problems which beset society.  The sports council Bill which the Minister intends to bring to the House in the very near future is but one constituent of a multi-layered approach which this Government has taken towards the development of sport generally.  The public interest in this area, as in all areas of public policy, is best served by comprehensive and effective legislative proposals. When the Government's sports council Bill is published in the near future we will be in a position very quickly to put strong and effective legislation on our Statute Book.</P>
    <P>There is common ground between Deputy Allen and myself on the importance of introducing a Bill to establish the sports council on a statutory basis.  The commitment is specifically included in the programme for Government because of its importance.  It is not true, therefore, that the Minister has made any attempt to upstage Deputy Allen or that the Bill would not have come forward were it not for the Fine Gael Bill.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Deputy on his initiative in bringing forward proposals.  He has obviously put much work into the Bill and is, like me, motivated by a strong desire to improve the environment in which sport is promoted and developed. However, the proposals which the Government will bring forward will result in a more effective Act which will better meet the needs of sport.  For that reason, I once again ask Deputy Allen to consider withdrawing the Bill.</P>
    <P>No time will be lost bringing the Government's Bill to the House.  I am sure it will have the support of the Deputy when it is introduced and the Minister will, as always, listen to reasonable points put forward by him in the course of debates in this House.  However, if the Deputy presses this to a vote on Second Stage, the Government will have no alternative but to oppose it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the opportunity to speak in this debate.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Flood, has set out the Government's position on sport and I find it odd that Deputy Allen does not share our optimism and our commitment to developing sport as one of our greatest natural resources and an area of natural advantage to the Irish people over the years.  There appears to be some effort by Deputy Allen and his colleagues to take advantage of a situation to maximise publicity and be seen to be leading events.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen is very skilled in this area, as I witnessed as a journalist, and I congratulate him on bringing about this debate which is important and timely.  However, I cannot see how he could possible argue that this Government is not committed to sport.  The decision of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to bring <Col N="237" /> responsibility for sport to the Cabinet table is evidence of our deep commitment.  It is no secret that the Taoiseach is a sports fanatic.  He has matched his own interest and enthusiasm by hard action in appointing a Cabinet Minister for sport. It is interesting that he has not dealt with sport in isolation.  It has happened far too much in the past that sport has been relegated to a junior ministry. By putting it at the Cabinet table and giving the new Cabinet Minister for sport a mix of responsibilities involving local development, tourism, sport and recreation, Fianna Fail's deep commitment to the development of sport is evidenced. It shows also that we are approaching this issue in a very focused way.  It is important that sport is not seen in isolation, as something that is watched on television by couch potatoes, but is an integral part of social policy and policies on the development of tourism.  If we are to attract visitors to our country in a modern age, it is very important we have the right facilities which, more often than not, are sports and recreational facilities, and the infrastructure to support them.</P>
      <P>More important, it is very important that sports policy be run in tandem with the development of social policy.  Sport on its own will not solve the drug problem or the problem of social disadvantage. In the constituency that I share with the Minister of State, there are disadvantaged communities that have no access to vital facilities and infrastructure which is so important for the development of youth.  We have made a commitment to the youth development fund, which has been increased to £30 million.  That is a positive step that has been welcomed by every drugs task force around this city and, I would argue, in the areas of Cork represented by Deputy Allen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Allen on the timely way in which he introduced this Bill.  It has led to a discussion and the Government will be introducing its proposals in time.  It is very timely to have a debate in the context of the peace process.  It is no accident that the North-South bodies will deal with this area specifically.  It is high time we as a country, North and South, look at ways in which we can co-operate and share our infrastructural facilities with a view to hosting a major international sporting event.  This would have huge significance in terms of revenue and projecting the country overseas.  Some years ago Deputy Gay Mitchell championed the idea of Ireland hosting the Olympics.  It may have been ambitious and it may have been before its time, but it was a timely reminder of the commitment we should be ready to make to sport and that we should reach for the stars by trying to get a major event of that kind.  The European Soccer Championship might be a very realisable goal in the context of an all-Ireland approach whereby North and South could co-operate in providing facilities, stadia, etc.  I appeal to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to set such an ambitious target, put the infrastructure in place, and try to achieve it.  Some people would argue that the <Col N="238" /> infrastructure is already there, the stadia and the mix of soccer and Gaelic Athletic Association games and that we may be in a position to host such an event.  We should set such an ambitious target and, in the vernacular, go for it.</P>
    <P>In the context of North-South bodies, I hope some effort will be made to unite the Irish soccer teams North and South of the Border so that we can make a fuller competitive challenge for a major international honour at European Championship and World Cup level.  This would be very welcome and could be facilitated quite easily. I appeal to the Minister to do something, to knock heads together if possible, and bring about a united Irish soccer team to face into the outside world.  That would be an important way of protecting ourselves on the international stage.  I do not need to go back over, for the Members here, the advantages that accrued to this country as a result of our participation in the World Cup and the European Championship previously.</P>
    <P>This Government's commitment is clear.  We have given £20 million for Croke Park to be developed as a national stadium and that is a very important contribution, despite the criticisms that have been levelled against it.  In my own area there are a great many clubs like St. Jude's, Faugh's and St. Mark's who have pitches which are not under their own control.  The Minister should look at the possibility of allowing clubs to develop their facilities, even if it involves handing into their control local authority parkland.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Allen's timely contribution. It will not be supported by us because we have our own proposals which are more focused.  I hope, when this Bill has been defeated, he will look at what this Government is doing and see that we are progressing this whole area to the advantage of the nation.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Allen who, as Minister of State with responsibility for sport in the Department of Education, put a great deal of work into legislation dealing with the National Sports Council of Ireland.  This Bill is not perfect, and I will refer later to some of its imperfections, and while it is obvious it could be improved and amended on Committee Stage, I am surprised at the Government's attitude that it will vote it down if we are not prepared to withdraw it on the basis that it has a better Bill.  We shall have to wait and see what that Bill is like.  A great deal of work has gone into the preparation of Deputy Allen's Bill, much of it gained from his experience as Minister of State with responsibility in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party fully supports legislation to establish a National Sports Council of Ireland <Col N="239" /> because sport is an essential part of life.  We have a proud sporting tradition and, in recent years especially, we have broadened the range of sporting events in which we have achieved international excellence.  Not only have our sportsmen and women excelled in their various fields but our fans and supporters have also added to the enjoyment and colour which accompanies these magnificent events across the globe.  In that regard and like other speakers, I pay particular tribute to Catherina McKiernan who has brought joy to us all and tremendous pleasure and pride in her achievement of winning the London marathon. She and many other great athletes of recent times are an indication that, with recognition from the State in the form of assistance of the important contribution sport can make through the medium of a statutory sports council, these people would go on to surpass some of the better athletes in the world.</P>
    <P>This international excellence has been accompanied by an expansion of the range of sports in which people can engage.  This is a welcome development as it increases participation and allows all sections of the community to be involved in sport.  However, it also presents us with certain challenges and we must recognise this and institute structures which accommodate and encourage the development of sport.  To a certain extent, our sporting culture has developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  The previous Government recognised this fact and took effective steps, through Deputy Allen, to rectify the situation. The document The Views of the Irish Sports Sector on the Future Development of Irish Sport and the other document Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland were critically important in the provision of a national sports strategy.  I place on record my appreciation and that of the Labour Party for the work John Treacy and the members of the strategy group carried out in providing us with a comprehensive framework in which to develop our sporting policy.  The proposal for a statutory sports council was a central part of the strategic action plan for sport contained in Targeting Sport Change in Ireland and triggered Deputy Allen's initiative in publishing this Bill. The Labour Party fully supports the recommendation of that report and will support this Bill, even though we would like to see amendments to it.  A sports council should be established on a statutory footing as soon as possible as it will form a key element of our future sports strategy.</P>
    <P>However, there are aspects in the publication of this Bill which concern me.  In its recently published legislative programme, the Government indicated its intention to publish an Irish Sports Council Bill.  This coincided with the publication of the Fine Gael Bill.  I sincerely hope no party in this House seeks to make a political football out of the issues.  We need effective legislation which will support and promote the development of sport and which will achieve the necessary widespread cross-party support necessary in both <Col N="240" /> Houses.  We do not need the issue to be used to the advantage of one side or the other because the major participants in sport, and Deputy Allen is aware of this more than anyone else, are the countless thousands of people involved on a voluntary basis.  Those people need our incentive, our assistance and our understanding.  They include parents and others throughout the country directly involved in the various sporting federations which give so much enjoyment to so many people.</P>
    <P>Turning to the detail of the Bill, there are a number of points to which I would like to draw attention.  I know Deputy Allen will not take offence because it is our intention to accept this Bill and improve it.  Section 5 deals with the functions to be undertaken by the proposed National Sports Council.  There are a number of serious omissions in this section which, if it did reach Committee Stage, which I doubt having listened to the Minister, the Labour Party would seek to address by way of amendment.  For example, there is no specific reference in section 5 to the promotion of sporting opportunities for people with disabilities.  These were referred to by the Minister.  This is a serious omission and one which I find hard to understand.  It is possibly an oversight, but it needs to be addressed.  When the number of voluntary groups and special olympics which are held throughout the country are taken into account, it gives an idea of the need for sporting outlets for people with disabilities.  We must ensure that any statutory body with responsibility in the area of sport has a responsibility for the promotion and co-ordination of sport and that that duty is explicitly laid down in legislation.  Any Bill which fails to do so is flawed.</P>
    <P>Another serious omission in section 5 is that the proposed council is not explicitly empowered to ensure the codes of conduct and ethics of good behaviour for those involved with children in sport are developed on a voluntary basis with sporting organisations.  Deputy Allen made a major contribution in the publication of this code of ethics in 1996 and to the committee which I chair, which has held meetings with various sporting organisations over the past number of months.  He knows as well as I the importance of that code of ethics and its improvement and adoption as a binding code on people because it is voluntary at the moment.  From our experience, we know the great sporting organisations, especially the larger ones, have all admitted they have major difficulties in communicating to the various levels, especially club level, the need for a code of conduct and ethics in the behaviour of people involved in sport.  This code of conduct is not only for the protection of children in sport but also for the protection of many adults involved with them.</P>
    <P>The recent revelations regarding sexual abuse in swimming are a potent reminder of the damage certain depraved individuals can inflict on children when they assume positions of power.  Sporting organisations are open to infiltration by these <Col N="241" /> individuals and we must do all in our power to protect our children from such abuse.  On foot of the revelations of the Derry O'Rourke court case and subsequent information provided to me by people involved in swimming, I initiated a review of the code of conduct by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation. This has proved to be a timely and valuable exercise and one in which all committee members have played a major role in teasing out the difficulties. When we complete our review the information received will play an important role in the development of quality in this area.  I pay special tribute to all those who, at our invitation, gave evidence at the committee.  Some of the most important sporting organisations freely exchanged views with us on the code of ethics and good conduct, particularly in regard to children, in sport.</P>
    <P>We should never under estimate the damage abuse, such as that which occurred in certain Irish swimming clubs, can do.  I am sure all speakers in this debate will allude to the value of sport in the development of the individual and communities. This is true in all constituencies throughout this great country.  I am pleased that in terms of the cross-Border organisation that will be set up, sport has been mentioned as a suitable area for co-operation between North and South.  I look forward to setting up that joint arrangement between the two Administrations.</P>
    <P>Developments at community level are essential. However, all sporting organisations that cater for children operate on the basis of trust between parents and club.  If this trust is breached, as in the Derry O'Rourke case, confidence in the club and, by extension, confidence in the sport can collapse.  One has only to recall the concern expressed by so many people on radio and television in the wake of the O'Rourke case to realise the damage that can be done to an entire sport when sexual abuse is revealed.</P>
    <P>The sporting organisation that attended our committee recognised that on the law of averages no sport is exempt from such a tragedy.  For that reason they are all committed to adopting the code of ethics to ensure those involved on a voluntary basis are aware of the dangers and the procedures to be followed when such tragedies occur.  It is therefore essential that any sports council is explicitly given responsibility to oversee this critical area.  Unfortunately, the Bill fails to do that, but that could be addressed by way of an amendment.</P>
    <P>The Bill also fails to explicitly give powers to the sports council to withhold funding from sporting organisations which fail to comply with or adhere to established safety codes.  The Minister took this course of action in relation to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association and many believe the innocent suffered in that case.  Consideration should be given to transferring this power from the Minister to the new statutory sports council.</P>
    <P>The Bill also fails to explicitly charge the sports <Col N="242" /> council with targeting sporting policy at areas of disadvantage.  The two Government speakers referred to this matter.  This goes against the central philosophy behind our anti-poverty strategy which requires all policies to be proofed for their effect on poverty.  The Labour Party believes the Government has paid lip service to this requirement and I am disappointed Fine Gael has adopted the same lack lustre approach in this Bill. However, I accept Members referred to the fact that many people in disadvantaged areas do not have access to sporting activities.  If they had, it might help resolve the drugs problem.  Poverty is still a burning issue.  Chronic disadvantage is often at the root of crime.  The forthcoming publication by Professor Ivana Bacik and Dr. Michael O'Connell of Trinity College entitled &ldquo;Crime and Poverty in Ireland&rdquo; reveals shocking facts about the link between disadvantage and criminal activity.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about tackling crime we must tackle its causes.  We must take effective action to prevent a new generation of children being lured into the criminal underworld.  Sport forms an essential part of this policy and the sports council, set up on a statutory basis, should be charged with recommending policy initiatives in this area. However, the Bill does not provide for this.</P>
    <P>Youth and community workers speak to young people of the value of sport, and the team spirit it builds.  To date, however, communities most in need of quality sporting facilities still make do with poor facilities.  A previous speaker alluded to various activities in County Sligo.  County Tipperary and other areas also make a major contribution to lottery funding by way of ticket sales, but some excellent projects have not been supported. This cannot continue.  It should be the explicit responsibility of the sports council to address these issues in an autonomous, independent and non-political fashion.  I am sure Deputy Allen, who has vast experience in distributing lottery funding to sports organisations, will agree that they believe there is political patronage in the approval or disapproval of projects for funding, irrespective of their contributions to community life.</P>
    <P>Despite its defects the Bill is welcome and I hope it will put pressure on the Government.  I am sure most of the work of the parliamentary draftsman has been completed and that it is merely a question of incorporating this measure in the programme for Government.  We need to pressurise the Government to have this statutory council put on the political agenda and taken out of the political arena.  The Legislature should treat this important aspect of daily life with respect and thereby eliminate the political sniping that tends to take place about what one Government did and another did not.</P>
    <P>I am sure there is widespread agreement in the House on the need for a statutory sports council. I hope its members do not comprise only political appointees, but that a broad spectrum of people are represented on it.  The Bill refers to appointing <Col N="243" /> people with certain recognised expertise.  If it is approached in such a manner we will have done a good day's work by bringing it on to the political agenda.  I hope the Government responds quickly to the demands of the main Opposition party, which we support.  If the Bill is passed, I am sure the committee which I chair would be willing to amend it as appropriate to get it on to the Statute Book.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this debate.  The Government's response to this issue is not what I would have wished.  It is half-hearted and does not include any long-term strategic thinking.  For too long there has been a lack of long-term planning in this area.  We should have seen this coming years ago.  It is typical of public policy.  This last census was carried out in 1996 but there was already evidence that because of the buoyant economy we were beginning to see significant numbers of people coming back into the country with significant amount of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been significant increases in GDP every year since 1993.  It has been the policy of successive Governments to support our entry into EMU and we knew that there would be some stabilisation of interest rates and that they were on a downward spiral.  However, no one took account of this and it is typical of public policy <Col N="261" /> that so little long-term strategic planning goes into this area.</P>
    <P>This is a complicated problem.  By definition it is multifaceted and there are many variables.  It is difficult to pin down one simple solution and I sympathise with the Government's dilemma. However, the package of measures announced last week &mdash; Action on House Prices &mdash; will not go any way to reduce prices, particularly for first time buyers.  No one can predict the future and I do not have a crystal ball.  However, I do not believe that last week's response was a comprehensive reply to the housing crisis because the Minister failed the grasp that there are three important groups in this equation.</P>
    <P>For the first time buyer, the interest rate reductions and much of the change in stamp duty will be nullified this year.  The consequences of last December's expansionary budget will yield more disposable income.  It will be cheaper to borrow money than it was last year.  As a result, many of the changes in stamp duty will have no beneficial effect.</P>
    <P>The second group most affected by the housing crisis are those on local authority housing lists. Some months ago I highlighted the problem whereby local authority housing lists have increased by 30 per cent since the last housing Estimate in 1996.  This is creating chronic problems of overcrowding, hassle in families and the plethora of problems associated with bad housing conditions.  We do not see any adequate response in the Government's plan.  It is also the case that rents could rocket in the private rented sector as a consequence of this package of measures and the Finance Bill.  There is no sign of this in the Bacon report and the Government seems unwilling to recognise the problem.  However, we could be discussing a new Bacon type report on the crisis which could emerge in the private rented sector unless we get our act together.  It is going to push bills through the roof and lead to more overcrowding within the sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response lacks measures to deal with the key problem of affordability.  If there was a massive increase in house building programmes by local authorities I could believe that there was a commitment by the Minister and the Government to do something about this problem.  If I saw the planning legislation which the Minister talks about coming before the House I could say that there was some attempt by the Government to deal with this problem.  However, that is not the case.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the action plan, after proposals 1 to 6 we see all kinds of waffle such as, &ldquo;The Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal will consider the scope for the private rented sector in relation to a proposal.  The Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal will bring this recommendation to the attention of the appropriate body&rdquo;.  One of the recommendations is to increase the staff levels of planning and development departments.  The plan states: &ldquo;Greatly increased financial resources under the new system <Col N="262" /> of local government finance will enable local authorities to devote increased resources to planning development and control&rdquo;.  This is not pinpointed or ring-fenced.  It is an aspiration as are many of the proposals after No. 7.  There is no content.  If, at the same time as he produced these measures, the Minister had produced new planning legislation or told us of the plans for the capital house building programme and new start programmes for local authorities I would have said there was a serious effort to deal with the problem of affordability.</P>
    <P>The average price of a house in Dublin in 1993 was £59,000.  If a couple on average incomes were both contributing they would spend just over 13 per cent of their disposable income on the mortgage. That figure is now 30 per cent.  If one is buying a house by oneself the figure is 54 per cent.  These figures show no hope for the first time buyer and it is clear that there is little hope offered by the Government's package for the first time buyers.</P>
    <P>The real problem with stamp duty is not the tinkering with rates at various house prices.  It is that first time buyers need a significant proportion of the cost of the house up front.  A deposit of 10 per cent is required.  Before April 23 the stamp duty on a £110,000 house was 6 per cent.  It is now being reduced to 4 per cent but a 10 per cent deposit is still required.  In effect, the rate change is a reduction from 16 to 14 per cent. If the Minister wants to give first time buyers an opportunity to get into the market they now need 14 per cent of the average cost of a house of £105,000 up front.  That is the reality for the first time buyers in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael proposal would have been pro first time buyers.  In abolishing stamp duty it would have had a huge beneficial effect for first time buyers.</P>
    <P>A wrong move was made in the budget in regard to capital gains tax.  The Minister has proposed changes to capital gains tax in terms of development land over the next four years.  When he made an announcement concerning the rate change to CGT in the budget last December for residential property, why did he not specify a number of years?  I could understand if he said he was changing CGT for residential properties for a period of two or three years to flood the market with a supply of houses.  However, the Minister did not specify any time frame with regard to a move which was generally unexpected.  I suspect even his officials did not expect it.  Why is it that for one aspect of CGT changes there is a four year time limit while another aspect of CGT changes is open ended?  Perhaps the Minister will explain the reason for this.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question in the House some weeks ago I was informed that the Government had £35 million to spend on new serviced sites.  We have now been informed that the amount will be increased to £85 million which I welcome.  Am I correct in believing that the £35 million fund is applicable only for the next three years or is the <Col N="263" /> £85 million to be used over the next three years? When will we get an announcement about that? It is another example of the problem at the core of this document.  It is not integrated, it is not comprehensive and does not deal directly with the totality of the problem of the housing shortage and particularly the problem of affordability.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago we had various discussions and arguments with the national press about the first time buyers grant but the Minister's statement does not refer to it.  We all accept £3,000 is not a huge sum of money.  There has been no increase in the first time buyers grant.  Does the Minister want the grant abolished?  If the Minister was serious about helping first time buyers he should have made a significant change to the grant and increased it on the basis of a certificate of reasonable value, as in the past.  The Minister could specify that new homes be of reasonable value in terms of price and construction.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with the broader questions of planning density, development and the role of the regional authorities.  The Government has tinkered with the issue and made some changes, most of which could have been put in place in last December's budget.  There is a great sense of disappointment among first time buyers.  I recognise the Minister's problem but when he had an opportunity to put the resources for first time buyers firmly on the agenda he failed.  Coupled with the mistake he made last December on the capital gains tax side for the sale of residential property, this does not add up to anything significant for the housing market.  The key problem is one for local authorities.  There is a crisis in the local authority sector which has increased by 30 per cent in the past two years and there has not been any response from the Government.  While I recognise that something was done, much more needs to be done.  We will take this matter up in the weeks and months ahead.</P>

    <P>Galway County Council has forwarded a proposal to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the town of Tuam which I hope will be successful.  In the city and county of Galway residential development is proposed for 500 acres of land.  The major problem in the city and in the environs is that land has become so expensive that people are trying to get sites outside the city.  The type of scheme operated by SFADCo in the midwest and in some towns of County Galway where three housing schemes &mdash; two of which were Monivea and Menlough &mdash; were built, under the direction of Fr. Harry Bohan, should be promoted as a good example of community housing or a housing co-operative.  It is being suggested in Galway that if young couples are to get houses they will have to get <Col N="264" /> land outside the city boundaries and form a co-operative to have houses build.  All the infrastructure is available.  One does not have to wait for massive sewerage schemes to be put in place before such a housing co-operative can proceed. This was proved by Fr. Harry Bohan and SFADCo.  I hope the proposals will ensure that housing co-operatives and housing estates will be available for young couples.  I hope Galway County Council will zone some of this land for residential purposes and that this type of housing can be provided.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the population in Galway will increase from more than 57,000 to 76,250 by the year 2116.  That is a challenge for local authorities and the Government.  The question of decentralisation which was successful in the 1980s has been referred to.  Yesterday, I was at a launch of a report by the Council of the West at Horan International Airport, Knock where we talked about a new deal for regeneration.  This report is about the western region and attempts to bring us up to date on the facts and figures concerning rural depopulation.  It was pointed out that the three regions &mdash; the west, the Border counties and the midlands &mdash; which have half the land mass have only one-quarter of the population.  To counteract this it is necessary to develop water and sewerage schemes to ensure the infrastructure is available for housing.  The GDP has fallen in those regions in comparison with other parts of the country.  What the council for the west said yesterday will ring a bell with all of us particularly western representatives who must ensure the infrastructure is in place to ensure the housing schemes are set up.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's mention of such regeneration in his proposals and I hope we have more success introducing these housing schemes to rural areas.</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether the most useful thing would be to use the remaining hour in a Committee Stage format because some Deputies wish to contribute to the general debate which was curtailed at 7 p.m. I will ask the Minister a couple of questions rather than taking him through the resolution paragraph by paragraph. When he rescheduled stamp duty for residential property did he consider not making it cumulative? As it is structured, a house costing less than £60,000 is exempt but a house costing £60,001 is liable for stamp duty for the full amount rather than just the amount over the limit.  A more normal way to structure stamp duty would be to apply it only to the amount over the £60,000 limit. This seems a peculiar way to reschedule stamp duty and it will distort the market.  There are a series of limits in the schedule and if a house costs slightly over a limit, that portion above it will be paid under the table in cash.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It seems to make more sense than paying duty on the whole amount when going over the threshold.  I know this has grown up historically but when the Minister went to the trouble of restructuring he might have introduced a more understandable application of stamp duty.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister comment on Part I, paragraph (7) of the Schedule, dealing with non-residential property?  He is applying an exemption of up to £5,000, a 1 per cent rate up to £10,000, etc. Perhaps he could inform the House how this is changed from the existing provision.  The schedule of stamp duty which will apply to residential property has been well explained and publicised, but the schedule for non-residential property applies rates of 1 per cent, 2 per cent and 3 per cent to different values.  Is he introducing new provisions or reinstating the existing provisions? Could he do the same on Part II of the Schedule, dealing with the arrangements for leasing &mdash; in other words, is he reinstating the present position or introducing new law and a new regime?</P>
      <P>In the resolution itself, could he indicate how one computes the stamp duty on a shop with owner occupied residential accommodation above it?  For instance, if the owners of a pub lived over it and the building was sold, how would the stamp duty be computed?  Alternatively, how would stamp duty be computed on a shop or pub, over which there was a flat which was not owner occupied but rented out?  What happens if a builder, rather than selling a completed house for a particular price, divides it into two transactions &mdash; selling the site and then charging the cost of building the house?  The Minister will be aware that practice occurred about ten years ago; the loophole in that regard was closed but was that closure carried into the resolution?  If the transaction is split, how will stamp duty be computed under the new regime in these two instances: first, if the house is owner occupied; and second, where the house is rented?</P>

      <P>I will deal with Deputy Noonan's questions first and then return to those raised in the generality of contributions.  Some of these questions are quite technical.  The Deputy suggested applying to stamp duty a regime similar to that for income tax personal allowances.  The <Col N="266" /> reason for not doing so is the cost, which would be of the order of £50 million per annum<i>.</i> Stamp duty earns considerable revenue for the Government and the cost of introducing such thresholds &mdash; which I am sure Dr. Bacon considered &mdash; would be enormous.  The advantage of the stamp duty regime as it currently applies is that when the house price is above a threshold the duty kicks in at a certain rate and the State gets the full yield.  The Deputy knows it is costly to increase personal allowances in the income tax code; it is equally costly to do it in the stamp duty code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Bacon and Associates approached this from the viewpoint of freeing up the second hand market.  Their report proposed a schedule of new stamp duty rates.  Up to now, stamp duty applied to all transactions.  This measure is doing what Dr. Bacon proposed &mdash; putting a partition between stamp duty on residential property and stamp duty on other property. His theory is that rebalancing the stamp duty rates will free up the supply.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will note we made small adjustments to the rates Dr. Bacon proposed, such as different cut-off levels for the 3 per cent rate which we thought would be better.  We did not look at it from the viewpoint of a revenue earner; between ourselves and the Department of the Environment and Local Government we thought the gaps specified by Dr. Bacon were too wide and that it was fairer to do it in the other direction. I think most people recognise that.  He approached this problem from another angle.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, on Committee and Report Stages of the Finance Bill, he and I put forward ideas about stamp duty practices.  I am of the view that a lot of this money will go to the seller, which is a difficulty.  I recognise the potency of Dr. Bacon's argument &mdash; he maintains that the rebalancing of stamp duty since the introduction of residential property tax and the outgoing Government's imposition of new rates has stopped the flow at the higher end, discouraged people from trading upwards, and slowed down the market, which is why he talks of rebalancing it this way.  I have not met Dr. Bacon, either when I was in Opposition or in Government.  I did not even speak to him when I was a member of and he was a consultant to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  However, from reading his report I can see the line he took on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Part I, paragraph (7) of the Schedule Deputy Noonan raised an interesting question about splitting a pub or shop from the residence above it.  An explanatory note to be issued by the Revenue Commissioners tomorrow will deal with this point.  For the benefit of Deputies and Senators, <Col N="267" /> 98 per cent of whom &mdash; myself included &mdash; know little about stamp duty, it states:</P>
    <P>In a mixed property situation, however, the residential part will no longer be aggregated with the non-residential part for the purposes of determining the appropriate rate of stamp duty.  A mixed property includes a property part of which is residential and part non-residential (e.g. living quarters over a shop) or two or more properties one of which is residential and the other non-residential (e.g. a shop and a house).</P>
    <P>Example: A building is bought for £500,000. It comprises a retail shop at ground floor level and residential apartments overhead.  The amount of the consideration attributable to the residential apartments is £200,000.  Stamp duty will be chargeable on the conveyance as if two separate properties were being conveyed.  The residential apartments will attract duty of 5 per cent on £200,000 and the non-residential part will attract duty of 6 per cent on £300,000.</P>
    <P>Example: Two separate premises are bought as part of a larger transaction &mdash; one is a house and the other is a bakery.  The consideration is £45,000 for the house and £55,000 for the bakery. The house will be exempt because it is under the threshold.  Duty of £2,750 will be chargeable on the bakery (£55,000 × 5 per cent).</P>
    <P>Example: Two separate premises are bought as part of a larger transaction &mdash; one is a shop with living quarters overhead and the other is a house.  The consideration is £30,000 for the living quarters and £45,000 for the shop.  The consideration for the house is £65,000.  Stamp duty is chargeable as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;living quarters (£30,000 × 3 per cent as the aggregate consideration for the residential property is £95,000)</P>
    <P>&mdash;shop (£45,000 × 4 per cent &mdash; no aggregation between non-residential and residential property)</P>
    <P>&mdash;house (£65,000 × 3 per cent as the aggregate consideration for the residential property is £95,000).</P>
    <P>I am sure the explanatory note will be of great benefit to members of the solicitors' profession.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to paragraph (7) of Part I of the Schedule.  Paragraphs (1) to (6) introduce the new rates for residential property while paragraphs (7) to (13) reimpose the existing 1 per cent to 6 per cent rates for non-residential property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no variation in the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Would the Department of Finance dream of doing such a thing?  The opportunity has not been availed of.  The principle of partition between residential and non-residential <Col N="268" /> property applies.  Paragraph (14) provides relief for transfers between close relatives.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) of Part II of the Schedule, which deals with leasing, introduces the new rates applicable to residential property while paragraph (aa) reimposes the rates of 1 per cent to 6 per cent for non-residential property.  The same principle applies.</P>
      <P>In the past the proposal that the stamp duty structure should be changed in line with the income tax structure was examined but it was considered that the cost to the Exchequer, of the order of £50 million, would be too high.  Dr. Bacon did not come at the problem from that angle, rather he approached it with a view to freeing up the supply side.  Each Member has an opinion on whether some of the measures proposed will achieve this.  The Deputy knows my opinion on the stamp duty changes.  He made a good case on Committee and Report Stages for acceptance of his own proposals which were the subject of an interesting debate.  I share his view that in the longer term market forces will decide all these matters.  I am a marketeer not alone in this area but in many others also.  Dr. Bacon recommended that, through a combination of forces, the market should be tweaked to free up the supply side.  That is what the Government is trying to do.</P>

      <P>The proposed changes to stamp duty charges represent an important first step to arrest house prices which are spiralling out of control.  I got the distinct impression listening to Deputy Hayes that the problem started after 26 June last year.  Prices have been rising for a number of years.  The previous Government had ample opportunities to do something about it during its term of office.  This is an excellent proposal.</P>
      <P>When we come to discuss the Bill to be introduced in the next couple of weeks I hope the Minister will consider extending the first-time buyer's grant to second-hand houses.  I disagree with a number of the proposed measures because they do not go far enough and perhaps will damage another part of the industry.  I am referring specifically to the disallowance of interest offset against rental income.</P>

      <P>I do not have a problem with the supply side proposals made by Dr. Bacon.  In general, <Col N="269" /> as a package, they will probably increase the supply of building land available.  I do not think he could have done much else.  The point which has been missed is that supply and demand are not two separate entities but are inextricably linked.  The penalties which the Minister is applying are an attempt to increase supply by restricting demand; for example, by removing the private investor from the new house market by imposing stamp duty and disallowing interest as a relief.</P>
      <P>If a builder builds 150 houses in my town, 40 per cent of them will be bought by small investors. The theory is that those 150 houses will now be available to owner occupiers, especially first time buyers.  However, in practice the builder will reschedule his building programme and rather than building 150 houses in 12 months he will build them over a year and a half or two years. He will effectively wind down his supply to meet the demand.</P>
      <P>It is a fallacy to think that building activity will remain at current levels after this package is introduced and that it is possible to build on present activity to increase supply.  Interfering with the demand side automatically interferes with the supply side.  I am extremely worried, especially by the provision that interest relief will no longer apply to small investors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the proposals in regard to supply. However, in regard to the tax relief on borrowing for residential investment, will the Minister agree that the payment, prior to the announcement, of a deposit on a property for such use should be seen as a contract?  Such payments were made under the then law and it would be only fair to permit their being regarded as a binding contract.

I have already tabled questions in this regard to the Minister, but I ask him to acknowledge the level of house prices in the greater Dublin area, as was highlighted in the Bacon report.  I welcome the zero rate of stamp duty for houses up to a value of £60,000 but there are no such houses available in the Dublin area. I ask for the introduction of a special measure to recognise the price of houses in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that this exemption for houses worth under £60,000 would have an effect on first time buyers, which it might do in rural areas.  However, I ask him to abolish stamp duty on all houses bought by first time buyers in the city area because of the lack of new housing.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan's analysis of the situation was a very good intellectual argument and I agree with much of it.  However, the proposals in the Bacon report are a short-term attempt to allow first time buyers an opportunity to enter the market. The price increase resulting from supply and demand being out of sync has prevented owner occupiers from entering the market.</P>
      <P>The measures in the Bacon report will have a depressing effect on investors entering the market. According to economic theory, that should allow owner occupiers to enter the market because builders will have to reduce their prices &mdash; or, at least, not increase them &mdash; as a result of not being able to sell houses to investors.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan made his points very well.  He is a practical person from County Limerick and I am a practical person from County Kildare and we both have views on the matter.  That should be the result of the package of measures, according to economic theory, but we will have to wait and see.

      <P>What we are now seeing is a symptom of the problem forecast by rural Deputies some years ago when we said the IDA was directing all industry towards Dublin.  Some of the biggest electronics firms in the world are now located in Dublin and there is a very buoyant financial services centre.  As a result, some people are earning very high wages in Dublin and they are prepared to pay high prices for houses.  The only way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As people's families grow and salaries increase they want bigger houses in more exclusive areas and there is constant mobility in the housing market.  The only way to meet that demand is by supplying more houses.  It is possible to offer incentives but house prices will only reduce in the long run if there is a glut of houses on the market.</P>
      <P>The Minister has always been very forthcoming and flexible in these matters, probably much against the advice of his civil servants at times.  In north Kerry we are trying to encourage people to build houses and to increase both supply and demand.  We have a seaside resort scheme in Ballybunion. I am not exaggerating when I say I received a large number of calls this evening from people in Ballybunion who are worried about the implications of the changes in section 23 in relation to the seaside resort scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>While I like bacon, including bacon sandwiches, I do not like the Bacon report.  The Minister has not dealt with tax breaks.  He should have looked after people on middle incomes and first time buyers.  He should have abolished stamp duty up to a threshold of £100,000 for the first time buyer.  I am disappointed that there are no initiatives for young couples starting off.</P>
      <P>The tax breaks, including those for seaside resorts and section 23, enable speculators to have five or six houses while young couples on middle incomes cannot buy one house.  The Minister should have allowed local authorities to provide free sites to couples on the basis that if they sold on within ten years they would reimburse the authority in some way.</P>
      <P>I do not know how much the Bacon report cost. The Minister should have consulted Deputies, urban councillors and people in public life.  I am an auctioneer and have been a member of an urban council since 1979.  I could have swiftly resolved this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Governments have looked after the rich and neglected the poor.  I am disappointed the Minister did not introduce initiatives to help those on low and middle incomes.  These measures are no use to them.  They only protect the rich, including people with three and four houses.  Young couples cannot buy houses or sites in Westport, Castlebar or Ballina, yet the Minister will not provide money to local authorities to provide houses for them.  I am fed up with section 23 tax breaks.  Last week's <i>Sunday Independent</i><Col N="272" /> revealed what is going on.  There is nothing in these measures for poor people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot disagree with Deputy Ring, nor can I disagree with the Minister when he said it is a market led matter.  Supply and demand will dictate the price of houses, as it does in most other matters.  The Government has decided to distort demand without first dealing with supply.  Mr. Bacon will have to be grilled to get a substantial package in place before attempts are made to deal with stamp duty or section 23 tax breaks.</P>
      <P>As an example of how the stamp duty changes are affecting matters, a friend of mine sold a modest family home in Dublin for £130,000 last week. Today he has been inundated with offers of a further £20,000 on that price.  He is trading up to a £250,000 house, which is not a major development in this city, and he will save £10,000 on what he is buying because of the changes to stamp duty.  He will, therefore, have made £30,000 in a few days.</P>
      <P>Given the restrictions to be imposed on the supply of houses and apartments, the house rental sector will be chaotic in the autumn and beyond. If we restrict those with money in investing in property we will create a problem in the rental sector while we pay £1 million per week in supplementary allowances to health boards alone to give people rental income.  Yet, penal additional rentals will be imposed on those seeking rented accommodation from the end of this year and beyond, and especially from the time students return to college in the autumn.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hayes made some interesting comments on the supply side, densities and various others aspects of planning, which are matters for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  I will let him deal with those proposals on another date. He commented that my officials did not expect the change to the capital gains tax.  I do not think I will do anything in the Dáil or elsewhere that would surprise my officials.  I gave my views on capital gains tax on all Stages of the Finance Bill and had very interesting discussions with Deputies Rabbitte, Noonan, McDowell and others.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Kitt referred to the principles of tax designation.  The changes made in the Finance Bill regarding section 23 are adequate and ring fenced.  One of the reasons the Bill was so large was because of the parts which related to urban and rural renewal.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government will introduce his proposals on the new urban renewal schemes in the middle of the year.  When the integrated plans are studied they will be considered by the evaluation committee and proposals will eventually be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill changed the rules for section 23.  Whereas in the past, blanket tax incentives applied to all areas of urban designation, section <Col N="273" /> 23 relief will not automatically apply.  In line with the Bacon report, before section 23 relief will apply in a new integrated area plan, urban designation will be rigorously applied and only in very exceptional circumstances.  Proposals made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government must be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance. The drawback with this is that, although I have confidence in my ability to say &lsquo;no&rsquo;, the Minister for Finance will be inundated with proposals on the urban renewal scheme.  There will, therefore, be a significant change regarding urban designation when the new scheme commences.</P>
    <P>Most of Deputy O'Flynn's comments were on the Finance Bill.  I hope to publish the Bill next week and have all Stages debated by the following week.  It will not be a large Bill.  All measures regarding stamp duty will be repeated in the Bill, but the changes will not be significant in so far as people will be aware of them.  I do not have a problem with the Deputy, or any other member of my party, disagreeing with proposals made by the Government.  I spent most of my political life disagreeing with proposals made by my party.</P>
    <P>Most of the points raised by Deputy Callely, including the disallowability of section 23, can be addressed when we debate the Finance Bill. Deputy Deenihan referred to the seaside resort renewal scheme.  By definition, a holiday home under this scheme would not be a main residence. The non-deductibility of interest will not apply to investors in rented residential houses in the designated seaside resorts, for example holiday cottages in such resorts, some of which are in Deputy Ring's constituency.  This is because such houses are not eligible under the seaside resorts scheme for owner occupiers.</P>
    <P>Significant changes were made some years ago before the introduction of the seaside resort renewal scheme.  People were able to build holiday cottages and claim tax relief.</P>
    <P>The same rule applies to holiday cottages.  The non-deductibility of interest, even though this matter will be covered in the Finance Bill, will not apply to rented residential houses in seaside resort areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring asked why we did not go down the route of having the exemption limit in regard to stamp duty and I dealt with that in great detail when replying to Deputy Noonan's point.  The Government acted on foot of the Bacon report. There is no point in having a dog and barking oneself.  That is not to say we should implement all the recommendations in a consultant's report. Most Governments and politicians have often taken refuge in saying they will introduce a measure because a consultant or someone else recommended it, but I do not believe in doing that.  The Government regarded the package of measures brought forward by Bacon as the appropriate route to take.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised at what Deputy Hogan said about his friend who has a house.  I would have made that point to Deputy Noonan on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill and I made it earlier <Col N="274" /> in this debate.  I presume some of that will happen regarding stamp duty.  The package of measures brought in by Bacon and on which the Government is acting is intended to distort demand. Deputy Hogan's comments about supply and demand are correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  A cutback of £800,000 has been forced on the western fisheries board's programme of development for the Corrib and Mask system in the context of its proposal to carry out budgetary works of £1.6 million this year.  That will have serious consequences for the proper development of the lake fisheries involved and of the tributary system to those lakes.  It will also affect manning levels in the area.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered the great western lakes system is a game fishing resource and not a coarse fishing area in the category of the lakes in County Cavan and surrounding counties.  Those lakes are a European resource and yet they are being singled out for a cutback in development which will have serious consequences for the area.  The future welfare of the local tourism angling economy in the great western lakes district is heavily dependent on the completion of the Corrib system development programme.</P>
      <P>The western fisheries board submitted a budgetary proposal to carry out £1.6 million of works during 1998.  Those works include a wide variety of locations and streams and among those included are developmental works on the Maam, Fealemore, Owenbrin, Glensaul, Srah sections of the Robe scheme, streams in the Carra system, the Clare, Black, Cross and Cornamona rivers. This is a huge developmental programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The technical committee dealing with these proposals approved the works involved. However, the management committee proposed a cutback of £800,000.  Presumably that was on the basis of pressure from coarse angling interests or because of a fear that spending several millions on the great western lake system might be seen to be an undue expenditure.  This money will not be available again.  Those lakes are an international resource.  The total moneys required is <Col N="275" /> approximately £5 million and is a very small part of the overall £300 million in that programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not have any fear about spending this money because given what is required under the programme it will be money well spent.  The fisheries board has personnel on hand who have been trained in water safety courses, satellite positioning and location and in a great deal of practical but skilled restoration and improvement works on the rivers and streams in the area.  Those personnel should not be lost due to a cutback in resources.  The Minister should ensure that, irrespective of whatever method is adopted, their service will continue.</P>
    <P>Given that Lough Mask comprises 22,000 acres in extent, these trained personnel are essential to the programme of works involved.  Given that Lough Mask and Lough Corrib comprise two of the great trout fishing entities in Europe and there are now only 13 wild brown trout fisheries left in the Continent, surely the Minister would be fully entitled and justified to provide finance to restore, manage and protect these unique resources for present and future generations.</P>
    <P>The spend on the east coast has been huge in comparison to the west.  I call on the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to redress this imbalance.  To ignore the proper and managed development of this unique resource is criminal in the context of its overall potential.</P>
    <P>The western fisheries board has done an excellent job to date and its programme should be allowed to continue and funded as originally agreed.  The Minister is probably well aware of this, but I warn him if he does not proceed along this course of action and allow this programme to be carried out, as originally agreed, he will draw upon himself the wrath of thousands of people, not only anglers, and he will do so at his peril.</P>
    <P>The local tourism angling economy is heavily dependent on this element of the Corrib system developmental programme being completed. Members of the management committee may or may not have been on Lough Mask or Lough Corrib, but they have taken a retrograde decision which will be destructive in its consequences for the proper development of the area and it is one that flies in the face of an already agreed programme. In that context I ask the Minister to reverse this decision to ensure the moneys allocated for this programme will be fully spent, as originally intended, because those moneys are justified in developing, managing and protecting a resource that is unique in Ireland and Europe.  Credit will be given to the Minister when he does that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to update the House on progress in relation to the western lakes project and the tourism angling measure generally.  The technical committee, to which Deputy Kenny referred, approves many technical projects and states they are technically good projects, but the management committee <Col N="276" /> has the task of deciding the allocation of the funds thereafter.</P>
      <P>The western lakes project is one of the flagship projects receiving support under the measure. The objective is to restore Loughs Corrib, Mask and Carra as prime brown trout fisheries, thus attracting more tourist anglers back to the west. Funding of £1.2 million has already been allocated to earlier phases of the project.  On foot of a further funding application by the Western Regional Fisheries Board, I announced last week that an additional £800,000 has been approved to support the next phase of development.  Far from funding being reduced, this further allocation brings the total funding to the western lakes project to £2 million, which is nearly 12 per cent of total funding available over the whole period under the tourism angling measure.</P>
      <P>The additional funding for the project also represents 40 per cent of this most recent round. Therefore, approximately £2 million is available in this round and the western lakes will get 40 per cent of that amount as a national allocation.  In the context of available resources, the project is receiving a significant level of funding which reflects the importance of the development.</P>
      <P>The objective of the tourism angling measure, which is a component of the operational programme for tourism, is to develop the national angling product to best international standards and significantly increase the number of tourist anglers visiting the country.  Angling has tremendous benefits from the tourism perspective as a year round activity often in non-traditional tourism locations, delivering significant local economic return as well as contributing to the tourism sector overall.  The main flagship investments under this measure have been in the west.</P>
      <P>The £17 million being invested under the tourism angling measure up to 1999 is the largest investment ever in inland fisheries development in western Europe.  Eligible projects include instream development, stock management, establishment of new fisheries, rehabilitation of fisheries and the provision of signposts and other educational and information material for visitors. The fundamental criteria for eligibility are that the fisheries are capable of attracting additional foreign visitors, are readily available for tourist use and demonstrably generate economic benefit and additional employment.  Over 100 projects have been approved to date throughout the country and are already making a significant contribution in terms of enhancing the fisheries resource itself and to tourism.  I announced a further round of projects totalling £2 million last week which includes the next phase of the western lakes project at £800,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order for the full value of this ongoing investment to be realised, a major drive on the marketing front is required.  Marketing plans are an intrinsic requirement for development projects and I also announced at the end of last year that funding is being specially earmarked for an angling market research and promotion initiative. <Col N="277" /> This is essential as part of the tourism angling measure.  I have mandated the Central Fisheries Board to work closely with Bord Fáilte to deliver on this important initiative which will involve the investment of £350,000 in marketing the angling product.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate the importance of ensuring that the benefits of the tourism angling measure are maximised through well planned and well spread investment throughout the country. The objective is to deliver game, coarse and sea angling projects with a balanced regional spread and a good mix of public, private and community group initiatives.  The flagship projects, including the western lakes and the Moy fishery, are vitally important for national development strategies for angling tourism.  Considerable benefit is being obtained also from a wide range of smaller projects round the country where local fisheries facilities can be upgraded at a comparatively small cost by angling clubs and local community groups as well as the regional fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>The further round of tourism angling projects which I announced last week will create up to 100 jobs and are spread through all regions.  They include a number of smaller projects which will show significant payback in tourism angling terms.  The scope for development of the inland fisheries resource and the considerable demands for funding make it imperative that we have investment strategies which are prioritised and focused on delivering the maximum return.  The management committee which decides on grant applications and which operates under the aegis of the Central Fisheries Board has been expanded recently to encompass a wider range of experience and expertise, particularly in the tourism area, which will ensure delivery on the targets and objectives of the measure.  The committee carried out a thorough review of the project process earlier this year to ensure that support is targeted at projects which show the best returns and that the most effective use is made of the remaining funds up to 1999.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note the heartening increase in projects led by local anglers and tourism groups over the last 12 months and the growing number of coarse angling projects receiving support.  This is being achieved together with ongoing significant investment support for game angling fisheries and for rehabilitation strategies for salmon, trout and sea trout stocks in key catchments.  The impact overall of all these components of our development strategy will be positive and permanent.</P>
    <P>Within this overall context, significant support is continuing to be made available for the next phases of large scale projects, including the western lakes project.  The additional £800,000 of funding now committed to that project sets the western board on course to continue its development programme in a focused and prioritised way and to deliver the best outcome in terms of economic and tourism returns.  I have no doubt that the western lakes project will result in a restoration <Col N="278" /> of these valuable fisheries and a significant increase in the value of the tourism angling product to the benefit of the western region and the country as a whole.  This major investment in the western lakes by the State and the European Union underlines the commitment of all concerned to restoring them to their former glory.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence that the Western Regional Fisheries Board will deliver effectively on this phase of the project and that the tangible benefits of this significant investment will be demonstrated through increased tourism numbers, economic activity and jobs in the west.  I am sure the House will endorse this investment strategy for tourism angling generally and for the western lakes in particular.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise the disgraceful position in the births, deaths and marriages register office in Joyce House, Lombard Street.  It is extraordinary that people must queue for hours on end for this service.  I understand that as many as 50 people frequently queue in the rain outside the office with the same number of people waiting inside. People arrive at 7.30 a.m. to register or to get documents which many of them require urgently. The office is turning people away and staff are unable to cope.</P>
      <P>The workload in the births, deaths and marriages register office has increased following a number of legislative changes introduced by the House.  If legislative changes are made, resources should be provided to those who must implement them.  There have been changes in relation to notification of marriage and changes in the format of birth certificates.  This means there is further demand on the service.  It is obvious the staff cannot meet the demands on the office at present.  It is unfair to consumers and staff at a time when emphasis is placed on giving consumers quality services.  It is unacceptable that people must wait so long, that there are inadequate facilities to deal with them and the office opening hours must be restricted due to lack of staff.</P>
      <P>The office opening hours are 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and 2.15 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. The staff must close the office at these hours to deal with postal queries which take up to six weeks at this stage. People often want certificates in a hurry for a variety of reasons.  I was recently approached by a person whose son was getting married in Eastern Europe and who needed the long version of his birth certificate in a short time because it needed to be translated.  However, he was told it would take six weeks by post.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that a public service office is giving this type of response to consumers.  I ask the Minister to immediately allocate extra staff to deal with the problem and to give citizens a proper service.  The current situation is unfair to consumers and staff.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The administration of the registration system, including the services and facilities provided at Joyce House, is statutorily a matter for An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir &mdash; Registrar-General &mdash; of births, deaths and marriages and for the superintendent registrar, Dublin and registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>There are two separate offices located at Joyce House, Lombard Street, Dublin 2, issuing certificates of births, deaths and marriages, the general register office and the above-mentioned superintendent registrar's office on the ground floor, which provides certificates for all births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages occurring within the Dublin city and county area.  This latter office in particular is currently experiencing a very high level of demand for certificates which is the primary cause of the long queues outside the building and also the delay in processing postal applications for certificates by that office.  While the general register office is operating a normal service to personal callers, there is approximately a four week delay in responding to postal applications for current events, with a longer delay in respect of events prior to 1900.  I am very conscious of the long queues for services outside Joyce House.  I am aware that these queues have been considerable in recent times and I regret the inconvenience to the persons concerned.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the superintendent registrar's office, has secured a lease on a premises adjoining the offices in Lombard Street.  It will, however, take some weeks to occupy and commission the new offices.  Additional staff will be required to develop new facilities, including facilities necessary to ensure the appropriate level of privacy to the public attending for the registration of events.  The number of additional staff required for the development of the improved service is subject to consultations between the board and the Department of Health and Children. I understand that in the interim the board is taking immediate steps to improve staffing levels within the constraints of the existing accommodation in order to redress the problem and to minimise delays.  These measures will considerably improve maters for the public attending at Joyce House.</P>

      <P>The Government has shown total incompetence in coming to terms with the problems of traffic congestion in Dublin.  At morning and evening rush hour there is gridlock in various parts of my constituency of Dublin South, which seriously undermines people's quality of life.  The gridlock stretches from Firhouse, Knocklyon, Rathfarnham, across the constituency to Mount Merrion, Stillorgan and Clonskeagh.  In the area of Dundrum village there is gridlock not only at <Col N="280" /> rush hour but throughout the day, frequently extending to Saturdays and Sundays.  Instead of tackling the problem, the Government has remarkably, in its ten months of office, contributed to its worsening.  Indecisive Ministers incapable of making decisions have put on hold vital traffic management proposals which would alleviate the plight of many of my constituents who live in Ballinteer, Sandyford, Balally, Churchtown, Mount Merrion, Clonskeagh and the Dundrum area.</P>
      <P>Since taking office the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has had on his desk the report of the departmental inspector arising from the public inquiry concerning the construction of the Dundrum by-pass and the Ballinteer road-Wyckham by-pass improvement schemes.  The Minister has to date failed to make a decision to sanction the schemes, neither has he allocated the funding to enable the necessary works to be undertaken.  To resolve the local traffic gridlock it is essential the Minister sanctions these schemes without further delay.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has publicly displayed his contempt of the people who live in the area, refusing by letter dated 23 April 1998 to agree to a joint meeting with all the TDs who represent the Dublin South constituency, together with Dundrum Chamber of Commerce.  The failure of the three Government Ministers in the constituency to ensure such a meeting takes place is, in my experience in this House, unprecedented.  Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council is awaiting the Minister's sanction to proceed with these essential roadworks.  It has been put in limbo and prevented from providing the new road schemes so badly required in the area.</P>
      <P>On the issue of Luas the Government has displayed contemptible incompetence.  The public judicial inquiry should have commenced at the beginning of July 1997 and completed by the end of that month.  It has been put on hold for more than ten months.  More than £200,000 of taxpayers' money has been spent on a review of the Luas project to consider the underground option. The conclusion of the consultants appointed by Government to examine this issue, published today, confirms the strategy of the previous Government.  Today's study acknowledges that the surface option is the most appropriate and cost effective in meeting the transport needs of the city and providing capacity to meet long-term passenger demands.  It is essential for Dublin South constituency and to alleviate the problems of Sandyford, Balally, Dundrum, Clonskeagh, Churchtown and Mount Merrion that the Luas proposal is sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report published today confirms that the cost of the underground option, even if it were feasible, would be a minimum of £500 million, which would render it impossible for the project to come on-stream before the year 2005.  We stand today at risk of losing crucial European Union moneys for the construction of Luas.  The <Col N="281" /> consultants' report facilitates the Government in getting the project back on track, yet today the Government postponed making a decision on this issue.  The Minister for Public Enterprise was left politically naked this afternoon at a press conference called in advance of the Cabinet meeting to explain to journalists the decisive indecisiveness of her colleagues.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to do a public U-turn on Luas, to admit the underground option is no longer feasible and get the project speedily back on the rails.  It is time for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to sanction construction of the Dundrum by-pass and the Wyckham by-pass as well as the new road alignments on the Ballinteer Road.  Until such time as these decisions are made, traffic difficulties in that part of south Dublin will continue to worsen until eventually traffic grinds to a complete halt.</P>

For reasons I will outline later, there are constraints on what I can say at this stage on the matter.</P>
      <P>Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has submitted two compulsory purchase orders for the acquisition of land for the Dundrum Main Street by-pass and the Ballinteer Road-Wyckham by-pass improvement schemes.

A public local inquiry was held into objections received against confirmation of the compulsory purchase orders and into the propriety of confirming the orders in so far as they relate to the extinguishment of public rights-ofway. Evidence on the likely effects on the environment of these schemes was also taken at the inquiry.</P>
      <P>The question of confirming the compulsory purchase orders and approving of the environmental impact statement now falls to be determined by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  He is required to act in a quasi-judicial capacity in determining the issues involved.  This requires that he must give careful consideration to the objections made to the orders, the evidence presented at the inquiry and the inspector's report thereon.  As the role of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, in determining the matter is of a quasi-judicial nature, the Deputy will appreciate it would not be appropriate to comment at this stage on the possible further development of these schemes in advance of the determination of the issues which are now before him.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that his concerns about the need for a decision as soon as possible will be fully taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for permitting me to raise this very important issue for some of my constituents.  The Minister received representations from the school manager who has outlined the case very well.  The image often portrayed of Dublin south-east is of the leafy suburbs.  One thinks immediately of Herbert Park, Ailesbury Road, Palmerston Road, Donnybrook, Ranelagh and Rathmines, areas of tremendous affluence, privilege and influence.  Dublin 4 has come to symbolise the centre of power in official Ireland, a place where the chattering classes consolidate their culture of contentment.  There is, however, another side to Dublin south-east.</P>
      <P>It is a place afflicted by terrible unemployment and deprivation, devastated by teenage drug use and where social inequality is clearly visible.  This is reflected in disaffection with the political system and in low voter turnout.  Today, I met a group of residents from Boyne Street in the south inner city who do not have hot and cold water.  It is shocking when one contrasts this with the sheer opulence of many of the areas of Dublin South East, and nowhere is this more evident than in the schooling and education system.</P>
      <P>As Lord Mayor, I had the opportunity to visit many schools.  When one visits the richer parts of the constituency, one sees contented children who are beautifully dressed, well nourished and supremely confident.  When one enters the inner city, one realises quickly that parents find it hard to make ends meet.  If we really want to close the gap between rich and poor, make a difference in the lives of these children and offer them hope, we must invest in education.  The small gesture I ask for tonight will make a significant difference. We invested a huge amount of money, £120 million, in the Drugs Task Force.  This measure is welcome but it makes greater sense in the long-term to invest in education and sporting facilities, which is sadly lacking in Dublin South East.</P>
      <P>There is rising discontentment in the area because of the belief that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority will produce a charter for developers.  The question constantly being asked is, what is in it for the people in Dublin 4?  When I say Dublin 4, I am not referring to Donnybrook but to Ringsend and Dublin 2.  What is in it for the people living in the docklands area? Tonight, they ask for something simple, which I hope the Minister will grant without too much difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the loss of a teacher would result in five classes being involved in multi-grade classes and the removal of children from the school to those with single classes, thus compounding the problem?  Is he aware that the teacher involved is the only other male on the staff and, therefore, a role model is lost?  This may appear a small point but it is important and one which the Minister raised in a recent interview on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo;.  He said there was a <Col N="283" /> shortage of male role models and that we require more male teachers.  This is another reason we need to retain this teacher.  I hope the school will be included in the early start programme and that the Minister's response will be positive for the people of the south inner city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gormley for raising this matter and apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that staffing a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is the case for all schools.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of City Quay national school on 30 September 1996 was 162 pupils which warrants a staffing complement of five teachers.  In addition, the school has the services of a full-time remedial teacher, a full-time disadvantaged area concessionary teacher and a shared home-school liaison teacher.</P>
      <P>The staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1998-99 school year have not yet been finalised.  However, when the staffing arrangements are finalised, the Minister has asked his officials to review the position at the school and to correspond with the board of management directly in the matter.  The Minister has no proposals at present to extend the breaking the cycle pilot project, the early start pre-school pilot programme or the teaching counsellor scheme.</P>
      <P>The operation of the breaking the cycle pilot project is monitored by the Department's inspectorate and evaluated by the Education Research Centre.  One of the key issues to be covered in the review will be the question of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the two distinct approaches, both urban and rural, which are being tested under the pilot project.  It would be inappropriate to consider the inclusion of additional schools in the pilot project until the evaluation has been carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister recently convened a National Forum for Early Childhood Education.  The Minister's objective in holding the forum was to allow all groups with an <Col N="284" /> interest in the area of early childhood education to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the future development of services in this area.  The provision of appropriate pre-schooI education in areas of social deprivation and low educational achievement was one of the issues addressed by the forum.  A report on the proceedings and conclusions of the forum is currently being prepared by the independent secretariat and will be published under the authority of the secretary general to the forum.  Following consideration of this report, it is the Minister's intention to publish a White Paper on early childhood education.</P>
    <P>The teaching counsellor scheme is currently operating on a limited pilot basis in 31 schools in the north inner city and Clondalkin areas of Dublin. A total of 27 teaching counsellor posts have been allocated to the selected schools.  The operation of the pilot phase of the scheme is being closely monitored by the Department's inspectorate. A detailed evaluation of the scheme is currently under way and the Minister expects to receive the outcome before the end of the current school year.  The question of any further expansion of the teaching counsellor scheme will be considered following completion of the evaluation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is currently reviewing his Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage.  His objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support necessary to enable them to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>
    <P>In the event of additional resources being targeted at pupils in disadvantaged areas, schools will be selected for support on the basis of criteria which will have regard to each school's prevailing needs at the time of selection.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of City Quay national school will be considered in the context of any proposed expansion of the schemes mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 29 April 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 41 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for legislation in relation to consumer protection rests with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Specifically, the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, confers certain powers and duties on the Director of Consumer Affairs in the area of credit agreements with, amongst others, banks.  That Act also provides a role for the director as a regulator of charges imposed on customers by credit institutions.</P>
      <P>However, the Central Bank also has a role to play in relation to the protection of depositors' moneys from the perspective of its functions as prudential regulator of credit institutions.</P>
      <P>Recent allegations have resulted in significant public concern about certain activities of particular banks and the banking industry generally.  It is with this concern in mind that I decided to establish a working group of representatives from my Department, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Central Bank, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General, the task of which is to investigate the law and practice governing the provision of financial sevices in Ireland and the impact this has on consumers.  In this regard, the group is undertaking an assessment of the laws relating to both the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the role of the Central Bank, including the procedures used to give effect to these roles, with a view to identifying the impact of these on consumers and, in particular, to identify if there are gaps in consumer protection that need to be filled.  The group has also been asked to consider what steps may be required to increase the public understanding of the regulatory systems, including the manner of their implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> The group has been asked to report its findings, and any recommendations it may have, to me by mid-May.  I understand the group has met on three separate occasions to date.  I have been advised significant progress has been made and that I should have its report within the timescale prescribed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The initiative in relation to having the decision to abolish duty free sales overturned rests with the EU Commission.  So far, the Commission has indicated that it does not intend to bring forward proposals &mdash; which would require unanimous agreement at Council &mdash; to reverse the decision which has been enacted into European law.  As I mentioned in the Dáil debate on this matter on 10 February 1998, Ireland has been to the forefront of the campaign to have the decision reversed but without much support from our European partners at ECOFIN.  Other states have left the running to us.</P>
      <P>I received the report on the impact of abolition of duty and tax-free sales for EU travel in 1999, commissioned by my Department and undertaken by KPMG Managing Consulting at the end of March.  This is being circulated to ECOFIN Ministers for their attention.  The results of this study are important and any presentation of its finding to ECOFIN may help in obtaining support for the call for a broader analysis by the</P>
      <P>Commission.  I intend to have the matter discussed at ECOFIN on 19 May, with a view to advancing the debate.  I will press the Irish case as appropriate.</P>
      <P>However, it should be noted that, following the informal ECOFIN at York in March, the Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated he does not consider it possible to achieve unanimity at ECOFIN on duty free in the light of the discussions to date.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the recent figures released by the national anti-poverty strategy indicating that, in the 1998 budget, the proportion of spending on tax cuts and social inclusion measures has considerably widened in contrast with the 1997 budget figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9532/98]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The data used by the Combat Poverty Agency in the context of the national anti-poverty strategy compares the budget 1998 taxation and PRSI changes with the additional social inclusion expenditure measures announced on budget day.  However, it is more appropriate to compare these measures with the total increase in expenditure on social services &mdash; not just increases announced on budget day.  This is because the budget day tax and PRSI changes give the complete picture for tax &mdash; PRSI measures in that year whereas the budget day expenditure announcements are merely additional to increases already detailed in the Estimates for Public Services (Abridged Version).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this basis the position is somewhat different from that outlined in the report referred to by the Deputy.  The 1998 estimate for social expenditure <Col N="288" /> is £10,322 million, up from the provisional outturn of £9,764 million in 1997.  This represents an increase of £558 million as compared to the £517 million full year cost of the budget day tax and PRSI reductions quoted by the agency.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that during the past five years, social services expenditure generally, including expenditure on social inclusion, has increased from £8,049 million to £10,322 million. This represents an average increase of just under £455 million per anum.  Against this average figure, the projected increase of £558 million for 1998 over 1997 compares most favourably.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of Partnership 2000, there is a commitment to invest an additional £525 million on a full year cost basis on the promotion of social inclusion over a three year period.  In the 1997 budget, my predecessor allocated £273 million for this purpose.  In the recent 1998 budget, I allocated a further £282 million on social inclusion programmes.  This means that the resources promised for social inclusion over a three year period will not only be provided within two years, but will also have been exceeded by £30 million.</P>
    <P>It is stated in Partnership 2000 that the biggest single contributor to social exclusion and poverty is unemployment.  In this regard, it is worth noting the social inclusion measures to integrate the long-term unemployed back into the workforce which have been applied successfully.  These include the increased numbers of participants on community employment and on the back to work allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>I agree with the widely-held view that the best anti-poverty strategy is the creation of sustainable employment.  With this in mind, budget 1998 introduced another initiative &mdash; job assist &mdash; which designed to help the long-term unemployed back to work.  This provides a special tax deduction tapered over three years for persons unemployed for one year or more who take up a job, a double tax deduction for employers employing previously long-term unemployed person. This can last up to 36 months provided the previously long-term unemployed person is still employed by them.</P>
    <P>The total number of people at work in Ireland will have increased by 250,000 in the five years ending 1998.  In recognition of the need to reduce the burden of personal taxation to reward effort and give people an incentive to take up work, budget 1998 implemented the first stage of significant tax reform that was signalled in the Government's programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium.  Among the measures introduced were reductions of 2 per cent in the standard and top rates of income tax, significant increases in personal allowances, a widening of the standard income tax band and an increase in the PRSI-free allowance to £100 per week.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the tax measures I introduced are employment friendly and will succeed in maintaining the strong employment growth of <Col N="289" /> recent years which, as I already stated, is the best way of combating social exclusion and poverty.</P>

To date, nine Irish and 13 UK civil servants participated in the scheme.  While the emphasis of the scheme within the Irish Civil Service has been on exchanges with staff serving in England, exchanges such as those referred to by the Deputy may be made under the current scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 31 to 33, inclusive, 42 and 52 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original 1997 budget day forecast for consumer price inflation was 2.2 per cent, whereas the final outturn for the year was 1.5 per cent.  My forecast for inflation in 1998 and 1999, as published in my December budget, was 2 per cent in each year.  This was based on unchanged interest and exchange rates prevailing at that time.  The degree to which the fall in our Effective <Col N="291" /> Exchange Rate over the last year or so will impact on inflation is uncertain, but undoubtedly it could have some impact.</P>
    <P>To date, despite an approximate fall in our EER of about 3.5 per cent since the end of November, the impact has been fairly muted. Obviously changes in interest rates as well as future movements of sterling will be important; most commentators expect sterling to depreciate in the next 12 months or so and this would help keep Irish inflation low.  It is too early to say that my forecast will be significantly exceeded, but obviously it will be kept under review.  A revised forecast for 1998 will as usual be published in the mid-year Economic Review and Outlook.</P>
    <P>While the year-on-year increase in the consumer price index for February was 1.7 per cent, and 2.1 per cent in March, the rise in the first quarter of 1998 over the corresponding period of 1997 was 1.9 per cent.  Our inflation rate, therefore, remains moderate.  The measures announced last week by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government are designed to deal with specific situation in the housing sector.</P>
    <P>The range of forecasts for inflation for this and next year is wide.  Commentators have been confused by the fact that different measures of inflation are being used which often means that they are not comparing like with like.  Personal consumption deflators, which some use, do not include the impact of mortage interest rates.  The consumer price index, on the other hand, includes the impact of mortgage interest rate changes.  The OECD have forecast 3.1 and 3.3 per cent as the personal consumption deflators for 1998 and 1999 respectively.  They have however not published a CPI forecast.  I would consider these and other equivalent forecasts to be on the high side.</P>
    <P>Keen competition in the domestic retail market is likely to continue, with the arrival of more UK retailers.  International inflation remains subdued, particularly commodity and oil prices, and this will benefit consumer prices at home.  So too will the fact that higher retail sales volumes allow retailers to absorb cost increases without increasing prices.  These factors will continue to influence prices in the period ahead.  In addition, fiscal policy and our social partnership arrangements should continue to ensure that our low inflation environment will continue under Economic and Monetary Union.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that, during the debate on the Central Bank Act, 1998, and in response to parliamentary questions tabled by him in March <Col N="292" /> 1998, I outlined the position in relation to the exmination undertaken by officials in my Department on the general issue of dormant accounts held in credit institutions.  That investigation identified, among other things, potential legal and constitutional issues associated with establishing a system for dealing with such accounts.  I have advised the Deputy that this is a very complex issue and one which requires very careful consideration. Without getting into specifics, the type of areas affected by the establishment of such a scheme would include that of property rights generally.</P>
      <P>I have advised the Deputy that I will not let the matter rest and that I will investigate it further during my term of office.  In the meantime, it would not be appropriate for me to release any of the results of the work undertaken by my officials until the further investigations I consider necessary are completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have previously informed the House on a number of occasions that the Central Bank of Ireland is subject to strict confidentiality requirements.  These are set out in section 16 of the 1989 Central Bank Act and subsequent amendements.  Section 16 introduced provisions, related to the disclosure of information by the bank's staff, similar to those already existing for public servants in relation to the prevention of corruption.</P>
      <P>Basically, the section provides that the Governor, a director, officer or servant of the bank may not disclose information related to the business of any person or body, whether corporate or incorporate, which came to his knowledge by virtue of his office of employment, or the bank's activities in respect of the protection of the integrity of the currency or the control of credit unless such disclosure is to enable the bank to carry out its functions under the Central Bank Acts.  Provision is made for the disclosure of information as required by a court in connection with criminal proceedings.  In addition, the bank, under section 49(2) of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, may disclose to the gardaí, where it has reasonable cause to believe that a criminal offence has been committed, any information to enable further investigation of the alleged offence. Further, under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, the bank is obliged to report to the gardaí a suspicion that any entity it supervises has committed or is committing the offence of money laundering, or certain related offences; money laundering embraces tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Penalty for contravention of the provisions of section 16 are: on summary conviction, a fine not <Col N="293" /> exceeding £1,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or on conviction on indictment, a fine not exceeding £25,000 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years.</P>
    <P>These secrecy provisions are vital in the maintenance of the financial sector's confidence in the bank and, in turn, the public's confidence in the operation of the financial sector.</P>
    <P>Irish law on confidentiality in financial supervision implements European Union law which requires a high standard of professional secrecy. Article 12, as amended, of the First Council Directive on the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions requires the State to ensure that the Central Bank maintains very strict confidentiality. The Office of the Attorney General has been consulted on this issue and has advised that rules of law emanating from the Directive and Ireland's obligations under the Treaty would prevent adoption of a provision which would widen the existing catergories of exceptions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Central Bank of Ireland.  Therefore, any legislation purporting to extend the present categories of exceptions to the bank's confidentiality regime would, <i>prima facie</i>, be <i>ultra vires</i> the Directive and the EU Treaty.</P>
    <P>Confidentiality is a core element of effective financial regulation and as such is deeply embedded in the body, not only of EU law but of international law generally.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's query, the EMI would not be the appropriate authority to consult, in the first instance, on issues related to the interpretation of EU Directives in the financial services field.  As I have already indicated on a number of occasions, these directives are in line with best international practice in the field of financial supervision.  In Ireland advice as to the interpretation and transpostion of EU law is, in the first instance, sought from the Office of the Attorney General.  Any proposals to amend these directives would, primarily, be a matter for the European Commission in its capacity as preserver of the Treaty and promoter of EU law.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the Moriarty Tribunal include a remit to make whatever broad recommendations the tribunal considers necessary or expedient for enhancing the role and performance of the Central Bank as regulator of the banks and of the financial services sector generally. Also, I have established a working group of representatives from my Department, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Central Bank, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General to examine banking and consumer issues.  The remits of both the tribunal and the working group cover the question of Central Bank confidentiality and I will, consider any recommendations they make.  If these suggest that clarification on the interpretation of the confidentiality requirements of the relevant EU Directives is necessary, <Col N="294" /> this will be sought.  Any draft legislative provisions which might then emanate from these examinations will, where appropriate, be referred for consultation to the EMI in accordance with Article 109f(6) of the Treaty on European Union.</P>

      <P>There have been ongoing discussions between my Department and the Civil Service unions in relation to the strategic management initiative and related developments since its inception.  The strategic management initiative is a standing item on the agenda for the monthly meetings of the general council of the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme, which my Department chairs.  In many Departments, it is also a standing item on the agenda of the departmental council, the local equivalent of the general council.  The civil and public service unions, in addition to other interested groups, are represented also on the co-ordinating group which oversees the development and implementation of Delivering Better Government and advises the Government on progress.</P>
      <P>Individual initiatives being pursued under the programme are also the subject of discussions.  In the case of the proposed performance management system, there was extensive consultation with and participation by staff and their unions in the design and develpment process.  The views of staff were sought through a sample survey and the unions participated directly in two project groups which were set up to help with the desigh of the system.  Arrangements are now being made to involve the unions in consultations on the implementation of the system and other initiatives.</P>
      <P>Discussions with staff and their unions are seen as an essential element in progressing the strategic management initiative.  The need for staff and union involvement is stressed in the Delivering Better Government document.  This will now be better facilitated by the participative arrangements being put in place under Partnership 2000 and which are designed to ensure joint involvement by management, unions and staff in development and implementing action programmes to progress the strategic management initiative.  These arrangements have been agreed with the unions.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise had the issue raised at the EU Transport Council on St. Patrick's Day and won backing from her Transport Minister colleagues for a call on the EU Commission to carry out a Community wide study on the effects of the ending of duty free sales.  Our two Departments have up to now and will continue to liaise on the matter, particularly, because of its importance to the areas under the remit of the Department of Public Enterprise. However, the initiative in relation to having the decision to end duty free sales overturned rests with the EU Commission.  So far, the Commission has indicated that they do not intend to bring forward proposals &mdash; which would require unanimous agreement at Council &mdash; to reverse the decision.  I intend to raise the matter at the May ECOFIN.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to the Deputy's question I would first like to clarify the position generally.  All central banks hold assets of various kinds.  In most countries, a proportion of those assets is held in foreign currencies, known as the external reserves. Such external reserves are held for two principal purposes &mdash; to assist in protecting the currency and to ensure that the country does not lack the foreign currency needed to pay for essential imports.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of the European Central Bank and the adoption of the single currency, it will be the euro-area as a whole rather than individual participating member states, such as Ireland, which will need such external reserves. Consequently, the ECB is empowered under its statutes to call up, from participating national central banks, up to 50,000 million euro in foreign exchange reserves &mdash; that is, assets in currencies other than the euro.  Each national central bank's contribution will be in proportion to its shareholding in the ECB, which in turn will be in proportion to each member state's shares of the euro-area's GDP and population &mdash; like shareholdings in the EMI at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis, the Irish contribution to the EMI currently is 0.8 per cent.  The initial Irish contribution to the ECB will depend on the final figures for GDP and population in recent years, the member states in EMU in 1999 and the total assets actually called up.  However, it is likely to be around 0.9 per cent of the total; something around £350 million, depending on the conversation <Col N="298" /> rate and the actual proportion.  In addition, the Central Bank will be subscribing to the capital of the ECB, which is to total 5,000 million euro; the Irish subscription is likely to be around £35 million.  These will remain assets on the balance sheet of the Central Bank, although they will not be under the control of the bank.  However, it should be noted that both the foreign reserves contribution and the capital shareholding will earn income for the Central Bank and thus indirectly for the Exchequer, as the participating national central banks will share the profits of the ECB among themselves.</P>
    <P>This will leave a substanial amount of assets, both domestic euro assets, and foreign non-euro assets, with the Central Bank of Ireland. However, just because they are not needed as official external reserves does not make them &ldquo;surplus&rdquo;.  The Central Bank of Ireland's balance sheet includes liabilities as well as assets; these include deposits from financial institutions, the Exchequer deposit, and legal tender notes.  The bank will also continue to need its own external assets, as well as those provided to the ECB, to play its part as a member of the European System of Central Banks.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank does have some assets which are not needed to meet liabilities; these are known as the bank's &ldquo;accounting reserves&rdquo;. However, the value of these reserves fluctuates, depending on changes in the values of the assets held by the bank.</P>
    <P>As of the end of February 1998, the latest date for which published figures are available, the official external reserves held by the Central Bank of Ireland totalled £4,739 million.  The accounting reserves stood at £1,160 million.</P>
    <P>It is too early to say what the balance sheet of the Central Bank will look like immediately after 1 January 1999, in EMU.  There are important unknowns: the approach to be taken by the ECB to the management of foreign assets &mdash; both its own and that of participating central banks &mdash; and money market operations; and how the foreing exchange market will initially perceive the euro.  What we can say with certainty is that both the overall level of assets and the surplus reserves of a central bank contribute to its credibility.  For example, adverse exchange rate movements could, in the absence of a sufficient level of accounting reserves to absorb such movements, have negative consequences for the net asset position of the Central Bank.  It is not my intention to act in a fashion which could undermine either the credibility of the Central Bank, and indirectly the ESCB, or the credibility of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to assess whether the Central Bank will have assets in EMU which are surplus to its requirements and I do not intend to engage in any precipitate action.  However, the situation is being kept under review as the shape of EMU unfolds.</P>
    <P>The contribution which any surplus assets of the Central Bank would make to the Exchequer <Col N="299" /> should not be exaggerated.  Assets of the bank earn a return for the bank.  The Exchequer receives the surplus income of the bank, thus indirectly benefiting from the bank's reserves.  If the assets, corresponding to the accounting reserves, were used by the Exchequer for other purposes, we would be losing the benefit of that income.  To the extent that the bank's accounting reserves would be used to reduce the national debt, the net annual benefit to the Exchequer would be the difference between the cost of servicing the repaid debt and the return on the assets in the accounting reserves, that is, effectively the margin between the interest rates for borrowing and lending.  Use of the accounting reserves for purposes other than repayment of debt by the Exchequer would not be in accordance with the strict control of public expenditure which is central to Government budgetary policy.</P>

      <P>Neither I nor my Department have made a submission to the European Commission regarding the development of broad economic guidelines.  Each year, the European Commission issues a recommendation on the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the member states and the Community, in accordance with Article 103 (2) of the Treaty on European Union.  This is examined by the Economic Policy Committee and the Monetary Committee.  The Commission's recommendations, together with the views of the Monetary Committee are then discussed at the ECOFIN Council Meeting.  The ECOFIN Council submits draft broad guidelines to the European Council, which endorses the guidelines.  Ireland is represented on both the Economic Policy Committee and the Monetary Committee.  Our views on the guidelines are expressed in these fora.</P>

      <P>The Strategic Management Initiative provides for major changes to the way in which public expenditure <Col N="300" /> programmes are managed.  Under the new approach, Departments will be given the maximum possible scope for managing the resources allocated to them.  As a counterpart to this greater delegation, each expenditure programme is to be subject to a thorough review every three years.  The reviews will be carried out by spending Departments under steering groups drawn from the Department concerned and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>In July 1997, the Government approved the first programme of spending reviews by all major Departments and Offices to be started in 1997. The Government also considered an indicative list of the reviews which might be begun in the second and third years of the programme.  The 1997 reviews are currently under way.  They are at varying stages.  A small number are almost finished, others are at an early stage.  My Department has urged that the full programme be completed by the summer.  In the summer I will propose to the Government the second programme of reviews.  Decisions on the future programme will take account of progress with the first round of reviews.  The main aim at this early stage is to ensure that the review process is introduced successfully and supports reform of the financial management system.</P>
      <P>In my Deparment, which does not have significant spending programmes under its aegis, a review of the ESRI has been carried out.  Other Ministers will no doubt supply information on reviews in their areas should the Deputy ask them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the article in the European Commission's publication, <i>The Week in Europe</i> which the Deputy refers.  Eligibility for full Objective One status is based on a region having a <i>per capita</i> GDP below 75 per cent of the EU average. As a single region for Structural Fund purposes, Ireland has always qualified for full Objective <Col N="301" /> One Status.  Ireland's <i>per capita</i> GDP has now surpassed 75 per cent of the EU average.  Accordingly, it will not be possible for Ireland to retain full Objective One status in the next round.</P>
    <P>The European Commission's proposals published last month provide that regions which are graduating from full Objective One status will continue to benefit from Objective One funding on a transitional basis.  Over the seven years of the next round, the Commission proposes that Ireland moves gradually from Objective One status at the beginning of the next round to an Objective Two-type status at the end of the next round.  The Commission's proposals also provide for Ireland to benefit from full access to the Cohesion Fund for at least the first four years of the next round.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals provide the basis for negotiations which have commenced at Council level.  These negotiations, including member states' shareout, will probably not be concluded until next year.  In the negotiations, the Government will endeavour to secure the best outcome possible for Ireland which will help us to: first, address our infrastructural backlogs; second, address our continuing human resource problems, particularly the challenge of long-term unemployment; and third, meet the development needs of those parts of the country which are still lagging behind.  In this overall context, the Government is exploring the option of sub-dividing the existing single region of Ireland, whereby some parts of the country might retain full Objective One status in the next round.  Commission approval for such an option would be necessary. The Deputy will also appreciate that the Government's consideration of this issue must have regard to what is in the interests of the country as a whole.</P>

      <Quest>the factors governing his decision to seek a change in the central rate of the IR£ within the ERM; and the nature of contacts with the European Commission prior to the meeting of 14 March 1998.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the decision to seek a revaluation of the ERM central rate of the IR£ on 14 March last taking into account all aspects of the situation.  These included domestic considerations and the discussions at European level, involving among others the European Commission, of our Convergence Programme 1997-1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards domesic considerations, I was concerned to ensure that our economic success continues in a balanced and sustainable way.  While we comfortably met the EMU inflation criterion in relation to 1997, the possibility of a significant increase in inflation, particularly in 1999, was one I wished to avoid.  I was keen to ensure we took timely action to prevent inflationary risks from <Col N="302" /> posing any threat to our economic stability.  I, therefore, decided that the most prudent course of action was to bring the central rate of the Irish pound broadly into line with its market rate prior to the revaluation.  In making this decision the needs of the whole economy were taken into consideration and I had to strike a balance between inflation concerns on one hand and competitiveness considerations on the other.</P>
    <P>As the EU Communiqué issued on 14 March last states, the decision to adjust the central rate of the Irish pound was made by mutual agreement of ECOFIN Ministers and central bank governors of the member states of the European Community, following a common procedure involving the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute, and after consultation with the Monetary Committee.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Informal Council meetings provide an opportunity for Ministers to have a general discussion on issues which will feature on the agendas of future formal Councils.  It is not the practice for such meetings to take decisions.  At the informal meeting of EU Finance Ministers in York last month, we discussed a range of issues including economic reform in the EU, the world economy, financial services and the euro, and Agenda 2000. There was also some discussion on EMU which focused on the preparations for the meetings of the ECOFIN Council that will take place during the first weekend of May.</P>
      <P>We considered the approach to be adopted in the preparation of the annual broad economic guidelines.  The Treaty on European Union requires the preparation of such guidelines for the conduct of economic policy in member states. We also discussed how ECOFIN might take forward work on the reform of product and capital markets.  There was general agreement that the Council should focus on the implementation of reforms.  One of the approaches considered was the submission by member states of short annual progress reports setting out the policies being adopted to render product and services markets more efficient and competitive.  These reports would provide a useful input into the broad economic guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> The world economy, particularly in the aftermath of the financial crisis in east Asia, was also discussed.  The discussion focused mainly on systemic issues affecting the architecture of the world economic and monetary systems.  There was general agreement on the need for greater transparency, more private sector involvement in dealing with financial crises and better supervision and regulation of financial systems.</P>
    <P>Other topics included the establishment of a trust fund in the World Bank to assist countries to cope with the aftermath of the financial crisis in east Asia and the creation of a European network of financial and economic experts to make the best European technical assistance available to the countries affected by the financial crisis. The trust fund has since been set up and work on the establishment of the network is ongoing.</P>
    <P>Against the background of a mandate given by the Luxembourg European Council on employment, meeting on 20 and 21 November 1997, we considered papers from the Presidency and the Commission on the completion of the single market for financial services.  In line with the mandate given at the Luxembourg European Council, the Commission is to make a report to the June 1998 European Council.</P>
    <P>President Santer made a presentation on the Commission's proposals on Agenda 2000 which includes, <i>inter alia,</i> the future financial framework of the Union, Structural Funds and the Common Agricultural Policy.  A general and informal discussion about the proposals took place.  These matters are now under discussion in the relevant Council working groups.  The examination/ negotiation process is likely to be a lengthy one and will, in all probability, continue right through this year and into next year as well.  ECOFIN is scheduled to consider progress at its May meeting.</P>

      <P>The development of an effective performance management system is essential to optimising performance at all levels in the Civil Service.  To this end consultants were engaged in 1997 to advise on and assist an interdepartmental group, set up under the strategic management initiative, in designing an appropriate system for use in the Civil Service.  The consultants completed their work at end November 1997.  The arrangements for implementing the proposed system, which will involve significant changes to current practices for managing performance, are now being finalised, including the arrangements for consultations with the Civil Service unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> Implementation will be undertaken in accordance with the participative approach provided for under Partnership 2000.  There has already been considerable consultation with and involvement by staff and their unions in the design and development of the system.  In particular, the views of staff on how performance is and should be managed were sought in a sample survey of staff throughout the Civil Service.  In addition, two project groups, representative of staff in all grades and the unions, worked with the consultants on the design of the system.</P>

      <P>I have previously advised the House that, following the disclosure of allegations concerning the National Irish Bank and Clerical Medical Insurance, I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank of 26 January 1998 drawing his attention to the possibility that developments at NIB could have exchange control implications.  In that letter I also requested the Governor to make a separate report to me on the implications, if any, of the NIB developments for all aspects of banking supervision.</P>
      <P>The governor replied to me on the supervisory side on 19 March 1998.  He confirmed that the bank's inspection of NIB, which was conducted in its capacity of supervisor, had concluded, but that he was precluded by law from revealing the findings.  Deputies will be aware that I have already read the text of the governor's letter into the record of the House.</P>
      <P>In his letter, the governor reiterated the comments made in his letter of 11 November 1997 concerning the supervisory issues arising from the McCracken tribunal, whereby he advised that the board was satisfied with its legal powers which are generally adequate to enable the bank to discharge satisfactorily its statutory functions.  The board keeps supervisory procedures under review and tries to ensure that these are in line with best international practice.  Nothing in the bank's inquiries into the NIB/CMI issue had lead the governor to change any of the conclusions he reported last November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent allegations against NIB concern the alleged application of charges on certain accounts over and above the standard charges which these accounts should have attracted.  The Central Bank is undertaking its own investigation into these new allegations.  I wrote on 30 March 1998 to the governor requesting his views on whether, following the result of the bank's current investigations, he would wish to revise any of his opinions regarding the adequacy of the legal framework for supervision set out in his letters <Col N="305" /> of 11 November 1997 and 19 March 1998. The governor replied on 31 March 1998 advising that when the bank's current investigations are completed he will again write to me.</P>

Indeed, the commission itself recommended that these factors be taken into account in setting the initial rate.</P>
      <P>The impact of a national minimum wage on the public service pay bill, the public sector pay bill and, indeed, the economy as a whole will depend on the timing and manner of its implementation.</P>

      <P>Paragraphs 2 to 7 of circular 15/79 related to &ldquo;Secrecy&rdquo; and to the requirements that the Official Secrets Act imposed on civil servants.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Finance to refer to Circular 15/79 concerning official secrecy and integrity and to say that, in light of the amendment of the Official Secrets Act by the Freedom of Information Act, paragraphs 2 to 7 <Col N="307" /> of Circular 15/79 are now superseded by this Circular.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Freedom of Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, members of the public enjoy, <i>inter alia</i>, a legal right of access to information held by Government Departments and other public bodies.  This right is subject only to certain exemptions.  Arising from the Act certain officers will be given explicit responsibility for the provision of information to members of the public on foot of requests made under the Act.</P>
    <P>The Official Secrets Act has been amended by the Freedom of Information Act.  However, it remains a requirement that civil servants, and former civil servants, avoid improper disclosure of information gained in the course of their official work.  This is essential to enable the efficient discharge of public business and to protect sensitive information given to Government bodies by third parties.  Disclosure of information would be likely to be improper where a person has not been given responsibility or authority to provide information to the public under the Freedom of Information Act, or is not otherwise authorised to do so.  Officers should familiarise themselves with official guidance in this area which is available from personnel units.</P>
    <P>Particular care should be taken to safeguard the confidentiality of information concerning the private affairs of members of the public or concerning the commercial affairs of companies or organisations which has been submitted in connection with official business on condition, or on the reasonable assumption, that it would remain confidential.  Any doubt which may arise as to whether a civil servant is authorised to communicate information in the course of, and in accordance with, his or her duties should be referred in the case of a freedom of information request for decision to the officer who is authorised to make decisions on requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act.  If information is sought outside the Freedom of Information Act then the matter is subject to existing restrictions under the Official Secrets Act.</P>
    <P>From time to time civil servants will deal with particularly sensitive information.  Such information will include information the release of which would</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>On budget day I forecast an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £89 million or 0.2 per cent of GNP.  The latest projections for my Department suggest that we are on course for a budget surplus of £400 million or 0.9 per cent of GNP.  In general Government terms this amounts to 1.2 per cent of GDP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may recall that in the recent budget I set out my budgetary strategy for the next three years.  For the assistance of the House I would like to quote from this.  I said that it was necesary &ldquo;to take account of a number of strategic issues: provide for capital investment, reduce the tax burden, pursue social inclusion, prepare for <Col N="309" /> EMU, anticipate changes in European Structural Funds, plan for an ageing population; reduce our national debt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In relation to the national debt I went on to say:</P>
    <P>As a country we are still deeply in debt.  At the end of this year it is likely to exceed £30 billion or about £22,000 for every person at work.  The interest cost alone will be over £2,300 million.  We must free up these resources.  Think of the alternative uses we could make of them: in increased investment, improved social services, or a reduced tax burden.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to depart from this strategy.</P>

      <P>Profits earned by banks and other businesses in the financial sector are liable to corporation tax at the standard rate, currently 32 per cent with a reduced rate of 25 per cent on the first £50,000 of annual profits.  Profits of financial institutions which arise from licensed trading operations in the IFSC are subject to a rate of 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated corporation tax paid by the financial sector in 1997 was of the order of £500 million. This covers banks and their Irish subsidiaries, building societies, insurance companies and companies based in the IFSC.  The amount does not include foreign tax paid by Irish financial institutions in respect of their overseas operations, which is likely to be significant.</P>
      <P>The tax position of the banks and other financial institutions is kept under continuous review and action can be taken if needed to secure the revenues to the State from this important sector.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure published before the budget reflected a provision <Col N="310" /> of £0.625 million for the proceeds of State asset disposal in 1998.  This is reflected in my budget.</P>
    <P>I am engaged in discussions with staff representatives and the boards and managements of the ACC and ICC banks concerning the possible restructuring of these banks, including the option of disposing of up to 100 per cent of the State's interest in the banks.  At this stage, it is not possible to say what the outcome of these discussions will be nor when any action taken on foot of them will be completed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise announced last month the conclusion of an agreement with the employees of Telecom Éireann on an employee share ownership scheme under which they will acquire a 14.9 per cent shareholding in the company.

      <P>Economic and monetary union, EMU, commences on 1 January 1999 when the exchange rate of the Irish pound against other currencies participating in the euro area and against the euro itself will become irrevocably linked.</P>
      <P>Exchange rates are significantly influenced by the markets' view of countries' current and prospective economic and fiscal performance, and naturally these views change frequently.  In EMU, the exchange rate of the euro, in terms of other currencies, will vary in line with developments on the foreign exchange markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After EMU begins, my Department will, in association with the Central Bank, monitor the euro-sterling exchange rate in much the same way as the Irish pound-sterling exchange rate is currently monitored.  While the performance of sterling is important to us, with the UK being our main trading partner, this concern should not be over-stated in that sterling is unlikely to fall so far from its current high level to cause us major <Col N="311" /> problems.  Furthermore, our trade with the UK, as a percentage of total trade, has continued to decline in recent years.</P>
    <P>Membership of EMU, irrespective of what the UK does, will be of benefit to Ireland &mdash; a conclusion which has been reached by the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council in independent reports.  EMU will bring the elimination of some transaction costs, the elimination of exchange rate risk across the euro area, lower and uniform interest rates and generally easier access to a huge market.  Ireland as a small open economy, is dependent on trade and so the moves towards a single market in the EU is greatly to our benefit. However, while EMU will open up huge opportunities, it will also bring increased levels of competition. I stress the importance to companies of focusing on the opportunities while at the same time addressing any weaknesses which might make them vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Preparation for EMU is, like all issues of competitiveness, primarily a matter for individual companies.  Forfás is co-ordinating the Governments's EMU business awareness campaign and substantial progress is now being made in making companies aware of the issues which deserve attention in the context of their individual operations. Consultants were appointed by Forfás, under the auspices of the EMU business awareness campaign, to examine the direct implications for Irish industry of the UK remaining outside EMU, and I understand that their findings will be incorporated into a series of leaflets focusing on the main action requirements on the part of firms. These leaflets will be distributed as part of the overall business awareness campaign.</P>

      <P>Preparations are well advanced at both national and EU level for the adoption of the single currency, the euro, and the beginning of the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 March last, the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute published their reports on member states' convergence.  The Commission also made a recommendation to the Council of Economic and Finance Minister's, ECOFIN, that the following 11 member states fulfil the necessary conditions for adoption of the euro on 1 January 1999; Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Finland and, of course, Ireland.  The Central Bank of Ireland, at my request, also produced an assessment of Ireland's convergence.  This report was published on 31 March and also concludes that Ireland meets the four convergence criteria concerning price stability, Government budgetary position, exchange rates and interest rates.  The bank states that <Col N="312" /> membership of EMU offers Ireland the prospect of stable economic conditions, based on price stability.</P>
    <P>The decision on which member states will participate in the third stage of EMU from the start will be made next weekend in Brussels.  On Friday 1 May, ECOFIN Ministers will recommend which member states should participate in EMU. In doing so they will act on the recommendation of the Commission and on the basis of the convergence reports of the Commission and the European Monetary Institute.  The European Parliament will give its formal Opinion early on Saturday 2 May, and the Council, Heads of State or Government, will confirm the participants later that day.</P>
    <P>The pre-announcement of the bilateral exchange rates to apply from 1 January 1999 between the currencies of the member states selected to participate in EMU will also be made next weekend.  It is now widely expected that these will be based on their central rates in the Exchange Rate Mechanism.  As the Deputy will recall, following a request from Ireland, the central rate of the Irish pound was revalued by 3 per cent to DM 2.48338, broadly in line with the market rate prevailing at the time, with effect from 16 March last.  The decision to revalue the central rate of the Irish pound represented a balance between competitiveness and inflation concerns.</P>
    <P>To provide the Oireachtas with the opportunity to discuss Ireland's prospective participation in EMU at the outset on 1 January 1999, I requested the Dáil and Seanad to take note of the recommendation from the European Commission concerning the fulfilment by Ireland of the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency. On 1 April, the Dáil duly noted the recommendation; the Seanad did so on 7 April.  In the context of the decisions to be taken next weekend, it is the Government's intention to support the Commission's recommendation that 11 member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro.</P>
    <P>The Government, in conjunction with the social partners, has in recent months established arrangements to accelerate preparation for the competitive impact of EMU.  The Partnership 2000 agreement also provides an explicit review mechanism in the case of disturbance to Ireland's international competitiveness in EMU.</P>
    <P>A key concern of many Irish firms is the performance of sterling.  Clearly, the sterling issue is important but its importance should not be overstated. When we talk about a &ldquo;Sterling shock&rdquo;, we are talking about a sharp fall from its equilibrium level.  Sterling is currently well above what most commentators, including the Governor of the Bank of England, consider to be its equilibrium level.  Therefore, at present, sterling would have to fall a very long way before its level could be considered to present an economic shock.</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the need to prepare for the possibility, no matter how remote, of problems for Irish industry as a consequence of <Col N="313" /> sterling falling significantly below its equilibrium level.  Consultants were appointed by Forfás, under the auspices of its EMU business awareness campaign, to examine the implications for Irish industry of the UK remaining outside of EMU.  I understand the study is now complete and that it has identified a range of actions in the fields of finance, marketing, distribution etc.  that firms could consider as part of their planning for such a contingency.  These actions will be summarised in a document which will be widely distributed in the next few weeks for inclusion in the information pack prepared by Forfás as part of its EMU business awareness campaign.  Ultimately, private sector preparation for possible shocks in EMU is, like all issues of competitiveness in the market place, primarily a matter for companies themselves.</P>
    <P>As regards practical preparations for EMU and the changeover to the euro, my Department has responsibility for co-ordinating the preparations of the Irish public administration and has a key role in helping the rest of the economy to prepare itself for the changeover.</P>
    <P>On 14 January, with the approval of the Government, I published the second edition of EMU and the euro: Ireland's National Changeover Plan.  The plan outlines the timetable for the changeover to the euro.  Briefly, on 1 January 1999, EMU will begin and the euro will come into being as the currency of the participating member states.  It will be useable for cashless transactions, e.g. cheques and credit transfers, from that date. However, euro notes and coins will not be available for a further three years, so Irish pound notes and coins will continue in use and all banking facilities currently available in Irish pounds will continue to be available.  On 1 January 2002, euro notes and coins will be put into circulation and by 1 July 2002 at the latest, probably a good deal earlier, Irish pound notes and coins will cease to be legal tender and the changeover to the euro will be complete.</P>
    <P>The plan also sets out the changeover arrangements that will be made by the public sector, including, specifically, the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and my own Department, the banks and building societies and the Irish Stock Exchange.  It also outlines the initiatives which have been put in place by my Department in connection with the changeover. Briefly in 1995 a single currency officers team, SCOT was set up: this includes a representative from each Government Department and its remit is to co-ordinate preparations for the changeover to the euro in the public sector; in 1996 the euro changeover group was set up: this includes representatives from the ICTU, IBEC and a wide range of private sector bodies and its remit is to help co-ordinate the changeover across the economy; in 1996 the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign was established, to provide businesses with the information they need to prepare themselves <Col N="314" /> for the changeover; in 1997 the euro changeover team in my Department was set up, to carry out my Department's tasks in relation to the changeover in the public administration and in the rest of the economy.</P>
    <P>An appendix to the national changeover plan outlines the changeover work being done by various public and private sector bodies and lists contact points for further information.</P>
    <P>As regards further initiatives in 1998, the plan makes it clear that the focus of the information programme on the changeover will be broadened to include information for the general public.  This will include an advertising campaign which will commence following next month's referendum with a leaflet which will be distributed to every household.  A poster on the euro has been prepared for schools and is being circulated at present.  Also, assuming that the Council confirms next weekend that Ireland fulfils the necessary conditions for adoption of the euro, a euro changeover board will be established in order to oversee the detailed implementation of the changeover, including the areas of public and consumer information.</P>
    <P>A copy of the plan was circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas and further copies are available from my Department and Forfás.</P>
    <P>As regards preparations by business, as the Deputy will be aware, Forfás has been running an excellent EMU business awareness campaign. The campaign has produced an information pack for business which has been widely circulated.  It has also circulated a summary leaflet in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners: over 140,000 copies of the leaflet have been distributed. Over 60,000 copies of a leaflet designed for small and medium-sized enterprises have also been distributed.  Forfás will continue its activities for 1998 and plans to issue further documents on issues such as information technology and a guide for retailers.  The Forfás information pack, which includes the national changeover plan, is available on the Internet.</P>
    <P>On the legislative front, the Central Bank Act, 1998, made sure that our Central Bank legislation is compatible with the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty, while the Finance Act, 1998, provides for the taxation changes required by the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999. Finally, the Government recently approved the drafting of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) Bill, 1998 to cater for other legislative changes necessary for the introduction of the euro from 1 January 1999.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure a clear and comprehensible framework in Irish monetary law following the introduction of the euro; to remove incompatibilities between Irish monetary law and the legal framework for the use of the euro; and to give effect to enabling provisions within the legal framework, for example in relation to the redenomination of outstanding debt.  The Bill is also designed to facilitate companies which wish to redenominate and renominalise their capital structure in euro <Col N="315" /> even before the final changeover to the euro on 1 January 20002.  It is intended to have the Bill enacted by summer 1998.  In preparing it, my Department has been consultating the European Monetary Institute and the European Commission and with interested parties in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As we prepare to join EMU from January 1999 one of the questions most frequently raised is what policy responses will be most effective for Ireland in the event of an economic shock within EMU.</P>
      <P>At the outset it should be noted that in the case of an economic shock affecting the euro area as a whole, this will be dealt with jointly by the member states and the relevant Community institutions, including the ECB.  Furthermore, the risk of an external shock to the competitiveness of the Irish economy, caused by the depreciation of currencies from within the euro zone, will be abolished once we enter EMU.  There has, since Ireland first joined the EEC in 1973, been a marked shift in the pattern of trade, economic integration and adjustment of the Irish economy in line with changes in the European union.  With the elimination of multiple European currencies under EMU final completion of the single market will, in turn, influence the degree of openness, extent of labour mobility and correlation of economic shocks across participating member states, accelerating the convergence and economic performance across participating economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the likelihood of an asymmetric shock affecting the Irish economy only, it is worth noting that the overall economic impact of such a shock was examined in detail in the ESRI study The Economic Implications of EMU for Ireland, published in 1996.  The report concluded that EMU participation by Ireland, taking account of the likelihood and the scale of an economic shock, would yield a positive net benefit to the economy.  In a more recent assessment, Terry Baker of the ESRI confirmed that the potential risks associated with sterling staying outside EMU have diminished considerably.  He attributed this to the significant appreciation of sterling and a fundamental policy shift by the UK Government in favour of possible eventual entry into EMU; he also sees the handing of responsibility for setting interest rates to the Bank of England as an important step in reducing the likelihood of a severe sterling depreciation.  In any case, even if sterling were to depreciate to what some might regard as its long-term equilibrium rate, this should not present insurmountable difficulties for our economy.  The Government is not, however, ignoring the need to prepare for the possibility, no matter how remote of problems for <Col N="316" /> Irish industry as a consequence of sterling falling significantly below its equilibrium level.</P>
    <P>In the unlikely event of an asymmetric shock occurring, flexibility of response will have a crucial role in ensuring that Ireland's economy has the capacity to successfully accommodate economic shocks.  By continuing to support the social partnership approach to economic and social policy the Government remains focused on the intensification of an internationally competitive environment for Irish enterprise in EMU.</P>
    <P>Recent rapid economic growth in Ireland has left us in a position of economic strength which should enable us to cope with any shocks within EMU.  The Government can through its management of the economy help to ensure Ireland's international competitiveness in the face of an external shock.  Fiscal policy will have an important role in stabilising the economy following an economic shock by maintaining the Government's budget in broad balance over the economic cycle in line with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pack.  To be able to do this we must run budget surpluses when times are good, as they are now.</P>

      <P>The communiqué issued on behalf of EU Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors following the meeting on 14 March 1998 at which the revaluation of the Irish pound's central rate in the ERM was decided including the following statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> The ministers and governors noted the firm resolve of the Irish authorities not to exceed the expenditure commitments in the 1998 budget and to ensure that any revenues above those anticipated in that budget are used to raise the primary surplus, and thus the general government surplus, above the planned figures.</P>
    <P>The Government's resolve, as indicated in the communiqué, to use any additional revenues in 1998 to increase the general government surplus rather than to fund extra expenditure marks its determination to ensure budgetary policy supports continued strong economic growth in a balanced and sustainable way.  With the revaluation of the Irish pound, the Government's policy on spending will help to ensure any unwelcome additions to demand and inflationary pressures in the economy are avoided.  It is the Government's firm intention to pursue economic and budgetary policies which will best support our efforts to keep the economy on a path of sustainable growth with price stability.</P>
    <P>Adherence to budgetary discipline is something to which all prospective participants in economic and monetary union are committed.  The acceptance by all EMU participants of the necessity for tight budgetary policies as set out in the Stability and Growth Pact will facilitate the achievement of the stable economic conditions essential to the success of the single currency.</P>
    <P>In relation to 1998 expenditure, I will continue to monitor the position closely during the year. In consultation with my Cabinet colleagues I will aim to ensure expenditure is managed in accordance with the Government's overall budgetary strategy and the requirements of EMU membership. Specifically, I will aim to ensure total expenditure in 1998 does not exceed the amount provided for in the 1998 revised Estimates for Public Service.  My statement on the end-March Exchequer returns said that spending in the first quarter was broadly in line with expectations.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to section 61 of this year's Finance Act which deals with tax relief for corporate donations to eligible charities.  For a charity to be eligible for this relief, it must have been granted exemption by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="318" /> from tax for the purposes of section 207 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  The legislation also requires that the eligible charity must have had this exemption for at least three years.</P>
      <P>The reason for introducing the three year requirement is to ensure that any charity applying for the relief has a proven track record and that it is not being set up simply to benefit from the tax relief.  A similar condition applies to the tax relief for donations to designated Third World charities introduced by my predecessor.</P>

      <P>The reports that there was a sizeable number of bogus non-resident accounts in AIB and other banks in the late 1980s and early 1990s have given rise to considerable, and understandable, concerns.  I share those concerns.  I am totally against tax evasion and I am determined to ensure it is dealt with as firmly as possible.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated on several occasions that I have asked Revenue and my Department to look at whether new powers are needed for Revenue in tackling tax evasion.  This review of Revenue powers is a wide-ranging one and includes the question of the extent of Revenue's access to bank accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that the pursuit of particular tax cases is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who must deal with them on a confidential basis.  I can, however, say that on various occasions in the past Revenue has discovered individual cases where false non-residence declarations had been made by individuals for the purpose of evading tax on deposit interest.  In all <Col N="319" /> these cases, Revenue took action as regards the taxpayers involved, by recovering any underpaid tax and interest and penalties, as appropriate.  I understand Revenue also raised the matter generally with certain institutions concerned in the early 1990s and was given assurances that steps had been taken to ensure compliance with the legislative requirements.  I have been advised by the Central Bank that it was aware of the matter at the time and of the steps being taken, including those of the Revenue Commissioners, to correct the situation.</P>
    <P>Before recent media reports of historic non-compliance in this area, Revenue had already commenced a review of the position generally.  Its work includes an examination of ongoing controls, procedures and liabilities and, where considered necessary, involves an examination of liabilities in past years.  The review covers all financial institutions and will take some time to complete.</P>
    <P>I will keep the matter under review and will also be examining it in the light of the report of the Moriarty Tribunal so that whatever measures are considered necessary in this area will be put forward.</P>

      <P>The Agreement reached in the multi-party talks should result in economic benefits for the whole island, North and South, and perhaps more particularly for the Border region.  The Deputy will be aware that the Border region is already receiving special financial assistance under various programmes related to its special situation. These programmes include the International Fund for Ireland, the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and the INTERREG programme.</P>
      <P>The International Fund for Ireland was established by the Irish and British Governments in 1986 with the aim of promoting economic and social progress in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  The fund has received contributions from the European Union, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.  The fund has already provided a total of £350 million overall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, established by the European Union in 1995, is aimed at Northern Ireland and the Border counties. It involves total EU expenditure of approximately £320 million over four years.  At least 20 <Col N="320" /> per cent of this funding is available for the six Border counties.</P>
    <P>The joint Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programme established under the Structural Funds, has approved EU funding for the Border counties for the six years 1994-99 of approximately IR£73 million.  The allocation to Northern Ireland was £53 million.</P>
    <P>The EU Community Support Framework for Ireland, 1994-99 includes a commitment on the part of the Irish and the UK Governments to maximise co-operation on Northern Ireland. Doubtless, this commitment to co-operation will continue during the next round of funding.  With regard to the planning process for the post-1999 Structural Funds, I have written to all regional authorities seeking their proposals for investment in their regions, including their proposals for cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is too early to say precisely what additional measures may result from the recent Agreement. The Deputy can be assured, however, that the Government will be making all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Border region benefits from the additional supports that should now become available on foot of the Agreement.</P>

      <P>Many different underwriting factors are used by insurers in assessing the amount of premium payable by all the various motor insurance risk categories, including age of vehicle, type of vehicle, the value of the vehicle and the applicable horse power level, etc.  However, the high cost of motor insurance encountered by young drivers is not solely determined by common vehicle assessment <Col N="322" /> factors, but is related mainly to their relatively poor accident and third party claims experience.</P>
      <P>Globally insurers tend to classify young and/or inexperienced drivers as a high insurance risk category relative to the more mature and/or experienced driver.  The adverse statistical facts, in terms of claims frequency and cost, regarding the young driver category of motorist have been cited many times in the House.</P>
      <P>Logically the key to reducing insurance premiums for young drivers is to raise their standards of safe driving.  The raising of such standards is not only in the interests of young drivers themselves, but in the wider interests of the community at large, which suffers the consequences of unsafe driving by young motorists.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my reply on 18 February last, a number of initiatives have been taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among young drivers.  These include the introduction of a scheme of insurance premium discounts by the insurance industry, in conjunction with the driving instructors register, on completion of a required number of driving lessons; the introduction of road safety educational programmes for students and advertising campaigns by the National Safety Council to discourage speeding; and the ongoing examination by the Department of the Environment and Local Government of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers. Such a system would, I believe, assist insurers in refining and segmenting the young driver market in a more scientific manner.</P>
      <P>After negotiations which I initiated after coming into office, Guardian PMPA, the leading motor insurer, recently announced the introduction of a special 6 per cent introductory discount for young male drivers aged 17 to 24 years who currently receive a nil no claims discount, with reductions also being given to young female drivers. Hibernian Insurance Company subsequently announced a similar scheme.</P>
      <P>I will also shortly be re-establishing the Motor Insurance Advisory Board to inquire into premia and loadings in motor insurance and to advise me on the charges for motor insurance as between different risk categories of drivers, having regard to the claims structure in each category.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to point out that concessions to young drivers have been introduced against the background of increasing underwriting losses in motor insurance.  The 1996 annual insurance report prepared by our Department showed that motor insurance underwriting losses increased from £41 million in 1995 to £90 million in 1986. The deteriorating underwriting situation has led some insurers to announce increases in certain insurance categories in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances, any reductions or discounts offered to young drivers must effectively be subsidised by increased premia paid by lowerrisk categories of motorists.  It does not make good commercial sense, nor is it equitable, that safer drivers should subsidise less responsible drivers. That simply reduces the incentive for safe <Col N="323" /> driving among all classes of motorists, leading to increased claims costs and a progressive deterioration in the insurers' underwriting account.  The end result is that average motor insurance premia in the economy will operate at a higher level than would otherwise obtain if the principle of riskbased premium-setting is strictly applied to all motor insurance categories.</P>
    <P>The Government levy to which the Deputy refers is in respect of a 2 per cent Exchequer tax which has been payable on non-life insurance policies since 1993.  The method of operation and collection thereof is, of course, a matter for my Government colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 79 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is pleased to be able to deliver the commission's report, the first stage in the process of fulfilling its commitments to introduce a national minimum hourly rate, and welcomes the commission's fundamental recommendation that there should be a single rate for all adults.  The Government notes the recommendation of the National Minimum Wage Commission that the initial rate should be set at around two-thirds of median earnings but that it should take into account issues of employment, overall economic conditions and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental working group, representative of the principal Departments involved, has been established to assist in formulating proposals and an implementation plan and to come back to Government as early as possible.  The Interdepartmental committee will study the issues, including economic impacts and costs, arising from the commission's recommendations. Consultations will also need to take place with the social partners and, indeed, I believe the initial rate should be struck in the context of negotiations on a successor to Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>I agree with the commission view that both the recommended structure and level of the minimum wage should take account of the needs of the most sensitive sectors to remain competitive. The knock-on effect of the introduction of a minimum wage and how effectively to control such effects &mdash; a matter in which the commission has made some suggestions &mdash; would also be an important element in consultation with the social partners.</P>

      <P>I am very satisfied that the mechanism of the National Research Support Fund Board is working well to support an effective national system of innovation, which is our common goal.  This is reflected in the fact that funding provided to the <Col N="325" /> National Research Support Fund Board has increased each year since the establishment of the board in 1995.  Funding figures are £4.831 million in 1995; £7.548 million in 1996 and £8.0 million in 1997.  For 1998, a minimum of £8.799 million is being provided.</P>

      <Quest>whether the decision taken under the Mergers, Take Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 to prohibit the acquisition by Coillte Teoranta of an 80 per cent stake in the Balcas group has implications for any future proposals by Coillte Teoranta seeking to make an equity investment in the sawmilling sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 5 January 1998 I received a notification of a proposaal under the Mergers and Takeovers (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996, whereby Coillte Teoranta intended to acquire a majority of the issued share capital of Balcas Limited, a sawmilling company.  Under section 7 of the Mergers Acts, I can either approve a proposed merger or takeover, or refer a proposal to the Competition Authority for investigation.  Under section 9 of the Mergers Acts, I can then decide whether to permit the proposal, either conditionally or unconditionally, or to prohibit it by Order.</P>
      <P>I decided to exercise the option of referral to the Competition Authority in this case.  The purpose of referring the proposal was to establish whether, in the opinion of the authority, the acquisition would be likely to prevent or restrict competition, restrain trade in any goods or services, or be likely to operate against the common good.  In assesing the likely effect of a proposal on the common good, the authority has regard to a number of criteria.  These criteria are continuity of supplies or services, level of employment, regional development, rationalisation of operations in the interests of greater efficiency, research and development, increased production, access to markets, shareholders and partners, employees and consumers.</P>
      <P>Following its investigation, the Competition Authority reported to me and recommended by a three to one majority that the takeover should be prohibited on competition grounds.  In the interest of fair procedures, the parties to the proposal and interested third parties were circulated with the authority's report in order to give them the opportunity to comment on it.  I also consulted the Ministers for the Marine and Natural Resources and Finance for their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to all the comments I received, and indeed all the circumstances of the proposal, I decided to prohibit the takeover in the interest of the common good.  To give effect to my decision, I have made an Order under section 9 <Col N="326" /> of the Mergers and Takeovers (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996, which I have laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I have also placed copies of the report of the Competition Authority in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>Any future proposals by Coillte Teoranta notified to me under the Mergers and Takeovers (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996, will be considered by me in accordance with the provisions of the Acts.</P>
    <P>The main criteria for such a notification to me is set out in section 2 (1) (a) of the 1978 Act, as amended, that each of two or more of the enterprises involved in the proposal have gross assets of not less than £10 million or a turnover of not less than £20 million in the most recent financial year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, ICI has indicated a desire to dispose of its 49 per cent shareholding in Irish Fertilizer Industries (IFI).  On the day of the recent annual general meeting of IFI, I met with the board following that meeting and, in particular, the ICI nominated directors, to discuss ICI's intentions and my own interest in the company's future.  In addition, I also had on a separate occasion a productive meeting with representatives of the IFI group of unions.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be discussing the matter with the chairman of ICI to examine the available options and to seek to make progress on an agreed approach to funding a new shareholder to replace ICI.  Pending such contact with ICI, no firm decisions have yet been taken regarding IFI. However, I can assure the Deputy that my priority is to seek to secure the future of IFI as a fertilizer manufacturer and to ensure that the maximum level of employment possible is maintained. To this end, I expect that matters will progress significantly in the coming months.</P>

      <P>ISO 14001 is a world-wide standard for environmental management systems, which has been adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation, CEN, as a European standard also.  I understand that when CEN adopts a European standard, the rules of CEN require all CEN member countries to adopt the European standard without change and to withdraw any conflicting standards.  As a consequence of our membership of CEN, Ireland was required to withdraw IS 310.</P>
      <P>Both ISO 14001 and IS 310 use the same approach and have a strong improvement imperative built in.  There is a system review involved in each, whereby the policy and environmental protection measures of the company applying the standard are evaluated and tightened up as necessary in line with the objectives of the system.  ISO is a globally recognised standard and has special status in the context of World Trade Organisation agreements.</P>
      <P>Environmental management systems have been developed as a tool to assist industry in managing its environmental affairs in a more assured, orderly, open and efficient manner.  Certification to these systems is voluntary and is a demonstration of a company's commitment to integrate environmental considerations into all aspects of the management of its operations.</P>

    <P>I have already reintroduced in 1998 the key conservation measures recommended by the salmon <Col N="332" /> management task force: shorter fishing seasons, a reduction in the prescribed maximum number of licences, the reduction in the sea fishing area from 12 to six nautical miles from the baselines, the deferral of the commencement date for the driftnet fishery at sea to June, the deferral of the commencement date for the draftnet fishery to 12 May, the reduction of fishing time to four days per week and day only fishing for driftnet at sea and renewal of last year's permissions in relation to monofilament netting.</P>
    <P>The consultation and feedback process on the fundamental issues involved in translating the tagging and quota concept into practical reality is critically informing my considerations of the legislative, structural and resource requirements inherent in the proposals.  In the meantime, a number of the practical initiatives timetabled in the Marine Institute report for 1998 continue to be progressed.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 102, 103 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has been deeply concerned by the hunger strike in New Delphi which is reported to have been brought to an end yesterday. The action taken by the six Tibetans involved in the strike has, I believe, drawn substantial attention to their cause.  The risk that lives might be lost as a result of their action was always, however, a source of great worry.</P>
      <P>The human rights situation in Tibet continues to be a matter of considerable concern to the Government and was raised by me during my meeting with the then Chinese Foreign Minister when I visited Beijing in February of this year.  I will raise the question of human rights in Tibet on every appropriate occasion during future contacts with the Chinese.  I believe also that direct talks should take place between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government; this would be of great assistance in helping to resolve the difficult issues involved.  I was aware furthermore of the interest of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in the situation in Tibet.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the concern felt by all EU member states in relation to the situation in Tibet, a Troika of EU Ambassadors from Beijing will visit Tibet from 1 to 10 May to investigate human rights conditions there.  Further action by the EU on the issue will be based on the information obtained as a result of this visit.</P>

      <P>The final peace agreement, the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace, between the Guatemalan Government and the various political factions in that country was signed on 29 December 1996. A report of the United Nations Secretary General's human rights mission to Guatemala dated 13 February 1998 has noted that the human rights situation in Guatemala has improved substantially. This does not mean that there are no longer any human rights problems.  Many have been inherited from the past, including the question of the recognition of and compensation for victims of human rights abuses.  The solution to others will require a more developed democratic structure. A particular concern is that impunity of alleged human rights abusers remains a problem. There is also a need to tackle structural defects in the system of the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>At its recent session in Geneva, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights adopted unanimously with Irish support, a Resolution on assistance to Guatemala in the field of human rights.  This Resolution was based on the UN report of 13 February.  The Resolution notes that institutionally there no longer exists an established state policy that violates basic human rights or individual rights in the country, and declares support for the work of the Commission for Historical Clarification which is examining past human rights abuses and the issue of compensation for victims of those abuses.  It also calls on the Guatemalan Government to assist that commission in its important work and to continue with its efforts to tackle the human rights problems that remain.  In this connection, I wish to add my voice to the condemnation by the UN Secretary General of the assassination on 26 April of Monsignor Juan Gerardi, Co-ordinator General of the Human Rights Office of the Archbishopric of Guatemala.  I wish to see a thorough investigation into this brutal crime and I note that the United Nations is closely monitoring the investigation by the Guatemalan authorities.  I can assure the Deputy that along with our European Union partners the Government will continue to impress upon the Guatemalan authorities the need to adhere to international human rights standards and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.</P>

      <P>Under the Irish Government's bilateral aid programme, the co-financing scheme with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, provides grants for small to medium-sized projects which meet basic needs in the sectors of health, education, <Col N="336" /> water-sanitation, income generation, rural development and urban community development. Under this scheme a total of nine development projects in Guatemala have been supported since 1994 through block grant funding to Trócaire, the principal Irish NGO working in Guatemala. Funding for these projects has amounted to £102,481.</P>
      <P>In 1998, block funding is again being made available to Trócaire for development projects.  It is expected that some of this funding will be allocated to projects in Guatemala.  The Department will be happy to consider funding applications for appropriate development projects in Guatemala from other Irish or Irish-linked NGOs.  In November 1997 a grant of IR£49,400 was given to Trócaire towards a specific human rights training programme in Guatemala.  The project aims to contribute to the peace process in Guatemala and the establishment of a society based on respect and human rights.  Activities under the project will include training in exhumation techniques; seminars on trauma counselling and training of human rights monitors.  The Centre for Legal Action for Human Rights, CALDH, will implement the programme.  Trócaire has been working with CALDH for five years and will monitor the programme.</P>
      <P>The Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, has recently recruited and is fully funding eight United Nations volunteers to work as human rights officers in Guatemala.  The volunteers will work in the UN Verification Mission, Minugua, which has a mandate to verify the implementation of the comprehensive agreement on human rights entered into by the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revoluncionaria Nacional Guatemalteca.  The approximate cost to APSO will be £220,000.  APSO is fully funded by the Department's bilateral aid programme.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 99 of 3 March 1998.  I am aware of the study referred to by the Deputy relating to the recent discovery of high levels of radioactive contamination of feral pigeons near the Sellafield reprocessing plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> Feral pigeons are highly territorial and are unlikely, therefore, to migrate any great distance. While it is most unlikely that these pigeons would migrate to Ireland, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, decided, nonetheless, to measure radioactivity in Irish pigeons. However, no detectable levels of radioactive contamination were observed by the RPII.  There is, therefore, nothing to indicate that contamination of birds should be a cause of concern in Ireland. Both my Department and the RPII have been in contact with the UK authorities on this matter and contact will continue as necessary.</P>

      <P>In line with Government policy, the Department of Foreign Affairs has, in the past, made formal, high level diplomatic approaches to the Governments of countries which signed, or which were contemplating signing, reprocessing agreements on spent nuclear fuel with the THORP facility at Sellafield, setting out the concerns of the Irish Government in this area.  Germany was among those countries approached.</P>
      <P>The Irish position was generally sympathetically received by the authorities concerned and the concerns were then conveyed to the nuclear electricity companies.  However, it was pointed out by the Governments concerned that they could not intervene directly in contractual agreements entered into with British Nuclear Fuels Limited, BNFL.</P>

      <P>As regards competition between airports, the position is that no licence or other approval is required from my Department for the provision or development of an airport in Ireland.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> As regards separate terminal operations within an airport, the Deputy may be aware that my predecessor as Minister, Deputy Alan Dukes, while not ruling out that concept, decided in May 1997 that the proposal of Huntstown Airpark Limited relating to a private terminal development at Dublin Airport was not in the interests of the future development of that airport.  He was of the view that, from both an airport planning and economic point of view, the existing terminal complex should be developed to its maximum capacity before a second remote location terminal is developed.</P>
    <P>The determination of An Bord Pleanála's hearing of an appeal by the promoters of Huntstown Airpark is suspended at present pending the outcome of a judicial review of the appeal process. A date for hearing the action in the High Court is awaited.</P>

      <P>The recent transfer of a shipment of nuclear material containing approximately 4kg of enriched uranium and about 1kg of spent nuclear fuel raises complex issues about the optimum approach by the international community to the problem of the disposal of nuclear material located in the former Soviet Union.  The general consensus in the western world is that it is desirable that storage of such material should be arranged at secure locations which are not vulnerable to terrorist threats or other forms of civil conflict or disturbances.  Taking a global view of the problem of the disposal of spent fuel and the stockpile of excess plutonium, I believe that it is reasonable to argue that there are positive benefits in removing this consignment from Tbilisi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do have some misgivings about the intention to store and reprocess material at Dounreay.  I have been concerned for some time about the general suitability of Dounreay as a result of waste management practices at the site and the Government's general opposition to reprocessing because of the associated proliferation risks.  An added source of concern is the recent resignation of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, UKAEA, Chief Constable because of <Col N="340" /> alleged shortcomings in the security arrangements at the Dounreay site.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I have written to Mr. Michael Meacher, MP, UK Minister for the Environment, expressing my concern about the decision to reprocess some of the material and seeking clarification of the steps which will be taken to address the suitability of Dounreay from a safety and security viewpoint.</P>

My Department, however, is not fully satisfied that the person named operated a separate unit from that of his late mother, who was also an applicant under the 1996 and 1997 cattle and sheep schemes.  The matter is being investigated at present with a view to resolving the outstanding issues as soon as possible.  This issue is delaying payment of 1997 grants to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>A submission to establish a new category of extremely disadvantaged areas in Ireland was formally presented to the EU Commission on 9 October 1996.  Subsequent to the submission, the Commission raised the issues of conservation and overgrazing in connection with the REPs and special areas of conservation.  It is concerned to ensure proposals affecting the extension and classification of land in the disadvantaged areas do not have an adverse effect on areas which are being targeted by the REPs and SACs as requiring special attention.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Commission made it clear that discussions relating to overgrazing and conservation must be concluded before proposals affecting disadvantaged areas would be examined. These discussions have now been finalised and are due to go to the EU Committee on Agricultural Structures for formal approval later this week.  Following this, I will endeavour to ensure that the Commission begins its examination of the third tier proposal as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The current REP scheme was initially approved for a five year period ending in 1999. An improved REPS package has been drawn up in conjunction with the EU Commission Services which will apply in natural heritage areas and commonages.  The proposed new scheme, which has yet to be formally approved by the Commission, includes the operation of basic REPS and will operate for five year periods, renewable for up to 15 years.  It is the intention, as set out in the programme for Government that the current REP scheme, outside NHA-commonage areas will be continued beyond 1999 for at least ten years.  It will be open to existing participants to reapply on expiry of their current five year contracts.</P>

      <P>A table outlining the staffing levels at the various Department veterinary offices throughout the country follows.  In order to ensure compliance with the current EU regulations for the intake of beef into intervention, it has been necessary on an ongoing basis to temporarily transfer technical agricultural officers from district veterinary offices to meat inspection duties.</P>
      <P>Temporary technical agricultural officers are being recruited at present.  These officers will be assigned to meat inspection duties mainly.  This should decrease the number of temporary transfers from district veterinary offices to the meat inspection area.</P>
      <P>I am keeping the staffing situation at these offices under review and I can assure the Deputy that existing staff resources will continue to be used to best effect to meet the day to day needs of farmers.</P>
      <P>Numbers in our veterinary offices are subject to constant change.  The table below consists of staff numbers for veterinary offices throughout the country for December 1997.</P>

      <P>In so far as payments under the various EU headage and premia schemes are concerned the position is that under EU regulations governing the bovine premia schemes, payments cannot commence until 1 November each year and even then only a 60 per cent advance payment can be made.  The regulations provide that balancing payments must be made by 30 June of the year following the year of application.  There is a tolerance representing 4 per cent of the total amount paid by 30 June which can be used to make payments outside the 30 June deadline in duly justified exceptional circumstances.  Generally, payments made after 30 June of the year following the year of application and which do not come within the 4 per cent tolerance are not funded by the EU and any such payments must be funded totally by the Exchequer.  The regulations do not provide for the payment of interest in respect of payments made outside the deadline of 30 June of the year following the year of application.</P>
      <P>In so far as the disadvantaged areas headage schemes are concerned, these are 65 per cent co-financed by the EU but the regulations do not stipulate a payment deadline.  In Ireland we try to ensure that full payment is made in eligible cases in the year of application.</P>
      <P>In the charter of rights for farmers my Department has set out certain target dates for making payments under the various schemes.  In general the target dates are well ahead of the EU requirements. With the exception of a relatively small number of applicants who have problems with their 1997 area aid applications my Department is on target to meet the payment deadlines set down in the charter of rights for farmers.</P>
      <P>Last week I announced revised arrangements for dealing with the remaining 1997 problem area aid cases giving priority to those cases which are holding up some balancing payments under the 1997 special beef premium and suckler cow premium. I am confident that the arrangements which I have put in place will lead to resolving the outstanding issues and that the outstanding payments will be made within the EU deadline.</P>

      <P>A system of compliance checking of REPS plans was introduced in May 1996 to improve the control and monitoring of REPS. The introduction of compliance checking was necessitated by the fact that spot checks carried out by my Department on REPS plans prior to March 1996 indicated that a significant number did not conform sufficiently with the REPS specification to enable payments to be made.</P>
      <P>Page 7, sections 17 and 19 of the original scheme document, issued in May 1994, contains the relevant conditions which govern the introduction of the compliance checking system under REPS.  The relevant clauses are as follows:</P>
      <P>17 (b) states: If the applicant fails to abide by the conditions of the scheme or if there is any material change in the circumstances of the applicant which would be in conflict with the terms of the scheme all or such portion of aid given or to be given as the Minister may determine shall be reimbursed or withheld. The Minister also reserves the right to offset such amounts against other moneys payable by the Department to the applicant in such cases.</P>
      <P>17 (c) states: The Minister reserves the right to review and, if necessary, to terminate payments under the scheme where no improvement to the environment is evident.</P>
      <P>Section 19 states: The Minister reserves the right to alter from time to time the procedures to be followed in the operation of this scheme.</P>

      <P>There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context tax <Col N="352" /> law follows the general law relating to marriage. The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance and double rate bands are given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, 1980, which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I should explain in the Hyland case in 1989 the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an &mdash; unmarried &mdash; cohabiting couple.  This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances. An interdepartmental working group has been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  This group is due to report by the middle of this year.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer's tax free allowances have been reduced in the current tax year compared with the last tax year because his wife is now in receipt of an invalidity pension which is taxable.  This pension is paid in full by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs without tax being deducted.  In order to collect the tax due on the invalidity pension, it is necessary to reduce the taxpayer's tax free allowances by an amount equal to the taxable pension his wife receives.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer's tax free allowances are now £100.18 per week.  The original certificate of tax free allowances which issued to him for the current year showed his tax free allowances as £97.68 per week.  This was because the taxpayer had not been allowed the full amount of expenses to which he is entitled.  This has now been rectified and a revised certificate of tax free allowances is being issued.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department is directly responsible only for Civil Service pensioners.  In the case of those pensioners, because of the complexities of the various restructuring deals, it is necessary to examine most pensioner files manually, in consultation with other Departments, in order to determine what increase is due.  In many cases, manual examination of files is also necessary to determine which restructuring deal is applicable to the individual pensioner.  The number of pensioner files involving manual examination is over 9,000.  The work in my Department has been ongoing on the implementation of this decision since its announcement last November and the full amounts due have been paid in some cases.  I would add that some pensioners are not yet in a position to benefit because restructuring deals have not yet been concluded for their serving counterparts.</P>
      <P>I would point out that an advance payment was made to a substantial proportion of pensioners before Christmas.</P>
      <P>As regards other areas of the public service, my Department issued instructions last November on the implementation of the Government decision along with a request to make the relevant payments as quickly as possible.

      <P>Under the terms of the pension scheme for secretarial assistants in the Houses of the Oireachtas, the occupational pension is integrated with the social welfare pension as is the practice in other areas of the public sector where employees qualify for the full range of social welfare benefits.  Under the terms of the scheme a pension, where payable, is based on &ldquo;net-pensionable remuneration&rdquo;. This means the amount by which pensionable remuneration exceeds twice the rate of old age contributory pension payable on the last day of pensionable service to a person who has no adult dependant or qualified children.</P>
      <P>Where a member of the scheme retires at age 60, a supplementary pension may be paid in respect of any period after retirement during which the pensioner is not employed; and fails to qualify, for reasons outside his or her control, for the maximum personal rate of invalidity pension, unemployment benefit, disability benefit or contributory old age pension.  The supplementary pension is designed to ensure that in the circumstances outlined above the person concerned has a combined income not less than the pension which would have been payable without co-ordination. An applicant for a supplementary pension must confirm in writing that the above conditions are fulfilled in his or her case.</P>

The specific abatement issue raised by the Deputy which was established following an independent arbitrator's finding in 1984 has not been legally tested.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 and 178 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of funding for drug misuse related services in the Eastern Health Board area is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  The Eastern Health Board, in line with the ministerial task force recommendations on measures to reduce the demand for drugs, in conjunction with voluntary agencies and community groups, provides education and prevention programmes and services aimed at delivering advice and harm minimisation programmes to drug misusers.  The board provides direct funding to a number of organisations, including Urrús, which provide education and training modules on drug misuse, addiction and community responses. Thirty thousand pounds was granted by the health board to Urrús in 1996 and also in 1997 as 25 per cent matching support for a project funded by the EU HORIZON programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 1998, Urrús has contracted with a number of local drugs task forces to provide community addiction studies programmes in local areas and funding is being provided to Urrús from the £10 million granted to the local drugs task forces to develop a response to the drug problem in priority areas where the drug problem is most acute.  However, Urrús has identified that there is a shortfall in relation to its operational costs due to the conclusion of its EU funded HORIZON <Col N="357" /> project this year.  Discussions are ongoing with the National Drugs Strategy Team, on which the Eastern Health Board is represented, regarding the provision of further funding to cover the operational costs of the Urrús centre.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 177 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Peto Institute and its offshoots provide a treatment regime called conductive education for children with conditions such as cerebral palsy. Treatment in this country for these conditions is <Col N="358" /> normally provided by a multidisciplinary team and includes such elements as physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy.  Conductive education is an alternative regime whereby a group of children work with a &ldquo;conductor&rdquo; who combines the roles of the therapist, teacher, nurse and care worker.  Organisations providing services in this country for children with disabilities have evaluated the conductive education system and have incorporated in their own treatment regimes, those aspects of it which are considered helpful.  On this basis, I do not propose to make funding available as proposed by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The policy of my Department is to develop services in this country to the highest standard and to provide them as close to the people who need them as possible.  Recoupment of medical costs by a health board for treatment abroad will only be considered where the service is not available in this country and a medical consultant recommends that such treatment is necessary.  I recognise the value of alternative medicine and therapies in the care of people with disabilities when used by trained professionals in the best interests of the client.  I have no proposals to provide further recognition.</P>

      <Col N="359" /> My Department has arranged to have an examination of the home help services carried out by an independent body, under the supervision of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, to advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other community based services.  I expect work to be completed on this review by mid-summer.  When I have received the report I will be in a better position to consider how best to bring about improvements in the overall organisation and development of the home help service.  I am conscious of the variations between health boards in the hourly rate of payment to part-time home helps and it is the intention to bring about improvements in this situation as resources permit.</P>

A national breast screening programme is currently at an advanced stage of preparation and it is hoped to commence screening in phase one of the programme later this year.  I have funded a number of breast clinics under the national cancer strategy. The strategy provides an integrated and comprehensive approach to reducing the incidence of and deaths from all forms of cancer.  I have provided £8.7 million in 1998 to continue implementation of the strategy, including £1 million for the national breast screening programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the facilities in place for the detection of breast cancer in the Western Health Board region, mammography machines are in place at University College Hospital, Galway and Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar.  UCHG also operates a dedicated breast clinic.</P>
    <P>To date, detailed information on death from breast cancer from the National Cancer Registry Board is available for three years only.  Care must be taken in interpreting data over such a short period.  The NCRB will continue to monitor trends in deaths from breast cancer and other forms of cancer in the coming year, and my Department will continue to support the board in its work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182, 183, 184 and 188 together.</P>
      <P>At present, in Ireland mammography is used primarily as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or concerned women on referral from their GPs and in some cases for women at particular risk of developing the disease.  Diagnostic mammography services are currently provided at 19 centres throughout the country, as per the following list.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis. The aim is to lead to earlier detection and treatment of breast cancer in asymptomatic women. In Ireland, experience of breast screening to date derives from a pilot programme, known as the Eccles breast screening programme, which was established in 1989 by the Mater Foundation.  The Eccles programme successfully demonstrated that a mammography screening programme is feasible in an Irish setting.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the then Minister announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy.  Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme for women aged 50-64.  Phase I will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and I will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 65, which represents approximately 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and the importance of ensuring that the Irish programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria.  As Minister for Health and Children, I am very much aware of the <Col N="362" /> unnecessary trauma and anguish that could be caused for women and their families as a result of mistakes in an organised screening programme. It is for this reason that the Irish national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice.</P>
    <P>Specifically the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors: the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective; and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    <P>A major challenge facing the programme was the need to establish a named population register which would comply with the data protection requirements.  However, I am pleased to say that following the passage of the Health Provision (No. 3) Act, 1997, and subsequent correspondence with the Data Protection Commissioner, we are now in a position to proceed with the establishment of a population register for the programme. Work is well advanced on this issue and it is hoped to have the register in place by July 1998.</P>
    <P>Since the launch of the cancer action plan, there have been a number of other important developments in relation to breast screening. These include: (i) the establishment of a national steering group, chaired by Dr. Sheelah Ryan, chief executive officer, Western Health Board, to guide the implementation of the national programme of screening for breast cancer, (ii) the establishment of a national quality assurance committee, chaired by Professor Ennis, consultant radiologist, Mater Hospital, as a subcommittee of the steering group &mdash; the committee is representative of experts from all the relevant clinical disciplines, and (iii) the decision to appoint a project director for the programme.</P>
    <P>A key development in recent months was a decision by the breast screening steering committee on a model of delivery for phase I of the programme. It has been agreed that there will be two central units based at the Mater and St. Vincent's, where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multidisciplinary team approach involving the relevant clinical disciplines, including the screening radiologist.  In addition, there will be two mobile units to bring the screening services to the women in the more remote-rural areas within the three health boards in phase I. Each mobile unit will be linked with one of the central units.  This should ensure uniformity of standards and continuity of care.</P>
    <P>Key factors in ensuring compliance among the target population would be health promotion and awareness campaigns.  The steering committee will be working closely with my Department's health promotion unit in this regard to ensure that women are fully aware of the benefits of participating in the screening programme.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the lead in time involved in the development of IT systems, the establishment of the population register and the recruitment <Col N="363" /> of consultant and support staff, I am advised that we should be in a position to start the programme by autumn 1998.  I am committed to making the necessary resources available to the programme to facilitate the commencement of screening and substantial funding has already been made available in 1998 to meet the start up costs for the programme.</P>
    <P>Decisions taken in relation to subsequent phases, which will include the Western Health Board area, will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place.  The steering committee has recommended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, imposed a statutory duty on health boards to carry out, as soon as practicable, assessments for foreign adoptions.  In carrying out this function, the boards must have regard to the competing demands in other areas of the child care services, particularly in relation to the protection of children from abuse and neglect, which takes priority over all other work.  Under the Act, it is also open to an applicant to request a registered adoption society to carry out an assessment. However, there is no obligation on a registered adoption society to carry out such an assessment.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are different timescales for the completion of the assessment process in the different health boards.  This difference arises principally from the greater volume of applications in some areas, particularly in the Eastern Health Board.  I met senior management of the Eastern Health Board last year to discuss delays in carrying out assessments of couples who wished to adopt children from abroad.  I am pleased to inform the House that arising from the additional funding approved to the Eastern Health Board for child care services in 1998 the board has proposed, in its 1998 service plan, the appointment of three new social workers to its adoption service.  This will facilitate a speedier assessment of couples who wish to adopt children abroad.</P>
      <P>I understand that the current waiting time prior to assessment in the Eastern Health Board is 12 months &mdash; a reduction of two months on 1997. This reduction can be accounted for by the allocation of additional resources and greater efficiencies in the overall process of application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Reporting on HIV/AIDS commenced in 1986 and cumulative statistics are available up to 31 December 1997.  The specific information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>Number of reported AIDS cases, 609; number of reported deaths from AIDS, 311 and number of HIV positive individuals, 1,850.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> While the system of reporting AIDS cases and deaths is purely voluntary the majority of doctors who deal with AIDS would be aware of the desirability of reporting all such cases.  Policy with regard to testing for HIV, as set out in the National AIDS Strategy Committee report, 1992, is one of voluntary testing, where people who believe they have put themselves at risk of infection with the virus come forward and following counselling, have a HIV test.</P>
    <P>It is clear from annual statistics that the number of HIV positive individuals is increasing.  Figures indicate that while the rate of increase slowed down between 1992 and 1994 the number presenting positive every year since then has increased steadily by an average of 12 per cent per annum.  Statistics on categories of risk indicate that heterosexuals and homosexuals present the biggest risk categories but the heterosexual category has shown the greatest increase since 1994.  Reporting on AIDS for 1996 and 1997, however, indicates that there has been a decrease in the number of HIV positives converting to AIDS, from 79 in 1996 to 32 in 1997.  Similarly, the number of reported deaths from AIDS also fell from 34 in 1996 to seven in 1997.  These two factors may be attributed to the successful treatment of patients with combination therapy drugs which delay progression to AIDS and prolong the life of persons with AIDS.</P>
    <P>My Department through the National AIDS Strategy Committee and its subcommittees on care and management, education and prevention, and surveillance continues to implement policy as laid down in the 1992 policy document.  These committees meet on a regular basis to consider relevant issues and to develop strategies and implement policy.</P>

      <P>The establishment of strategic policy committees, SPCs, is a matter for each city and county council.  The process of implementation includes the election of chairs for the authorities' SPCs and the establishment of corporate policy groups.  A corporate policy group comprises the chairs of the SPCs and the cathaoirleach of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed guidelines were issued to relevant authorities entitled Strategic Policy Committees <Col N="369" />&mdash; Guidelines for Establishment and Operation in November 1997 for distribution to members and relevant staff.  The guidelines are based on the work of a group which included local authority members, management, my Department and others.  These guidelines were followed up by a national seminar day held on 5 February.  A booklet entitled Focus on Strategic Policy Committees, which included further guidance and the proceedings of the seminar, was recently issued to authorities.</P>
    <P>The guidelines set out advice on the setting up of SPCs, including the allocation of SPC chairs-paragraph 4.2. The guidelines advise that the allocation of SPC chairs should reflect equitably the spread of elected representation on the council and that local authorities should be seen by the public to operate fairly and equitably.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, however, the application of the guidelines in a particular case is a matter for each authority concerned in the light of their particular local circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for intervention by the Minister nor would intervention be appropriate in such matters which are for decision by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I intend, however, to establish a group to monitor and review generally the operation of the SPC system after this round of SPCs are implemented. This group will consider the issues which have arisen during the course of their implementation. This group will comprise DOELG, elected members, local authority management and others.</P>

      <P>Planning of the proposed Dublin port tunnel is being advanced by Dublin Corporation, acting under the general supervision of the National Roads Authority which has overall responsibility for the planning, design, construction and financing of national roads.</P>
      <P>Costs arising from the planning and design of the project are being co-financed by the Cohesion Fund under the current round of EU funding.

At this stage, it is not possible to anticipate the implications, if any, a decision to toll the tunnel for traffic management purposes might have for rates of EU assistance.</P>

      <P>The building regulations place a duty on persons providing or reconstructing buildings on or after 1 June 1992 to cater for the needs of disabled people.  Owners, designers and builders are responsible for complying with the regulations.  Technical Guidance Document M provides guidance on how to comply with the requirements in relation to access for disabled persons.  Local building control authorities have a role in monitoring and enforcing compliance which they may carry out by random inspections and investigations of any complaints about non-compliance.</P>

    <P>I have set two objectives for local building control authorities in 1998: first, the appointment of building control inspectors by all authorities not later than 1 July 1998 and second, all authorities to make substantial progress towards inspecting 12 per cent to 15 per cent of building developments, as recommended in guidelines formulated <Col N="372" /> by the City and County Managers Association, by the end of 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste requires Ireland to achieve recovery rates of 25 per cent or more for packaging by 30 June 2001 and 50 per cent or more by 31 December 2005.  I consider that satisfactory progress is being made towards the achievement of these targets.</P>
      <P>The most recent comprehensive data on waste management, contained in the national waste database report published by the Environmental Protection Agency, indicate that the recovery rate for packaging waste in the household and commercial waste streams increased from 10.4 per cent in 1993 to 15.6 per cent in 1995.  The report also indicates a recovery rate of 21.9 per cent in 1995 in relation to packaging waste from all sources i.e. household, commercial and industrial. The EPA is compiling an updated report in relation to 1998.</P>
      <P>Repak Ltd.  is a company established by industry, and operational since July 1997, to promote and co-ordinate the recovery of packaging waste and to faciltate compliance by industry with its obligations under the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997.</P>
      <P>It is an objective of Repak Ltd.  to organise and finance the systems needed to achieve a recovery rate of 27 per cent by 2001 in relation to packaging waste.  Its waste recovery scheme requires members to take steps to recover the packaging waste arising on their own premises, and to make a financial contribution to Repak Ltd.</P>
      <P>The funds contributed by members are applied by Repak Ltd.  mainly to support the collection and recovery of packaging waste from householders. In this regard, I understand that financial assistance in 1997, to a total value of over £800,000, was provided to Kerbside Dublin and Gandon Enterprises Ltd., the Rehab Recycling Partnership, to assist their recycling activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Repak Ltd.  is an approved body under the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations, 1997, and persons participating in its waste recovery scheme are exempt from obligations which would otherwise apply under the regulations.  I consider its operation to be a tangible expression of producer responsibility and an important element of overall waste management.  However, it is still at an early stage of development and there is considerable scope for expansion and fine tuning of its operations, for example, to develop a higher public profile, to communicate its activities <Col N="373" /> more fully, to expand its membership, to modify its fees structure to reflect more fully the relative environmental impact of members' activities, to support and monitor compliance by its members with their obligations and to aim for higher targets for waste recovery to meet the requirements of the packaging directive in the post-2001 period. I understand that all of these matters are being pursued by the company.  I have asked it for a comprehensive report, and this will be used as a basis for constructive consultation on the ongoing development of its waste recovery operations.</P>
    <P>Repak Ltd.  is at present the sole approved body under the regulations and I will be glad to consider other applications for such approval.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> Statutory responsibility for water management and protection, including responsibility for monitoring water quality, rests primarily with local authorities.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is also responsible both in so far as activities licensable by the agency are concerned and as part of its overall responsibility for the preparation and implementation of environmental monitoring programmes and the establishment and maintenance of databases of information related to the environment.  Since 1971, and extensive system has been in place for monitoring the quality of surface water and the impact of pollution.  Details of the most recently available data on the quality of rivers and lakes, including the wastern lakes, are contained in the EPA report <i>Water Quality in Ireland 1991-1994</i>, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The report sets out and discusses the quality of surface waters based largely on surveys carried out by the former Environmental Research Unit of my Department and subsequently EPA at its regional laboratories, by local authorities and by the fisheries agencies.  It assigns status compatible with no or low probability of pollution and impairment of beneficial uses to the western lakes Corrib, Mask, Conn and Carra.  Lough Cullin is a feeder lake to Lough Conn.  Mid-lake sampling points only were examined in the case of the western lakes for the period 1991-94.  The report acknowledges that while this is acceptable as a means of obtaining a general description on water quality it may not be adequate to show localised deteriorations adjacent to polluted inputs.</P>
    <P>A western lakes project has, however, been commissioned by EPA under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-99, including an investigation of eutrophication processes in the littoral zones of western lakes.  The project involves a detailed study of how lakes respond to nutrients, especially phosphorous inputs to littoral zones areas.  I expect that the results will be published shortly by EPA, and will assist local authorities in particular in the performance of their water pollution control and management and monitoring functions.</P>
    <P>While the report for 1991-94 confirmed that the bulk of Irish surface waters are of good quality, it also drew attention to a growing tendency towards eutrophication, the enrichment of waters beyond natural levels by nutrients, notably phosphorous. A catchment based strategy to address this tendency, <i>Managing Ireland's Rivers and Lakes,</i> was published by my Department in May 1997.  A copy of the strategy is available in the Oireachtas Library.  It sets out a systematic approach to tackle the problem of eutrophication caused by phosphorus inputs to waters and incorporates a range of measures to protect and, where necessary, restore water quality.  Some of the main thrusts of the strategy address the issue of water pollution from farming activities.  As part of its implementation, I am preparing guidelines for nutrient management planning on farms, and <Col N="379" /> I will shortly be prescribing standards for phosphorus in rivers and lakes in new regulations which I am now finalising.</P>
    <P>I understand that the next review of water quality in Ireland is currently being prepared by EPA.  This will take account, <i>inter alia</i>, of all monitoring carried out on the western lakes over the last three years, including an intensive monitoring programme of Lough Corrib and the main inflowing rivers to Lough Mask and Lough Conn, initiated in 1997.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the concerns expressed about water quality in the western lakes, and recently met a deputation from the Connaught Council Advisory and Consultative Committee with whom I had constructive discussions in this regard.</P>

      <Quest>whether the new house grant payable by his Department is means tested; his views on whether a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny, who has been refused this grant, is being discriminated against on the grounds that a settlement received by his partner, whose name was also included on the application, is being assessed as means against them both; and if he will review the application with a view to having approval issued in view of the fact that neither person ever received a new house grant or owned a house prior to this.</Quest>

      <P>The conditions governing the new house grant scheme normally preclude payment of a grant where a person who is party to a joint application or the spouse of such person had previously purchased or built, individually or with each other, another house for his or her own occupation.  However, a grant may be allowed where the marriage of the person has been dissolved or annulled by court order, or the person is separated under a court order or a deed of separation; and the person and any dependants are in need of housing; and the Minister is satisfied that refusal to pay a grant would cause undue hardship.  Each such application is considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, having regard to the fact that the cost of the house was £36,350, there was a separation settlement of £37,000 and joint income of over £19,000, payment of a new house grant could not be allowed to the applicants.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1998, gave legislative effect to the range of enhancements to the child benefit scheme which were announced in the 1998 budget.</P>
      <P>In so far as the position of twins is concerned, the first substantial recognition of the difficulties experienced with multiple births is being granted this year with provision being made for a new payment of 150 per cent of the normal child benefit rate for twins.  Provision was also made in the Act for increases in the rate of child benefit of £1.50 for the first two children and £3.00 for all subsequent children, to bring the monthly rates to £31.50 and £42 respectively.</P>
      <P>Finally, the grants payable on the birth of three or more children are being increased to bring them into line with the existing arrangements for twins.  Where three or more children are born together, a grant of £500 will be payable and where such children reach four and 12 years of age, further grants of £500 will also be payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> These measures will come into effect in September of theis year.  Any further enhancement of the child benefit scheme will be a matter for consideration in the context of next year's budget.</P>

      <P>The most significant effect of the introduction of a minimum wage, in so far as it affects my Department's areas of responsibility, will be the positive impact it would have on the incentive for unemployed people to make the transition into employment.  I do not envisage that a minimum wage should have a direct effect on social welfare payment rates.</P>
      <P>The level of social welfare payments is influenced by a range of policy objectives which are reflected in key commitments contained in the Government's programme &mdash;&ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo;&mdash; and in the Partnership 2000 agreement.</P>
      <P>In the Government's programme, for instance, we included a commitment to provide for substantial increases in social welfare payment rates, including increasing the old age pension to £100 per week over a five year period.  Partnership 2000 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the implementation of the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare before the end of the partnership.  The substantial increases provided for in the 1998 budget represent significant steps towards meeting those commitments.</P>

      <P>The Economic Background to the 1998 budget, published by the Department of Finance on budget day, projected an average increase of 2 per cent in the consumer price index in 1998.  The average consumer price inflation, published by the Central Statistics Office, for the year to March 1998 was of the order of 1.6 per cent, while the year-on-year rate was 2.1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1998 budget provided for significant increases in all social welfare payments.  In line with the commitment in the Action Programme for the Millennium, the personal rates of pension payments made to elderly persons in society were increased by £5 per week which represents percentage increases ranging from 6.4 per cent to 7.4 <Col N="384" /> per cent.  All other personal rates of payment were increased by £3 per week with the result that all long-term social assistance payments and all short-term social insurance payments increase by 4.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>These budgetary increases mean that, in real terms, social welfare payments will rise by 2.4 percentage points to 5.3 percentage points above forecasted inflation in 1998 and are well ahead of increases given in the immediately preceding years.  Payments of these increases will be made at the beginning of June next, two weeks earlier than in 1997, thereby protecting and enhancing the real value of all social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>Each health board is responsible for the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, subject to my general direction and control.  This function is carried out primarily by community welfare officers who also have other responsibilities within the health boards' community care programmes.</P>
      <P>My priority at present is to improve the delivery of supplementary welfare allowances in consultation with the Health Boards under the current legislative and administrative arrangements. In that regard, my Department, working in co-operation with the health boards, has undertaken a major programme of computerisation in the eight health boards, under which SWA is being brought within the scope of the integrated short-term schemes computer system for short-term social welfare payments generally.  Provision has also been made this year for appeals to the Social Welfare Appeals Office in the case of most SWA payment types and there is ongoing consultation and co-operation on a range of other administrative and policy issues.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals at present to transfer the community welfare officers currently operating under the health boards to my Department.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme is to provide a financial <Col N="385" /> incentive to long-term unemployed people to return to work.  The scheme has a limited number of places and is targeted at people who need an additional financial incentive to return to the workforce.  It is a requirement of the scheme that an applicant must apply prior to taking up employment and this is clearly indicated on the relevant application form and information leaflet.</P>
      <P>The person concerned commenced selfemployment on 21 July 1997 but did not apply for the allowance until 6 February 1998.  His application was refused on the grounds that his claim was late and that he was in a position to return to the workforce without the need for the financial incentive which the scheme provides.  The rules of the scheme do not allow payment to be made in cases of this kind.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, as initiated in 1996, it was not possible to provide funding towards the annual monitoring fees charged by the monitoring companies.  Any change in the scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists certain householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households during the Fuel Allowance heating season, which runs for 26 weeks of each year from mid-October to mid-April. An additional £3 per week smokeless fuel allowance is payable during the heating season to fuel recipients in Dublin, Cork and, from October 1998, Limerick, Wexford, Arklow, Dundalk and Drogheda.  This extra allowance is to assist recipients in meeting the increased costs of buying smokeless fuel in urban areas where there is a ban on the sale of bituminous coal for environmental reasons.</P>
      <P>There are some 97,000 pensioners over the age of 66 in receipt of a fuel allowance and the estimated cost of giving them a once off grant of £28 each would be £2.7 million.  This could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>However, there is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.  This operates in addition to the national fuel scheme.  Under the SWA scheme, a person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement.  This can be paid as a weekly supplement in addition to other social welfare payments.  An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the Community Welfare Officer at the local health centre.</P>
      <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an Exceptional Needs Payment. The purpose of ENPs is to help prevent hardship by providing for essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.  These facilities under the SWA scheme are already in place and are a more appropriate mechanism to meet the needs of those who are experiencing financial difficulties due to the exceptionally cold weather experienced after the end of this year's fuel allowance heating season.</P>

      <P>No specific capital allocation has been earmarked by my Department for expenditure on the proposed national park in the current year and the question of future funding will be examined in the light of requirements for land acquisition for the park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I already explained to the Deputy in my reply to previous questions in relation to this matter, a sum of £2 million was allocated under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 for the establishment of a visitor centre for the park.  However, a prerequisite of EU Structural Funding was the necessity to have the works completed by the end of 1999.  As indicated by me in my reply to Question No. 35 of 27 November 1997, under the mid-term review of the EU Structural Funds Community Support Framework, a reduction of ten million ECU was made on the European Regional Development Fund allocation for Sub Programme I of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, for which my Department has responsibility.  As it was clear that the visitor centre project could not have been completed <Col N="388" /> before the end of 1999, it was decided to include the funding allocated to it as part of the decommitments required to meet this ten million ECU reduction and this was also indicated in my reply of 27 November 1997.  It is my intention to resubmit the application for assistance from Structural Funds in the post-1999 period.</P>
    <P>As regards the location of the proposed visitor centre I am examining the various options and I hope to make a decision on the matter in the near future.  In relation to the purchase by my Department of a property on 23.09 hectares of land near Ballycroy for development as an administration centre and to provide office accommodation and storage facilities for the proposed Mayo National Park, the purchase price was of the order of £300,000.</P>

    <P>* Channelled through the Vote of the Office of Public Works in 1995 and partly in 1996.</P>
    <P>As explained in my reply to today's Questions Nos. 236-238 from the Deputy, an amount of £2,000,000 was allocated under the Tourism Operational Programme 1994/1999 (ERDF), for the provision of visitor facilities for the proposed Mayo National Park.  Following a mid term review in October 1997 this amount was decommitted. A total of £143,969 had been spent from this allocation prior to the withdrawal of the funds.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Cultural Institutions Turlough Park House, Castlebar</P>
    <P>Five million pounds in co-financed European Regional Development Fund funds under the auspices of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 has been allocated towards the development of a facility for the proper display and appreciation of the folklife collection of the National Museum of Ireland at Turlough Park House, Castlebar.  The project is being developed in conjunction with Mayo County Council with work envisaged to be completed by end 1999.</P>
    <P>Two projects in County Mayo have been offered grant assistance under this Department's cultural development incentives scheme (CDIS), which is funded from the Operational Programme for Tourism.  These are the development of arts facilities at the Custom House, Westport and the Michael Davitt Museum, at Straide.  The grants offered are £140,000 and £200,000 respectively.</P>

      <P>During the course of my recent visit to the United States, I had the opportunity to meet with senior film industry personnel in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>I met with a wide circle of key players at a reception arranged for me by the Irish Film Board on Wednesday 15 April and explained to them the range of measures and policies to support film production in Ireland, and Ireland's outstanding attractions as a European location and centre for film production.  I had separate meetings with senior executives of Fox Filmed Entertainment, Paramount Pictures and Disney Studios on Thursday, 16 April.</P>
      <P>I consider that these meetings were vitally important in ensuring that Ireland remains on the mental map of decision makers in Hollywood when considering making a film in Europe.  I emphasised that Ireland is a rich source of talent and creativity and that opportunities exist for US producers to work with Irish producers in developing stories for the international market.  I would hope to further develop and strengthen the links between the US film industry and the Irish film industry.</P>
      <P>Finally, I take the opportunity to place on the record of the House my appreciation of the assistance provided to me by members of the Irish Film Board, in making the arrangements to ensure that my visit was a success.</P>

      <P>The Customs and Excise Service has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs intended to be smuggled into the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána has primary responsibility for the investigation of any offences connected with smuggling or illegal importation of controlled drugs.  In situations where the Garda Síochána acquire intelligence and information concerning the importation of controlled drugs, a joint task force comprising members of the Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise and the Naval Service is set up to co-ordinate an appropriate strategy <Col N="397" /> for the seizure of drugs and the apprehension of the criminals involved in smuggling drugs into Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs national drugs team resources servicing the Galway-Mayo region consist of one intelligence unit based in Galway supported by a maritime unit and a drug detector dog unit based in Sligo.  The Customs national drug team resources deployed in this area can request assistance from other Customs national drugs team units as necessary.  They can also request support from the seven units attached to the Revenue mobile service which operate in the Galway-Mayo-Sligo area.</P>
    <P>A coastal watch scheme is also in place along the west coastline.  This scheme involves educating the public in relation to the possibility of drug traffickers importing drugs along the coastline; ensuring that information is recorded and channelled efficiently; and ensuring that intelligence reports are utilised to the full.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that in order to co-ordinate the management of this scheme a member of the Garda has been appointed in the relevant areas as a co-ordinator to cultivate contact with key members of the public in strategic locations and positions in the community.</P>
    <P>In addition, the coastal watch co-ordinator, the divisional drugs units and the Garda national drugs unit liaise regularly with the Customs national drugs team in relation to matters affecting the possible use of the west coast by international drug traffickers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Naval Service, Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of the joint task force, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, has also increased the role and effectiveness of the Naval Services in this area.</P>
    <P>During the course of routine fishery protection patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti-drug smuggling operations.  Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are satisfied that the Customs Service, in co-operation with the other enforcement agencies concerned, provide adequate protection at present against the illegal importation of drugs. The situation will, of course, be kept under review.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that recent seizures of controlled drugs in particular on the west coast and the south west coast have shown the success of the current policy along the coastline in the west and south west of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The details supplied show that this question concerns the position of female secondary teachers who retired from the service on payment of a marriage gratuity and who later returned to teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="404" /> The position is that under the secondary school teachers' superannuation scheme it was never mandatory for female teachers to resign on marriage. Female teachers appointed on or before 31 July 1963 were, however, eligible for the award of a marriage gratuity provided they had completed six years of pensionable service and retired from approved teaching service no later than the date of their marriage.</P>
    <P>It is open to a teacher who retired on payment of a marriage gratuity to return to teaching service. It is also open to the returning teacher to rejoin the superannuation scheme from a current date.  If the teacher wishes to reinstate the pensionable service given prior to marriage, however, she must repay the marriage gratuity together with 5 per cent compound interest per year from the date of payment to the date of repayment. An option to repay a marriage gratuity must be exercised while the teacher is in pensionable service.</P>
    <P>The provisions which I have outlined are of long standing and are of general application.  If the Deputy is aware of a particular teacher who is seeking clarification of her own position in regard to service given prior to marriage, my Department will be happy to deal with the query on an individual basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 280, 281, 282, 300, 301, 302 and 303 together.</P>
      <P>I recently met a deputation regarding an application for the provision of a post primary school in Newport, County Mayo.  I undertook to consider the matter subsequently in the light of the case made by the deputation and the outcome of a study carried out by my Department in the matter. I expect to be in a position to take a decision in the matter in the near future.</P>
      <P>An application for the provision of a new post primary school in an existing catchment area is considered by my Department in the light of a number of factors.  These would include the availability of sufficient pupils to maintain a viable school, the ability of the potential operator to provide a reasonably wide range of subject options, the level of support demonstrated by the local community for the proposed school, impact on existing schools and the best interests of the pupils in question.  General developments in an area, such as housing and industrial developments, would also be taken into account in arriving at a decision.  In a broader context, the Government's commitment to the development and maintenance of educational facilities in smaller communities, particularly in the west would also be considered.</P>
      <P>Newport secondary school closed in 1968.  It is difficult to be precise as to the number of pupils from the original area of that school now attending schools in Westport and Achill. However, the numbers are estimated at 220 and 40, respectively.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of closures and amalgamations of primary schools in the former Newport secondary school area since its closure. Details of the existing primary schools from which a post primary school in Newport might enrol pupils are given in the attached tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  Information regarding the number of children under four years of age in the area is not held in my Department.</P>

      <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial and resource teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I have to determine priorities and allocate available resources to best effect.  I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the remedial and resource area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.  I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be considered in the context of any additional remedial or resource teacher allocations which may be undertaken for the forthcoming school year.</P>

      <P>The total number of braille-using pupils in first and second level schools is about 55 (35 in special schools and 20 in mainstream schools).</P>
      <P>Braille versions of textbooks are provided by Arbour Hill Prison.  A master list of books already on braille is made available each September to special schools and to visiting teachers. Braille versions of books from the master list can be applied quickly.</P>
      <P>Requests from mainstream schools for braille texts which are not on the master list are made through the visiting teacher service and should be made as soon as the requirements are known. Visiting teachers liaise directly with the prison authorities and monitor progress regarding the provision of braille texts requested by them.</P>
      <P>When delays occur, they are due mainly to the late receipt and the large number of requests.  The increase in requests arises from an increase in the number of new textbooks being published and from an increase in integration.  The number of braille-using pupils who are leaving special schools to attend mainstram second level schools is growing.  Transcribing one textbook per subject into braille will in the special school enable an individual copy to be made available for each pupil in a class-group.  In a mainstream school, however, it will usually enable an individual copy to be made available only to one pupil as the textbook in use can vary from school to school.</P>
      <P>The brailling unit in Arbour Hill Prison has requests for braille versions of three Irish textbooks. Braille text is much longer than the original print text &mdash; a braille version of a textbook will have several volumes.  The brailling unit will provide Volume I of the braille version of each of these textbooks as soon as possible and before proceeding to transcribe text of Volume II.</P>
      <P>I have recently discussed the question of brailling facilities with representatives of &ldquo;Féach&rdquo;, the parent support group for blind and visually impaired children.  My Department is at present examining the feasibility of arranging with the publishers of school textbooks to have a copy of new textbooks made available on computer disk to facilitate production of a braille version.  The question of the provision of a resource centre for visual impairment is also being examined by my Department.  The brailling of textbooks is among the services which such a resource centre would provide.</P>

      <P>Earlier in the current school year, the supply panel scheme was extended by the provision of a further 30 teachers.  The scheme now operates in 17 locations throughout the country serving a large number of schools.</P>
      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers was served by the supply panel when it operated as a piot scheme.  In the context of the development of the scheme, it was necessary to redress difficulties which has presented during the pilot phase.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, a reduction in the number of supply teachers in some locations was deemed appropriate to ensure a more efficient management of the scheme.  A consequence of this action was a reduction in the number of schools in these areas benefitting from the scheme.  I should stress that the reduction in supply teachers in some locations was accompanied by an increase in the number of teachers in other locations.</P>
      <P>Carn national school was one of the schools excluded following the changes to the pilot scheme.  I should emphasise, however, that Carn national school is still entitled to engage substitute teachers when necessary from outside of the panel scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Shortly after taking office.  I announced my intention to establish a national educational psychological service.  This is to be available to all primary and secondary schools as well as to preschool children.  Proposals for the establishment of this service were included in the Programme for Government.  A planning group which includes representatives of all the partners in education has been set up with the task of preparing detailed recommendations for the development of the psychological service.  The work of the planning group is now well advanced and it is expected that it will report to me before the end of the current school year.</P>
      <P>In order to meet the urgent need for an expanded educational psychological service in the primary sector, my Department is jointly organising with Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick, a development project which will last for three years.  Fifteen qualified psychologists have been recruited on a contract basis for the duration of the project.  This increases the number of psychologists working in the primary sector from 13 to 28.  The additional allocation in 1998 for expanding the psychological service is £550,000.</P>
      <P>These psychologists are currently undergoing their induction training and will work in regional teams under the management of the psychological service in the Department of Education and Science.  The schools selected to participate in the project will be contacted during this school term.</P>
      <P>One of the first tasks of the newly appointed psychologists will be to carry out an analysis of needs in collaboration with the principals of the selected schools.  This will include an estimate of the numbers of pupils requiring psychological assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All post-primary schools and 402 primary schools are currently served by my Department's <Col N="413" /> psychological service.  It is estimated that, at any one time, there may be approximately 1,300 pupils in these schools awaiting psychological assessment by Department psychologists.  This includes pupils who were previously assessed and are due for review of progress.</P>
    <P>This figure does not include pupils who are awaiting assessment by psychologists employed by regional health boards or voluntary bodies or by psychologists who are in private practice.</P>

      <P>The manager of Castlebar boy's national school, County Kilkenny, applied to my Department in November 1997 for grant assistant towards the cost of a range of capital improvement works at the school.  My Department examined the application and subsequently advised the school authorities that it was not in a position to approve funding for the proposed scheme due to the level of existing contractual commitments and available capital funding.</P>
      <P>In March 1998, my Department received a further application for grant assistance towards the cost of other improvement works at the school.  The local Office of Public Works has been requested to furnish a report on the proposed works.  When this report is received, a decision will be taken on the application in the light of the urgency of the works and available capital funding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 305 and 306 together.</P>
      <P>My Department recently embarked on an exercise aimed at establishing the precise position regarding remedial needs in all primary schools. As part of this exercise, all schools, including those in County Mayo, have been invited to make fresh applications based on their present level of remedial need.  Responses to this request are currently being received by my Department and the closing date for all such applications is 30 April 1998.  In these circumstances, my Department is not yet in a position to indicate the number of applications for a remedial service which may be received from County Mayo.</P>
      <P>Two remedial posts were allocated to schools in County Mayo for the 1997-98 school year, as follows:</P>

    <P>No remedial posts were allocated to County Mayo for the 1996-97 school year.</P>
    <P>Two remedial posts were allocated to schools in County Mayo for the 1995-96 school year, as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) Bangor Erris (base)</P>
    <P>Drumslide NS, Ballycroy</P>

    <P>Achadh an Ghlaisin</P>
    <P>Glencastle NS, Bunnahowen</P>
    <P>Shragh NS, Bunnahowen</P>
    <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I have to determine priorities and allocate available resources to best effect.  I am currently reviewing provisions across the special needs area, including the remedial area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of schools in County Mayo will be considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be undertaken for the forthcoming school year.</P>

The question of providing physical education facilities at St. Michael's Holy Faith secondary school, Finglas, Dublin 11 can only be considered in the context of the capital available for post-primary building purposes generally.  Because of the huge demand for classroom accommodation in schools throughout the country, I am not in a position at this stage to state when physical education facilities will be provided in this particular case.</P>

      <P>The Irish language requirement has no bearing on the issue of the supply of qualified teachers from the colleges of education.  Many candidates with a grade C or better in higher level Irish at the leaving certificate examination apply for entry to primary teacher training each year and are unable to gain admission due to the intensity of competition for places.  Consequently I have no plans to amend the minimum entry requirements to primary teacher training in the area referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Urgent discussions are already under way between my Department, the Higher Education Authority and the colleges of education in order to achieve a significant increase in the intake to primary teacher training with effect from this September.</P>

      <P>Second level schools are not required to notify my Department when pupils absent themselves from school and for that reason I do not have statistics available to me on the numbers of children in Dublin absenting themselves from second level schools on Fridays.  However, it is my intention to establish a mechanism for the purpose of quantifying the number of pupils who fall outside the education system.</P>
      <P>At present, statutory responsibility for school attendance in the Dublin region resides with the local authorities under the School Attendance Act, 1926.  This Act makes school attendance compulsory for children up to the age of 15 years.

      <P>The current rates are 100 per cent for vocational schools and community colleges and 90 per cent for voluntary secondary schools.  The parties to the deed of trust of a community school are required to contribute 5 per cent towards the initial building cost of the school.</P>
      <P>I should explain that the legal position in relation to the ownership of secondary schools is quite different from that of VEC and community schools where the buildings are effectively owned by the State.</P>
      <P>Voluntary secondary schools are the property of the owners-managers.  A capital grant may be paid towards the cost of building, furnishing and equipping a new secondary school or major refurbishment of existing secondary schools.  The cost of providing the site is not grant aided.  The contribution of 10 per cent reflects the different management and ownership structure of schools in the secondary sector.</P>
