      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the current position in regard to the pollution of the sea by hazardous and noxious substances (civil liability and compensation) Bill?  Will that legislation assist Irish residents on the east coast who may be affected by the reported 400 per cent increase in radioactivity and radioactive contamination of seaweed on the east coast?  As this obviously has other dangerous manifestations for the health of citizens, there should be the possibility of compensation in accordance with the promised legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of concern and I am sure the Minister will reflect on whether it should be dealt with in the Bill.  The general scheme of the Bill was submitted to the parliamentary draftsman some time ago, but because of other priorities it has not yet been published.  It is hoped to publish it in the autumn; November is the latest date I have been given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify what he means when he states legislation is a priority? Is he satisfied with the rate of progress on this legislation to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the priorities of the parliamentary draftsman.  Like all legislation, it would be nice if this were published sooner.  It has been with the parliamentary draftsman for some months and it is hoped to have it in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a question yesterday that I raised with the Taoiseach last week about the necessary legislation to meet our commitments under the British-Irish Agreement, but the Tánaiste was unable to give a comprehensive reply.  Can the Taoiseach confirm the legislation will be before the Government next Tuesday, presuming the normal Tuesday meeting takes place?  In view of the practicalities of the convention that Opposition parties are generally given a fortnight's notice of legislation before it is taken in the House, will the Taoiseach indicate when they will have sight of the legislation so that we can have a constructive and supportive debate on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Bruton has also raised this matter with me, Deputy Quinn has raised it on a number of occasions.  The legislation has not come before Government.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is examining whether the matter requires legislation. A meeting is currently taking place to finalise the Department's view in that regard.  As soon as it makes a decision, I will write to the leaders of the parties to inform them of the final conclusion.  If the matter does not require legislation, I have asked that party leaders be briefed in that regard.  The view at the end of last week was that it does not require legislation, but I have asked the Department to make absolutely certain <Col N="251" /> that is the position.  I will know the result in a few hours' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I place on record my grave concern that the Irish Government, which was party to the British-Irish Agreement, is apparently reneging on a commitment to introduce legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This question concerns promised legislation to which 95 per cent of the electorate in this Republic gave their assent.  The idea that some officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform could suggest that this legislation is not necessary is absolutely outrageous. The benefit of the doubt on this matter should be given in a transparent way and legislation should be introduced, notwithstanding what the views of officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform may be.  It could be construed in the most negative manner possible by parties to the assembly elections which will take place on 25 June.  I urge the Taoiseach, as a matter of urgency, to clarify this point quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy much latitude but we cannot have a discussion on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly agree with what Deputy Quinn has said about the importance of providing for this matter by way of legislation. We are making a distinction between people who have committed similar offences by proposing to have lighter sentences for those who have committed the offences for political motives.  Any discrimination of that nature in a state ruled by law must be made by law.  It is not possible to have administrative discrimination in a matter of this importance.  It is vital that this be provided for in legislation and in no other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard what the Deputies have stated.  The meeting is ongoing and I will make the views of the House known to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the views of Deputy Quinn and Deputy Bruton on this matter.  In the current situation, where assembly elections are in progress in Northern Ireland, the last thing we need is for the perception to go abroad that we are backsliding on an agreement that was signed only weeks ago.</P>

      <P>When will the European Monetary Union Bill, which has been published, be brought before the House?  Will the Taoiseach indicate if it is true that Ireland has not managed to get any member on to the senior management team of the European Central Bank?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We have nobody on the team.  The only representation we have in that bank will be a non-executive director.  That will have serious implications for decision-making on our economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will be taken next week.  I would have welcomed the appointment of Irish people to the most senior management positions in the European Central Bank but, in accordance with the EU treaty, it is an internal matter for that bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that there are 55 management level posts in the ECB, of which 49 are being filled by people working in the European Monetary Institute, including three Irish nationals.  So the 55 positions include 49 people moving from the EMI to the ECB.  Of the remaining six positions, I understand that three are alternates of the Central Bank.  That leaves three positions.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate when the Ground Rents Bill is to be published?  Has the Government received any advice, given the reports that there may be constitutional problems with this legislation?  Does he have any mind to deal with that?  Will an amendment to the Constitution be required?</P>
      <P>I welcome the interim decision by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to limit the floor space of giant retail units, following my call for this in the Adjournment debate last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Ground Rents Bill, the House will know that there are not many such rents left.  However, constitutional issues still have to be examined in relation to those remaining after 20 years of legislation on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to pursue the matter raised earlier by Deputy Bruton concerning the increased level of radioactivity in the Irish Sea.  I understand that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will attend an important meeting of the OSPAR Convention early next month.  Last week, I asked the Taoiseach if he would allow some time in the House for a debate in advance of that meeting.  Such a debate would allow the House to discuss the Government's preparations for the meeting.  The Taoiseach seems to be favourably disposed towards it.  Will he indicate if time will be made available for a discussion of that sort?</P>

      <P>The House has been sitting late for about seven or eight weeks already.  It is a matter of how much time is available.  I understand <Col N="254" /> that a question has been tabled for the Minister tomorrow that seeks information concerning his position at that conference.  I am sure he can be questioned about it then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands I received a circular in respect of two new Bills. The first was the Planning and Development Bill, dealing with the comprehensive protection of buildings of artistic, architectural and historical importance.  When will it be published?  Will it be under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands or the Department of the Environment and Local Government? The second was the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage Bill.  When will it be introduced?</P>
      <P>At the launch of the Independent Network News service this time last year, the Taoiseach gave a specific commitment to abolish the 3 per cent levy on local radio stations.  When is that likely to occur?  Will it be included in the Broadcasting Bill to be published this summer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take those questions in reverse order.  That levy issue will be addressed in the Broadcasting Bill which is to be ready late this year.</P>
      <P>The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage Bill is being prepared.  The heads were sent to the parliamentary draftsman's office a few weeks ago, on 19 May.  The Bill is to be assigned to the draftsman on 15 June.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Bill is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  It is being prepared by the Department of Environment and Local Government and will be taken by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said the Pollution of the Sea by Hazardous and Noxious Substances Bill was a priority.  Does he recall that on 29 January he promised that legislation would be produced in this session?  He is now saying it is still with the parliamentary draftsman and will not be produced until the autumn at the earliest. What has happened since January to delay this legislation in view of the fact that we strongly complain about pollution of the sea by others?  If we are dilatory in introducing legislation, we show that we do not give the matter priority in our jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on the Bill last night, I was speaking about the guidelines set down by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on 24 November 1997.  I particularly welcome the change of focus and direction in urban renewal policy.  The Minister is now talking about a scheme which will feature a more focused approach targeting the remaining areas of need. It is important to emphasise areas of need in urban renewal policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said the Government and the national anti-poverty strategy require that future policy on urban renewal must take full account of the social needs of and the effects on areas targeted for regeneration.  Architecture, design and conservation opportunities under the scheme must also yield optimum results.  It is important that local authorities have been given a role and responsibility for leading the preparation of these plans.  Although there has been much criticism of local authorities, they are best suited to bring forward these plans.  Some local authorities have submitted a number of applications and have not prioritised them.  They did what local authorities did in the past with applications for the national lottery grants.  In fairness Galway County Council, which sent in an application, focused on an <Col N="257" /> area plan for Tuam which I, as a Deputy who has represented the town for the past 23 years, welcome.  Tuam needs this type of incentive.  The Government, through the Minister, set out criteria which will assist local authorities in the selection and prioritisation of the areas for integrated area plans.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned about the guidelines which refer to a population of 6,000.  The guidelines make the point that few towns with a population of fewer than 6,000 have received designation up to now.  It looks as if it will be difficult for towns with populations of fewer than 6,000 to be included in the present scheme.  It is, however, more important that the scheme reflects an urban renewal application which could be achieved without the figure of 6,000 being applied to a town.  The Minister said the panel's recommendation was that the guideline of 6,000 should remain unchanged on the basis that it is only a guideline.  It would be unfair if a town was excluded from the scheme because the figure of 6,000 had not been met.  The population of Tuam in 1991 was 5,540 and it increased to 5,627 in 1996.  What is most important about Tuam and many other towns is the hinterland which is served by the town.  The population of the rural hinterland around Tuam amounts to 27,000. These factors should be taken into consideration when talking about the guideline of 6,000 people.</P>
    <P>The designation of sites and areas for tax incentives has been an important measure in the redevelopment and renewal of many towns and cities.  In the case of Tuam, the integrated area plan for Galway County Council was carried out by Brady, Shipman and Martin Planning Consultants. The object of the plan was to provide a planned integrated and focused approach to urban renewal.  When this is implemented, the IAP will aid the physical, economic, social and environmental regeneration of a declining urban area.</P>
    <P>Tuam was selected because of the high levels of unemployment and social deprivation in the town and the surrounding rural area.  The town has significant areas of physical dereliction and investment has been hampered by poor image. Ironically, the service functions of the town are threatened by its proximity to Galway city.  Tuam also has the potential to attract investment through its good location, educated workforce, historical heritage and modern infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The main objective of the plan is to ensure Tuam is upgraded and improved.  With the integrated area plan and the sub-area designation, a context will be provided in which huge development may take place exploiting the infrastructure, workforce and character of Tuam.  I pay tribute to Galway County Council, Tuam Town Commissioners, the business community and voluntary organisations in the town which were so enthusiastic about putting forward the case for the town.  Tuam is a market town and has retained important educational and ecclesiastical functions.  Its industrial base has had a varied history <Col N="258" /> with a number of traditional industries closing which has caused an increase in local unemployment levels.  The town, which is 21 miles from Galway, has become a commuting centre but has retained its own distinctive identity.  The setbacks suffered by Tuam in recent years include the closure of the Irish Sugar Company and cutbacks in the railway service.</P>
    <P>Galway city has benefited from urban renewal schemes in the past and from the development of the economy.  Urban renewal has been successful also in towns such as Ballinasloe and Loughrea.  However, Tuam has not benefited to the same extent.  The type of plan before us is one which should be of great benefit to Tuam.  Various Ministers for the Environment allocated funding to Tuam for a waste water treatment plant where we have recently commissioned a £25 million water supply system.  There are excellent link roads around Tuam which is situated on the N17 &mdash; the principal north-south route in the west &mdash; now famous in song and story.  This infrastructure with the town's historical heritage provides a basis for the further expansion of the tourism and service industries.  There are other plans and policies associated with the town, including the western regional authority plan 1996-2000, the Ireland-west regional tourism plan, the Western Health Board proposals 1998, the Galway rural development company &mdash; the ADM and Leader II programme, the tidy towns plan 1995, the urban and village renewal scheme 1994 and the Western Development Commission.  This type of investment is important in addition to the proposal with the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>Education, training, employment and economic development are features of most of the plans with the Department.  This is true also in the case of Tuam.  I wish to mention in particular the proposal that a portion of the town be used for local community functions and operate in tandem with the commercial venture.</P>
    <P>The Bons Secours hospital in Tuam has spent a substantial amount on refurbishment of existing facilities.  However, there is a need for further refurbishment and an expansion of services.  It is encouraging to note that the hospital is included in the development plan for urban renewal.  Galway County Council is operating a refurbishment scheme in Gilmartin Road, Tuam, and an estate management course will be carried out in conjunction with it.  Tuam has many archaeological remnants from its historic past.  An objective of the plan is to exploit its rich heritage.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to consultations regarding the urban renewal scheme.  Some Deputies were critical that local authorities did not engage in sufficient consultation.  Public meetings were held in Galway on this issue.  The principal partners in the development of the town were residents, business people and landowners, Galway County Council, Tuam Town Commissioners, the rural development company and the education <Col N="259" /> and training providers.  Arising from the public meeting held in Tuam on 5 February 1998 there was great interest and enthusiasm in the scheme. It was clear from that meeting that there should be more employment opportunities in the town. Another issue raised was that Tuam could benefit from a new hotel to serve both the town and the leisure industry.  One hotel is not adequate to cater for the people of Tuam and the tourism industry, which has great potential.  I hope, following a second planning application from a business group, permission will be granted for a second hotel in or near the town.  Certainly Tuam town could benefit from a rail link with the city of Galway.  I am a member of the western county rail committee which has as its secretary, Fr. Michéal MacGreil, from Westport, one of the pioneers as regards the railways.  Five counties from Connacht have representatives on that committee. I hope the committee's efforts will be successful in getting a rail link with Galway city and the whole western region from Claremorris right down to Tuam and Limerick.</P>
    <P>The plan emphasises that provision should be made for mobility of the disabled and parents of young children.  The plan emphasises also that the town should exploit and capitalise on its history. At present there is a festival in Tuam commemorating Rory O'Connor, the last High King.  As part of that festival there is a major emphasis on the town's history.</P>
    <P>The use of the town hall has been highlighted in the plan.  Certainly the town hall needs refurbishment. I hope a portion of the hall can be used as a community facility.</P>
    <P>The Dean of St. Mary's Cathedral, who has been speaking about the history of Tuam and is involved in the festival, has mentioned the necessity of developing St. Mary's Cathedral as a gateway to Tuam and highlighting the town's image and heritage.  This is one area that should be emphasised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we are discussing this Bill.  I am pleased the scheme will commence on 1 August 1998.  I hope the areas I mentioned as regards archaeology and conservation and the provision of car-parking facilities will be supported. The vision for Tuam is the most important part of the application by Galway County Council &mdash; a vision to develop the town as a self-sufficient urban centre that serves its huge hinterland.  I hope the town of Tuam, through maximising its rich historic base, will become a prestigious inland tourist destination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>When the urban renewal schemes were introduced in the mid-1980s we were in the middle of an economic recession, unemployment was high, emigration was running at the rate of <Col N="260" /> 30,000 per year, the building industry was in a slump and the centres of our cities and towns were, in many cases, derelict.  There was strong justification at that time for the introduction of a scheme to promote investment in our towns and cities.  We have a different set of circumstances today, however.  We are experiencing an economic boom.  People are coming back to the country. Property prices are booming and the question has to be raised as to whether we need a raft of tax incentives and rates remissions to encourage activity in the building industry in the centres of our cities and towns.  That question was raised and answered in the Minister's contribution yesterday and the answer, with which I agree, is that there is a need to address areas of social disadvantage, to use the urban renewal scheme in a new way to do that and to integrate the urban renewal strategy with other strategies aimed at addressing poverty and social disadvantage in urban areas.  In that context, the Minister referred yesterday to the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
      <P>This new approach to urban renewal was begun by my colleagues, Deputy McManus, when Minister of State with responsibility for urban renewal, and Deputy Howlin, when Minister for the Environment, who commissioned the study of urban renewal which formed the basis for the Bill before the House and for the new approach to urban renewal.  The study is valuable not just in terms of underpinning the legislation before us but for the critical evaluation it undertook of the urban renewal schemes to date.</P>
      <P>We should remind ourselves that the study was critical of the urban renewal schemes to date.  It pointed out, for example, that the tax incentives provided in the urban renewal schemes were a cost to the taxpayer, something not often spoken about.  We often talk about tax incentives and rates remissions as if they do not involve any cost but the report makes it clear that, depending on the parameter used, the total net cost of the urban renewal schemes up to 1996 was somewhere between £367 million and £461 million.</P>
      <P>The other side of the equation, namely, the return on that State investment, does not appear at face value to have been of significant benefit. An investment of £17.7 billion was made in the various schemes undertaken.  The net employment produced, admittedly excluding the IFSC, amounted to just 1,600 jobs.  There was development of urban areas but the extent to which some of that development might have taken place anyway, and the extent to which the development caused displacement in business and commercial activity from other parts of cities and towns, is questionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From an architectural and conservation point of view, the report was also critical.  For example, it points out in its executive summary that in many designated areas, the practice of conservation has simply resulted in the gutting of buildings and the retention of facades.  Clearly the urban renewal schemes have been of considerable benefit to the recipients of the tax incentives <Col N="261" /> and the rates remissions involved, including the developers, the property owners and the investors. Whether the communities who lived in the areas subject to urban renewal schemes benefited is an entirely different matter.  The report states:</P>
    <P>The impact of Urban Renewal Schemes on indigenous or adjacent communities is an issue which varies significantly depending on the prior condition or baseline before re-development occurred.  In those designated areas which have adjacent indigenous inner city communities, the local communities believe that urban renewal, as defined by the incentive schemes, has not addressed issues which are central to the regeneration and sustainable redevelopment of these areas such as unemployment, the lack of public amenities, education, training and youth development.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>In general, socially deprived inner city communities are precluded from participating in tax-incentive led development both by virtue of the fact that they do not have sufficient tax liability or capital to benefit from the Schemes and due to escalating land prices in designated areas.  Similarly, many not-for-profit and voluntary organisations have been unable to carry out social or amenity projects in designated areas.</P>
    <P>The report presented to the Ministers in 1996 was highly critical of the extent to which the urban renewal schemes addressed the issues of social deprivation, poverty and disadvantage in the areas in which they operated.  That is not to address the public perception of the urban renewal schemes and the degree of scepticism about them, that the areas selected for urban renewal and, in particular, the sites selected for designation had more to do with who owned them than where they were located.</P>
    <P>The issue now is whether the Bill before the House will address the principal objective set for it, namely, to turn around the urban renewal schemes to address the issue of social exclusion and disadvantage in the areas concerned.  The concept of the integrated area plans is welcome as are the general objectives set for those plans. I welcome also the section which addresses the question of monitoring.</P>
    <P>As a means of addressing social exclusion and the principal objective set by the Minister, the Bill falls far short.  There are a number of areas where, for example, the Bill does not go sufficiently far to address the problems of social exclusion and disadvantage.  First, the Bill addresses solely the question of physical dereliction and does so outside the context of the other interventions aimed at addressing social disadvantage, for example, the approach being taken by the area partnerships, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the county enterprise boards, the drugs task forces, the health boards and the education system.  That <Col N="262" /> underlines the necessity for a greater degree of integration in tackling poverty in our community.</P>
    <P>The national anti-poverty strategy launched by my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, during the course of the previous Government, which appears to have been taken off the boil somewhat by this Government, should be put centre stage in tackling poverty in our society.  The question that must be addressed is whether urban renewal will be effective in addressing social disadvantage and poverty or whether the social reasons expressed by the Minister are simply a justification for continuing tax incentives for certain favoured developers.</P>
    <P>The second question which arises is whether tax incentives and rates remissions are the best instrument to achieve the objectives concerned. As I mentioned earlier, not-for-profit organisations are effectively excluded from participation in the urban renewal schemes because they do not attract tax incentives and rates remissions. For example, grants are not being provided except for conservation purposes.  A grant-based approach in dealing with social exclusion might be a more effective way of tackling the problem. Grants could be made available to community organisations, voluntary bodies and local authorities to allow them undertake the type of developments that are necessary in areas of social disadvantage, particularly community-type developments which will not attract private investment and which consequently will not benefit from the urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>I was concerned about the reference by the Minister to the discussions with the European Commission and to which Deputy Howlin referred last night.  I have a second reason for expressing concern about it.  One of the areas proposed to be excluded by the European Commission in the revamp of Structural and Cohesion Funds is the URBAN programme which is aimed at addressing social deprivation in urban areas. At a time when we are enacting legislation aimed at addressing social exclusion through urban renewal, it would be ironic if the Government would permit European funds, which will change after 1999, to be redirected from the areas in which they are most needed, such as social deprivation in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The interface between the Minister of State's two responsibilities &mdash; urban renewal and housing &mdash; is not addressed.  I am not sure to what extent the Minister is aware of it but there is a social housing crisis.  Some 40,000 families are now on housing waiting lists.  The numbers are growing as fewer people are able to buy houses because of the increase in prices.  There has been an explosion in the number of people who are homeless or living in bed and breakfasts or in hostels as well as those living in unsuitable conditions in family homes.  There is a serious problem in that private rented accommodation at lower rents is no longer available.</P>
    <P>The housing situation is worse now than I have ever seen it in my time in public life.  I am surprised <Col N="263" /> the Bill does not seek to address that.  It is not right that tax incentives are used to allow building luxury penthouse apartments rather than being targeted at the provision of social housing. One amendment I will table on Committee Stage will seek to have the tax incentives and rates remissions directed specifically at the provision of social housing.  Taxpayers should no longer be asked to subsidise building penthouse apartments which are selling for £1 million and are being leased at enormous rents, while huge numbers of people, with their families, are living in squalid, appalling conditions or in unsuitable accommodation and for whom the State is not providing. If the urban renewal scheme is to be redirected, it should be at the provision of social housing.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy Michael Kitt made a strong case for his local interest and one with which I do not disagree, I wish to make the Minister aware that my local authority, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, has submitted an integrated area plan.  I do not wish to compound the common perception that my constituency is exclusively wealthy and well off.  Some of the worst areas of poverty in Ireland are to be found there.  The integrated area plan submitted by the county council seeks to address that and I ask the Minister to seriously consider it when it comes to choosing the integrated area plans.  At the same time, I agree with the comments of others that there needs to be a more transparent approach to both the selection of integrated area plans, to the designation of areas and to the costs to the taxpayer associated with the scheme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Gabhaim fíorbhuíochas don Teachta Gilmore mar gheall ar a chuid ama a roinnt.  The Bill promises the socio-economic and physical renewal of urban areas.  Crucially, we must learn from the mistakes of the past when urban planning was allowed to proceed in an extremely chaotic way.  In many cases, landowners, developers and speculators decided the pace and areas of development, with compliant county councillors of the major parties responding to their requests and carrying out land rezonings and material contraventions which were utterly unsuitable.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a crucial role to play. The way they implemented the plan for greater Dublin in terms of the three towns of Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown was disastrous for the tens of thousands of people who live there.  Greenfield sites were chosen on which thousands of homes were built with no facilities or backup provided.  No infrastructure in terms of community backup or even in terms of investment in employment was provided.  The people of those areas are still running to catch up because of the mistakes made.  That must not be allowed to be repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Urban renewal is nothing if it does not involve investment in people and that is my main question with the Bill.  It is not sufficient to have the <Col N="264" /> renewal left to the speculators and so-called investors who take advantage of the various tax breaks.  Fianna Fáil has traditionally relied on such people.  It is no surprise they receive favours from Fianna Fáil when, for example, a builder donates £60,000 to £70,000 to the party in one year.</P>
    <P>The suffering of those on the local authority housing lists is now immense and emergency investment is needed to provide homes for them. There is immense distress among young people who cannot afford to buy homes because of the actions of what I can only call gangsters in the building industry who have, by sheer profiteering, put homes outside the reach of ordinary working people on ordinary wages.  That issue must be addressed.  In the private rental area, we are seeing the return of the days described and condemned by James Connolly many decades ago. Rack renting has returned to Dublin and is alive and well and as ugly as ever.  That should be tackled by the Government through investment in urban renewal.  If these problems are allowed to continue, they will give rise to a major social crisis which is now already developing.  The vested interests must be taken on and investment in people put first.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal must also be set in a national context.  Allowing Dublin to sprawl indefinitely and chaotically is no longer sustainable in terms of traffic and pollution.  There must be national planning in all the counties so that people can stay in their home base, which is what most are happy to do if the jobs and the infrastructure are provided.  In that way, there can be a balanced development throughout Ireland rather than the chaotic rush towards Dublin which creates greater problems for ordinary people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my wholehearted support for the Bill.  Urban renewal applications in the form of a written statement and a plan were furnished by local authorities in February and are currently being assessed by the expert group set up by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to assist him in evaluating them.  Both statements and plans must indicate the objectives for the social and economic renewal on a sustainable basis in the areas to which they relate and the improvements in the physical environment of the areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill can be divided into four headings. First, it deals with standard provisions.  It is also concerned with the preparation and contents of the integrated area plans and defines the functions of local authorities and the Minister.  It also deals with the remission of rates and taxes.  Part III relates to additional functions for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  The final part provides for urban and village renewal grants <Col N="265" /> for local authorities and the amendment of taxation provisions which relate to them.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal schemes were introduced in 1986 as an answer to the increasing dilapidation and dereliction of many areas of our larger cities and towns.  The main objective of the initial scheme was to promote urban renewal and encourage local development through promoting investment by the private sector.  The aim of the legislation was to give an impetus to the construction and reconstruction of buildings in specified areas and proved highly effective.</P>
    <P>Following the successful outcome of the 1986 initiative, it was decided to launch a further scheme in 1994.  Both schemes have played a significant role in addressing widespread dereliction. They have been mainly responsible for the rejuvenation of areas that had fallen into decline. They have encouraged economic activity and enhanced tourism.  Most importantly, they have restored the confidence of the local population in designated areas.  It is obvious that the far sighted initiative taken so long ago has had very positive results.  The resulting investment has generated many new developments in run down areas and has given the people who live in those localities a much needed boost.  It has given them a renewed pride in where they live and the confidence to live in and invest in their own localities.</P>
    <P>Some people believe the social aspect of the early schemes was not on a scale that might have been desired.  This may be so but we cannot deny that the aim of urban renewal legislation was a worthy one.  It was a step in the right direction.  If this move had not been made we would be starting out on a new road today and making the mistakes of the past again.  This Bill proves that we have learned from past mistakes.  Approval for applications will be monitored within guidelines that have a strong emphasis on the social and environmental input.</P>
    <P>The Bill obliges local authorities to prepare integrated area plans and promotes widespread consultation with local interest groups.  Applications for tax relief must comply with local planning and generous incentives will be given.  For example, grants will be available for the renewal and preservation of buildings of historical and architectural interest.  Thanks to what we have learnt we will ensure that the renewal of local structures and areas will be examined and approved, bearing in mind the absolute necessity for social renewal.</P>
    <P>We have designed a Bill that guarantees a positive bias in favour of social renewal in line with the physical renewal of the areas where the schemes will operate.  It also demands a maximum return on investment in designated areas in its other aspects &mdash; environment, conservation, design and architecture.  While the Bill will not solve all ills, it will give us an unprecedented opportunity to enrich the lives of people and the physical fabric of the areas they live and work in.</P>
    <P>There was a heavy onus on local authorities to prioritise the identification of suitable areas to <Col N="266" /> derive maximum benefit from the scheme.  They owed this to the citizens of the areas for which they are responsible.  They also had to bear in mind disadvantaged communities when presenting the case for designation of specified areas within their jurisdiction.  They involved all interested parties in discussions and the views of local representative organisations were sought. All interests in a given area should have participated fully in the planning and realisation of urban renewal programmes.</P>
    <P>As a member of Cork Corporation, I must voice my reservations that the preparation of the plans was an executive function of local corporations and councils.  Councillors are consulted but have no input into the final format of the plan decided by the local authority.  Cork city councillors did not have full sight of the local plan prior to its being submitted to the Department.  That is not right &mdash; it is undemocratic.  Councillors are elected on behalf of the local community and are entitled to have a voice in the future development of the localities they represent.  The local community put its trust in them to decide the future of the locality.  We were consulted but our views did not have to be listened to.  It was the prerogative of the City Manager and his officials to decide the final plan.</P>
    <P>I intend no reflection on these people when I voice my objections to the way in which the scheme was introduced.  They were operating within the constraints imposed on them by the guidelines set out by the Department.  The ground rules must be changed.  All future plans must be a reserved function of the elected members of a local authority.  They must be allowed make the decisions that are fundamental to shaping the new cities, towns and villages under the umbrella of such schemes as integrated area planning.  The Minister and the House must take note of my views and I would like to hear the Minister of State's views.</P>
    <P>Living over the shop has been particularly successful in Cork.  The guidelines for the scheme will be continued in Cork where we have had tremendous success.  Cork Corporation submitted two integrated area plans &mdash; one for the Blackpool-Shandon area, the second for the city docks. Both plans differ in character.  Designation for both would achieve important objectives for the city.  Blackpool-Shandon is an area of low employment with many run down black spots.  It is in the heart of my constituency.  There are major traffic problems, smog, grime and a poor environment.  Now that the construction of the Blackpool bypass has commenced, thanks to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the commitment of the Taoiseach when in Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The bypass will lessen traffic and remove a major drawback for intending developers. Business interests have a negative perception of Blackpool because of the traffic problems and the dereliction of major tracts of the area. With the incentives being offered they will be able to invest in and develop Blackpool which will once again be the social and economic focal point of the northside.</P>
      <P>Cork Corporation has placed great emphasis on refurbishing the existing homes of owneroccupied houses.  This guarantees stable communities with long-term commitments to an area. This is vitally important in areas such as Wellington Road which boasts many large l9th century houses.  We know how difficult it is to repair and maintain such property, much of which has, for this reason, been developed into poor quality rental accommodation.  Incentives will encourage a return to owner occupancy.  There should be no limitation on house sizes as many of the larger dwellings are the most worthy of preservation. Owner-occupiers of listed dwellings should be given special consideration.  Their properties are often financial burdens because of age and character.  They must receive positive encouragement to refurbish many of those buildings that have been sadly neglected.</P>
      <P>The other designated area of Cork is the docks area &mdash; the gateway to Cork city.  It is a high visibility site in a very central area which has suffered long periods of decay and neglect.  The docks area has a mixture of residential, commercial, service and industrial buildings on the north side of the River Lee.  If the Minister of State accepts the corporation's plan for the area we will see an Isle of Dogs or St. Catherine's type waterside development within a number of years which will enhance the gateway to the city.  Such a development must be incentive-driven.</P>
      <P>The houses in Montenotte slope down to Kent railway station and the famous Horgan's Quay. There are also old warehouses, mills and heavy industry on the marina on the south side of the bank.  Urban renewal in these areas must be used to guarantee the preservation of the many fine old terraced houses that are, in some cases, threatened with decay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sympathetic restoration of some of the city's finest industrial heritage buildings is a priority.  Its early 20th century industrial architecture must be protected.  This area is an important and representative part of Cork's history.  The proposed upgrading of the railway station will have a major environmental and aesthetic impact.  It will encourage the use of public transport, and, I hope reduce the volume of vehicular traffic on our roads.  It is important that public transport be of a standard and quality that will attract road users. <Col N="268" /> This poses a challenge for Bus Éireann and Iarnrod Éireann.  We are all aware of the success of the latter's Arrow service in Cork and other areas.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal must be utilised to relieve the increasing congestion on roads.  It is vital that we use the integrated area plan to the fullest potential to achieve this.  CIE has invited proposals for the development of Horgan's Quay and the redevelopment of Kent station and has submitted plans for both to Cork Corporation.  These include a new railway concourse, shopping area, new railway station, a hotel, apartments, IT centre, telesales and offices.  I understand a number of proposals have been shortlisted.  We must match this body's faith in Cork by demonstrating our commitment to renewal of the area.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the controversy surrounding the Horgan's Quay site in Cork, of the actions of a Minister in the previous Government in relation to the proposed purchase of the site by a well known and respected Cork developer.  I had numerous discussions with the late Hugh Coveney and with Alderman Jim Corr of Fine Gael who, as Lord Mayor, spearheaded the proposed development with CIE and to whom I express my sincere gratitude for not politicising the matter.  I also express my gratitude to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, and the board which advertised the proposed development in December last year.</P>
    <P>I could talk for an hour about the wrongdoing in relation to the Horgan's Quay site but that is history, the people concerned are no longer in power.  What we must do is match the enthusiasm of Cork Corporation for the redevelopment of all the localities covered by the two area plans submitted. I trust the Minister of State will endorse and approve them when they have been evaluated by the expert group.  They will stand as the legacy of the Government and are of vital importance to the renewal of the city.  The Minister of State has demonstrated his commitment to conservation and an awareness of the social implications of urban renewal.  I praise him for adopting an innovative approach in this Bill and I ask the House to offer him its full support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>: I welcome the Bill.  The urban renewal scheme has been a success story since its introduction ten years ago and has helped to rejuvenate many of our towns and cities. Urban areas have been given an opportunity to modernise while builders and developers have been encouraged to become actively involved with local authorities in restoration projects. Wexford town, which was designated ten years ago, has reaped the benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enniscorthy was granted designation status in l992 by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  It had suffered severe job losses following the closure of bacon and flour milling factories.  Many agricultural enterprises had also closed down.  The town was in serious decline. Today, it is thriving; two new hotels have been <Col N="269" /> built in the last year with new cineplexes, apartments and a swimming pool.  The Department of Agriculture and Food has relocated in the town. As much work remains to be done, an extension of the scheme has been sought to allow development take place across the river.  I hope this will not be blocked off by the Bill.  We have been informed, however, by county managers, town clerks and other local authority officials that, from discussions with Department officials, it is unlikely extensions will be granted.  I ask the Minister of State to take a direct interest in the matter and allow projects already begun to be completed.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about crime levels and the need for conservation.  I am not certain, however, that the granting of designation status will solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The developer has an important role to play. What consultations have taken place with developers over the past ten years?  It is my understanding that the Department's proposals are not developer friendly, that they will create problems for developers.  We should remove the red tape so that they are not driven away.  There must be a shared arrangement whereby towns will reap the benefits and developers are encouraged to participate.</P>
    <P>The 6,000 population guideline is a source of concern.  If this criterion is included and strictly adhered to, many small towns will not benefit.  I cite New Ross and Gorey in County Wexford as examples.  I ask the Minister of State to consider removing this figure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin admitted that the one mistake he made was giving exclusive responsibility to county councils which are generally made up of big wealthy farmers who have no interest in urban developments.  Because of this no decision was made in County Wexford and a list of four towns was submitted to the Department.  Urban councils have no say.  The Minister of State should look at this matter.  It is not right that councillors who represent rural areas have a say when it comes to the designation of urban areas. Responsibility should be transferred to borough and urban councils, town commissioners and the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Enright, Perry and Ring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I listened closely to the Minister of State.  This side of the House has supported the concept of urban renewal since l986 as we realise fully the benefits it can bring to communities. We welcome the integrated area plans, which are a central focus of this legislation.  It is bad practice that the House is being asked to rubber-stamp legislation which, in effect, has already been put in train.  That point was referred to by Deputy Dukes last night.  Various sections deal with the integrated area plans, their monitoring and other functions, which have been decided upon.  Section 7(6) outlines the basic provisions that should be included in an integrated area <Col N="270" /> plan.  The House has not been consulted on that matter, yet all the integrated area plans were submitted to the Department by March.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised the issue of social housing. If the collective view of the House was to prioritise social housing as a major function of a new integrated area plan and, accordingly, change section 7, would that necessarily mean the 78 integrated area plans submitted would have to be thrown out of the Department and the county councils and various corporations that submitted them would be asked to revisit them?  That is bad practice.  This legislation should have been before the House months before those integrated area plans were sent to the Department.</P>
    <P>Section 7(7) states that &ldquo;In preparing an integrated area action plan the local authority or authorised company concerned may consult with such other persons.  .&rdquo; Deputy Howlin mentioned the lack of consultation some local authorities have engaged in with the partnerships, chambers of commerce, residents' groups and a range of people in their county.  County councillors have echoed the point made by Deputy Flynn.  If it is the collective view of the House to insert a specific provision for consultation, how stand the integrated area plans?  If Department officials were to go through each of those plans, I suspect they would find the variety of consultation that exists in an area like south Dublin, which has the wholehearted support of the South Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the partnerships and other bodies, may be different from the level of consultation that may exist in Tipperary or Cork.  It is bad practice to put in place legislation after the horse has left the stable.</P>
    <P>If it is the collective view of the House that we should have a much stricter regime to monitor the effectiveness of these plans one or two years down the road, what powers exist to provide for that?  That is another example of bad practice.  If the House decides on Committee or Report Stages to substantially amend the legislation, where stands the integrated area plan?  I would like the Minister of State to respond to that point. Will the 78 plans be returned by the Department to the county councils or companies and told that the collective view of Dáil Éireann is somewhat different from its intentions last January, February or March, that they should go back to the drawing board and start again?  That is an important parliamentary point.  Unless the House can put its impression on this legislation, many of the integrated area action plans will not have the necessary force to achieve what we want.  I do not say that to be critical but to stand up for the democratic rights of Members of this House, to allow them have their imprint on legislation and to ensure that imprint can be effectively enforced.</P>
    <P>As has been said on numerous occasions, since 1986 urban renewal has made a difference to many large towns, particularly to some cities.  It is right that the strategic plans, which should be central to urban renewal in the future, should have a much sharper focus.  We must ensure there <Col N="271" /> is a bias towards local community groups taking control of a plan because to date, particularly in the Dublin area, local people have not benefited directly from much of the investment in very deprived communities in the inner city, particularly in the west and south west of the city which I represent.  I applaud the aim in the Bill which will ensure that we will have a much more strategic approach to urban renewal in the future.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the fact that while the integrated area plans have been sent to the Minister, ultimately the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will make the final decision.  In this new age of explaining the decisions of Government and being open and accountable to local authorities, I would have thought it only sensible that an explanation should have been given as to why those integrated area plans which do not gain the approval of those Ministers on 1 August do not meet the necessary criteria, but there is no provision for that in the Bill and that will have to be revisited on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As other colleagues have been bleating understandably about their constituency demands, I will spend the remainder of my contribution focusing on the problems facing south Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of a county council but I am not a farmer, so unfortunately Deputy Browne's comments do not apply to me.  Of the 11 areas of social deprivation in the country, nine are in the Dublin area.  To date many of the urban renewal proposals have referred specifically to conservation, protecting old buildings and such like, but the focus should be on developing communities where housing estate after housing estate has been built and very few social facilities and infrastructural development have been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the more innovative proposals has come from South Dublin County Council concerning Tallaght and north Clondalkin.  As all Members are aware, the designation of The Square in Tallaght has made a dramatic difference to creating a new town centre in the middle of the third largest conurbation in the country. Tallaght, in the south-west of this city, is larger than Limerick city and has a huge population. The Square and the new town centre have acted as a hub of investment, as can be seen in the rental price of commercial property.  That innovative proposal from South Dublin County Council involved designating the whole area, but the local authority will establish a fund through which businesses in The Square, which have done very <Col N="272" /> well, will pay into it.  That fund will go directly towards providing for the new suburban parts of west Tallaght where there is no infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>It uses the centre of Tallaght as a hub through which funds can be made available for areas such as Brookfield, Fettercairn, Killinarden and Tallaght which would not have a hope in hell of getting investment were it not for the fact that moneys can come from The Square.</P>
    <P>This is the type of concept the Minister and his Department should support because the areas I mentioned, which have massive rates of unemployment and have one type of social housing, will not receive any direct benefits from urban renewal unless it is filtered through a major hub of investment such as the town centre in Tallaght. The plan has the complete support of Tallaght chamber of commerce, the partnerships and all the groups which were involved in the report.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look in an innovative way at the plans which will come before him.  This is the type of investment we must encourage.  The areas I referred to, which have one type of social community with massive deprivation, are completely different from other communities.  If areas are correctly selected urban renewal will make a difference to these communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Urban renewal has been a considerable success and the relevant Ministers, officials and local authorities deserve congratulations. In rural areas we face a problem in that huge numbers of people are going to the larger centres of population, resulting in the closure of houses, schools, Garda stations and post offices in villages and towns.  This is causing further urban deprivation leading to major housing problems. In my constituency there is a serious housing problem in Tullamore and Birr, a relatively small town.  Services are not being put into smaller areas.  In future there must be some mix in the context of wealth which normally concentrates in the centre.  Consideration should be given to wealth being moved to outlying areas thus encouraging inward rather than outward development.</P>
      <P>Urban renewal should encourage the restoration of areas in need of renewal.  In many areas derelict and semi-derelict areas have been restored under this scheme.  The Minister must seriously examine the guideline of 6,000 recommended by the expert group and which I think should be scrapped.  Three plans were submitted by Offaly, one for the Tullamore-Clara catchment area, one for the Birr, Crinkle and Riverstown area and one for Edenderry.  If the Minister applies the provisions in the Bill, Birr and Edenderry will be excluded.  We went to the trouble of preparing a plan for Birr, a heritage town, with the aid of Patrick Shaffrey, an expert in town planning, and I hope it is not excluded.  These areas must be examined and I ask the Minister to do everything possible in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> Tax incentives are important and I am glad they have been renewed.  The overall scheme is highly desirable and I am sorry I do not have further time to discuss it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Urban renewal presents the Government with an opportunity to transfer resources via the investment sector to Sligo and western regions which are removed from the east coast industrial and commercial sectors.  This can play a major role in offsetting some of the effects of peripherality.  Major investors in such sectors as retail will not be encouraged to invest unless tax incentives are used to offset the disadvantages of location and population.</P>
      <P>Towns such as Sligo, Ballymote, Tubbercurry, Collooney and Carrick-on-Shannon represent the last centres of population in the north-west and require positive investment discrimination if they are to remain regional and county focal points.</P>
      <P>Urban renewal investment presents an opportunity to create a vibrant local investment climate, encouraging redevelopment in derelict and run down areas.  Since 1993 urban renewal has attracted in excess of £100 million in investment for Sligo city, creating a new vibrancy in the city which is apparent in improved streetscapes and new tourist, shopping and cultural activities.</P>
      <P>Sligo still lags behind as a regional centre for the north-west, not having experienced the retail expansion of competing towns such as Galway, Athlone, Longford and Derry, thereby posing a threat to long-term viability.  I am aware of moves to limit retail expansion, something which is very welcome as controls are being introduced to reflect the need to support existing established activity.  In this context the capping of floor size is very welcome.</P>
      <P>In its submission for urban renewal Sligo has sought to encourage the rebalancing of the city centre by strengthening the retail sector with multi-storey car parking, encouraging a strong programme of conservation of existing streets, protecting inner city residents and seeking to increase hotel accommodation.</P>
      <P>Nationally, the Government is moving towards the removal of multi-storey car parking incentives. This is a mistake and will have a major negative impact on a number of areas, particularly Sligo where there is a need to radically increase car parking availability.  Providing flat parking in urban areas is an inefficient use of scarce urban land.  The incentive should remain for certain nominated areas such as Sligo in order to allow a managed expansion of the retail, office and commercial sectors.</P>
      <P>The rural scheme which will be piloted in portions of south Sligo will very much complement the urban scheme.  The Minister should implement the rural scheme in additional areas of County Sligo as an imbalance can be created when an urban scheme is promoted in the absence of a rural scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little encouragement for owners or residents in city streets, such as John Street in <Col N="274" /> Sligo, given that tax incentives may be inappropriate in the context of an aged population which has possibly no tax liability.  Yet buildings in such areas are listed as part of our national heritage and must be given Government consideration.</P>
    <P>Retail growth must be induced to develop in a manner that supports local shopping and existing independent retailers.  This requires a response similar to that in the UK and internationally, namely, supporting policies that encourage expansion from within city centres.  In the UK there were outer urban renewal schemes which resulted in city centres becoming derelict.  We must encourage second and third generation business people by ensuring they receive some of the incentives available.</P>
    <P>A licence system is required to enable local authorities collect levies for community facilities &mdash; currently there is no such legislative power &mdash; monitor building sites in order to eliminate the black economy and secure local employment opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The new urban renewal scheme, which will commence on 1 August 1998, will mark a change of focus and direction in urban renewal policy, which I welcome.  The new scheme will be different from its predecessors, all of which have been in existence in some shape or form since 1986, as it will target the remaining areas of need in a more integrated, focused and streamlined manner.  While physical renewal will, of course, be the central objective, it will not be the only one.  The future policy on urban renewal must take account of the social needs in the areas targeted for regeneration.  An important objective of the new scheme is to ensure that physical renewal contributes to social renewal.</P>
      <P>Relevant local authorities seeking designation will be required to prepare integrated area plans, IAPs, for parts of urban areas in most need of physical and socio-economic rejuvenation and to identify targeted sub-areas or key developments within them for which designation is sought.  The need for such designation must be justified by reference to the IAP's objectives for the area.  A starting point in the preparation of an IAP should be an analysis of the physical and social needs of the selected area and a vision statement as to how urban renewal could, and would, address these needs.</P>
      <P>Urban renewal schemes have achieved a great deal since 1986.  The purpose of the new scheme is to focus resources from both the private and public sectors into the remaining areas which have the greatest need of development and potential for redevelopment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are required to prioritise potential IAP areas to ensure the new scheme is properly targeted having regard to the following factors: It is envisaged that priority will be given to areas in cities and towns with strong urban characteristics where the greatest concentrations of physical decay and social or economic disadvantage tends to occur; the IAP area must contain <Col N="275" /> sites or key developments with the potential to benefit from designation incentives and must have the potential infrastructure to cope with any likely developments; and the IAP may also present opportunities for partnership arrangements between public bodies and the private sector for the development of publicly owned land or other arrangements with possible spin-off benefits for the local community.</P>
    <P>The opportunity for achieving synergy with other area-based plans should be maximised, without duplicating work already undertaken. The following programmes, in particular, may present opportunities to assist in this process: local authorities' programmes in regard to infrastructure, transport and social housing; urban renewal and environmental improvement works under the EU urban and village renewal programme; there may be opportunities to build on the achievements of the earlier designated areas or enterprise areas in a particular region; local development plans prepared, or in preparation, by local development organisations for the purposes of the local development programme; and plans compiled by the county enterprise board.</P>
    <P>The integrated area plan process aims to give local people a stake in the rejuvenation of their areas by focusing on community attainment and sustainable job creation.  The education, training and employment and social needs of indigenous local communities must be assessed by relevant agencies and matched, as far as possible, with new job opportunities.  Some of these jobs can be created within the area by developing its existing economic base.  The local authority, in co-operation with local business interests and development agencies, should analyse barriers to growth and the employment of local people as part of baseline studies into this issue.  They should also identify scope for generating new economic activity in such sectors as small enterprises, local services and tourism which will not displace, but rather enhance, the economic and social prosperity of the indigenous disadvantaged population.</P>
    <P>Limerick County Council has already submitted an integrated area plan to the Department of the Environment and Local Government in accordance with the guidelines laid down on this matter.  I congratulate and commend the officials of Limerick County Council involved in drawing up these proposals relating to urban renewal opportunities in County Limerick.  I fully support the council's application to the Department of the Environment and Local Government in regard to seeking urban renewal status for the towns of Newcastle West, Rathkeale and Kilmallock.  The population of these three towns exceeds the population threshold of 6,000 people which is normally the test applied before urban renewal status is granted.</P>
    <P>A very practical purpose would be served by granting urban renewal status to the towns of Rathkeale, Newcastle West and Kilmallock.  It <Col N="276" /> would send out a very clear message that this Government is serious about promoting positive and constructive rural development policies whereby long-term and sustainable jobs would be created.  One of the ways in which the Government could achieve this objective would be by introducing urban renewal benefits to the towns which have been included for recommendation for such status by the proposals submitted by Limerick County Council.  Moreover, it would serve a social and economic purpose within County Limerick itself and assist in redressing the one way traffic in terms of investment which has been directed towards Limerick city to the detriment of the county.</P>
    <P>Private investment is needed in Limerick county just as much as in the city and the granting of urban renewal status to various towns in the county would be a positive step in the right direction. It must also be emphasised that if urban renewal status were granted to some towns in County Limerick, under the round of urban renewal towns which will be granted such status later this year, it is probable that other towns in Limerick would benefit from urban renewal status soon after.  Extensive consultation took place on this whole issue between Limerick County Council and private and voluntary groups in the region, all of which must be commended for their efforts in formulating proposals relating to granting urban renewal status for towns in County Limerick.</P>
    <P>We have all seen the benefits which urban renewal has brought to our cities in terms of infrastructural improvements and direct investment in their respective areas.  In fact, the Minister for Finance recently announced the rural renewal scheme which is to apply in some counties beside the Shannon, including Longford, Roscommon, Leitrim and parts of Sligo and Cavan.  This initiative is very similar to the urban renewal scheme and will prove highly successful in terms of the social and economic improvements it will make to this region.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, logical that if towns with fewer than 6,000 in population can benefit from the rural renewal scheme, it would be correct to allow towns with fewer than 6,000 in population to benefit from the urban renewal scheme.  The Government should also consider allowing towns with fewer than 6,000 in population to amalgamate for the purposes of securing urban renewal status.  This would be good news for Limerick county and rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this legislation and I express my appreciation to all those who have worked very actively to advance it and have carried out some of the <Col N="277" /> necessary preliminary work.  I would particularly like to put on record my appreciation to Mr. Dom Hegarty and the committee of experts who are evaluating applications under the scheme.  The main criterion which should be taken into account is the level of deprivation, in terms of derelict buildings and decay, unemployment and poverty in towns.  Poverty is more acute in some towns than in others.  If one uses a population criterion of 6,000 people, one will find that most towns of that size are thriving and, with few exceptions, seldom have problems of economic and social consequence.</P>
      <P>The consultation mechanism is extremely important.  A typical example of the impact of urban renewal can be seen in Ennis.  That town has been transformed into a thriving, vibrant economic centre since urban renewal commenced some years ago.  The huge investment that has taken place and the escalation in the development of private housing as well as public buildings indicates the success of the scheme and demonstrates that a mix of commercial and private housing development can be successful.  Another factor in the transformation of Ennis was the Government decision, at about the same time as the urban renewal decision, to relocate Government Departments there.  This twin approach of renewal and decentralisation can have a highly beneficial impact in towns such as Ennis.</P>
      <P>Many Members of the House represent areas which have experienced a massive reduction in population.  If I had time I could quote statistics from district electoral divisions which show that in the period since the last census the population in some districts has declined by up to 40 per cent. There has been a huge decline in the agricultural population on the west coast of Clare and the indications are that the decline will continue.  As agriculture becomes more mechanised and more intensive the flight from the land will accelerate rather than decrease.</P>
      <P>For that reason it is critically important that we take initiatives such as this in areas which are bounded by rural districts suffering severe decline.  I can offer the House one example.  Last Saturday, confirmations took place in Kilmihil village for two large parishes adjacent to where I live, Coolmeen and Cranny.  Fourteen children were confirmed, a 100 per cent reduction in the numbers five years ago.  The seriousness of the decline in rural areas is not fully recognised by planners.  Soon there will be ghost villages instead of the small villages which currently exist on the west Clare peninsula.  Schools are threatened with closure while many post offices and Garda stations have already closed due to the serious erosion of the population.  The most serious problem is that the population in the area comprises mainly old people and young children and many of the old people live alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any prospect of dealing with this problem on the Loop Head peninsula, it will only be achieved through the designation of a town such as Kilrush which is the central focal point <Col N="278" /> of economic activity.  That is why Clare County Council put forward Kilrush in its application to the Department.  Kilrush was built by the Vandeleurs and there are still derelict buildings in the old famine ward which were built by that family to ease poverty and deprivation during the Famine. The area could benefit from huge investment by way of restoration of buildings.  The opportunity and finances to do so do not exist at present.  Designation and an incentive scheme in that area would be critically important in securing the reconstruction of some of the unique historic buildings.</P>
    <P>Kilrush also suffered a great deal as a result of the decline of the flour milling industry.  The old buildings connected with that industry lie derelict and in decay with no prospect of ever being utilised except under a scheme of this nature. However, on the basis of population figures the town of Kilrush, despite the surrounding area which has a population of about 10,000 people, would not qualify for the scheme.  It is important that, when making assessments, the review body take into account the population of the small or satellite villages adjacent to a town such as Kilrush. They include Cooraclare, Kilmihil, Carrigaholt, Cross and Kilbaha, villages which are suffering severely at present.  I can make the same point about a town such as Lisdoonvarna, the only spa town in Ireland, which has also sought resort designation.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to co-ordinate the activities of all renewal schemes, whether they are for resorts, urban areas, rural areas or villages.  Under forthcoming legislation, a number of Departments will co-ordinate a new grants scheme for historic and architecturally significant buildings.  Funding of £4 million is mentioned in the recently published document, Protecting our Architectural Heritage. The funding in section 17 of this Bill could be utilised to carry out this type of work and I hope that will be done.  After some experience in the implementation of this legislation, we might examine the possibility of putting an authority in place which would deal with all urban renewal. That would avoid duplication and the confusion that will arise among various Departments and authorities.</P>
    <P>People should also be drawn to a greater degree into the consultation process.  There has been little consultation with people at local level about what is necessary and about the eventual shape of the integrated plans.  The integrated plan is the focal point of this legislation and the key to its success.  Substantial funding should be made available to local authorities to enable them to employ professional expertise to draft the best possible integrated development plans and to ensure we get the greatest benefit from this legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Daly for affording me the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The provisions of the Bill will be discussed in depth on Committee Stage.  As my time is limited, I will <Col N="279" /> confine my comments to making a case for the inclusion of Balbriggan in the new urban renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>It is the view of the majority of the residents of Balbriggan that the town, once the industrial and textile capital of Fingal, has been neglected by politicians and the political system for many years.  It is difficult to disagree with this view given the lack of industry in the town and the rate of unemployment, which is significantly higher than that of any other town in Fingal.  There is also a high rate of youth unemployment.</P>
      <P>It is also clear that there is a significant number of under-utilised and vacant buildings in the town and many other buildings which are in poor structural condition.  The majority of these buildings are located where they can seriously detract from the overall appearance of the town.  They provide an ideal opportunity for redevelopment and rejuvenation as provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides for the preparation and submission of integrated area plans for consideration by the Minister.  The community in Balbriggan, in conjunction with the planning staff of Fingal County Council, prepared such a submission, the only submission made by that local authority.  There are areas in the country which the Celtic tiger has not yet reached and Balbriggan is one of them.  There is a widely held perception that tax-related schemes, such as that for urban renewal, have been designated in the past not on the basis of need but on the basis of political expediency.</P>
      <P>I hope the Government will not deny the town of Balbriggan its legitimate entitlement on this occasion.  The Minister knows the town well and is also aware of the unique requirements of the urban renewal scheme.  I urge him not to let the people of Balbriggan down and I hope 1 August 1998 will be a highlight in the rejuvenation of Balbriggan.</P>

      <P>I welcome this eagerly awaited Bill.  It provides for the preparation of integrated development plans by local authorities.  It provides for recommendations to be made in respect of qualifying areas for the purpose of urban renewal tax reliefs.  However, there is no indication of how widely these reliefs will apply.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that previous urban renewal schemes have been a success, as can be witnessed around the country.  Limerick has been transformed since the introduction of the schemes by the former Minister, Mr. Boland.  I welcome that the Minister, in response to a number of requests to have the 6,000 population guideline reduced, emphasised that it is only a guideline and is not <Col N="280" /> set in stone.  This provides the Minister with an opportunity to examine any proposal.</P>
    <P>I support the proposal from Limerick County Council that Rathkeale, Newcastle West and Kilmallock be designated.  There has been serious decline in those rural areas of County Limerick and fourteen schools there will soon lose a teacher.  This is an opportunity to rejuvenate a part of Limerick which has been in decline for some decades.</P>
    <P>I will put the case for Rathkeale town.  It is unique in many ways, but particularly because it is the home of a significant number of travellers. Of towns with a population of 1,500 or more in 1996, Rathkeale had the highest proportion of travellers.  Up to 40 per cent of the population are from the travelling community.  The number of travellers significantly increases at Christmas and for other special events.</P>
    <P>Over the years the wealthier members of the travelling community have purchased or built their own houses in the town.  A sizeable number of them remain unoccupied as some of the families pursue their trading activities abroad or choose to live in caravans adjacent to the houses. Often houses are used as stores and the doors or windows of many are fitted with unsightly iron grilles.  The Roche's Road and Fairhill areas, which are a significant part of the town, are almost entirely occupied by travellers.</P>
    <P>Nearly 50 per cent of the population of Rathkeale is travellers.  There is a high level of tolerance between both communities in the town, although there is also a great deal of tension.  Rathkeale has one of the lowest crime rates of any town in the county.  There are few difficulties and two separate cultures live side by side in a spirit of tolerance and understanding.</P>
    <P>However, it has created, and will inevitably create, problems for the town.  There has been a great deal of tension between the communities. In recent years there has been progress and the situation has improved.  However, that is not to say there are no problems.  While the level of understanding in both communities is high, trouble flares up occasionally.  I have asked for a special study of Rathkeale.  However, because the town is unique, it would be difficult to find someone with the experience to carry out such a study.</P>
    <P>A significant number of properties in the town require refurbishment.  Sporadic dereliction can be detected throughout the town although it is particularly noticeable on the main street and the area of the square.  The local enterprise group estimates that derelict and unoccupied premises comprise 40 per cent of the buildings on the main street.  A decline in the physical fabric of Fairhill and Roche's Road also corresponds with extremely high vacancy rates.  The extent of urban decay and obsolescence is quite high.</P>
    <P>There has been little new investment in Rathkeale and this has resulted in a slump in the town's economy in the past two decades.  Emigration from the town has continually increased as has unemployment.  Population decline <Col N="281" /> between 1991 and 1996 was the greatest of any town in the county at 14.25 per cent.  Rathkeale suffers from extremely high levels of long-term and youth unemployment among a workforce predominantly consisting of semi-skilled and unskilled workers.</P>
    <P>The economic hardship in the town is evident, not only in the dereliction of the town's physical fabric but also in its retail base which has been in decline.  This decline is more evident as the retail base is almost exclusive to the main street.  The unique traveller occupancy in the town creates a further requirement for incentives.  Insufficient resources and a fragmented approach to meeting the needs of this group has isolated them and reduced the opportunities and services available to them.</P>
    <P>Rathkeale has enormous potential to benefit from the integrated area plan designation.  The recent completion of the town's bypass and improvement in sewerage and water networks ensure the infrastructure has the capacity to accommodate further development.  Designation will bring investment into the town, creating jobs, encouraging enterprise and ensuring adequate levels of housing provision.  Improvement will also occur in the social fabric of Rathkeale, with the promotion of greater social integration.  This will lead to an expanded range of facilities and services available to both communities.</P>
    <P>I impress on the Minister the unique position of Rathkeale and how important it is to restore the centre of the town to commercial activity.  The extension of the scheme will provide an incentive to do this and will attract businesses to the town. The decline in the physical fabric of the main street is a serious problem.  The inner core of the town is decaying and many of the buildings are derelict, dilapidated, unoccupied and disused. The blight of decay which has strangled the physical, social and economic life of the town must be stopped.  People must be enticed to live in the town.  The potential of the town to attract private investment and development is depressed because of the physical environment.</P>
    <P>There is little interest on the part of many owners of property to undertake development of the buildings.  The designation of the areas in Rathkeale for the purpose of urban renewal will lead to significant private sector investment and will contribute to the improvement of the town. The Rathkeale enterprise committee is unable to address the problem of dereliction.  The increasing problem of dereliction and dilapidation on the main street was highlighted by a survey undertaken by the committee.  Of every ten buildings in the main street, four are derelict, dilapidated, unoccupied or disused.  Such buildings are often boarded up as they are owned by travellers who have moved on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a national problem. Rathkeale has effectively dealt with it for a century, <Col N="282" /> although with a great deal of difficulty.  We try to manage the situation which has resulted in problems in the town which I wish to expose.  I appreciate that comments on travellers are always made.  However, Rathkeale is one of the best towns in the country in the way both communities live in relative harmony.  There has been criticism of Rathkeale and its travellers. However, it has problems which must be dealt with and I am asking the Minister to deal with them.</P>
      <P>For many years there has been no market for second-hand property because of the number of neighbouring derelict buildings.  No new residential improvement has taken place in Rathkeale. An alarming number of businesses in the town have closed.  Such a loss of economic activity is directly related to the decline in population.  In compiling a strategic plan for the main street, the development committee consulted Limerick County Council.  The council wholly endorses the promotion of the urban renewal scheme in Rathkeale.  The Derelict Sites Act, 1990, which prevents property becoming derelict and detracting from the amenity, character or appearance of areas, has proved difficult for Limerick County Council to implement.</P>
      <P>In Rathkeale main street buildings continue to be neglected and are unsightly.  Urban improvement measures, whether promoted by the county council, initiated by community organisations or provided by private enterprise, were implemented in recent years and improved the physical appearance of the town.  Such improvements are overshadowed by a number of derelict properties which, until removed, will make it impossible to achieve the objective of improving the physical environment of the town, attracting people to live in it and sustaining new enterprises. The experience of other designated areas underlies the interest of many people, particularly young people, in buying houses or apartments in urban areas and bringing life back into such centres.  Elderly people also prefer to live in towns given their proximity to services.</P>
      <P>The activity generated by an urban renewal scheme would halt the worsening process of decay and dereliction and change the face of Rathkeale.  The result of such development would be to improve amenities for the existing population and attract significant numbers of young people to live in the town.  The enterprise committee recognises the strong focus of the urban renewal scheme on residential development, relying on measures to conserve and use existing infrastructure.  Rathkeale needs social and economic rejuvenation.  Tax designation would encourage people to move back into the town and revitalise the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A successful town is associated with a growing population.  Many people are ready and willing to make necessary investments if tax designation is granted.  Many local citizens have invested money elsewhere in recent years.  The risk of investing in property elsewhere is significantly lower and the <Col N="283" /> likelihood of appreciation in values of properties is higher than in other towns.  The designation of areas of Rathkeale and in particular the provision of residential allowances will bring life back to the town.</P>
    <P>A survey of the town indicated there are 56 derelict, dilapidated, unoccupied or disused houses in the main street, more than 39 per cent of the total.  Only 27 houses are residential, 13 are residential and business and 16 are business alone.  Twenty of the houses have only one occupant, 22 have two or three occupants and three have two or more occupants.  Occupants of 38 of the 42 residences are people living alone or two people living together who are over 50 years of age.  We must break down the barriers to development.  Property values in the town are plummeting and there is genuine economic decline.  In the past 20 years, 64 businesses have disappeared from the main street and have not been replaced.  There is a decrease in population and an increase in unemployment.  We must break this vicious circle.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter, particularly in view of the unique position of Rathkeale which often talks itself down when it should talk itself up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and appreciate the Minister's intentions on this occasion.  Urban renewal was carried out in the past for various reasons.  I understand the emphasis on the involvement of the Minister for Finance in this scheme.  Previously urban renewal was concentrated outside towns where various developments took place and developers were considered favourably in terms of investment.  On this occasion the Minister is trying to avoid that and concentrate strictly on urban renewal.</P>
      <P>I welcome the progress made under the urban renewal scheme in my town of Longford.  Since County Longford has been designated under the rural renewal scheme, how will that compare with urban renewal?  Will the same conditions apply for developers and other people who wish to avail of the scheme?  A detailed integrated plan was drawn up by the local authority and I compliment the officials of the urban and county councils in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister will outline the position for the county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill. We must ensure an integrated approach is adopted.  As Deputy Belton said, it is important that the urban renewal scheme is concentrated on the town structure.  That approach has proved very successful in my town of Monaghan.  I hope the scheme will be extended in the town.  Since industries and businesses have to compete against those who receive tax benefits they should have an opportunity to take part in the scheme.  That would ensure the town, which suffered much as a result of the Northern problems, is developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to an issue raised by the county manager and staff regarding this scheme.  The <Col N="284" /> population limit recommended by the group for qualification for the scheme is 6,000, but that eliminates towns such as Clones, Castleblayney and Ballybay in County Monaghan.  Those towns suffered enormously as a result of large numbers of people moving from Northern Ireland because of the troubles.  Those towns should receive funding in line with that made available to Monaghan and other towns, otherwise they will decline.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille agus aontaím leis an Aire go bhfuil gá leis.  Tá na buntáistí a bhain leis an scéim a bhí ann cheana rí-soiléir agus deineadh cuid mhaith den obair sin nuair nach raibh an tír chomh saibhir is atá sí anois.</P>
      <P>Creideann daoine áirithe nach bhfuil gá le scéim nua faoi láthair ach is léir go bhfuil in áiteanna áirithe &mdash; ní hamháin sna bailte móra ach faoin tuath freisin.</P>
      <P>I welcome the consultants' finding that physical urban renewal can no longer operate in isolation &mdash; virtually all the difficulties experienced arise as a result of that being the sole criterion &mdash; and the recommendation that a new scheme should address physical, economic, social and environmental regeneration.  The new scheme is wisely linked to area-based integrated strategic planning. I am glad local authorities will have a much more central role than was the case previously.</P>
      <P>Many problems with previous schemes, including the special tourist resort scheme, would have been avoided if there had been a higher level of consultation with local authorities in regard to physical planning and the provision of services such as sewerage and water, services which were inadequate in some of the areas nominated for the scheme.  It seems county councils and borough councils were consulted while urban councils were not.  That matter should be addressed.</P>
      <P>One must also acknowledge that the expert advisory panel did excellent work in advising on the guidelines for identifying priority areas and suggesting the content of integrated area plans. The criteria for selection of areas for which plans were to be prepared included the policies and objectives of the county development plan. Unfortunately, those plans might not assist in counties where plans are up to ten years old.  That matter needs to be addressed independently of this or any other scheme.  The criteria also included the extent of physical decay, social and economic disadvantage and, most importantly, the need for the incentive and the likely benefits that might accrue from the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clare County Council submitted Shannon town as its first priority for the scheme and did an excellent integrated area plan.  Shannon town is unique in that it is the only town that does not have a shopping street.  The town was built mainly to provide housing for people working at the airport <Col N="285" /> and in the industrial estate and the town centre company, which owns the shopping centre, effectively decides who can operate retail outlets there.  To be fair, it has not taken undue advantage of its monopoly, but it is extremely undesirable that any private company should have such a monopoly and control.  A town the size of Shannon needs a shopping, cultural and social centre. This scheme provides an opportunity to build an entirely new streetscape, which I hope will be dealt with imaginatively.  Despite the fact that the town is on the verge of an international airport, nobody has seen fit to construct a main street in it.  The county council suggested an area in the centre of the town for designation which would be suitable for the creation of a shopping area.</P>
    <P>The extent of the scheme is limited.  There is a considerable need for urban and village renewal incentives for smaller towns and villages.  Various speakers mentioned traditional market towns in their constituencies which, because of developments in shopping and other areas, have gone into serious decline.  Miltown Malbay and Ennistymon in the west and north of County Clare were very important market towns but are now in a state of dereliction.  The same is true of Scariff and Tulla.  I agree with the expert advisory panel that this Bill may not be the correct context in which to set a scheme for such towns, but it should be addressed in the future.</P>
    <P>A study of the position in Ennistymon shows that only 12 of the 56 teachers employed in the town live in the immediate area, only two of the 23 gardaí stationed there live in the town or its periphery and only two of the 17 bank staff live in the immediate area.  Some 75 per cent of factory workers commute from places such as Ennis.  It is undesirable that the main towns in almost all counties are the focus for development and housing. While it makes some sense when the people who live in those towns also work in the area, it makes no sense in the case of Ennistymon which is approximately 15 miles from Ennis which is already under considerable development pressure. The living-over-the-shop scheme, which is in operation in Cork and particularly successful in Stanford in Lincolnshire, could be encouraged in relatively small towns and villages.</P>
    <P>When the 6,000 population guideline, about which there has been much criticism, was referred back to the expert advisory panel, it stuck to its guns on the basis that a certain minimum scale is required for the scheme to succeed.  While most people would accept that argument, towns such as Kilrush would lose out if this guideline were rigidly applied.  Because these towns were the focus of much development 20 or 30 years ago many industrial and commercial outlets and some living accommodation are in a state of dereliction. A strong case could be made for the inclusion of at least parts of such towns in this scheme.</P>
    <P>I understand a recent report suggested the need for a minimum of 30,000 new housing units per annum over the next ten years.  It has been suggested that figure could be as high as 40,000 <Col N="286" /> or more.  In Britain, John Prescott set a target of 60 per cent for new housing in existing or derelict urban areas.  We should develop derelict sites and under-utilised space in villages and towns and encourage people to live there.  This would ease the pressure on Cork, Galway and Dublin which needs to be addressed urgently.  It would also ease pressure on towns like Ennis which is gradually attracting people from all parts of County Clare and address the problem of ribbon development that is inevitable in circumstances where housing is not available.</P>
    <P>We will also need to provide incentives for rural and village life, which does not necessarily mean providing housing developments.  It will be interesting to monitor the development of the scheme introduced last year for counties along the upper Shannon region.</P>
    <P>In some respects the Bacon report is a very blunt weapon and there is already evidence of how it is working.  For example, rent for houses in Ennis which was running at approximately £480 per month has decreased to approximately £380.  The loss of stamp duty exemption, tax allowances and the 20 per cent capital gains tax is effectively driving those with plans for integrated tourist developments out of the market.  It will be necessary to police the effect of the changes made on foot of the Bacon report across a number of ministries to ensure they do not undermine desirable and necessary developments in the provision of tourist accommodation and so on.</P>
    <P>A strong argument is frequently made &mdash; I am sure it emanates from the Department of Finance &mdash; that schemes such as that proposed in the Bill should be narrowly focused to be successful.  That is not correct, particularly in the current economic climate when people have money to invest and broader schemes might be more successful. Neither do I agree with the view of the Department of Finance that these incentives are costly in the long term.  The enormous short term gains from taxation on materials and worker's wages do not seem to be taken into the equation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Killeen for sharing time with me and I welcome the opportunity to speak on the question of urban renewal and the proposed integrated area plans.  In the past urban renewal schemes were successful in that they achieved their objective, the structural renewal of towns, villages and cities throughout the country.  However, they did not take into account the social implications involved or the fact that people are the most important aspect of towns and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the current demographic trend, people are moving to cities and large towns where facilities and services are provided.  This will place enormous pressure on towns and major cities in the next few years.  For that reason, it is timely to amend the urban renewal schemes introduced in the past and examine the integrated area approach.  The overhead shop scheme, for example, has not been as successful as we would <Col N="287" /> have liked.  In parts of Cork it was not taken up to the extent we had hoped for.  I would like to see that scheme being extended with more incentives being given to developers to include that type of development.</P>
    <P>Cork Corporation has submitted two integrated area plans &mdash; one for Blackpool and the other for the harbour area.  Both of them are justified and would certainly enhance the living conditions of the communities within the areas of the proposed plans.  In addition, they would enhance the city giving it an opportunity to develop as well as bringing forward the services needed for tourism, colleges and local business.  Investors and businesses have been slow to move into certain sections of Cork city, even under the old urban renewal schemes but I hope they will now that we have larger areas in the integrated area plans.</P>
    <P>We must take into account people living within the districts covered by the integrated area plans. I welcome the inclusion of provisions for amenities, employment and training, and that local people will be involved at an early stage through the consultative process.</P>
    <P>I sound a note of caution, however; it is also necessary to consult developers because they will invest money in those areas.  They are willing to take the risks so they should be consulted at an early stage.  What might be very aspirational on paper concerning the integrated area plans may not always be sustainable from an economic point of view.  Developers should be approached about this.</P>
    <P>Skyscrapers have become part of the skyline of most major cities around the world, but not in Ireland where we seem to have a psychological block regarding such buildings.  Vast tracts of land have been developed here, particularly featuring office block accommodation to a height of three storeys.  I am not in favour of increasing the height of residential blocks but the height of office accommodation in our cities should be examined.  I see no reason we cannot progress and decide that, towards the end of the 20th century, we can build skyscrapers while still making architecture attractive and interesting.  The facades of modern buildings have become very mundane, although I know this is because of prohibitive cost.  We must examine the possibility of allowing developers to build higher office accommodation away from residential areas.  Such high rise developments have been successful in other cities throughout the world and I see no reason it should not happen here also.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome and timely.  We should change the aspect of urban renewal, taking into account people, communities and facilities available within the planned areas.  Cork's two integrated area plans should be examined, not in isolation but in tandem for the benefit of the whole city.  There is no point in looking at one plan without regarding the other.  Both of them merit inclusion.  They would have an immediate impact <Col N="288" /> on the city as these are the last two areas that need to be developed there.</P>
    <P>As regards the announcement by the Minister regarding the 3,000 square metre limit for retail space, many people have been considering that issue for some time.  They include small shop-keepers and their representative body, RGDATA, which has been lobbying intensely for that matter to be examined.  Ministerial announcements are very blunt instruments because they can have a possible impact on plans that are going through the planning process but may not yet have been completed.  One or two developments in Cork will suffer because of that. However, as they are part of the integrated area plan, they might come to fruition and could yet be successful.</P>
    <P>In making such an announcement, the Minister should have looked at individual planning applications that have gone through Cork Corporation, for example, and that could be lodged with An Bord Pleanála.  Such a decision could have a devastating effect on a developer's initial intention.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bacon report, which was published recently, will have an impact also.  Integrated area plans and urban renewal schemes have all been successful, but if people cannot afford housing within such designated areas we are back to the old problem of speculators buying accommodation and renting it out at enormous prices.  That has happened with past urban renewal schemes and I fear that urban areas could fall into disrepair and decay in the coming years if they are not monitored closely.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the proposals in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the broad principles of the Urban Renewal Bill.  It is the first time an integrated planning approach has been used as a basis for submissions.  I recognise the work of my colleague, the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and that of the former Minister of State, Deputy McManus, who published this report and laid down the criteria for this legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's introductory speech yesterday in which he gave his vision of how he sees this matter proceeding.  As a result of recommendations laid down, all county councils throughout the country set about preparing their development plans.  From the contributions that have been made on all sides of the House, it is obvious there are major areas of decay throughout the country where the Celtic tiger has neither been seen nor heard.  It is also obvious that there is a need for flexibility concerning the 6,000 population figure which would exclude many towns in need of rejuvenation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> In the limited amount of time available to me I will speak about my constituency of South Tipperary. As elected councillors, we employed professional consultants to independently assess the two towns chosen in South Tipperary &mdash; Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary.  We agreed unanimously to allow the consultants to make their recommendations and priorities independently of ourselves.</P>
    <P>The consultants were very thorough in carrying out research under the headings of need, potential, welfare and the balanced development of the county as a whole.  They also looked at the economic disadvantages, social deprivation and physical quality of the towns.  To achieve this information and arrive at their decision, they undertook widespread consultation that has been spoken about, but which was missing in some areas.  That involved the business sector, community groups, chambers of commerce, elected members from the county council &mdash; which was the formulating body &mdash; and the utmost consultation with the urban district councils involved. This all took place in South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>Other areas use different criteria and some councillors even voted to select their choice.  We did not adopt this attitude in Tipperary because, first, we wanted to comply with the criteria and, second, we wanted a plan that would pass the expert group established by the Minister.  We did not want to convey any political advantage.</P>
    <P>In Carrick-on-Suir, Fianna Fáil councillors criticised their own colleagues on the county council for not having used their voting power to have the decisions made in accordance with party political considerations.</P>
    <P>I want to give some idea as to why Tipperary town was prioritised before Carrick-on-Suir.  I also want to confirm that it is imperative that both towns be successful in their applications to the Minister for approval.</P>
    <P>Social and economic disadvantage is one of the areas covered in the document prepared by our consultants.  Six measures were used to describe economic disadvantage.  The first three related to: the position as it now is, in terms of the lack of job opportunity within the town; the lack of commuting to job opportunities, which were measured at more than five miles; and the level of commercial activity measured as the ratio of retail turnover per head of population.</P>
    <P>These indicators show that while Tipperary has a very high level of unemployment, travelling to work in locations elsewhere is lower, suggesting a double disadvantage: the lack of jobs within the town itself and within a reasonable commuting distance from the town.</P>
    <P>Both towns display relatively low levels of retail activity.  Although Tipperary town may have a greater amount of floor space from a retail point of view, the overall quality and range of shops in the town tends to be very poor and this has been confirmed by all the information and questionnaires circulated in the town.</P>
    <P>The three sets measured for economic disadvantage <Col N="290" /> relate to the changes of the position in the towns since 1985.  In each of the measures chosen, which relate to overall population change, loss of young potential workforce and change in manufacturing employment, Tipperary town showed the greatest possible disadvantage. The town now has a falling population losing nearly one in every five of its workforce and has lost an astonishing 57 per cent of its manufacturing capacity in the past seven years.  Apart from the population trend, loss of migration, young workers and changes in manufacturing, the loss was 60 per cent in Carrick-on-Suir compared to 76.9 per cent in Tipperary Town.</P>
    <P>The vision for the town has been devastated by the major loss of industry in recent years.  Its close proximity to the faster growing centres of Limerick City and Clonmel, which benefited from urban renewal, leaves it in shadow.  It is imperative for a town of the stature of Tipperary, a historical town, located on a traffic route, the national primary N24, and situated in a scenic area that the Minister, with his expert group, looks at this not in a partisan way but considering the absolute needs of not only these two towns but those mentioned by other speakers today.</P>

      <P>Coming from a town which has an application before the Department seeking urban renewal status and knowing the importance of such status for the town, I ask the Minister to ensure no fragmentation of application will be permitted.  Athy is the priority of Kildare County Council with Kildare town second and Kilcock third.  Such an application should be taken on its merits.  Urban renewal, on the evidence I have seen, is of paramount importance to the successful applicants.  The areas designated in the last application by my colleague, Deputy Stagg, have seen major investment in terms of residential and commercial development and it has greatly advanced the towns' success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Newbridge, County Kildare, has been transformed by hotels, shopping malls and residential development and is an example of how urban renewal can work extremely well and to the benefit of the community.  The downside of the scheme is possibly that the development of towns such as Mullingar, Athlone, Newbridge, etc., which have been granted urban renewal status has a detrimental effect on adjacent smaller towns.  These towns, while probably benefiting from schemes to beautify them rather than develop their potential, are vulnerable.  This time the Minister must ensure such towns are not bypassed and are given the chance to develop in their own right.  This will ensure that towns will, in many cases, be able to develop the natural resources in tandem with residential and commercial development.  Athy, for example, is a heritage town with magnificent natural resources in the River Barrow and the canal and will, if successful, be in a position to develop such resources by providing riverside restaurants, accommodation, a <Col N="291" /> marina and a hotel.  These are areas where development is vitally important.</P>
    <P>Last night on the Adjournment I raised the chronic unemployment problems which affect south Kildare and requested the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline her Department's plans to attract investment to south Kildare.  The Minister's response was disappointing. However, I hope my raising the matter will concentrate her mind on the problems facing south Kildare.  Inward investment is crucial to replace the hundreds of jobs the region has lost over the years.  Urban renewal can play a key role in attracting such investment.  Not only does the construction employment related to the rejuvenation of a town give a major boost to its local economy and especially to local traders, the elimination of dereliction and a new spirit of initiative which it engenders in the local community makes the town attractive to investment by major industrialists.</P>

      <P>In this Bill I have attempted to strike the right balance between the need to continue with tax incentives based urban renewal schemes and the need to ensure the benefits of urban renewal accrue to the many poorer communities in disadvantaged urban areas as well as new residents, investors and developers.  Many of the Deputies favoured this approach.</P>
      <P>The new integrated area plan approach will address not only issues of physical development but also the wider issues of local socio-economic benefit.  It requires local authorities to identify, following extensive consultation with local partners and the involvement of local communities, targeted focused sub-areas within the overall area covered by the plan which will qualify for urban renewal tax incentives.  It also requires them to justify the need for the incentives by reference to the objectives of the integrated area plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The identification of the gains to the community in terms of employment, development of the local economy, social housing and environmental improvement will contribute to addressing the concerns of the Government's national anti-poverty strategy.  The local authorities' selecting and prioritising the integrated area plans following consultation is an important step in highlighting for those local authorities and communities <Col N="292" /> the sense of ownership of the new schemes which should help ensure their success.</P>
    <P>We have, in combination with measures announced recently by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, ensured that conservation of the built environment will be a guiding principle in a strategy of any plan for core urban areas.  I am happy to give Deputy Howlin credit for initiating the process which has led to the statutory provisions before the House.  He and his colleague, Deputy McManus, commissioned the study by consultants which examined the effects of previous urban renewal schemes.  The consultants came up with the recommendation that urban renewal in the future should be built around broadly based strategic plans allowing for a more focused approach targeted on the areas of greatest need with greater selectivity in the application of incentives.  The report from the consultants was considered by the previous Government and details of the proposed new approach to urban renewal to come into effect after the present scheme expires were announced in May 1997.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I was somewhat surprised at the tone and nature of Deputy Dukes' response to the Bill's provisions.  The Bill, which is of an enabling nature, provides the statutory framework within which decisions on designation for urban renewal tax incentives will be taken in the future.  It sets out clearly the basis on which integrated area plans should be prepared, provides that such plans may contain or be accompanied by recommendations on designation to assist in achieving objectives of the plan, covers the role of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the process, links with the application of the tax incentives by the Minister for Finance under tax legislation and provides for the subsequent role of the local authority in terms of monitoring and reporting on the plan and certifying that developments qualifying for incentives are consistent with the objectives of the plan.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not and could not seek to be specific on the extent to which designation will be applied.  The application of incentives represents a cost to the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone. It is important we ensure maximum value for money and the best possible benefits in the application of public resources to supporting urban renewal objectives.  As a former Minister for Finance, I found Deputy Dukes' apparent inability to accept that the potential effect on the Exchequer is a relevant issue in considering the extent to which designation can be applied somewhat unexpected.</P>
    <P>The Bill's clearly laid out provisions are in sharp contrast with the provisions of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, under which it was at the discretion of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to designate any area in which he was satisfied there was a special need to <Col N="293" /> promote urban renewal.  Those provisions successfully withstood legal challenge in the past.  I have no reason to believe that the provisions before the House, which set out to achieve clear public socio-economic objectives, would not do likewise.  It is important to note that the tax incentives in future can be applied only in the context of integrated area plans.  The integrated area plan prepared on the basis of clearly defined criteria provides a basis on which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may make his recommendations and on which the incentives may be applied by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Howlin's support for the new approach to urban renewal in which we are engaged.  I assure him that my commitment to ensuring the benefits of urban renewal accrue to the wider community is one which it is my intention to deliver.  Deputy Howlin suggested there may be some deficiencies in the Bill in terms of the role of county councils in the process, transparency in decisions in relation to designation, the absence of a right of appeal and lack of consultation. I assure the Deputy and members of urban district councils throughout the country that pitching the role of making the initial decision in relation to the areas for which integrated area plans should be prepared at county level does not reflect in any way on either urban district councils or their members.  However, for strategic reasons, related to balance and perspective in the context of the whole county, it made sense that the initial decision on the area to select should be made at county level.  With the best will in the world it would be unreasonable to expect an urban district council to bring an overall strategic view of the county's needs to a county based decision-making process.</P>
    <P>Although not included in this initial selection process, borough corporations and urban district councils were expected to participate fully in the process of subsequently preparing the integrated area plan.  An extensive consultation process is clearly provided for in the guidelines on preparing integrated area plans.  The extent to which this took place will be an important factor in the assessment process of integrated area plans which is now under way.  A few Deputies referred to a lack of consultations in their areas.  That is a matter of which I will take careful note not only in relation to their areas but in relation to all applications to ensure that the consultation process which was clearly laid out in the guidelines did take place.</P>
    <P>Deputies Howlin and Gilmore raised an issue regarding ongoing discussions with the European Union.  In May 1997 the European Commission wrote to the Irish authorities about the enterprise areas scheme, which is a subset of the urban renewal scheme.  The reason for its writing was the extension of the enterprise area scheme in the 1987 Finance Act to the regional airports and the attendant press publicity at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>After prolonged discussions and examination, the Commission approved the enterprise areas designated in the 1987 Finance Act last December but retained the right to examine each airport, enterprise zone designation on a case by case basis as they arose.  As a result of these developments it has become necessary to obtain European Union Commission approval for the new urban renewal scheme and the new rural renewal scheme, both of which will have to be notified to it.</P>
      <P>The Commission is examining a proposal regarding the extension of the capital allowances for buildings in the wider Custom House Docks area beyond January 1999.  Apart from some transitional cases, it will also be necessary to notify the European Commission about the tax reliefs in the wider Dublin docklands area.  European Union Commission approval is not needed in the case of tax reliefs for residential accommodation. However, a problem has recently emerged in regard to the continued availability of the double rent relief for tenants of buildings in all tax designated areas in the context of the new European Union regional aid guidelines which are to come into force.</P>
      <P>The Commission officials consider that this relief is not compatible with the new guidelines in the context of Ireland's improved economic position and, therefore, should not be granted, except in limited cases.  The European Union Commission's objections are not expected to arise in the case of the capital allowances for commercial and industrial reasons but these will be subject to the aid intensity ceilings, arising in 1999, under the new regional aid guidelines. There are still many issues which will have to be resolved between ourselves and the European Commission before we can state clearly what the extent and level of tax incentives will be.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the population figure.  I am conscious that Deputies have more than one town in their constituencies. This figure was included merely as a guideline indicative of the scale of urban area likely to meet the criteria for the new scheme.  We are talking about urban renewal, not village or small town renewal.  A certain scale of development is necessary in an area to meet all the criteria in relation to an urban area.  No town will be excluded purely on the basis of population.  All the criteria spelled out in the guidelines will be taken into consideration.  Having said that, there are areas that warrant a high level of consultation, on the other hand in most areas there was a satisfactory level of consultation.  I commend the local authorities that took the trouble to ensure as many people as possible had a role and participated in the consultation in regard to what was finally agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised the question of grants to support the integrated area plan objectives.  I have already spelled out the thinking of the non-availability of grants in reply to Parliamentary <Col N="295" /> Question No. 40 on 6 May, tabled by his colleague, Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    <P>I am interested in what was said about social housing because the guidelines for the new scheme &mdash; Deputy Gilmore and a number of others referred to this &mdash; refer specifically to the synergy within other area based plans, including those of area based partnerships.  It is clear that the integrated area plans are not concerned only with physical renewal.  It is a requirement set out in the guidelines that generally at least 15 per cent of the additional housing in an integrated area plan must be social housing.  Housing incentives will only be applied where essential, taking account of market conditions.  Deputy Browne referred to the fact that some of the towns designated under the old scheme were left in a half finished state.  He referred to Wexford, his own constituency.  Wexford submitted plans for New Ross and Gorey.  However, there was nothing to prevent a local authority submitting an integrated area plan for a town which had designation under the old scheme, if it chose to prioritise such a town.  Many have done so.  The new scheme was bound to cause some reaction from developers, a matter to which he referred.  Their reaction would probably be inspired by the social agenda this scheme is seeking to address as opposed to the previous property-led nature of earlier urban schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes raised the interesting point that if the Oireachtas was to reject the Bill or to make some fundamental changes to it, what would be the position?  Fundamental changes in the Bill probably would cause difficulties in relation to integrated area plans already submitted.  The net effect of this would be to postpone indefinitely the introduction of any new urban renewal scheme when the present scheme expires effectively on 31 July.  I did grant an extension to 31 December to facilitate completion of schemes in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>The process of preparing integrated area plans was initiated by the previous Government.  I have given credit to the fact that the Bill was initiated by the Rainbow Government in May 1987.  While the legislation may be catching up with what has happened in preparing plans, it also covers many matters that have yet to be decided.  I am pleased with the warm reception for the Bill.  I recognise the process was started by the previous Government. I brought it before the new Government in the first few weeks after coming to office and it got approval to proceed along similar lines.  I hope there will be agreement on Committee Stage because initiatives were taken in putting forward guidelines.  We do not want to lose time between one scheme and the next &mdash; we want continuity when the existing urban scheme expires and the new scheme take its place.  That was the purpose of advising local authorities in advance of the legislation being passed.  There are plenty of precedents for what we are doing but if the Bill is not passed all bets are off.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the information in the report published in February, and a great deal of other information, the interdepartmental committee of the implementation group was set up. A major element of the action programme arising out of that is to increase awareness in this area. The committee has set about a comprehensive programme not just to address the question of the number of men and women using IT but to increase awareness of it.</P>
      <P>The commission launched a widespread public awareness campaign in conjunction with many other organisations.  It availed of commercial sponsorship opportunities and highlighted the benefits the information society would bring to the lives of ordinary people.  It tried to prove that it was not simply a case of high technology in the workplace but that other benefits would accrue from the use of technology.  The survey showed that people were unaware of these benefits.  They did not believe information technology was relevant to their everyday lives.</P>
      <P>The commission has attempted to build on the positive aspects highlighted in the original survey of the steering committee.  In addition, it works with initiatives already in place to reach target groups and learning organisations, including community bodies.  It is working on small and medium enterprises because the research has shown that SMEs do not see that information technology is relevant to them.  The commission has also targeted major opinion leaders and the general public, including minority groups.  All that work is useful.  The commission is trying to convince people that awareness of information technology is important.</P>
      <P>Having attended a number of meetings, read the research extensively and listened to presentations, it is obvious the commission will not succeed in its work overnight.  It will take some time before the IT programme launched by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, and myself before Christmas will result in large numbers of people being aware of the relevance of information technology.  The Information Society Commission is adamant that it can dramatically increase the figures given and I believe it will succeed.</P>

If a <Col N="298" /> survey across the secretarial and administrative grades were carried out, it would be obvious that a far higher percentage of women have been involved in IT from the days of the ribbon typewriters to word processors and on to computers. That is the simple answer.  Surveys carried out across the crafts industries indicate that people are not using technology of any kind.  That is the reason for the imbalance in the figures.  Surveys carried out of the banking, insurance, architectural and other sectors where technology is used indicate that the proportion of men who do not experience any difficulty with technology is as high as the figure for women.  It is only when one takes the overall workforce that there is an imbalance in the figures.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>As Taoiseach and Head of Government, I have a leadership role and a corresponding involvement in major policy areas and this is reflected in my Department's statement of strategy.  In this context, Ireland's participation in the third stage of economic and monetary union from 1 January 1999 has been taken fully into account in the development of national economic and social policy and was a central concern in the negotiation of Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic and social policy division in my Department assists me in my role as Head of Government by ensuring that the relevant key objectives of Government policy are pursued and achieved.  These objectives are set out in the Government's programme, An Action Programme <Col N="299" /> for the Millennium, and in Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The principal activities of the division derive from monitoring the implementation of Partnership 2000 through convening quarterly meetings with the social partners and the production of progress reports.  This is done in close co-operation with the relevant Departments.  The division also fosters the co-ordination of measures across Departments and agencies to ensure quality service delivery in the context of Partnership 2000. This is achieved through participation in a number of cross-departmental groups, the convening of special meetings and the production of policy papers.</P>
    <P>Issues where the division has taken certain specific initiatives in the recent past relate to the work of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, the development of Government policy on the information society, the future development of the International Financial Services Centre and the study of proposals for a basic income.</P>
    <P>A satisfactory outcome in the negotiations on Agenda 2000, particularly the next round of Structural Funds, are priorities central to the work of the European and international affairs division of the Department.  The division plays a key co-ordinating role in developing the national approach on the Agenda 2000 negotiations.  The fact that it provides the secretariat to the Ministers and Secretaries General group on EU policy is of particular importance in this regard.</P>

What has been stated is that there are two options in discussions: one is to retain Objective one status for the entire country for the transition period; the other is to subdivide the country if it is advantageous.  Two things must be determined for the latter to happen: one is Commission approval because subdivision is not automatically allowed; the other is that it must be ensured the country gains overall in monetary terms.  It is not clear that would happen, it is a negotiating card we can use in the process at this stage.  We have not declared which stance we will adopt and neither have other countries.</P>

      <P>We will have Objective one status in the transition period but it will not be the same as it was before because Ireland has exceeded the qualifying GNP figure.  The country could be subdivided and surveys have been done on this in the Department of Finance.  I first initiated such surveys in 1994.  Regions could be prioritised for the old style Objective one status. That is something we will bear in mind in the negotiating period.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept his party is engaged in naked hypocrisy on this issue? The Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad has tabled a motion to the effect that Objective one status should be retained for the west, the midlands and the Border and there is no mention of the other option the Taoiseach mentioned.  His party in the west advocates Objective one status for the region indefinitely and not on a transitional basis and his entire party advocated that stance before the election.  The Taoiseach is now telling the House that there are options and that he has not made up his mind on the matter.  Is it possible that the schizophrenic attitude between Fianna Fáil in Cabinet and in the Seanad might be resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I object.  Deputy Bruton has little experience of this kind of negotiation as he was not involved in the negotiations in 1989 and 1993.  I handled both very successfully for the country and I will do the same with this one.  It would be awfully foolish and it is something that only Deputy Bruton would do to declare our negotiating stance in advance.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, in reply to a question from Deputy Bruton, stated that in the course of the transition period, whatever duration that may be, the country will have Objective one status.  Will the Taoiseach clarify that?  Has the Commission already signalled that the country will have Objective one status or that it will be subject to a transitional process based on that status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we will not have Objective one status because we no longer qualify under the relevant criteria.  We will either have an amended Objective one status for either the entire country or for certain parts of it.  We will not receive the same amounts of funding.  There will be a transitional arrangement which will not grant as much funding as when we had Objective one status. There is no name for it yet but it will not be the old style Objective one status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean the comment the Taoiseach inadvertently made earlier that the country will have Objective one status in the next period of Structural Funds is incorrect and that there will be either Objective one status for parts of the country or an overall transitional system for the country as a whole?  Does he agree that the point of the motion tabled by Fianna Fáil in the Seanad is precisely to obtain a separate advantageous arrangement for the west and not <Col N="301" /> the national arrangement to which the Taoiseach refers?  Does he also agree that, if Objective one status is retained for the west, it will be to the cost of the rest of the country, but that that is precisely what the Fianna Fáil Senators seek?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe I am answering questions on Seanad motions.  I want to state the Government's negotiating position.  Owing to Ireland's economic success, we will no longer qualify under the criteria for Objective one status. However, the Commission proposes a lengthy transition period which it is hoped will last until 2006, although there will only be a four year period for Cohesion Funds.  However, as the Deputy knows, there is considerable difficulty with that. A number of member states do not accept that countries which have joined economic and monetary union should have Cohesion Funds.  I do not believe that will stand up to analysis but it is a negotiating position.  On the basis of Commission proposals, we will continue to receive a significant amount of funding until 2006 under the Objective one envelope or whatever it will be called in future.  Our key objective is to ensure the maximum level of funding is obtained for Ireland and my negotiating stance in discussions with different Heads of State and with the Commission is to see what exactly is their negotiating stance and what it is likely to be over the next year.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, it is unlikely negotiations will be completed quickly.  Little happened in Cardiff other than to set the timetable and some of the crucial criteria.  Matters should have progressed towards the final arguments by the Vienna summit in December.  The special German summit in March will wrap it up.  That is how it is operating.  No one is likely to concede anything this side of the Vienna summit, so we will have to decide in the final negotiations what is best for us.  We must argue that, despite good economic figures, we still have an infrastructural deficit and then see how best that stance can be maximised.  That means either opting for the transitional period up to 2006 or subdividing the country, if that can be agreed.  Some say this will be easily agreed but I do not believe that to be the case.  However, if it was agreed it might be advisable for us to go down that road and take out some regions such as the Border and the west. That would exclude other areas where there is considerable social disadvantage.  Other member states have the same difficulty.  Yesterday I met Prime Minister Guterres who has the same problem with Lisbon which is at 88 per cent and will be ruled out.  It is a matter for each country as to how they approach the negotiations.  I will not concede our strategy at this stage.</P>

      <P>While it is important to maximise the assistance for Ireland, it would be grossly improper to abandon those urban areas which are seriously disadvantaged in pursuit of a lobby from the west.  Presumably they believe <Col N="302" /> their case but there is serious concern, particularly in greater Dublin, that the Structural, Cohesion and Social Funds will no longer be available to Dublin where ten of the 11 most disadvantaged areas are located.</P>

      <P>We have always had Objective one status for the entire country.  That is still the case.  Arguments are made by other organisations which I will not outline.  Some of these arguments have considerable merit but there are downsides for other regions.  We have to see what is best and the decision we make must be for the entire country.  Some argue that one could get more by going the other way.  I argue that if we have Objective one status only for a transitional period and hold Cohesion Funds for the entire island, that is hard to beat in monetary terms.  There is much negotiating to be done.  The commission's documents of last autumn and 18 March are not the full picture.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: With regard to Ireland's entry to EMU, is the Taoiseach's Department preparing for some of the likely scenarios which will result, in particular, the fact that the traditional bail out methods in times of economic crisis, such as devaluation, will not be allowed?  Budget deficits will be pegged and public borrowing strictly controlled.  With that regime already in place inflation is beginning to rise and may rise further next year.  What preparations is the Department making for this situation?  Will there be a return to the attempt to squeeze the public sector and the wages and conditions of workers, particularly public service workers, to squeeze more productivity without rewards?  Why should workers co-operate with that when successive Governments have failed to prevent racketeering in the building industry and the housing <Col N="303" /> market which has put a modest house out of the reach of an ordinary worker?  Will the Taoiseach comment on the contradictions involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounded like a Second Stage speech on the Economic and Monetary Union Bill which will be before the House next week.  The criteria were fixed under the Maastricht Treaty which was voted on by the people. The subsequent discussions and arrangements for removing measures such as competitive devaluations are part of what we must live with and work to.  We have done so for many years.  We fulfilled the criteria in most years in the past decade. Pressures will always arise because of economic cycles.  They have been a reality for the past 290 years since 1700.  There will be ups and downs in the economic cycle in the future and it is clear what mechanisms are and are not available.  We will have to live within the expenditures and incomes policies and whatever policies are put forward by Governments in their financial statements. That is how we will have to order matters. I am sure these matters will change as time goes on.  That is what we signed up to in economic and monetary union.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the negotiating strategy of leaving open until Vienna the option of whether to go for transitional Objective one status for the whole country or whether to sub-regionalise the country to maintain indefinite status for some regions, means that he is choosing the transitional option for the whole country?  It will not be possible to obtain indefinite Objective one status without establishing the area and a system of government separate from central Government well in advance.  If the Taoiseach pursues the strategy of leaving it all until Vienna he is giving up on the option of retaining Objective one status for the west, the midlands and the Border areas.</P>

Each Minister carefully monitors progress to date within his or her Department and gives an account to Cabinet of objectives achieved or work in hand towards achieving those objectives.

He gives a regular account to the Cabinet and to me of the commitments which have yet to be achieved and the place in line with each commitment.

      <P>A partnership committee was established in my Department in May this year.  It is chaired by the Secretary General and comprises four members of senior management and five union representatives. The committee membership will be expanded at a later date to include members of staff at all levels.</P>
      <P>The function of the committee is to draw up and oversee the implementation of an action programme for the Department.  This action programme will be the primary mechanism for putting in place, on an agreed basis, the changes necessary for the successful implementation of the Department's strategy statement and the programme of modernisation being developed centrally under SMI.  The 2 per cent local bargaining provision under Partnership 2000 is dependent on verifiable progress being achieved in the implementation of this action programme.</P>

    <P>As the partnership committee has just been established, it is not possible to anticipate at this stage the precise targets and results which are to be achieved under the action programme.  Before finalising the programme's content, the partnership committee will consult widely in the Department. However, it is expected that the general issues to be dealt with will include quality customer service; human resource and performance <Col N="309" /> management; training and development; new financial management systems; information technology and infrastructural issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>I met Prime Minister Blair in Government Buildings on Monday, 1 June 1998 to discuss a wide range of European issues in the run up to the European Summit in Cardiff on 15-16 June. Prime Minister Blair came to Dublin in his capacity as President of the European Council. His visit formed part of his tour of EU capitals in advance of the summit.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity to welcome Mr. Blair on his first visit as Prime Minister to Dublin and I indicated my intention to ask the Dáil and Seanad to extend an invitation to Mr. Blair to come to Ireland in the autumn to address a joint sitting of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Prime Minister said he would be happy to accept.  The Prime Minister and I had a brief discussion before dinner when we took the opportunity to review the outcome of the referenda, both North and South, and looked forward to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in a balanced and comprehensive way.</P>
      <P>At the meeting which took place over dinner, the key items on the Cardiff agenda were discussed. These included the Agenda 2000 negotiations, the broad economic guidelines for the Union and the national employment action plans. Other issues covered were the progress being made in relation to the Union's policies on drugs and organised crime.  We also discussed EU enlargement and the shape of the Union, including the European institutions, in the new millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the likely discussions at Cardiff in relation to the Agenda 2000 negotiations, I outlined <Col N="310" /> Ireland's position on the Commission's current proposals on Structural and Cohesion Funds. I emphasised the need for generous transitional arrangements for Ireland under the Structural Funds.  I also restated Ireland's opposition to the current Commission proposals for CAP reform and the Government's intention to pursue real improvements on the terms on offer.  Prime Minister Blair and I also exchanged views on a number of key international issues, including the Middle East and Kosovo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has acted on the suggestion made by Deputy De Rossa and supported by Deputy Quinn and myself to extend an invitation to Prime Minister Blair to address this House.  What outcome does the Taoiseach expect from Cardiff on the various points that were mentioned?  Does he expect any substantive decisions to be taken or will it be a parking exercise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of issues on which the President of the Council, Prime Minister Blair, would like to see progress.  As I said earlier, I do not believe much progress will be made on Agenda 2000 other than on time scales, setting down broad guidelines and reporting on the negotiations at this stage, but I do not believe there will be anything major in regard to conclusions.  A discussion on the broad economic guidelines for the Union should give a clear indication of where we will be going in the next period and I believe there will be substantial conclusions from that.  The national employment action plans have been received and analysed by the Presidency and it will put forward best practice in terms of what we should be doing to further reduce the high level of unemployment in the community and to address difficulties in that area compared to other blocs throughout the world.</P>
      <P>I suspect there will be quite an amount of discussions on security issues.  The Kosovo issue took up most of the discussion of the General Affairs group on Monday and it will probably take up a substantial amount of time.  There will be some brief discussion on the Good Friday Agreement and on a number of other issues.  I believe they will be the main items covered. There was a summit in Avignon between Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac at which they put forward a letter, which effectively is a paper, on issues of subsidiarity, on what will happen after the Amsterdam Treaty has been ratified and what institutional changes should be considered. That matter will also be discussed.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach arrange, as in the normal way, an opportunity for statements on the summit next week?  This question relates to some extent to the Taoiseach's <Col N="311" /> meeting with Prime Minister Blair in Dublin and his statement that he hoped we could adopt common positions, as between Ireland and Britain, within the European Union.  While closer relations between Britain and Ireland are welcome in many instances, a common position with Britain in the European Union would be to the disadvantage to the population of this State.  I am thinking in particular of budgetary matters.  To tie the Agenda 2000 budget to 1.27 per cent of GDP would be disastrous for an enlarged Union.  Will the Taoiseach press for a revision of that figure this weekend?  Will he resist the attempts by Chancellor Kohl and others to seek rebates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Prime Minister mentioned two or three issues in particular, one of which was BSE, in regard to which there will, I hope, be some development today.  Other matters related to security, Northern Ireland, drugs, etc.  He was not in any way asking me to be tied in to any substantive issues, something we would be totally against.  His point is that every time we meet, as was the case with our predecessors, there has effectively been a one item agenda with other items only discussed on the margins.  He said that as we moved forward there is more to the islands <Col N="312" /> than one issue, something I totally agree with.  I look forward to being able to meet the British Prime Minister to talk about something other than the ongoing security situation in Northern Ireland.</P>

Did the Taoiseach raise with the Prime Minister the pollution of the Irish Sea by radioactive waste or the dumping of phosphorus bombs in it which have been washed up on the Irish coast?  These are matters we could usefully deal with on a bilateral basis.</P>
      <P>Regarding the summit in Cardiff, does the Taoiseach propose raising either during it or on the margins the failure of the Minister for Finance to gain representation for Ireland in the senior management of the European Central Bank and will he try to reverse that disaster?</P>

      <P>I understand the Economic and Monetary Institute transferred its 49 full time staff members to the European Central Bank.  There are six other members, including three Irish staff who are alternates.  The Governor of the Central Bank is on the executive committee of the bank.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The advent of economic and monetary union from 1999 will require adherence by all participating countries to strict budgetary discipline as set out in the stability and growth pact.  The Government is fully committed to pursuing the necessary budgetary policies to help achieve and sustain the stable economic conditions which are essential to the success of the single currency.  Prudent management of public expenditure will play a crucial role in this process.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to managing public expenditure in a way which will seek to maintain firm control on the growth in overall spending while ensuring that adequate additional resources are targeted at addressing the many problems of disadvantage in society which continue to require attention.  The Government's policy as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium is to limit net current spending growth to 4 per cent and capital spending growth to 5 per cent on average up to 1999 and to reduce overall Government spending as a share of national output.</P>
      <P>In my budget speech I said the task of achieving the Government target of limiting the increase in net current spending to 4 per cent on average will be challenging.  The projections of expenditure on a no policy change basis in the period 1998 to 2000 published with the budget, which showed an average annual increase of 3.8 per cent, were within the Government target and the increase in 1999 was projected to be 4.8 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Government fully recognises that, with the projected average increase on the basis of unchanged policies running close to the 4 per cent programme limit, holding to that limit while at the same time implementing new policy commitments as set out in its programme will not be easy.  It will require making choices in allocating resources so that the additional costs of new or expanded services are met within the average annual limit of 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>The proposed move to a full system of multi-annual budgeting with effect from the 1999 budget which I spoke of in my 1998 Budget Statement should help in this regard.  This will involve the Government making decisions for resource allocation over a three year period covering the main budgetary aggregates.  Voted expenditure, current and capital, would be disaggregated into financial envelopes for ministerial Vote groups.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These will be the amounts allocated to Departments for the three years and within which they will be expected to contain their spending, including the cost of any new policies or improvements in existing services.  The comprehensive programme <Col N="314" /> of expenditure reviews being carried out as part of a three year programme under the strategic management initiative should also assist in making decisions on priorities within and between spending programmes.</P>
    <P>The communiqué issued on behalf of EU Finance Ministers and Central Bank governors last March following the revaluation of the Irish pound's central rate in the ERM noted &ldquo;the firm resolve of the Irish authorities not to exceed the expenditure commitments in the 1998 budget and to ensure that any revenues above those anticipated in the budget are used to raise the primary surplus, and thus the general government surplus, above the planned figures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Commission's recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the member states and the Community, states that &ldquo;in view of the present strong growth of the [Irish] economy and the possibility of overheating, any revenues received over and above those anticipated in the 1998 budget should be used to raise the budget surplus.  Moreover, a tight fiscal stance is required in Ireland to reduce the risk of overheating.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am monitoring expenditure trends this year and aim to hold expenditure close to the budget provision.  My statement on the end of March Exchequer returns said that spending in the first quarter was broadly in line with expectations.  It is my intention that tax revenues in excess of the budget provision should have the effect of increasing the budget surplus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister indicating that the financial envelope for 1999 on the current side will provide for 4.8 per cent growth?  Will he be sticking to a no policy change framework for the 1999 spending Estimates?  If he is not willing to commit to that figure, does it mean the Government will be bringing forward extra spending to 1999 at a time when the economy is allegedly moving towards overheating, thereby restricting and undermining the opportunity of using fiscal policy to slow down economic growth?</P>

      <P>In my Budget Statement of 3 December I said it was the intention of the Government to abide by its commitment in its programme which sets the limits for net current spending to an average annual increase of 4 per cent over the period.  In this context the figure for 1999 on a no policy change basis will be 4.8 per cent.  The commitment in the Government's programme is to an annual average increase in net current spending over the period.</P>

      <P>We should not fool ourselves. Is it not true that the Minister will present to his EU colleagues on 1 July indications of his financial strategy for 1999?  He must surely be in a position to tell the House whether the figure will be 4 per cent or 4.8 per cent in 1999.  It is not <Col N="315" /> acceptable for the Minister to fudge issues which must be central to his budgetary strategy.</P>
      <P>Regarding the use of the surplus, the Minister has made a commitment in 1998 that the surplus will only be used for debt reduction.  As indicated in the communiqué from Europe of 1 May, has the Minister also made a commitment that any surplus in 1999 will be used solely for debt reduction?  Does this curtail his ability to offer tax relief in 1999?</P>

      <P>The statement following the meeting of 1 May repeated the words used in the communiqué issued in mid March on foot of the 3 per cent aggregate revaluation.  It sets out the Government's commitment to a budgetary policy of keeping down inflation and the use of any unanticipated revenue arising in 1998 to increase the primary surplus rather than to increase expenditure.  This formed part of the broad economic guidelines at the ECOFIN meeting.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to abide by the commitments set out in the programme for Government, those given to the Commission and those in the communiqué on revaluation.  This means not doing anything which would overheat the economy or exacerbate inflationary pressures.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>

      <P>While it is true I did not manage to convince all my ECOFIN colleagues or the EU Commission to change from their long-standing opposition to carrying out a study of the effects of ending intra-community duty free sales from 30 June 1999, I did manage to get support from a considerable number of member states. These included France and Germany, for the first time at ECOFIN, and this was a very welcome development.</P>
      <P>While I will continue to work to change this decision by seeking to influence my colleagues and the Commission, I have not yet finally decided on the best approach to follow in the light of the outrun of the ECOFIN discussion on the subject.</P>
      <P>One substantive problem is that this issue has been closely associated with Ireland because of the strong efforts we alone have made to have the decision reversed and a further Irish initiative at Council level is unlikely to be greatly welcomed. It would be far better, for presentational purposes, if a further Council initiative came from one of the larger member states, perhaps one of those recently persuaded to come over to our position.  I will check if there are any plans by other member states to reopen discussions.</P>
      <P>At my press conference after ECOFIN, I stressed that substantial problems lay with those member states which were still opposed.  Much useful work can still be done by trade and employee interests in those states working to influence Ministers and politicians.  In some cases, ferry operators and other interests may not have succeeded in making their case as vigorously as might be expected.</P>
      <P>Further discussion with some of the strongest opponents in the months ahead might be the appropriate option.  Perhaps the issue should be taken up again only when the Commission document, which they promised at ECOFIN, becomes available.  This may help demonstrate the scope for member states to intervene is fairly limited and, therefore, help to reopen the issue.</P>

Is it not the case that, if an issue is of crucial national importance, we should avail of every opportunity to publicise it and make a nuisance of ourselves if necessary?

      <P>It is as a result of pressure from Ireland that this matter has been revisited at all. The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, was in a very influential position as President of <Col N="317" /> the Council of Ministers and he listed the issue of duty free sales as a lunchtime item at a meeting of ECOFIN.  Although he was much respected by his colleagues, he was, to say the least, met with deafening silence on the issue.</P>
      <P>It is due to pressure exerted by this Administration and the fact that we have made a nuisance of ourselves that the matter has been revisited at all.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, succeeded in encouraging the majority of her Transport Council colleagues to urge their ECOFIN colleagues to discuss the matter again.  I succeeded in getting the matter back on the ECOFIN agenda and more countries, including influential states such as France and Germany, have come round to Ireland's position. I stated clearly at the post-ECOFIN press conference that it would be better if another country could take up the reins at this stage.  Although I intend to revisit the matter, I expressed my view to the Irish duty free lobby that it should seek to convince its colleagues in other countries to persuade their politicians to make a bigger issue of this matter.</P>

      <P>When Ireland commenced its onslaught in regard to duty free sales it had no support at all.  At the time of the most recent ECOFIN Council, we had succeeded in gaining the support of major countries such as France and Germany.  It is true the Nordic countries are still strongly supposed to reopening this matter. However, I understand views on the matter are very evenly balanced in some other countries.  I know of one colleague whose Cabinet is split 50-50 on the matter.  Much progress has been made on this issue in a short period but it will be difficult to reverse the decision.</P>
      <P>The issue falls within the Commission's remit and a proposal on it must issue from it.  Even if that happens, it will require a unanimous decision on the part of the 15 member states to have the matter reversed.  I have never tried to give the impression that the matter will be easily resolved.</P>

      <P>The total Government package announced on 23 April, including the taxation elements contained in the Finance (No. 2) Act, must be assessed by reference to the policy goals set out at that time.  The goals which the Government <Col N="318" /> identified are: to increase the supply of serviced land; to reduce excess investor demand; and to assist ordinary house purchasers, thus defusing the house price spiral and increasing the affordability of housing.</P>
      <P>At this stage, it is too early to measure the effectiveness of the Government package. However, early indications, based on recent media reports, suggest that recent residential units coming to the market are being purchased almost exclusively by owner-occupiers, whereas in the past a substantial percentage of such units would have been sold to investors.  The impact of these measures will be kept under review both by my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister intend to put in place any systematic monitoring in co-operation with the CSO or others in respect of investor purchases and rent levels?  Many people are concerned that the impact of the changes on investors will result in higher rent levels.  Is the Minister monitoring those who benefit from lower stamp duties?  There is a legitimate fear the benefit will be passed on to the sellers rather than the buyers.  What specific statistical data are being collected to ensure this policy is working?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The gathering of such information is primarily a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the CSO.  The issue of lower stamp duties was discussed in depth on Committee Stage of the original Finance Bill and the Deputy may want to read the comments I made at that stage.  The Finance (No. 2) Act was introduced on foot of the Bacon report.  The Bacon report must be taken in its totality.  Bacon suggests that, taken together, all the measures will have an intended distorting effect on the market at this time.  In the longer run, house prices will be determined by supply and demand.  Bacon recommended and the Government agreed that the incentives to the investor were too great and were forcing owner occupiers out of the market.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the effect of the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  The only evidence I can offer is the anecdotal evidence published in some newspapers which appears to suggest that the owner occupier now has a better chance of competing. However, in the longer term it is a matter of supply and demand.  We tried on this occasion to distort the market to give the owner occupier a better chance of succeeding in that market.</P>

He should have agreed a <Col N="319" /> system with the CSO and the Central Bank for monitoring the extent to which the stamp duty benefits go to home buyers, lending policies are conforming with prudence, prices are reducing and rents are stabilising.

      <P>On 16 December 1997, the Tribunal of Inquiry (Payments to Messrs.  Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry) served on order for production on me, as Minister for Finance, relating to documents pertaining to the operation of exchange controls in the years 1954 to 1993 inclusive.  This production order also covered the Central Bank.  The Central Bank was delegated responsibility for the day to day operation of exchange controls with effect from 3 May 1965.</P>
      <P>This order did not specify any particular file or document and required that all documents be produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the order for production was received, I immediately wrote to the Governor and authorised the Central Bank to take all the steps necessary to comply with the order.  I also directed my Department to ensure that all relevant documents <Col N="320" /> should be produced and that every assistance should be given to the tribunal.  The process followed by the Department in relation to the production order was one which was adopted in consultation with legal advice, with a view to offering the maximum assistance to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Despite the most strenuous efforts on the part of the Department, it has not been possible to locate some of the files listed on the Department's register of files relating to the operation of exchange controls for the period in question. A listing of the files covered by the order for production together with a listing of those files which have not been located was forwarded to the Tribunal of Inquiry (Payments to Messrs.  Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry) on 30 April 1998.</P>
    <P>On 6 May 1998, in order to allay public concerns and having taken legal advice, I made public the list of files which have not yet been located.  This listing gave the details of 130 files which have not yet been located and of 12 incomplete files.  I also forwarded a copy of this list to the three main Opposition spokespersons on Finance. No further files have been located since this list was published on 6 May and the list remains valid.  I have advised the tribunal that the files which have been located have been secured and remain available for inspection at its convenience and that officials of the Department of Finance remain at the disposal of the tribunal to assist it further.</P>
    <P>During 1997 my Department had begun the development of a new computerised file classification and file tracking system, the purpose of which is to track the movements of files and identify their whereabouts at any given time.  Work on this system is now well advanced and it is expected to be fully operational over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works is currently preparing plans for the upgrading of the Department's main file storage area in Government Buildings. It is hoped that this work, which will improve the storage and retrieval of files, will commence later this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department is currently in the process of engaging contractors to conduct an independent professional inventory of departmental files opened since 1948.  The purpose of this inventory is to confirm the existence and whereabouts of all files opened over the past 50 years.  This exercise, which it is envisaged will take about three months, will include the transmission to the National Archives of those files which should have been archived previously.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will significantly improve existing filing standards in the Department.</P>

      <P>The communiqué issued on behalf of EU Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors following the meeting on 14 March 1998, at which the revaluation of the Irish pound's central rate in the ERM was decided, included the following statement:</P>
      <P>The ministers and governors noted the firm resolve of the Irish authorities not to exceed the expenditure commitments in the 1998 budget and to ensure that any revenues above those anticipated in that budget are used to raise the primary surplus, and thus the general government surplus, above the planned figures.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Commission's recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the member states and the Community, a revised text of which was unanimously agreed at the meeting of ECOFIN on Friday, 5 June 1998, states that &ldquo;in view of the present strong growth of the [Irish] economy and the possibility of overheating, any revenues received over and above those anticipated in the 1998 budget should be used to raise the budget surplus.  Moreover, a tight fiscal stance is required in Ireland to reduce the risk of overheating&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Both the broad economic guidelines and the communiqué acknowledged the Government's commitment to a budgetary strategy geared towards maintaining stable, non-inflationary growth.  I intend to deliver fully on this commitment. Along with the revaluation of the Irish pound, the Government's policy on spending will help to ensure that any unwelcome additions to demand and inflationary pressures in the economy are avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to 1998 expenditure, I will continue to monitor the position closely during the year. In consultation with my Cabinet colleagues, I will aim to ensure that expenditure is managed in accordance with the Government's overall budgetary strategy and the requirements of EMU membership.

It is intended this will go further when monetary union takes place on 1 January next.  A broad outline of the overall budgetary parameters will be given at July's meeting.

      <P>The Minister has taken us into the first 11 &mdash; an auspicious number on the day that is in it &mdash; and the special 11 in terms of European financial Ministers.

An Irish person will not hold one of the senior 23 positions in the European Central Bank.  Our governor will only be a non-executive director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about fiscal policy, the fact that the Irish economy is being constrained and out of step with the other EMU economies.  In that context it is critical that there be an Irish representative at the highest level of European monetary policy.  The Irish Government has failed disastrously to ensure that our interests are at the front <Col N="323" /> of European monetary policy.  The Taoiseach said he had no responsibility for this.</P>

Of the six extra appointees, three are governor alternates in the European Monetary Institute.

Another appointee is a professor of economics and is the chairman of the alternates of the monetary committee.  The last appointee is from Finland and an expert on banknotes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 72 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the third banking force, my predecessor stated, in reply to a question from Deputy Callely on 1 May 1997 that much progress had been made over the previous few years in opening up the banking market, in reducing barriers and in creating competition generally.  In this, he specifically mentioned the impact of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, the Central Bank Act, 1997, and the Credit Union Bill which has been enacted since then.  I referred generally to such developments and to those at EU level in a reply to questions on 28 April 1998.  At that time, I said that all these developments meant that &ldquo;the State's policy in relation to banking no longer requires it to be directly involved in the sector in an ownership capacity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Looking at the future of ACC and ICC Banks, I added that &ldquo;given the impact which EMU will have in terms of increasing competition within the sector, the <i>status quo</i> with regard to State ownership is not an option for ACC and ICC Banks in the long-term&rdquo;.  It was against this background that the Government authorised me to enter into discussions with the boards, managements and staff of both banks regarding the future of the banks, including, in principle, the option of disposing of up to 100 per cent of the State's interest in the banks.</P>
      <P>On foot of this Government authorisation, I had separate discussions with the boards, managements and staff representatives of both banks in December last and following receipt of submissions setting out their individual views, I held further separate meetings with them on 20 May last.  At these meetings, I again emphasised the position that the State's policy in relation to banking no longer requires it to be directly involved in the sector in an ownership capacity and that any process for the disposal of any or all of the State's interest in the banks would have to be open, transparent and non-discriminatory &mdash; i.e. that clear and objective criteria for selecting a potential purchaser or partner would have to be established and abided by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meetings provided a welcome opportunity for all participants to engage in a very useful and <Col N="325" /> constructive exchange of views and the positions discussed are being developed in ongoing contacts with officials from my Department.  In view of the continuing nature of these contacts, it would not be appropriate for me to disclose any further details of the discussions at this time.</P>
    <P>As regards the TSB, I can only repeat what I have already told this House, namely, that under the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989, neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Government has the power to initiate any change in the status of TSB Bank.  As Minister I can only respond to a proposal from the trustees who have the sole power of initiative in this matter.  I have no current proposal from the trustees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  I am sure he would agree it is time that certainty and finality was brought to the debate about the future of a third banking force, particularly the three banks under scrutiny, the TSB, ACC and the ICC.  What are the Minister's views on a possible merger between ACC and the ICC?  Is he aware of any prospective partner &mdash; either an existing banking operator or an outside party &mdash; who may be interested in acquiring ACC or ICC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be in a position to bring this matter to a conclusion.  However, my predecessor, Deputy Quinn was also of that opinion and he was unable to do so.  His predecessor, the Taoiseach, initiated this matter and was also unable to bring it to a conclusion.  I hope to be able to do so.  We have moved considerably from the idea of a third banking force.  That idea was mooted in 1992, 1993 and 1994, but the issue is no longer on the agenda in the way it was at that time.</P>
      <P>The TSB must be considered somewhat differently. I have no direct control or power of initiative over that organisation.  The TSB Act, 1989, is an unusual hybrid.  I am aware of no other Act which sets up an institution such as this, but there must have been very good reasons for so doing.  Any powers of initiative relating to the bank must come from the trustees of the TSB.  If, however, the TSB puts forward proposals I have power of veto.  Furthermore, if funds accrue from the disposal of TSB they would fall to the Exchequer, but I cannot initiate proposals in that regard.  The proposals on the table previously were put forward by TSB. The trustees very jealously guard their rights in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have direct ownership over ACC and ICC on behalf of the State.  I hope to move forward the proposals on those two banks as quickly as possible. If the Trustee Savings Bank becomes part of the equation and if the regular trustees of the TSB put forward proposals I will deal with them. I had meetings in December with the board, staff and management to progress matters.  As a result of those meetings the various groupings furthered their proposals, but it took time for some groups <Col N="326" /> to be in a position to forward those proposals.  In the past month I have had further meetings with the boards of ACC and ICC as well as staff representatives. Discussions are ongoing between my officials and those institutions and I hope progress will be made.  I do not like setting a deadline because previous Ministers for Finance who set deadlines were unable to meet them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in favour of a merger between ACC and ICC?  Is he aware of any suitors, existing operators in the Irish banking market or outside this country who are interested in acquiring either bank?  I accept the point about the TSB having autonomy regarding its future. Has it indicated a preference as to where its future lies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any proposal for a merger between ACC and ICC.  In recent years there have been various expressions of interest from institutions inside and outside the State in becoming partners or entering arrangements with ACC and ICC.  The Government has authorised me to ensure the <i>status quo</i> in terms of those institutions is no longer an option and to dispose of up to 100 per cent of ACC and ICC.  I can move between those two broad parameters and that is the area in which negotiations have been taking place between myself and the boards of management of ACC and ICC.</P>

      <P>Is it time to revise the consensus that there should be no State involvement in banking?  Surely it was never more necessary to have a third banking force &mdash; for example, involving ACC, ICC and TSB &mdash; which would be a centre of probity and excellence, a banking system of integrity.  Is it not necessary for the Minister to reconsider the matter in view of what we learned in the past six to eight months?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <P>I am talking about the time when Deputy Quinn was in Government, not <Col N="327" /> with Fianna Fáil, but with the Deputy's friends on his left.  In the banking world it is time to move on.  There is no need for the State to be involved in the banking sector.  I said that on many occasions and I repeat it today.  In my meetings last December with ACC and ICC I said that the <i>status quo</i> was not an option but that everything else could be discussed.  The process involving the boards of management of those institutions and myself is an inclusive one.  I would like to think that in the negotiations, the people on the other side believe that I am open to all ideas except that the <i>status quo</i> is an option.  Outside that, anything is possible, including the sale or disposal of up to 100 per cent of either or both institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the <i>status quo</i> is not an option for the ICC or ACC, and I accept that.  The <i>status quo</i> is not an option for the TSB.  A bank with less than 5 per cent of market share must consider its future.  Has the Minister met the management of TSB?  Notwithstanding the autonomy of that bank with regard to its future direction, has it indicated whether it considers the <i>status quo</i> to be satisfactory, given that at one stage it was hot in pursuit of National Irish Bank?  Has TSB indicated any preference as to where its future lies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I made clear to the TSB and the House that I will not waste my time encouraging TSB.  The trustees of that institution have taken their own course at all times, as previous Ministers found.  If TSB put forward a proposition I would gladly consider it, but it is a matter solely for the trustees of that institution to consider its future.  Deputy Creed expressed his view on matters that should be considered, but TSB brought forward its proposals some years ago.</P>

      <P>I met management of TSB since becoming Minister for Finance and I told them the same as I am telling the Deputy, that it is a matter solely for the trustees to decide the direction the bank will take.  That is not my remit and the bank would not take kindly to my making suggestions to it, as previous Ministers found out.</P>

      <Quest>the level of take-up on the new job assist programme among unemployed people; the level of expenditure allocated to advertise the programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10095/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The new tax initiative introduced in the last budget to help the long-term unemployed has become known as the &ldquo;job assist&rdquo; scheme.  The Revenue Commissioners <Col N="328" /> have advised that, on the basis of statistics prepared up to 4 June 1998, the take-up in the job assist scheme was 209 cases; that is to say a total of 209 cases were issued with a tax-free allowance certificate in the period 6 April 1998 to 4 June 1998 which included the new job assist tax allowance.</P>
      <P>The cost to the Revenue Commissioners of advertising the job assist scheme was £151,000, including VAT.  The campaign consisted of advertising both on radio and in newspapers at national, regional and community levels.  In addition, the cost of producing explanatory leaflets and posters for placement in tax offices, FÁS centres, employment offices and post offices came to £50,588, including VAT.  I regard the take-up of 209 cases in the first seven weeks of operation of the job assist scheme as very satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regard a take-up of a couple of hundred as disappointing given that there are approximately 11,000 on the back to work allowance scheme?  Does he agree the job assist scheme, his initiative in the 1998 budget, favours employers more than prospective employees?  Furthermore, does he agree the back to work scheme is a more attractive option for an unemployed person?  For example, a single person who takes up a job under the back to work scheme would be better off by £40 per week. Does the Minister consider he is rejecting an approach based on tax reductions targeted at the low paid and as a result has had to introduce further subsidies and exert pressure for a relatively high national minimum wage?  The Minister mentioned an advertising budget of £151,000.  Is a similar level of information available on the back to work allowance scheme and did it have a similar level of funding and backing from the Department and relevant agencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, I did not trumpet the job assist scheme as the be all and end all.  I stated that the scheme would deal with the problem from another angle and would complement the other schemes in place.  I regard the 209 job take-ups in the seven weeks of its operation as being very satisfactory.  I stated this was another attempt at focusing on the long-term unemployed from two perspectives.  It would give the long-term unemployed an incentive to take up employment and it would give the potential employer an incentive to employ a long-term unemployed person as opposed to someone else in the marketplace. I also stated it was a deliberate attempt at distorting the labour market.  I do not regard it as being in competition with any other scheme.  It is an attempt to address the problem of long-term unemployment that Deputy Broughan has highlighted more than any other Deputy in the House.  A long-term unemployed person &mdash; a person unemployed for 12 months or more &mdash; receives an additional tax free allowance of <Col N="329" /> £3,000, £2,000 and £1,000 for the first three years, with additional allowances for children, and the employer can write off double the cost of employing such a person in his or her accounts. This is another way to attack the scourge of long-term unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the scheme has been in operation for a very short time.  However, the back to work scheme is a better inducement for prospective employees.  In fairness, the Minister has introduced a significant number of targeted responses to unemployment.  However, in the past couple of months his colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, has introduced, without reference to the House, a workfare programme whereby unemployed people are basically told to go to a building site or a security company and take up a job without training or back-up support.  While I accept the Minister did not introduce a workfare scheme in the budget, is he concerned that the Minister, Deputy Ahern, has introduced workfare without even raising it at Cabinet?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that one cannot apply for job assist and the back to work allowance scheme?  The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs would have weekly data on people who are 12 months or more unemployed and leave the register.  Surely that would be an ideal way to identify those concerned and inform them of their rights under this scheme.  Is there a system for doing that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such system in place at present.  I would like greater co-operation between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, FÁS and the Revenue Commissioners in these matters, but that does not happen at present.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs are working towards achieving greater co-operation in that regard, which I am sure the Deputy will agree is long overdue.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any scheme introduced by my colleague, Deputy Ahern, which could be even loosely referred to as workfare.  I am aware that some weeks ago he clarified the guidelines on availability for work.  Perhaps that is what the Deputy is referring to, but I do not believe that could be even loosely referred to as resembling workfare.  Perhaps the Deputy is suggesting he should introduce such a scheme.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill implements the Government's commitment, as indicated by the Taoiseach in the House on 3 June 1998, to introduce as a matter of urgency legislation amending the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts to enable the Houses of the Oireachtas to resolve to change the terms of reference of a tribunal, subject to the consent of the tribunal.  That commitment is linked with the Government's stated intention, also of 3 June, to seek, on enactment of the legislation, the consent of Mr. Justice Flood to amendment of the terms of reference of the tribunal, as then outlined.</P>
      <P>Once the Government had decided that the investigation should be carried out by Mr. Justice Flood's tribunal it was necessary to bring forward this legislation because without the legislation the Houses would not be in a position to change the terms of reference of that tribunal.  If the Government had decided to propose the establishment of another tribunal to deal with the new situation, this Bill would not, of course, have been necessary. However, after careful consideration the Government formed the view that the further investigations would most appropriately be undertaken by Mr. Justice Flood's tribunal so that all matters arising could be dealt with by the one tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only a short time since we debated the terms of the 1998 Bill which led to amendment of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921. That Bill was framed to meet the particular circumstances which had arisen by the request made by Mr. Justice Flood, in his interim report of the tribunal of inquiry into certain planning matters, for amendment of the terms of reference of his tribunal.  The central concern of the Government in bringing forward that Bill was that once a tribunal is established, it should be allowed to proceed with certainty in the knowledge that its terms of reference will not be changed, except in certain exceptional circumstances, and where it is satisfied that any such amendment would not prejudice the legal rights of any person who had co-operated with or provided information to it under its terms of reference.  The difficulty faced by the Government at the time was that the Act of 1921 did not expressly provide for the circumstance in which it was desired to have a change in the terms of reference of a sitting tribunal. Accordingly, the Act contained no guidelines on <Col N="332" /> the safeguards which should be observed when deciding on any change in the terms upon which a tribunal is established.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the 1998 Act were not lightly proposed by the Government and they were devised on the basis of legal advice from the Attorney General.  The Government was conscious that any provisions which were vague, oppressive or in violation of persons' rights would be open to challenge and could jeopardise the otherwise healthy operation of a sitting tribunal. These are also the concerns of the Government in bringing forward this Bill.  The overriding concern is to achieve a balance in what is brought forward, to ensure fair procedures and to uphold the principle of justice.</P>
    <P>It is argued by some that in the 1998 legislation the Government should have allowed the terms of reference of a tribunal to be amended, otherwise than on the basis of a specific request from the tribunal, by allowing the Oireachtas to initiate the change.  The difficulty with the wider approach is not one, even now with the benefit of hindsight, that has somehow disappeared.  The difficulty is that the process of consultation with a tribunal in trying to establish change in its terms of reference with its consent could create tension between the Executive, the Oireachtas and a tribunal. Agreement on the amendments of terms of reference must not, and cannot, be expected in all cases.  The integrity of the judicial process must be preserved and the onerous task placed on a tribunal needs to be uppermost in our minds in debating those same issues which arise in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the context of the 1998 Bill, following on the request from Mr. Justice Flood, there was simply no need to go further than what was proposed. The best approach, in the Government's view, was to allow for change where a tribunal has requested specific change.  That was the situation which the Government dealt with in the 1998 legislation.  There are now different circumstances and this Bill recognises that.  It, however, retains the central feature of the 1998 Act by requiring that the tribunal is satisfied that a change in its terms of reference will not prejudice the legal rights of any person before the tribunal.  In addition it ensures that the tribunal retains its independence through the inclusion of the principle of consent.</P>
    <P>It has been argued also that the Government proceeded with the narrower option in the 1998 legislation because it did not want the terms of reference of the tribunal under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Moriarty changed to have the Ansbacher accounts investigated.  I want to dispel that myth because the allegations resurfaced in debate in the House on 3 June, having been raised in debate on the 1998 Bill.  The various layers of investigation of the Ansbacher accounts are as detailed and as broad as can be, consistent with the laws, including revenue and international law in this area.  The Ansbacher accounts are subject to scrutiny by the Revenue Commissioners, by an <Col N="333" /> authorised officer appointed by the Tánaiste under the Companies Act, 1990, and by the Moriarty Tribunal, which has a brief to examine certain aspects of those accounts.</P>
    <P>The other myth which surfaced in the debate on 3 June is that my Department advised that the 1998 Bill was not necessary on the basis that power already existed under the 1921 Act to amend terms of reference of a tribunal.  The reality, of which those in the House with Government experience will be particularly aware, is that the practice when preparing legislation is to engage in a detailed analysis of all the issues involved, to tease out the legal principles and all of the practicalities.</P>
    <P>In the course of this exercise on the Bill the Department, as it must, and the draftsman raised queries which required to be answered by the legal side of the Attorney General's office.  One of the queries was on the necessity for the legislation. The Attorney General's legal advice, which was confirmed by independent counsel, was that it was necessary to expressly provide for, in effect, amendment of terms of reference of a tribunal.  Indeed, this Bill is based on that premise and that is also the premise of the Private Member's Bill that is before the House in the names of Deputies John Bruton, Quinn, De Rossa and Sargent.</P>
    <P>I propose now to deal briefly with the details of the Government's Bill.  It is concerned with tribunals of inquiry to which the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 applies.  Section 1 of that Act requires that prior to the making of an instrument which applies the Act, both Houses must have resolved that it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance.  The provisions in the Act of 1921, as amended by Acts of 1979, 1997 and 1998, give to a tribunal certain powers, rights and privileges that are vested in the High Court for evidential purposes.  Such a tribunal can enforce the attendance of witnesses, examine the witnesses under oath and compel the production of documents.</P>
    <P>The 1998 Act inserted a new section 1A into the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, which provided that an instrument which appoints a tribunal shall be amended pursuant to a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas where the tribunal has requested the amendment and is satisfied that such amendment would not prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts, with amendment, section 1A of the Act of 1921.  Subsection (1) of the new section 1A provides that an instrument to which the new section applies shall be amended by a Minister of the Government pursuant to a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, subject to certain conditions which are specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the subsection.</P>
    <P>The conditions are that: the tribunal has consented <Col N="334" /> to the proposed amendment following consultation between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister, or that the tribunal has requested the amendment.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of the subsection represents an additional option to the procedure provided for in section 1A of the 1921 Act as it stands.  The effect is to allow the Oireachtas to resolve to change the terms of reference of a tribunal in the absence of a specific request in the matter from the tribunal itself, whether or not that tribunal was established before or after the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b), under which the tribunal may request amendment of its terms of reference, is in the law as it stands by virtue of the 1998 legislation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the new section 1A provides that, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a tribunal shall not consent to or request an amendment where it is satisfied that such amendment would prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its terms of reference.  It re-enacts the substance of the law contained in this respect in the 1998 legislation.</P>
    <P>The new subsections (3) and (4) are technical provisions which also re-enact provisions to be found in the 1998 legislation.  The effect of subsection (3) is that where terms of reference of a tribunal are amended, the Act of 1921 will apply to those new terms of reference.  Subsection (4) makes clear that the conditions in the new section 1A will apply where terms of reference of a tribunal are amended.</P>
    <P>The Private Member's Bill is substantially different from the Government's Bill.  It allows for amendment of the terms of reference of a tribunal on the initiative of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but does not expressly provide for amendment on the initiative of the tribunal.  The Bill would, moreover, allow amendment of terms of reference of a tribunal in circumstances where the tribunal has not consented to the amendment. The Bill merely indicates that the tribunal must inform the chairmen of both Houses that it is satisfied that the amendment proposed by the Oireachtas would not prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its existing terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The Government's Bill is specific on these issues.  The terms of reference of a tribunal cannot be changed without the consent of the tribunal and the tribunal itself may, as in the case of the Flood Tribunal, request change in its terms of reference.  As I have indicated, a consultation procedure is also specified in the Government's Bill.  When considering the question of what tribunal might investigate the further matters in question, I confirm that the Government asked the Attorney General to consult Mr. Justice Moriarty and Mr. Justice Flood in relation to whether they would be willing to undertake the work in the context of the tribunals which they are chairing. <Col N="335" /> Both of them expressed a willingness to undertake further investigative work on behalf of the Oireachtas and neither of them felt that there would be any prejudice caused to persons by such addition to their terms of reference.  As I indicated, the Government has now formed the view that the further investigation would most appropriately be undertaken by Mr. Justice Flood's tribunal.</P>
    <P>Some Members of the House have, I understand, queried the appropriateness of the approaches made to the two judges by the Attorney.  Let me make it quite clear that the approach which the Attorney made was purely to establish whether either would be willing or in a position to accede to an amendment of their terms of reference.  The Attorney did not advance any specific proposal to alter the terms of reference of either tribunal.</P>
    <P>Both tribunals are impartial and independent. They were established by orders in the terms that were resolved by both Houses and if the terms of reference of either Tribunal of Inquiry were to be the subject of amendment this could only be done under existing legislation pursuant to the provisions of section 1A of the Act of 1921.  Moreover, any such amendment can only be made at the request of a tribunal.  The approach made by the Attorney to the judges was whether there would be any obstacle to their terms of reference being amended by the Oireachtas, if that should be its wish.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies will be aware that it is quite normal and proper for the Attorney to act as a channel of communication in this way and there are precedents.  The willingness of either judge to undertake further investigative work on behalf of the Oireachtas is to be greatly welcomed by the House given the heavy work already under way by those judges.</P>
    <P>The Bill is sensitively framed to expressly provide for the conditions and the procedures which must be adhered to where it is determined that the terms of reference of a tribunal, to which the Act of 1921 applies, should be amended.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: On 26 March during the Second Stage debate on the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment), 1998, which sought to comply with the request of Mr. Justice Flood to allow him to investigate possible planning irregularities prior to 28 June 1985, I indicated to the House that I would table an amendment to enable the Government to seek to change the terms of reference of a tribunal provided that the consent of the tribunal had been obtained.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform told the House on that occasion that this could <Col N="336" /> not and should not be done.  Indeed, he told us in solemn tones that &ldquo;anybody who went to Mr. Justice Moriarty, or any other judge in charge of a tribunal, and asked him if he felt the terms of reference of a tribunal should be amended might be considered by many to be interfering with the judicial independence of the chairperson of the tribunal.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: He went on to say that:</P>
      <P>If any member of the Government did that, legitimate questions would be asked in the House.  I regret that Members of the House suggested that type of legal mumbo jumbo and tried to pass it off as desirable.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I moved an amendment to the effect that the terms of reference of a tribunal could, after it had been established, be amended pursuant to a resolution of both Houses where &ldquo;the Government, with the consent of the tribunal, has requested the amendment.&rdquo; The Minister refused to accept the amendment on Committee Stage or on Report Stage on 1 April.  What was legal mumbo jumbo according to the Minister last March and April has now become the exact thrust of the Bill he has brought before the House today.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister trying to dance his usual minuet around a decision he knows was wrong then and has proven to be wrong today. If the Minister had the good grace to accept the Opposition amendment last April, this Bill would not have been necessary as the legislative powers would already be in place to enable the Attorney General to go to Mr. Justice Flood to ask him to agree to accept a widening of the terms of reference to investigate payments to Mr. Ray Burke.</P>
      <P>The woeful consequences of somebody going to the tribunal and to be seen to be &ldquo;interfering with the judicial independence of the chairperson&rdquo; as we were told, and as has become apparent to the House today, has already taken place in view of the fact that consultations have taken place between the Government and the Attorney General and Mr. Justice Moriarty and Mr. Justice Flood.  The abhorrence of last March and April seems to have totally evaporated.  Indeed, it is something which will now become part and parcel of the new Bill arising from the consultations which will now be necessary between the Attorney General and the chairman of the tribunal. So much for consistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to accepting worthwhile initiatives from the Opposition there has been a total zero tolerance response from this zero tolerance Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There was a zero tolerance response to a perfectly well crafted Door Supervisors Bill, produced by my colleague, Deputy Farrelly, to bring about long overdue registration, regulation and supervision of bouncers at discos and places of entertainment.  The Minister's proposals are so <Col N="337" /> far down his priority list that they will not even see the light of day for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Again, there was a zero tolerance response to the Registration of Sex Offenders Bill, published by my colleague, Deputy Neville.  The Bill was rejected by the Minister on the grounds that he will launch a discussion paper on the issue.  We are still at the stage of a discussion document while unregistered sex offenders roam our streets and a perfectly good Bill is allowed to languish. Before the Minister even saw the text of my recently published Enforcement of Court Orders Bill, which would end the jailing of fine defaulters and civil debtors by extracting fines and debts from their earnings, he announced he would not accept it but would bring forward his own proposals. It was confirmed by the Tánaiste in the House this week that these proposals will not see the light of day this year.</P>
    <P>Each time I ask the Taoiseach about the progress of the Minister's legislation, it becomes patently clear that this issue is not a Government priority.  There was a zero tolerance response to the Democratic Left Bill, brought in by Deputy McManus, to grant an amnesty to existing asylum seekers and to enable a fresh, fair and systematic approach to be taken when dealing with asylum applications.</P>
    <P>I continue to maintain that this legislation is not necessary and the terms of reference of a tribunal can be changed by a simple resolution of both Houses.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, told the Dáil on 20 January that when a resolution has passed both Houses of the Oireachtas and an order made appointing the tribunal under specific terms of reference, the power to amend an order does not exist in legislation. This statement is untrue.</P>
    <P>The interim report of Mr. Justice Flood dated 26 February tears that contention to shreds by seeking an extension of the commencement date to before 20 June 1995.  Here we have a High Court judge, the chairman of the tribunal, seeking to broaden the scope of his investigations without any reference to the need for legislation to so do. The net situation is that in the wake of the Flood request, the Attorney General maintained that legislation was necessary.  Officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform maintained it was not necessary and their advice was published in a Sunday newspaper.</P>
    <P>The legislation route was taken by the Government to provide a fig leaf and an unnecessary expedient to save the blushes of the Attorney General.  As I pointed out last March, it is superfluous, unnecessary and could well be restrictive.  The changed terms of reference will have to be clear, specific and comprehensive. They must enable the tribunal to investigate all policy decisions by Mr. Burke when he was Minister for Justice, Communications, Industry and Commerce and Energy between 1987 and 1992 in order to ascertain whether decisions taken by Mr. Burke or Governments of which he was member could have been influenced in any way by payments <Col N="338" /> he or the Fianna Fáil party received in that period.  We want the tribunal to establish the real reason Princes Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Independent Newspapers, was granted lucrative MMDS licences either directly or as shareholders in companies which held licences in all but two of the 29 cells for which licences were offered and awarded.</P>
    <P>We want to know why Mr. Ray Burke as Minister agreed to all the main terms sought by Independent Newspapers in the granting of exclusive MMDS licences.  We want to know the reason Mr. Burke insisted on signing and despatching from his office the letter of comfort to Mr. Joe Hayes, Managing Director of Independent Newspapers. We want to know the reason the Minister departed from official advice in providing &ldquo;written assurances&rdquo; sought by Mr. Hayes.  We want to know the motivation behind Mr. Burke's assurance to allow existing franchise holders not only to apply for a renewal of their ten year licence, three years after the MMDS systems were established, but to also offer them the comfort that:</P>
    <P>I should say that I do not see changes of franchise being made simply for the sake of change. Unless my Department has had cause to express grave dissatisfaction to an MMDS Licensee, it will be safe to assume that Agreements under Regulation 7 will be given to existing licensees&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That was a cast iron guarantee.</P>
    <P>We want to know why another O'Reilly owned company, the Fitzwilton subsidiary, Rennicks, visited Mr. Burke's home with a cheque made out to cash for £30,000.  We are led to believe no favours were sought or given.  Does the Taoiseach, Mr. Burke, or the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, seriously expect us to believe that somebody would arrive at your home with £30,000 in cash, in a brown envelope, or by way of a cheque made out to cash and do so out of a sense of admiration for the recipient's principles or prowess with absolutely no strings attached?  Much play has been made of the fact that the Rennicks proposal for Kilcoole, County Wicklow, for which it was approved for a grant of £4.2 million, did not go ahead.  However, we want to know whether there is any link between the Rennicks £30,000 payment to Mr. Burke and the fact that the Rennicks company was approved for grant aid of £240,000 in 1988 of which it drew down £180,000.  We want to know if the delivery of the £30,000 cheque to Mr. Burke in 1988 by Mr. Robin Rennicks and Mr. Paul Power who were senior executives respectively of Rennicks and Novum had anything to do with the fact that in 1989 Novum got £10,000 in grants from Forbairt and received a total of £478,000 in grants up to 1996.</P>
    <P>Of particular interest is Mr. Burke's involvement in granting Irish Citizenship to 11 Saudi Arabian and Pakistani nationals, two of whom were involved in the biggest banking scandal in history.  Was the fact that these were people dealing <Col N="339" /> in millions of dollars or millions of pounds, as the case may be, a factor in ensuring that the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, took a very personal interest in their passport applications?  Was the fact that these were monied people with access to vast millions, instrumental in the unprecedented step of having their certificates of naturalisation signed personally at his home in Swords by the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Burke?  Was the fact that these people were millionaires a factor in dispensing with and setting aside the requirement that fees must be paid on the actual issue of the naturalisation certificates, in the setting aside of the requirement of a declaration of fidelity to the State, in dispensing with the residency requirement, in accepting applications for citizenship on wrong application forms and in the failure to insist on definite and adequate investment proposals?  My colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe will deal further with this issue.</P>
    <P>Are we to take it that Mr. Burke and Mr. Haughey acted in splendid isolation?  Are we expected to believe that Cabinet colleagues, including the Taoiseach and other members to the forefront of this Government, did not know or were even suspicious of what was going on? Were they totally oblivious to what was being carried on by their Cabinet colleagues?  Questions have been rightly asked about the Taoiseach's judgment in appointing Mr. Burke to high office. There is however, a question about the judgment or lack of action on the part of the Tánaiste in relation to the Burke affair.  It is fine for the Tánaiste, Miss Harney, to state that if she had known then what she knows now she would not have entered a Government of which Mr. Ray Burke was a member.  The point is the Tánaiste was aware of the welter of rumour and innuendo surrounding Ray Burke and she still waltzed into Government with Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the Progressive Democrats of today are no longer the Progressive Democrats of yesteryear.  Gone is the steadfast determination of the O'Malley era when political expediency must always take second place to what is politically right.  Can you imagine the Progressive Democrats of 1987 to 1992 accepting a situation where its leader, let alone a leader who is also Tánaiste continues to stay in Government with the Taoiseach who knew for the past three months, and deliberately decided not to tell her, that Ray Burke got £30,000 from Rennicks, that it was from this £30,000 that Mr. Burke made the contribution to Fianna Fáil and not from his £30,000 JMSE donation as we were all led to believe last October?</P>
    <P>Can you imagine the Progressive Democrats of former days clinging resolutely to office, simply for office sake, with the Taoiseach who gave the impression that everything was to be sent to the tribunal?  In fact only details of the £10,000 Rennicks-Burke donation was sent and the £20,000 balance which Mr. Burke kept only came <Col N="340" /> to public knowledge because Mr. Byrne of Rennicks spilled the beans?</P>
    <P>Can you imagine a former Progressive Democrats leader content to sit in Cabinet with the Taoiseach and a colleague who deliberately withheld information about the £20,000 Rennicks payment, the motive for which could not be investigated under the revised terms of reference of this tribunal, if it had not been for <i>Magill</i> and Mr. Byrne's revelations?</P>
    <P>Can you imagine any other Progressive Democrats leader staying in power under a Taoiseach who assured her and the nation that he had dispelled all and any lingering clouds over Ray Burke's suitability for office only to find out in the past two weeks that the investigation amounted to nothing other than a half-hearted, personal, casual query?</P>
    <P>One wonders if the reason no proper investigation was carried out or commissioned by the Taoiseach was that he was extremely fearful about the unpalatable truth which would emerge about Mr. Burke, which would make Mr. Burke's appointment to office impossible and which would lead to internal chaos within his party and the Government.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain publicly paraded determination on the part of Fianna Fáil to shake off the murky shadows of the past and to present a new squeaky clean image.  The Taoiseach has been put out front of the new nouveau clean image of Fianna Fáil.  The impression is that the party is being run and managed by a new generation leaving totally behind it the misdemeanours of the past.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate for the Taoiseach that his past close association with Mr. Charles Haughey, who wrote his character reference as the most &ldquo;cunning and devious of them all&rdquo;, is now haunting him as he purports to lay bare the skeletons in the cupboard.  It is unfortunate that his admiration for the style of Mr. Ray Burke caused him to turn a blind eye to the reality of what Mr. Ray Burke was at.  If Mr. Burke as a senior figure in Fianna Fáil for 30 years was adopting the approach that as far as political donations were concerned it was a case of &ldquo;two for me and one for you&rdquo;, then as a Fianna Fáil backbench Deputy said to me yesterday: &ldquo;How many more of them were at it?&rdquo;&mdash; i.e. short-changing the party.</P>
    <P>The squeaky clean image is no more.  What we have is a Taoiseach who knew full well the extent and the consequences of the Burke frailties and fallibilities and still appointed him to the most senior and sensitive post in the Government and who reviled the leader of my party for questioning Mr. Burke's suitability.</P>
    <P>There are many questions to be answered about the Taoiseach's performance and judgment is but one of them.  There are many questions which have been asked of the Taoiseach and too few have been answered but they must be answered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This new legislation is clearly <Col N="341" /> necessary because of recent disclosures and the need to widen the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal.  The particular focus of my inquiries has been in relation to the passport for sales issue. Despite a series of parliamentary questions over the past four or five months it has not been possible to get answers to questions, particularly in relation to the operation of the scheme from the time of its introduction by Government decision in December 1988 and the establishment of the interdepartmental advisory group to assess proposals in October 1994.  Of the 143 naturalisations under the scheme, 114 applications were received in the period up to and including 1994.  During the tenure of office of Mr. Ray Burke as Minister for Justice, 44 persons were naturalised under the scheme.</P>
      <P>This Government has conducted an extensive review of the scheme which took over six months, from September 1997 to April 1998, yet it refuses to publish the report or to confirm that it will be referred to the Flood tribunal.  From the evidence available to me it is clear that major questions remain to be answered on the operation of the scheme between 1988 and 1994 when the interdepartmental advisory group was put in place. There is evidence to suggest that during that period the Constitution was flouted, the law was broken and the Cabinet guidelines establishing the scheme were also flouted.</P>
      <P>Article 9 of the Constitution deals with the question of citizenship and states that the future acquisition and loss of Irish nationality and citizenship shall be determined in accordance with law.  Article 9.2. states that fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental political duties of all citizens, yet it is clear from a reply I received on 3 March last, in relation to the naturalisations granted between 1988 and 1994, that a total of nine persons, who would normally be required to make a declaration of loyalty to the State and fidelity to the nation, were relieved of that requirement by the Minister of the day.  In a further eight cases the Department is apparently unable to say whether such declarations were made or to indicate whether a specific ministerial decision was made to waive the requirement. That is the basis on which I suggest it is clear that the article in the Constitution was flouted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is evidence to suggest that the law was broken.  Section 15 of the 1956 Act sets out the conditions that shall be fulfilled to secure Irish citizenship.  Section 16 gives the Minister of the day power in certain circumstances to waive all or any of these conditions, but section 17 is a stand alone section providing that any such application shall be in the prescribed form.  There is no question of any discretion to the Minister.  Under section 17, any such application must be in the prescribed form and must be accompanied by certain evidence.  The prescribed form is laid down in Statutory Instrument No. 216 of 1956 and that provides exactly the form that needs to be completed by anybody applying for naturalisation. <Col N="342" /> There is evidence to suggest that form was not completed in quite a number of instances.</P>
    <P>There is also evidence to suggest that some of the forms that were completed are questionable because the form required three references from Irish citizens.  The Irish citizens were to state that they were prepared to support the application from personal knowledge of and intimate acquaintance with the applicant over a certain number of years, which was to be stated.  It is clear from the evidence now available that in a number of instances those character references were not furnished.  Section 17 was not complied with from that point of view.</P>
    <P>There is also evidence to suggest that the character references provided were questionable and there is even a suggestion that a Minister in this Government provided a character reference indicating intimate knowledge of an applicant when it seems clear he could not have had any such intimate knowledge.  I raise this issue because there are questions to be answered and it is the responsibility of the Government to answer them.  They have not done that.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the question of flouting the guidelines established by the Cabinet in December 1988.  Those guidelines were clear.  There was to be a substantial investment in the manufacturing or services sectors.  The applicant had to have purchased a substantial residence and had to have resided in Ireland for a period of 60 days.  There is an admission from the Government that in the period from 1988 to 1994 &mdash; I refer to the reply to a parliamentary question on 15 October 1997 &mdash; the original conditions applying to the scheme began to loosen.  For example, some property and forestry developments were taken as qualifying and the 60-day residence requirement was not applied in all cases.  I tabled questions on this matter but did not get satisfactory replies.  There are a number of instances where the Cabinet guidelines were flouted and in particular I want to know on whose authority the criteria were loosened between 1988 and 1994.</P>
    <P>Clearly sufficient questions have been raised in relation to the operation of this scheme between 1988 and 1994 to make it imperative to refer the report to the Flood tribunal.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Government in refusing to publish the report or agreeing to refer the report to the Flood tribunal.  I received an answer from the Minister in which he said it would not be appropriate to publish the report but he did not say the basis on which it would not be appropriate. Is it appropriate to selectively leak part of the report in an effort to divert attention from the real issues in the report?  That reply was followed by a rather intemperate statement from the Minister last Friday, in response to my demand that the report be published and referred to the Flood tribunal, when he referred to my remarks as being scurrilous and downright untrue and alleged that I was misrepresenting the facts.</P>

      <P>I expect the Minister to deal with the reasonable questions I have raised in a reasonable manner.  I believe I have established a case where there are questions to be answered. Those questions have not been answered and it is the responsibility of the Minister to provide those answers.  The first answer he must provide is the reason he is not publishing this report.  Is there something to hide?  Why is he not willing to refer the report to the Flood tribunal?  Surely sufficient questions have been raised to justify such a referral.</P>
      <P>I tabled a question to the Minister yesterday, which was replied to in the House, on the number of passports issued during Mr. Burke's tenure as Minister for Justice.  I received a short reply stating that 44 passports had been issued during that time, yet in this morning's newspaper there is a reference to a Fang family who apparently got 33 passports during Mr. Burke's tenure of office.  It seems the Department is willing to give further information to the media; it could not have come from anywhere else.  Why was that information not furnished to the House in reply to my question? Why is the minimum information being furnished? As far as the public is concerned there is a failure to publish the report yet there is selective leaking to suit the Government.  That is dishonourable behaviour.</P>
      <P>Is it important that the facts are established and a signal is sent to the people that we are prepared to ensure they are established?  If the Government has something to hide, it will not be able to hide it.  The truth will be discovered &mdash; the truth is great and shall prevail; when all is done the lie shall rot.  I want the Government to publish the report and to refer it to the Flood tribunal.  I want this legislation in place as soon as possible so that the terms of reference can include an investigation by the Flood tribunal into the passports for sale scheme, particularly during the tenure of Mr. Ray Burke as Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>Today is an important day in the life of many Irish people, particularly the thousands of students sitting their leaving certificate exams.  It is also an important day in the life of the Minister.  It is his &ldquo;groundhog day&rdquo; when the recurring nightmare of tribunal matters from which the Minister and the Government cannot extricate themselves returns to haunt them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 February Mr. Justice Flood published the interim report of the tribunal of inquiry into certain planning matters.  He requested that the Government amend the terms of reference of the planning tribunal.  In the wake of this request, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, stated: &ldquo;The public can rest assured that the Government will do all it can to facilitate the investigation into allegations of planning corruption &ldquo;.  On 3 March the <Col N="344" /> Taoiseach stated in the House that: &ldquo;The House has received a request.  ..from Mr. Justice Flood for an amendment.  This is how we will achieve that amendment and we will do so quickly&rdquo;. However, this was followed by wholly inadequate legislation of 26 March.</P>
    <P>Almost four months after Mr. Justice Flood's request, the terms of reference of the planning tribunal have not been amended.  That is a disgrace. It is increasingly clear that, in an effort to save their own skins, the members of the Government are willing to spancel the work of the Flood Tribunal.  The Government's approach to Mr. Justice Flood's request has been bizarre, unbelievable, lazy and ludicrous.  If anyone chooses to construct an acronym from those words, it would also adequately encapsulate the Government's approach.  The Government's threadbare defence for refusing to extend the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal to include investigation of the Ansbacher accounts was blown apart by Mr. Justice Flood's request.</P>
    <P>In a desperate measure to maintain the nonsense that the terms of reference of a tribunal could not be amended by a resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Government decided to introduce the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, as it is now called. When it was debated in the House less than three months ago, I said it was &ldquo;unnecessary, unwarranted and an attack on the democratic powers of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  Subsequent events have proved the veracity of this statement and today we encounter the ridiculous situation where the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is forced to introduce legislation to effectively repeal the legislation he introduced less than three months ago. The Bill before the House today is the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill. There have been as many versions of this Bill as there have been &ldquo;Godfather&rdquo; films.  This is appropriate given the murky and sinister subplot behind it.</P>
    <P>Like many Members, I was taken aback a number of days ago when it emerged that the Government would seek a derogation on the implementation of the parental leave directive.  Official sources cited at the time said the derogation was being sought on the basis of the heavy legislative programme facing the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I found this reason hard to understand because the Government's legislative programme listed only three Bills due to be published by the Department in advance of the summer recess.  However, the introduction of this Bill clarifies the matter.  It is obvious the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is so snowed under with drafting legislation to repeal the Minister's previous Acts that everything else must be put on hold.  That is a sorry situation.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill must be one of the most embarrassing and humiliating experiences in the Minister's political life.  Since it became clear to him that the provisions of his initial Act would <Col N="345" /> not be countenanced by either tribunal, he has seen his desperate ploy to protect the Ansbacher account holders from public scrutiny fall asunder before his eyes.  This must be a source of considerable embarrassment for the Minister considering that every speaker on this side of the House highlighted the folly of his actions when we debated his original legislation.</P>
    <P>However, embarrassment is something the Minister has become accustomed to dealing with since he attained office.  That he ignored the considered opinion of senior officials in his Department about the need for the original legislation has compounded his problems.</P>
    <P>It may come as little comfort to the Minister but I feel a degree of sympathy for him.  He is the public fall guy for this Government.  He is the one who, for the second time in three months, has to propose unnecessary and groundless legislation to protect his Government's backside.  He is the Government's answer to the Tory party's Brian Mawhinney.  When everything is falling apart, he must publicly attempt to convey the impression that things are under control and going according to plan.  It is a rotten job and it is a rotten Government which obliges a Minister to behave in such a fashion.</P>
    <P>However, I have a solution for the Minister which will stop the nonsense.  The task he has undertaken is unnecessary and he need not put himself through the embarrassment of guiding the Bill through the House.  There is no need for legislation to amend the terms of reference of a tribunal because that power is vested in the Oireachtas which establishes a tribunal and can amend its terms of reference.  In the interests of democracy and of his reputation, the Minister should acknowledge this and put an end to the ludicrous behaviour we have witnessed from the Government since 26 February.  However to expect this degree of realism from a Minister who is prepared to ignore the sound advice of his senior officials is perhaps asking too much.  I presume the charade will go on.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the detail of the Bill.  The Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill effectively repeals the Minister's original Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act.  Whereas in March the Minister told us the terms of reference of a tribunal could only be amended following a request by the chairman of a tribunal, it now appears that, in the Minister's opinion, this is no longer the case.  The new Bill contains a section allowing a degree of initiative on the part of the Government.  Perhaps in his reply, the Minister could inform the House how he arrived at this Pauline conversion to democratic procedure.</P>
    <P>The Bill is seriously flawed.  It provides the power of initiative to the Government but not to the Oireachtas.  This is a bizarre state of affairs as it is the Oireachtas, not the Government, which establishes a tribunal.  In effect the Minister is attempting to do two things with the Bill.  First, he is covertly accepting the principle that the <Col N="346" /> Oireachtas can amend the terms of reference of a tribunal.  Second, he is attempting to restrict the Oireachtas' powers to amend the terms of reference of a tribunal by limiting the power of initiative to the Executive through the offices of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Labour Party will table an amendment seeking to overturn this section.  We propose that any Oireachtas group recognised under the Standing Orders of the House will be entitled to consult the tribunal regarding the acceptance or otherwise of a proposed amendment.  This amendment seeks to achieve two results: first, to break the strangle-hold on the process of initiation that the Bill seeks to confer on the Government, and second, to avoid the imposition of an unwelcome and potentially dangerous relationship between a tribunal and the Government and thereby maintain the independence of tribunals established by this House.</P>
    <P>In his summing up on Second Stage of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, the Minister made remarks which have been quoted by Deputy O'Keeffe.  He also stated that: &ldquo;If any member of the Government [approached the tribunal], legitimate questions would be asked in the House&rdquo;.  However, as it stands, the Bill requires the Attorney General to do exactly what the Minister dismissed in his speech last March. The Labour Party amendment seeks to overcome this problem by restoring the powers of initiative to the Oireachtas and by ensuring equal access to the tribunal for all parties recognised under the Standing Orders of the House.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will also table an amendment to strengthen the provisions in section 2(2) of the Bill.  The amendment will limit the grounds upon which a tribunal can refuse to accept an amendment to its terms of reference.  The Labour Party will also seek to insert a new subsection into the Bill to provide for the exchange of relevant information between tribunals.  There is currently a lacuna in the law in relation to this matter and our amendment to the Bill will seek to address this deficiency.  It is a timely amendment and one can envisage a situation developing in the coming months where a provision such as this may greatly assist the operation of the two tribunals currently at work, particularly as it now appears that the matters under investigation are converging.</P>
    <P>This Bill is unnecessary.  There is no need to introduce legislation to amend the terms of reference of a tribunal.  However, the Minister chooses not to listen to this analysis, whether proffered by Opposition spokespersons or senior civil servants in the Department.</P>
    <P>This legislation is politically necessary.  The Government needs to maintain the myth that this House could not amend the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal in January to allow the public investigation of the £38 million salted away in offshore accounts, some of which were conveniently accessible through a bank in Dame <Col N="347" /> Street.  The Government's adherence to this line is becoming more threadbare with each twist in this saga.  However, it has dug itself in so deep that it has no option but to continue digging.  The Minister has been the chief gravedigger in this debacle.</P>
    <P>This is the second time in less than three months that we have had to debate legislation amending the terms of reference of a tribunal. With every day the Minister's and the Government's grip on this issue becomes increasingly tenuous.  At the conclusion of this debate no doubt the Minister will again accuse the Opposition of having over-active imaginations by linking this Bill to the decision of the Government to protect the Ansbacher account holders from public scrutiny.  If the Minister is intent on trotting out this line then I have a challenge for him.  With the passage of this legislation the Minister can have no doubt that the Oireachtas is empowered to amend the terms of reference of a tribunal. Will the Minister and the Government use this legislation to enable the Moriarty tribunal conduct a public investigation of the Ansbacher account holders?</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the nonsense this House has been put through since February regarding this legislation has its root in the refusal of the Government to amend the terms of reference of Moriarty to allow a public inquiry into Ansbacher.  The Minister now has an opportunity to prove me wrong.  After the passage of this Bill the Government has the power to amend the terms of reference of a tribunal.  Deputy McCreevy stated during the debate on extending the Moriarty tribunal that the power to amend the order does not exist in legislation.  This is no longer valid.  Will the Government allow a public investigation into Ansbacher or are we to be content with the confidential inquiries being conducted at the behest of the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney?</P>
    <P>Over the weekend, Deputy Harney spoke of the confidential investigations into the Ansbacher accounts.  She stated: &ldquo;What has surprised and disturbed me is the extent of what we have now uncovered.&rdquo; She went on to say that her investigations lead her to conclude that some very influential people did not seem to believe that the tax laws were for them.  Is Deputy Harney the only person entitled to know the details of these investigations? Are ordinary taxpayers expected to be satisfied with confidential inquiries into one of the most audacious and disgraceful tax scams perpetrated against the people?  Does the Government expect that Deputy Harney's infrequent public assurances that her inquiries are going along nicely are what the public expects from an investigation into what is probably one of the largest nests of corruption uncovered in the history of the State?  If so it is badly mistaken.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an astonishing piece of incompetence on behalf of the Minister and the Government. It effectively repeals the legislation that the <Col N="348" /> Minister brought before this House in March.  In bringing this Bill before the House, he has a range of serious questions to answer.  One of the most serious of these questions is why the provisions contained in the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 1) Bill could not be used to amend the terms of reference of either tribunal to investigate the recent revelations regarding Ray Burke?  Why is it necessary for the Minister to effectively repeal his previous legislative efforts?  Answers to these and many other questions posed during this debate need to be answered by the Minister before this whole saga descends further into farce.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill with some reservations.  I have always seen our role as legislators as setting the terms within which the Judiciary or a judicial tribunal would operate and that that arm of the Constitution would exercise its responsibility independently without regard to political consequences or implications.  For that reason, ideally we should set appropriate terms of reference and let the tribunal act and request extensions of its powers.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts to enable the House to resolve to change the terms of reference of a tribunal to which these Acts apply, subject to the consent of the tribunal.  This Bill is appropriate in these circumstances.  The pace of disclosures in the media has been such as to require legislators and enable tribunals to deal with matters immediately, urgently and effectively.</P>
      <P>In an ideal world we would not need tribunals. I wish to make some observations on our responsibility as legislators.  When I say that we have a personal obligation to reject any wrongdoing or hint of corruption, I do not cloak myself in virtue, as I have no right to do so.  I am conscious of the Lord's maxim &ldquo;Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.&rdquo; In making these observations I do not set myself up as a guardian of other people's morality.</P>
      <P>I cannot but notice that those who have done so, either as individuals or political parties, have suffered the consequences with the public and the electorate.  They see that in the human and political condition no one can claim to have total and unblemished integrity.  No one can set himself up and claim that he alone has those principles in his personal or political life and then question, criticise and expose the inadequacies of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This realisation did not start in this generation. The 1st century Roman satirist Juvenal, who had a fair notion of public fallibility, asked, &ldquo;<i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&rdquo;</i>&mdash; who will supervise those who claim to supervise?  In this situation the public alone can supervise those who claim to supervise.  No Member of this House can claim <Col N="349" /> virtue beyond others to expose the shortcomings and inadequacies of others and cloak himself or herself in virtue &mdash; it is not my intention to do so.</P>
    <P>I reject those who claim that it is their prerogative and fundamental purpose as a political party to be custodians of the standards of others and to claim that Fianna Fáil is not fit or trustworthy to govern on its own.  I will refrain from referring to individuals but some of the most honourable, stubborn men of integrity that I have known over 33 years were members of parties on both sides of this House.  That is not to say that each one of us could measure up to the standards of those men &mdash; how great it would be if we could. However, not once did I hear one of those rugged men of integrity proclaim that they belonged to a higher moral cast than the rest of us or that they were ordained by God to fulfil this role.  There has been a fair bit of that in this House in the past few years.</P>
    <P>In particular, there have been attempts to insinuate political corruption.  I do not want to dwell on this matter.  However, while it may have been necessary to investigate matters under the beef tribunal, I reject the implication that people in Government were responsible for the corruption. Those who made those veiled allegations know them to be untrue.  The men and women about whom I am speaking did not need a code of ethics, they knew it was essential that they practised what they preached.  The old Fenian tag &mdash; the fiannaíocht &mdash; is appropriate: beart dé reír ár mbriathar, act according to one's words.  This should be uppermost in our minds as we select targets.  The men and women about whom I am speaking imposed an obligation on themselves to have trust in and mutual respect for each other. To break this obligation was to break the common bond.  It is not for me to judge but it is a matter of regret if standards, of individuals or parties, have slipped from time to time because of the damage done to the body politic.  The principle of collective responsibility on which this State is based ensured mutual respect and trust; it was not necessary, as has been happening in recent days, to tell someone else in public that they and their party would have to behave according to standards set by others.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley is quoted as saying in his latest interview with Eamon Dunphy on Today FM, just days after appearing on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, that the prospect of Fianna Fáil in Government on its own is one that would frighten many people.  I find this offensive and objectionable.  That is not to say that Fianna Fáil can claim that each and every one of us is without sin but I find it objectionable that some people claim they are needed to ensure standards are adhered to.  I reject this implication in the name of the many genuine, honourable and honest people throughout the country, none of whom would claim total virtue. Some of the self-appointed gurus in the press may make snide remarks about these innocent or foolish people but they are the salt of the earth.  It is <Col N="350" /> an offence to them to imply, much less to state, that Fianna Fáil on its own cannot be trusted.</P>
    <P>There are people who served in Government in recent times who did not seem to understand the principles of collective Cabinet responsibility, much less Cabinet confidentiality.  This is a matter of great regret.  There are people who rose to the highest offices because they found that the best way of promoting oneself and win support was to place the press gurus on the inside track.  This is also a matter of regret.  We should return to the standards which guided our predecessors in this House.  It may emerge at the tribunals that individuals did not adhere to those standards but this does not mean that those who were in Government with them are guilty by association.  That is an unfair, unreasonable and unworthy allegation. No one should rush to judgment in advance of the judicial tribunals completing their work.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of the Oireachtas for 33 years.  The people for whom I have respect are the ones who never attribute shame, failure or moral turpitude to others but lead by example.  I ask Members to have some regard and Christian understanding for the families of those who are being fingered.</P>
    <P>On the night the beef tribunal was established I said that I was reluctantly agreeing to its establishment lest there be any suggestion that those in positions of responsibility were trying to cover up corruption or wrongdoing.  Tribunals have a habit of turning out differently, tend to last much longer and cost much more than anticipated.  It would also be a help if those who call for the establishment of tribunals did not claim privilege in respect of the evidence that they are asked to give when called to appear before them.  This would ensure consistency.</P>
    <P>When Minister for Agriculture and Food I was asked by Raphael P. Burke who is being targeted from all sides &mdash; I know nothing about these events &mdash; to deal with the matter of export credit insurance.  He asked how he could be expected to make a proper decision.  I had agreed to do so when the matter was brought before the Supreme Court.  In making judgments we should be conscious of the effect on ourselves, individually and collectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not spoken in any of these debates because the state of Irish politics turns my stomach.  This is also the view of the vast majority of the public.  Members on all sides of the House have made the point to me that what has happened in recent months has done irreparable damage to politicians and the body politic.  It is about time that we put our heads together and came up with solutions to these problems, with ways of investigating these allegations and handling those people who have, undoubtedly, done wrong.  There is a pall of suspicion surrounding us all.  Cynicism is at an all time high.  It is open season for sensation seekers.  The major issues have tended to be ignored among the rumours and innuendoes which have been circulated about <Col N="351" /> politicians.  It is sad that people who enter public life are now universally regarded with suspicion throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to comment directly on the allegations which have led us to this state of affairs as they will, ultimately, be investigated by the tribunal. My views on those people and their actions which have brought us to this low ebb are unprintable and unparliamentary.  I do want to say something, however, about the manner in which the political establishment as a whole has addressed the mounting crisis in politics.  We have spent our time scoring points off each other rather than looking to long-term solutions.  The response from the political establishment has been tardy, piecemeal and reactive.  More energy has been invested in invective and political point scoring than in seeking to put in place institutional mechanisms that will work not only at this time but into the future.</P>
      <P>Some years back I suggested the need for a standing ethics commission which would be charged with the task of examining any allegation which arises regarding any office holder.  I suggested at that time that such a commission should exist on a permanent basis, that it would examine and investigate whether any <i>prima facie</i> evidence existed to support any allegation made and that it would necessarily take action either directly or through other State institutions.</P>
      <P>When the Fianna Fáil-Labour Administration broke up in 1994 I understood that a considerable amount of thought had been given to this matter and that it had been moved forward to some extent at that time.  The establishment of such a commission would be a far more logical response to these continuing crises in politics than the type of response we have in the form of tribunal after tribunal and people arguing on both sides.  Such a commission should be established and we should respond to this matter on an all-party basis.  Wisdom in this matter and the hurt and concern about it does not reside on any one side of the House.  Everybody who cares about politics must be concerned about what has happened.  Politics and those who practice it have most to gain from a standing commission.</P>
      <P>At present, suspicion about politicians is rife. Every allegation made is given credence.  Any criminal, fraudster, self-serving liar can make any allegation he or she wishes against any Member of this House, the Seanad, any councillor or any other person involved in politics and they will be believed.  Irrespective of how preposterous or unfounded an allegation may be, the politicians in question face a dilemma.  If legal action is initiated, as could be the case for most private citizens when citizens are defamed, the publicity that would follow and the rumours that would abound as a result of it would do irreparable damage.  The truth would catch up from the proceedings of the court case a year and a half later, but the damage would be done at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, most innocent people, I count politicians <Col N="352" /> among them, find the prospect of court action not only expensive but stressful and daunting. Therefore, I cannot understand why there has been a reluctance over the years to put in place some form of standing regulatory body that would have investigative powers to protect those who are good in politics and to expose those who are bad.  If an accuser of a politician is a man of straw, then a court action is not a particularly sensible course of action.  If a politician were to go on a PR offensive rather than take a defamation action, the headline would read &ldquo;politician denies&rdquo; and the politician would be automatically assumed to be guilty until he or she could prove his or her innocence.  The old concept, the central thesis of our legal system, that a person is innocent until proven guilty, has long since been displaced by the Irishism &ldquo;there is no smoke without fire&rdquo;.  The third alternative is to do nothing, wait for the storm that blows to pass over and then pick up the pieces.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe we need a standing ethics commission.  We need it more than most countries because Irish political culture is an intensely personal one.  People know everybody in this State, they know things about everybody else and they will put forward arguments that they know things about individuals that they do not know about themselves.  The reality is that we are a nation that lives on rumour and innuendo.  The longer this goes on, the more damage it will do to politics and politicians.</P>
    <P>I was pleased at the weekend when the Taoiseach resurrected the concept of a standing ethics committee.  I hope other parties will be party to putting that together.  I also hope that we can clean up this mess and the pigsty that is Irish politics at present and that we can be confident that those of us who came into politics to serve the public will not be tainted by the experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a script that does not devote a single paragraph to the rights or wrongs of the issues into which it is proposed to inquire; it deals purely with the Bill and the circumstances surrounding the background to it.  Having heard the contributions of Deputies O'Kennedy and Roche, I will have to make a few remarks. Deputy O'Kennedy, in particular, sought to raise the substantive issues, but in his own fashion.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Roche's point about an ethics commission, I am not persuaded at this stage by the need for one.  I would like to hear the argument as to why the House needs a permanent ethics commission.  I do not accept that 98 per cent of the Members on any side of the House need an ethics commission to police them from taking bribes or being involved in corruption.  That is an important point.  Of course the public say many things, there are many jibes and so on, but that is not generally believed to be the case.  Great frustration came through in the two speeches we heard.  We must ask why, for the third time in 12 months, we are amending the tribunals of inquiry Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" /> Deputy O'Kennedy told us this would not have happened in the time of our predecessors.  He told us he resents the type of politics practised today where people are made accountable, where issues that come into the public domain are argued out on the floor of the House and said that would not have happened in the past.  Is that not the point?  It would not have happened in the past.  We are here because of a train of events triggered by a former Taoiseach and a politician who was dominant in this polity for more than two decades.  Can anybody seriously envisage former Taoisigh Eamon de Valera, Sean Lemass or Liam Cosgrave being the subject of the type of charges that will be resolved, one way or the other, in Dublin Castle?  It is unthinkable and unconscionable.  We are dealing with what, I hope, is the legacy of the Haughey era.  I do not accept that we have to establish an ethics commission to police the daily lives of every other Member of this House.  It may be that our standing has fallen so low and, as Deputy Roche said, that the practise of politics has been so debased that it is necessary to do that in order to restore our standing in the public mind.  We have come to a very sad pass if that is the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy is entitled to make any case he likes, but he has given us a long lecture about who is in a position to protect the morals of any other Member here, and that goes without saying.  None of us is perfect, but there is a question of quantum involved.  If somebody, while in possession of a major office of State, has been found to have received £1.1 million or some other person has confessed to getting £60,000 while in office, that is not the typical venality to which the rest of us, like every other member of the public, is subject.  It should not be presented in those terms.  Deputy O'Kennedy has a fairly selective memory when he said he warned us on the night of the beef tribunal that the only reason he was agreeing to it was because if a taint of suspicion attaches we have to deal with it.  He is correct. However, some of us have been around long enough to remember why that assertion is on the record.  As Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry Deputy O'Kennedy made a long speech for 25 minutes opposing the notion of a tribunal. An official then came in and passed him a note following a meeting in the corridor between Fianna Fáil Members and the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, saying there must be a tribunal.  The Minister, who was still speaking, made a U-turn in mid flight and read the note into the record of the House.  This is what happened and there is no point in Deputy O'Kennedy coming to the House like some latter day St. Paul telling us what he said.  Future historians can read the record to see what he said, but the subsequent speeches will explain why he said it.  He can have any crib he wishes with Deputy O'Malley but the sentence he quoted from the Deputy represents a view held by a proportion of the people.</P>
    <P>The questions raised cannot be defended by <Col N="354" /> Deputy O'Kennedy saying they are somehow insulting to people who vote for Fianna Fáil. Nobody is imputing that people who vote for Fianna Fáil are complicit in the events which have transpired in recent times.  Certainly, I am not doing so.  The Deputy can ask <i>quis custodiet ipsos custodes</i>&mdash; who will guard the guards themselves &mdash; and speak of beart dé réir ár mbriathar but we all know why we are discussing this Bill, namely, because certain things happened that should not have happened.</P>
    <P>There is another place to examine the substantive issues.  What Deputy Roche &mdash; who has clearly thought about these issues &mdash; said may have to be done.  However, the issue cannot be presented in the manner which leading Fianna Fáil spokespersons are doing, namely, by saying that whatever the issue, it will be examined by a tribunal in Dublin Castle and that it should be left at that.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle spent some time on this side of the House and the sight of Fianna Fáil at full bay in Opposition has to be witnessed to be believed.  The approach now being presented is that if Fianna Fáil was on this side of the House and the boot was on the other foot its Members would ask, following a quiet word in the corridor, that issues be sent to the tribunal without mention in the House.  Deputy O'Kennedy's presentation seemed to imply butter would not melt in his mouth.  I am sure he is a man of the highest probity, but he sat around the Cabinet table with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle when many of the events being inquired into were occurring.  He may not know anything about them &mdash; I am not suggesting he does &mdash; but it was he who mentioned the beef tribunal.  For the man who sat on top of the heap when all this was going on to put such a construction on it, stretches credibility a little.</P>
    <P>This is the third occasion in six months that the Dáil has had to amend the tribunals of evidence legislation.  This is a remarkable commentary on the times in which we live.  It highlights the uncertainty and contradictions in Government in terms of handling the issue.  From the point of view of the public it is a barometer of a legacy of public life that the House would like to put behind it. We are now picking up the pieces of a prolonged period when the interaction between some senior politicians and certain businessmen was a corrosive influence on public life.</P>
    <P>Last December the Dáil amended legislation to provide privilege for people producing documents for a tribunal and to close the loophole as a result of which the McCracken tribunal was unable to award costs against Charles Haughey despite the obstructive approach adopted by the former Taoiseach which involved Mr. Justice McCracken in an enormous amount of additional work and which added greatly to the taxpayers' bill.</P>
    <P>In March of this year we returned to amend the Act to allow terms of reference to be changed subsequent to a tribunal being established.  This <Col N="355" /> arose from the request of Mr. Justice Flood who asked that the terms of reference be altered to allow certain relevant matters prior to June 1995 which had come to his attention be investigated. Despite the fact that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, particularly the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, had vociferously resisted all attempts to change the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal to allow wider investigation of the Ansbacher accounts, insisting it could not be done, the Government agreed to Mr. Justice Flood's request, something dealt with by Deputies Jim Higgins and Upton.</P>
    <P>The reason we are again discussing this issue is that the Government adopted the narrowest possible approach to amending the law last March.  The Government amendment allowed only for the terms of reference to be changed where the tribunal itself so requested.  Opposition parties pointed to a possible scenario where additional information may come to light after the establishment of a tribunal which the Dáil would want referred to it, although the tribunal may not have requested that it be added to its terms of reference.  Opposition parties tabled amendments to this effect and all were resisted by the Government which insisted terms could only be changed when there was a specific request from the sole member.  For the second time in a matter of months, the Government has done a spectacular U-turn and now accepts that the terms of reference can be changed, even when not specifically requested by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Once again the Government has taken the narrowest possible approach to the amending legislation, effectively allowing only the Government initiate the process of change by making change conditional on consultations between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister, effectively excluding the Dáil from the entire process.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the legislation is only the first step in the process of changing the terms of reference of the Flood tribunal to allow it consider the matters initially disclosed in <i>Magill</i> and debated in the House last week.  This is an essentially important but technical step.  The real test of the Government's bona fides will be the amendment to the terms of reference which will flow from the legislation.  The record of the Government regarding terms of reference does not inspire confidence. It has consistently and continually adopted a minimalist approach.  Despite intense pressure from inside and outside the House, the Government refused to give the Moriarty tribunal the comprehensive terms of reference which would allow it conduct a comprehensive investigation into all the Ansbacher accounts. Instead, the Government effectively restricted it to an investigation of the accounts only in so far as they related to Charles Haughey and Deputy Lowry.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister perpetuates the myth <Col N="356" /> that we have dealt with the Ansbacher deposits. He states:</P>
    <P>The various layers of investigation of the Ansbacher accounts are as detailed and as broad as can be, consistent with the laws, including revenue and international law in this area.  The fact is that the Ansbacher accounts are subject to scrutiny by the Revenue Commissioners, by an authorised officer appointed by the Tánaiste under the Companies Act, 1990, and by the Moriarty tribunal, which has a brief to examine certain aspects of those accounts.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a lawyer, to come to the House to seek to give the impression that all will be revealed in the context of the Ansbacher accounts.  He knows very well this is not the case and that the remit of the Moriarty tribunal only applies to certain named politicians or holders of public office.  He knows that the report of the authorised officer appointed by the Tánaiste may not be published; that she is prevented by law from publishing it and that the Revenue Commissioner would never publish it in any event. Why is this myth being perpetuated?  It may be that the Minister is unaware of what I have outlined, but I greatly doubt this.  Perhaps the Tánaiste, who has got herself in a similar fix with NIB, is unaware of the problems.  For some reason that escapes me she got marvellous headlines this morning in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in particular about how she is looking for transparency and cannot get enough of it.  She wants to publish the names.  She is well aware she cannot publish the report of the authorised officer.  The Minister led the country to believe she had appointed inspectors to carry out a job in NIB but it transpires the inspectors cannot investigate products which were being sold for the purposes of tax evasion. The Minister is behaving like a drunken man looking for a fight, asking the authorised officer to hold her jacket while the Attorney General holds her back.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants transparency, she should go to court and seek the appointment of an inspector and the court can decide whether to mediate the inspector's report into the public domain.  The Minister is fighting a great fight on transparency and the country thinks that is what she wants.  If it is, she has a strange and obfuscatory manner of going about it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Flood tribunal, the Government's initial approach was even more restrictive. The initial draft terms of reference produced by the Government made no reference, direct or indirect, to Mr. Burke although it was allegations surrounding him which had set the whole process in train.  The Opposition parties battled with the Government for a week on the matter and the Government produced endless drafts of the terms of reference, all of which seemed to be directed at obscuring the central issue, namely, the role of Mr. Burke.  The Government was eventually <Col N="357" /> forced to accept terms of reference which included a very oblique reference to an acknowledged monetary donation in the Dáil on 10 September 1997.</P>
    <P>I hope we will not witness a repeat of that when it comes to the motion to extend the terms of reference of this tribunal.  The terms must be comprehensive and must allow for a full investigation into the financial affairs of Mr. Burke and all the important policy decisions taken by him when he was Minister.  A good example of the justification for such a comprehensive approach is the evidence highlighted at the beef tribunal in respect of the export credit insurance scheme for which Mr. Burke had responsibility for a period. The £30,000 donation from a Fitzwilton subsidiary occurred at the same time as another subsidiary, Novum, made a claim on export credit insurance following default on an Iraqi contract in respect of which £2.167 million was paid out. The chief executive involved was Mr. Paul Power and he accompanied Mr. Rennicks to Mr. Burke's home to deliver the £30,000 cheque made out to cash.  This is an important matter which the Minister may be in a position to lay to rest.</P>
    <P>I recall Novum's interest in the export credit insurance scheme at the beef tribunal.  Last Sunday, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, noted a payment was made to Mr. Burke in June 1989 and that Novum was particularly keen on getting export credit support, particularly for exports to Iraq in the second half of 1989.  I would like the Minister to address that point if he is in a position to do so.  It seems somewhat odd that a company which had a bad experience with the default on a 1988 contract by the Iraqis, and was awarded £2.167 million for that under the scheme, came back to do more business with Iraq.  The number of people wishing to do business with Iraq at that time was amazing, all of them guaranteed by the State under the export credit insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>I have copies of the minutes of the relevant days of the beef tribunal.  On 10 April 1992, Mr. Ted O'Reilly, Assistant Secretary in the Department, gave evidence and mentioned Novum had sent a representative to seek overdue payments in 1987.  On 8 May 1992, Mr. Barton, a representative of ICI, agents for the State, stated he thought only three or four people in the country knew their way around the political system in terms of accessing export credit insurance.  When asked to name them, he mentioned Novum.  Mr. Ciarán Ó Coinneagáin, private secretary to the then Minister, when asked if any companies other than Goodman were hassling the Minister for export credit insurance, said Novum stuck in his mind.  When asked in what context, he replied he had received many phone calls from the company for the Minister.  This happened in spite of the fact the earlier contract defaulted.</P>

      <P>In the course of this evening's debate, we have been treated by the Opposition to the usual smears, innuendoes, <Col N="358" /> untruths, half-truths, whispers through the half door and slinking in the shadows to which we have become accustomed of late.  It has been suggested that the provisions of today's Bill should have been included in the Tribunal of Inquiry Act, 1988, and that, in the course of the debate on that Bill, the Opposition suggested as much. This argument was advanced on the basis that the Opposition had it right then and the Government had it wrong but that accusation does not stand up under the weight of evidence.</P>
      <P>The reality of the position is that certain circumstances presented themselves when the 1988 No. 1 Act was being discussed in this House. Those circumstances were quite clear; a chairperson of one of the tribunals sought an amendment to the terms of reference.  It was clear legislation was required to deal with that and such legislation was introduced to enable the terms of reference to be amended on the application of the chairperson of the tribunal.  I argued at that time that this was the preferred course of action and I still hold that view.</P>
      <P>Different circumstances have lead to the introduction of this legislation and the Government has again responded to those.  At no stage during the debate on the No. 1 Act did I hear any Deputy put forward an argument as to how the terms of reference should be amended in the context of other matters which should be examined by Mr. Justice Flood.  I did hear arguments then, and again today, as to the desirability of a global amendment to provide that a resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be sufficient to enable terms of reference to be amended in order that the Ansbacher accounts could be examined. That is a different matter, albeit an important one.  I explained <i>ad nauseam</i> the position in regard to the Ansbacher accounts and believe I did so with credibility.</P>
      <P>The 1988 Act was introduced to meet the situation where the chairman of the tribunal sought an amendment to his terms of reference.  It is important to state that during the course of that debate the Opposition consistently put forward the view that it did not regard legislation as necessary.  Some Members of the Opposition have now changed their minds and are of the view that it is necessary after all.</P>
      <P>The circumstances surrounding the introduction of the Bill before the House are unprecedented and could not possibly have been foreseen when the earlier legislation was introduced.  During the debate on the 1998 Act, amendments were tabled by the Labour Party and Democratic Left which would have allowed the amendment of the terms of reference of a tribunal where the tribunal has not requested such an amendment.  They did not provide for the consent of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the amendment tabled by Deputy Jim Higgins on behalf of the Fine Gael Party provided for the consent principle but it is important to point out that it did not provide for any mechanism or procedure whereby the tribunal would <Col N="359" /> be consulted.  On the passage of the 1998 Act, I admitted that it involved, to an extent, legal mumbo-jumbo.  However, I also cogently made the argument that I did not believe it was appropriate to provide for a member of the Government to go to a judicial personage in charge of a tribunal seeking to change the terms of reference. I also said at the time that such a provision would leave the process open to the allegation of interference with the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I have today explained in great detail the terms under which the Attorney General, due to the exceptional circumstances which were presented, went to the chairperson of each tribunal.  It is of considerable importance that the independence of the tribunals is maintained.  In that context, I pointed out then, as I do now, that the amendments tabled by the Opposition parties during the debates on the previous Bill left open the possibility of toing and froing between the Government and the tribunals.  Such comings and goings would relate to fundamental matters for the tribunals, proposed changes in their terms of reference, and would occur at a time when the tribunals were already engaged in the inquiries for which they were established.</P>
    <P>Unlike the amendments which were tabled by the Opposition parties in relation to the 1998 Act, the legislation before the House today provides for proper procedures whereby the terms of reference of a tribunal can be amended by a Minister of the Government following consultation between the Attorney General and the tribunal on behalf of the Minister.  The amendment of the terms of reference will take place on foot of a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, where the proposed amendments will be debated.</P>
    <P>An important feature of this legislation is the fact that the tribunal will be consulted prior to the making of the amendment and its consent to the amendment will be required.  This requirement preserves the independence of the tribunal. During the debates on the 1998 Act, I stressed that it was of paramount importance that the tribunal retain its independence.  It is undesirable that one should have to approach a tribunal of inquiry to ask if it wishes its terms of reference to be amended.  I set out the reason for this opinion on a previous occasion.  The circumstances which are now present are exceptional and exceptional legislative measures are being brought before the Oireachtas to address them.</P>
    <P>I emphatically reject in trenchant terms any suggestion that there has been a conscious attempt by me or by the Government to be minimalist in our approach.  That allegation can be proven to be untrue by virtue of the salient fact that we have brought forward legislation to deal with these matters whenever it was required.  I doubt that any Member of the House could have possibly foreseen the circumstances which are currently present and are the reason for this legislation.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's <Col N="360" /> comments on the passports for sale issue.  It is as if the Opposition arrived in the House with a machine gun and a full magazine and, seeing no target, fired just in case.  On this occasion, Deputy O'Keeffe should have pulled the gun from its holster before pulling the trigger.  The much vaunted report which the Deputy has been discussing in the media and in the House is an <i>aide memoire</i> to the Government.  It sets out interesting facts, some of which might be of considerable interest to Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    <P>It was reported at the weekend that the then Government decided in March 1997 that 19 passport cases should be proceeded to finality.  Notwithstanding this decision however, the Government subsequently decided that additional applicants in respect of three companies should be considered.  In respect of one of these companies the Government agreed to the substitution of a new investor for the one who had originally applied.  Furthermore, it was decided to accept an additional application in respect of a fourth company. How does this fit into the categories which Deputy O'Keeffe formulated for the House this afternoon?  He said decisions were made which clearly broke the law.  He said Cabinet guidelines were breached and the Constitution was flouted. He presented no evidence to the House to back up any of these allegations.  Perhaps he was referring to the four applications which were considered by the last Administration following a decision that only 19 named cases should be progressed to finality.</P>
    <P>It is important that people know what they are talking about.  It is of equal importance to the integrity of Members of the House who serve in Government at any time that if allegations are made, evidence should be produced.  Failing that, any Member who makes such allegations is in dereliction of his or her duty &mdash; not just to his or her colleagues but to the public.</P>
    <P>As regards the statements made by Deputy Upton, when circumstances required legislation, it was presented to the House.  Deputy Upton was wrong when he said that this legislation effectively repeals the No.1 Act of 1998.  That is patent nonsense.  This legislation amends the previous legislation to take account of exceptional circumstances. Deputy Upton repeats the allegation that the advice of senior officials was ignored. However, he ignores the fact that the advice of the Attorney General, the first law officer of the land, was accepted.  Deputy Upton said legislation is not necessary.  However, it has been accepted by the Attorney General's office and by an independent senior counsel that there was, and is, a need for legislation.</P>
    <P>How much more minimalist could one have become than not to produce any legislation?  That would have led to a position where the terms of reference, as amended, might not be deemed to have the force of law.  That would have been so minimalist as to undermine the work of the tribunals.</P>
    <P>We have reached a position where the tribunals <Col N="361" /> of inquiry can have their terms of reference amended by a request or in accordance with this legislation.  On each occasion we have ensured that any person who has previously given evidence will not be prejudiced by the fact that the terms of reference are changed.  The independence of the tribunals has been maintained and there is no uncertainty in so far as that could be achieved.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend, nor have I pretended, that this legislation is ideal.  I have made clear on a number of occasions why I have reservations about anybody going to a tribunal to amend its terms of reference.  However, I have been at pains to explain that the Attorney General was most careful in the approach he deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>The Private Members' Bill which has been lauded, naturally, by the Opposition parties and which is also before the House does not provide for the consent of the tribunal to the amendment of its terms of reference.  During the debate, Deputies suggested that the only matter with which the tribunal will be concerned is whether an amendment of its terms of reference will prejudice the legal rights of persons who have co-operated with the tribunal.  It appears that some Opposition Members consider that the tribunal should have no say in the matter.</P>
    <P>This Government wishes to have the fullest possible inquiry into the matters in question.  In addition it wants to ensure there can be no successful challenge to the tribunal's work.  The tribunal is best placed to decide whether there should be an amendment to its terms of reference and what that amendment should be.  Therefore, it cannot come as a surprise that I ensured that even if the approach comes from the Minister through the Attorney General that the consent of the tribunal will be required.  To that extent, the integrity and independence of the tribunal has been maintained.  I still consider that to foist amendments on a tribunal without its consent would invite a challenge to it, which would in all probability be successful.</P>
    <P>The legislation has been presented in good faith.  Opposition parties have attempted to say the Government was reticent in bringing forward the relevant legislation.  History will show that the Government's actions were prudent, considered, wise and legitimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a short but important Bill.  It is important to existing and prospective TDs and to the electorate they serve.  The proposed constituencies will be effective from the next dissolution of the Dáil until the next review, which will take place after the next census.  Under Article 16 of the Constitution a revision of constituencies must be carried out at least once every 12 years.  That Article also provides that the ratio between the number of Members to be elected at any time for each constituency must, as far as is practicable, be the same throughout the country.  The practice is that constituencies are revised whenever a census of population shows significant change in the total population or in its distribution.  In the past 30 years a revision has taken place after each census. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is required, under section 5 of the Electoral Act, 1997, to establish a constituency commission upon publication by the Central Statistics Office of a census report setting out the population of the country classified by area.</P>
      <P>The census taken in 1996 showed an increase of more than 100,000 in the population since the previous census in 1991.  In some constituencies the number of persons represented by each Dáil Member was considerably above the national average while in others it was well below the average.</P>
      <P>An independent statutory commission was set up last September to report on Dáil and European constituencies.  Its statutory terms of reference were essentially the same as the terms given to previous commissions.  In accordance with the provisions of the 1997 Act, Mr. Justice Richard Johnson, judge of the High Court, was appointed chairperson of the commission on the nomination of the Chief Justice.  The other members of the commission were the Ombudsman, the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.  The commission was entirely independent in carrying out the task given to it, constrained only by the Constitution and the terms of reference.  I am glad to have this opportunity to thank the members of the commission for the conscientious and even-handed way in which they completed their task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to fix the total number of Members of Dáil Éireann and to revise the constituencies to bring them into line with the provisions of the Constitution regarding equality of representation.  The Bill proposes to implement in full the recommendations made in <Col N="363" /> the commission's report.  Section 2 provides that the total number of Members of Dáil Éireann after the next dissolution will be 166, the same number as at present and the number recommended by the commission.  Section 3 provides that the Members of Dáil Éireann will represent the constituencies specified in the Schedule.  The total number of constituencies will increase by one to 42.  The proposed new constituencies set out in the Schedule will come into force on the next dissolution of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>While there is no change in the existing representation in the Dublin area of 47 seats, the major constituency changes in the Bill relate to Dublin.  Apart from the establishment of a new constituency, the boundaries of existing constituencies are altered to varying degrees.  More than 97,000 of the population are transferred from one constituency to another.</P>
    <P>The following are the major features of the scheme in Dublin as identified by the commission. Communities in west Dublin are united in three constituencies, an arrangement which should be capable of ready adaptation to future population trends in the area.  The central constituency reverts to representing the north inner city.  The river Liffey is effectively used as a constituency boundary for most of its length in Dublin city and county.  The use of the M50 as a constituency boundary is increased substantially. Outside Dublin minor territorial changes are proposed to ten constituencies.  In pursuance of the statutory provision to avoid breaching county boundaries as far as practicable, the commission recommended no new breaches of county boundaries. The scheme of constituencies in the Bill, however, retains the existing breaches of counties Carlow, Clare, Tipperary South Riding and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Under the 1997 Act the commission also had the task of reporting on European constituencies. The 1998 commission recommended no change in the present formation of the four European constituencies, and the Government accepted that recommendation.  I am sure this will be of immediate interest to prospective candidates for the European Parliament elections to be held on Friday, 11 June next year.  Local elections to all local authorities will be held on the same day. There are no constitutional provisions relating to the formation of European constituencies, but the commission's terms of reference require that there should be reasonable equality of representation as between constituencies.  In addition, there is a statutory duty on the Minister, having considered the report of the constituency commission, to submit to the Oireachtas proposals for a review of European constituencies by 1 December 2003 at the latest and subsequently at least once every ten years.</P>
    <P>The 1996 census showed the variances from national average representation in the four existing European constituencies ranged from &mdash; 10.4 per cent in the Leinster constituency to +9.44 per <Col N="364" /> cent in the Dublin constituency.  In its report, the commission indicated that most submissions made to it recommended no change in the existing constituencies.  The commission examined alternative arrangements but concluded that &ldquo;no reasonable redrawing of the constituencies would reduce the existing variances and result in coherent constituencies with which communities could identify&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to comment in detail on the scheme of the Dáil constituencies proposed in the Bill.  The commission provided a very full report, in several instances spelling out the different options in particular areas.  Apart from what is contained in the report, no further information is available to me on the work or decision-making process of the commission.  The commission's role is purely advisory.  Under the Constitution ultimate responsibility rests with the Oireachtas.  The practice of appointing an independent commission to advise on constituency revision has been universally welcomed and is now the accepted procedure.  The scheme of constituencies in the Bill is the product of an agreed process operated in accordance with acceptable rules by an independent and impartial body.</P>
    <P>In the Government's view, the commission's recommendations constitute a package which should be accepted in its entirety without change. The Bill proposes to implement the commission's recommendations in full and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be quickly enacted legislation, although it impacts in a personal way on every elected Member of the House.  By tradition, it is legislation which, on its publication, merits careful scrutiny by every individual in the House. There is a constitutional requirement for equality of representation or a strong degree of proportionality in regard to membership of this House and each constituency that sends Members to this House.  In summary, the constitutional requirement is that there will be at least one representative for every 30,000 of the population and not more than one for every 20,000 of the population. Arrangements will, therefore, have to be made by people drawing up constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two high profile High Court cases addressed this issue.  While the High Court decision in those cases is not precisely prescriptive, in general terms there is a legal requirement and a constitutional imperative that there would be general proportionality.  As a result, there is a requirement to reconsider constituencies, normally after every census.  This is the first time, however, the matter was considered by a commission established on a statutory basis &mdash; it was established under Part II of the Electoral Act, 1997, which I had the honour of bringing before the House.  I also acknowledge the very difficult work done by Mr. Justice Johnson, the Ombudsman, the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment and the Clerks of both Houses.  The Minister was not very keen on having the Secretary <Col N="365" /> General of the Department of the Environment as a member of the Commission, but I hope his sojourn over the past year made him realise it was correct to resist the temptation to remove him from the commission when the l997 Bill was going through the Oireachtas.  By and large a good job has been done.</P>
    <P>The changes are as minimal as possible to reflect the requirement for proportionality.  The next Dáil will have the same numerical membership as the current one.  Even though there has been a net increase in the population, I am sure the public would be reluctant to have more Members elected.  The new constituency of Dublin mid-west will increase the number of west Dublin constituencies and is recognition of the population growth in that part of the country. There will be more three seater constituencies than four or five seater ones.  I have always held the view that the larger the constituency the better the single transferable vote system works to give perfect proportionality.  The distribution of seats will work better in a five seater than in a three seater.  It is interesting to note the commission decided to have 16 three seater, 12 four seater and 14 five seater constituencies to make up the 42 constituencies that will form the next Dáil.  That is one more than in the current Dáil.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, predominantly the changes will occur in the Dublin area, with 97,000 people being displaced within their constituencies. The Dublin electorate is fairly used to moving constituency boundaries.  I hope that will not be onerous for those involved because we certainly do not want to discourage people from participating in the next election.</P>
    <P>I want to facilitate the early passage of the Bill because we do not know when it might be required.  The way things are progressing at present it might be imperative to revise the constituency boundaries.  From our perspective, I want to ensure the increase in population is reflected in the redistribution of seats and that there is a reasonable degree of proportionality. However, there will still be a degree of variation. The table at the end of the Bill shows that there will be under representation in Waterford constituency, which will have 6.66 per cent under the mean average, whereas the constituency of SligoLeitrim will be relatively over represented to the degree of 7.44 per cent over the mean average. However, I genuinely accept everything possible has been done in that regard.</P>
    <P>As every Member would probably have a different view on how to draw up constituency boundaries, we must accept the impartial view of the commission we have tasked with this important job.  Even when there is cross-party agreement on change, it is the tradition of the House to accept the view of the commission concerned. I note from the debate on the electoral Bill in June l995, there was cross-party agreement on changes that seemed anomalous, but the principle of accepting in total the impartial recommendation of an independent commission was <Col N="366" /> upheld and its recommendations were accepted in total.  I note the Minister proposes to follow that precedent in this case.  Regardless of what Deputies say about constituencies, such as Mayo, being too big or the need for slight adjustments to others, he proposes to enact into legislation the recommendations of the commission.  I do not disagree with that logic, it is the correct thing to do.  If we appoint a commission to do an impartial job, we should accept its recommendations on that basis.  For that reason, I have tabled only one amendment and I am advised for legal reasons that it is appropriate.  Therefore, I invite the Minister to reflect on it.  If we do not have time to deal with it on Committee Stage, perhaps the Minister might indicate his attitude to it in reply to Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not propose going through the Schedule to talk about the merits or demerits of every constituency. The job was given to an independent commission and its recommendations are being enshrined in statute.  That tradition has been supported by Members and I will give fair wind and safe passage to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would prefer if it were not rushed through.  I had hoped it might be forgotten about for a couple of years.  If a general election were to take place I would prefer the position to remain as it is.  I am not making an urgent call for this legislation.</P>
      <P>I accept that matters such as this have been dealt with by independent commissions for the past 20 years or more.  However, the Bill should not be passed without amendment merely because of the independent commission.  There is no point in claiming the Oireachtas has the final say or that it is the supreme authority if it is afraid to change any aspect of a commission's recommendations. When we were discussing a previous report on this matter, five or six Deputies from North and South Tipperary did not agree with the recommendations and were prepared to do some trading on the matter.  However, the parties, in their wisdom, felt the Oireachtas could not be seen to make any change to the recommendations. That is idiotic.  If the Oireachtas is the supreme authority it should not be tied to the recommendations of independent commissions.  If that were the case, we should let the commission deal entirely with this matter and not bother with the legislation.</P>
      <P>I am sure the commission has examined everything in a cold clinical mathematical manner, but if people feel hard done by they would probably prefer it were by politicians because they could at least wait in the long grass for an opportunity to get even with them.</P>

      <P>If it is done in such a bland, fair, balanced and even way and it does not work out in one's favour, one almost feels there is no point in criticising them because nobody will listen and one cannot get one's message through.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat concerned about this matter and we should obtain advice on it from an independent commission.  I am nervous that we will go to independent commissions on every matter every day of the week as if, somehow, politicians of all parties are incompetent and incapable of doing something for themselves; as if they need &mdash; or are willing &mdash; to hand over everything to an electoral, referendum or ethics commission.  I agree with the independent commission but I reserve the right to hold on to our independence from time to time.</P>
      <P>I will deal with some aspects of the 1998 report of the Constituency Commission.  I do not agree with some speakers, including Deputy Howlin, who say that, overall, there is nothing terribly drastic in the report and that any change it contains is minimal.</P>
      <P>The report's summary of recommendations, on page 7, mentions &ldquo;minor changes&rdquo;.  The summary outlines where very little change was made but then suddenly goes on to talk about Dublin where astronomical changes are proposed, involving all 11 constituencies.  That seems to run contrary to what the report said earlier about rural constituencies. When it comes to dealing with Dublin somebody ran riot because the proposed changes there are enormous.</P>
      <P>I thought the commission had breached one of its own regulations on breaching county boundaries, but when I read further I found it had not. I am not complaining about this matter, but a few years ago the Department of the Environment and Local Government prepared legislation for the Oireachtas turning County Dublin into four areas.  Now the Department says that while it created Fingal, it is not really a full county at all. That is what local people were saying also.  We should do one thing or the other.</P>

      <P>The commission has laid out its stall and its terms of reference are on pages 11 and 12 of the report.  The terms of reference include at paragraph 2.2 subparagraph (2)</P>
      <P>(e) there shall be regard to geographic considerations including significant physical features and the extent of and the density of population in each constituency; and</P>
      <P>(f) subject to the provisions of this section, the Commission shall endeavour to maintain continuity in relation to the arrangement of constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet during the Seanad debate people said the <Col N="368" /> commission's findings were totally in line with the terms of reference.  It is not a perfect world and maybe one cannot bring in findings which are fully in line with terms of reference and constitutional provisions.  Like most contributors to this debate, my remarks are specifically targeted at what the commission has done to the constituency I represent.  The commission, however, has not adhered to all its terms of reference and the justification for moving away from those terms of reference is very vague.  I would feel happier if the commission had explained in far greater detail why it did not adhere to what I see as its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I noted the number of submissions made to the commission.  As I did not make one I suppose I should not complain now.  Perhaps there is a lesson in that for everybody.</P>
    <P>One of the items the commission took into account was the Dáil debate on the previous commission's report.  That is interesting and heartening because we often think that nobody is listening to what is said here.</P>
    <P>On pages 18 and 19, the commission's report states:</P>
    <P>Thus, for example, in the case of Dublin, we recommend the establishment of four 3-seat constituencies because we consider that this is the optimal arrangement, having regard to local circumstances.</P>
    <P>That is a very broad, general statement and I really do not know what it means.  It could mean anything one likes it to mean.</P>
    <P>On page 32, paragraph 5.3, under the heading &ldquo;Guiding principles&rdquo;, the report states:</P>
    <P>We considered a number of &ldquo;minimum change&rdquo; schemes retaining the existing seats in all constituencies, which would bring all Dublin variances within the 5% limit from national average representation.  Apart from improving variances, these schemes were not notably superior to the existing arrangement of constituencies.</P>
    <P>If the commission was able to look at a number of &ldquo;minimum change&rdquo; schemes which retained the existing seats in all constituencies and which would bring all Dublin variances within the 5 per cent limit, I would have thought that was near to perfection.  So, why did it not run with that?</P>
    <P>The commission makes statements and lays out its terms of reference, but it does not fully live up to them.  It speaks about taking account of population density.  I regard my constituency of Dublin north-west as one of the most densely populated, including Ballymun flats which is one of the biggest multi-storey complexes in the country.  If anything, that justifies the constituency being a four, five or six seater rather than reducing the number of seats &mdash; from four to three &mdash; which seems contrary to one of the commission's terms of reference.</P>
    <P>It very much depends where the commission starts in relation to Dublin.  If it starts at one end <Col N="369" /> of the city, people fall into place.  This time the commission seems to have gone back to the old thinking that the Liffey is the biggest natural boundary.  It is a big feature both for the north and south sides of the city.  My specific complaint is that, even allowing for the fact that Dublin central would become a northside constituency, and allowing for subparagraph (2)(e) and (f) of the terms of reference, why could the commission not make Dublin central a three seater and leave Dublin north-west as a four seater?  The commission report does not provide a logical explanation for that.</P>
    <P>It refers to uniting communities but one can examine any constituency boundary, either in the new or old set ups, and see communities that are divided everywhere.  As regards this or any other change, certainly in an urban context, it is impossible to bring unity back.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5.6, on page 34 of the report, deals with north Dublin and states:</P>
    <P>In reverting to a northside 4-seat constituency, Central cedes both a seat and the Ballyfermot, Inchicore and Kilmainham area to South-Central.</P>
    <P>I find that rather strange.  I did not think any constituency could cede a seat to another.  It certainly cedes x thousand people, but not a seat.  The report goes on to say, also on page 34, that Dublin central gains a seat from Dublin north-west, but I thought that a constituency gets a number of seats based on the size of its population.  One does not cede or gain a seat from another constituency. It gives the impression that when somebody is looking at this and playing God with a playstation and or chess board he is not looking at it in a cold mathematically way but is looking at heads.  When it is said a seat is being gained in one constituency at the expense of another what is in mind is that somebody will move one way or the other.  Obviously, that is not what is meant to happen.  Perhaps the Minister will explain the report's use of the words &ldquo;to cede both a seat&rdquo; and where it says one constituency will gain a seat from an area.</P>
    <P>I am surprised Dublin North West is being reduced from a four seater to a three seater constituency. I do not understand it under the terms of reference.  It has not been fully explained.  Individual constituencies are referred to in cold terms.  The report says the Dublin North West constituency experienced the largest population decline in Dublin between 1991 and 1996 and that it will now become a three seater embracing the Santry, Ballymun and Finglas communities and extending north to the M50.  One can either take it or leave it.  The terms of reference are laid out but there is no justification for it other than to say the Liffey will be the dividing line and that Dublin Central will become a constituency on the north side of the Liffey.  It does not explain why it did not accept terms of reference (f) and act on the basis of continuity and make Dublin Central a three seater and Dublin North West a four <Col N="370" /> seater.  I know we are supposed to take a broad balanced view of these matters and not gripe.  If I return to speak on a commission report, I hope the commission will have read this Dáil debate.</P>

      <P>Second to membership of the House, membership of an independent commission in the Republic is perhaps the next most thankless task one could undertake.  The independent commission is a welcome move but, unfortunately, there are always winners and losers as a result of boundary changes.  In this case, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste seem to be the chief beneficiaries and we might all wonder aloud how that occurred.</P>
      <P>I have nothing much to complain about, although I regret losing Clondalkin.  The separation, however, of Clondalkin and Tallaght is logical.  What is quite illogical is the separation of Rathcoole, Saggart and Brittas.  I hope that in the long-term the commissioners will take account of the local communities' views on this matter that they should be reunited with the Dublin South West constituency.  The dual carriageway is a rational and natural divide and should be maintained in the next boundary revision.</P>
      <P>In the long-term I fear a difficulty in the Dublin area.  I look around with a certain amount of envy at our rural colleagues because the county boundaries are largely respected.  There is a coherence and continuity to the political life of those constituencies even in Deputy Dukes' constituency which was divided but it was still Kildare and there was some level of continuity, cultural and otherwise, to the changes which occurred there. In the Dublin area, the Minister and, indeed, the commission might consider confining the new constituencies to the local authority areas.  South Dublin would have a number of constituencies contained in it as would Dún Laoghaire Rathdown, the corporation area and Fingal.  That would be rational and would provide a level of continuity in that local party members and Members of the Dáil would serve the one broad community represented by a local authority area. That would be a welcome change in the future and would help my colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern.  Some of the divisions in Dublin are unreal and it is not entirely the commissioners fault because they are juggling numbers.</P>
      <P>In the long-term, the Minister might consider fixing the number of Members of the House in his reforms.  We cannot endlessly create more Deputies because the population is increasing and we should address that issue.  The public will not pay for us in the long-term if we keep rapidly reproducing ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important issue is the dual mandate, membership of local authorities and of this House, and I urge the Minister to get rid of it over two electoral cycles.  I would like the Minister to look at the issue of directly elected mayors of local authorities.  It would be good if these constituencies could be defined in the long-term and <Col N="371" /> they should be confined to local authority areas in general or county boundaries outside Dublin.</P>

      <P>Since the first appointment of an independent commission to advise on Dáil constituency boundaries in 1977, it has been the tradition to implement those recommendations without alteration.  It is a wise and well-founded tradition to which we should adhere.  I have not heard a strong or cogent case to depart from tradition on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The commission has done a very competent job within the terms of reference it was given.  The report, contrary to what Deputy Noel Ahern seems to think, is a model of clarity.  It is evident from the report that the commission gave fair consideration to all the possible options it had within the framework of its terms of reference.  It is fair to say it was given a difficult job to do because the terms of reference did not hang together as coherently as one might have liked.</P>
      <P>Given that realistically we will implement the recommendations of the commission and pass this Bill without alteration, any comments made here are made more in the hope that they will be taken into account by a future Government when drawing up terms of reference for a future commission and perhaps by a future commission when making its recommendations.  With that in view, there are some points which call for comment.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael expressed the view that the number of boundary changes to constituencies could be kept to an absolute minimum by the simple expedient of increasing the total membership of this House to 168.  I know the argument is often made that the Dáil is too large and should be reduced to perhaps 100 Members.  There is merit in that argument just as there is merit for keeping the Dáil at its present size.  In our view a proposal to increase membership of the House to 168 for the reasons I briefly outlined would not affect the merits of either of those arguments one way or the other.</P>
      <P>While it is the case, happily, that the overall population is increasing, it is also the case that the centre of gravity of the population continues to shift eastward.  We took the view that there could be a rational distribution of constituencies with minimal changes in boundaries.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to take part in this important debate.  As a Deputy from the Kerry South constituency which relies heavily on the agricultural economy for its survival, I am acutely aware of the need to make every effort to support and maintain the maximum number of farm families on the land while ensuring that farm incomes are brought up to an acceptable level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> A recent study of the South Kerry agricultural economy found that the number of smallholders in the area has decreased substantially in recent years.  In South Kerry one in every five farmers in the region must supplement low income from agriculture with social welfare payments.  Most of these smallholders have disengaged in dairying as a livelihood because their holdings are no longer viable.  About 71 per cent of them operate on holdings of less than 30 hectares.  Given the decline in EU supports the fate awaiting these farmers is bleak.</P>
    <P>My colleague and Labour Party spokesperson for agriculture, Deputy Penrose, last night demonstrated the case for such farmers.  I will add to it by taking up some other important points which in the main focus on the quality of food.  It is of vital importance and, indeed, fundamental to the future of the food industry that a truly independent scheme for guaranteeing the health, safety and quality of farm produce is developed.  Such a quality scheme for meat and meat products, for example, must be part of a national assurance programme for food safety and quality.  To ensure the highest level of acceptance for consumers at home and abroad the scheme must be managed by a truly independent statutory office.  This would ensure that sectoral interests do not exert undue influence.</P>
    <P>The Government has moved to establish the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on a statutory basis.  The ICSA has indicated there should be some liaison between the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  This is the designated independent agency which oversees the implementation of the ISO 9000 range of standards as well as guaranteeing food safety in the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Health and Children.  All interested parties would have a right to consult the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  In any such arrangement groups representing the interests of consumers, food industry employees, the medical profession, scientists, the veterinary profession, farmers as the primary producers and others deemed by the Food Safety Athority of Ireland to be appropriate, could be consulted from time to time.</P>
    <P>The classification of Irish food and food products, including food ingredients, to an internationally recognised standard such as the ISO 9000 standard, which everybody accepts to be a truly objective standard, would increase the confidence and respect of consumers who are extremely important in this matter.  The standard is internationally recognised in the export market and the fact that a significant proportion of Ireland's foreign trade is accounted for by food exports, the ISO 9000 standard has become extremely important.</P>
    <P>Consumers rights must be respected.  I implore the Minister to show his commitment to the farming community, many of whom are in difficult circumstances, and reintroduce the control of farmyard pollution scheme, the dairy hygiene scheme <Col N="374" /> and honour the pre-election promises to various farming organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this debate.  Agriculture is facing a challenging time and unless we develop structures and safeguards to deal with these challenges many farm families will be wiped off the rural landscape.  Rural depopulation and the difficulties in attracting young farmers into farming are already serious problems for the economy.  An ageing farming population coupled with a host of disincentives preventing young people from staying on the land contribute to our inability to meet the demands of highly competitive world markets. The Agenda 2000 proposals will further damage the prospects for farm families.  If they are implemented in full young people will not be attracted into farming.  While most of the proposals in Agenda 2000 will be negative for Ireland, I am particularly concerned at the implications for our beef industry.</P>
      <P>Beef and livestock farming represent our largest farming sector involving 100,000 producers.  If we do not vigorously defend this sector the entire economy will suffer.  In any proposal to deal with the beef sector there will have to be a major effort to deal with the segments of the industry which were totally excluded from the CAP reform package in 1992.  Unless we implement programmes to assist drystock farmers, how will young people be attracted into farming?  A great deal of agricultural policy is centred on the big producer and the factory based producer.  Forage support is £100 per acre.  In this case the winner is the continental producer and the loser is the Irish smallholder.  The new extensification rules are of benefit to factory type feed users but drystock farmers will be the losers.  Agricultural policy must focus on the real needs of farmers.  Beef support must be targeted at drystock farmers and small dairy quota holders.  Every support should be given for grass and silage production and there should be an increase in suckler cow premiums.</P>
      <P>Last night my party colleague, Deputy Penrose, referred to the accelerated fall off in the numbers employed on farms.  According to the first quarterly household survey, published on 26 May, every economic sector, except agriculture, has indicated an increase.  If there were to be job losses on a similar scale in any other industry there would be a public outcry.</P>

      <P>The agriculture industry is a multi-million pound industry here.  Its annual output of approximately £8.8 million provides jobs for more than 195,000 of our citizens.  It is important that we adopt a sensible approach to the development of agriculture and support of the agriculture industry.

      <P>That being said and politics taken out of the equasion, the Government has taken tremendous initiatives with regard to the agriculture industry since taking office.  I commend the Minister for providing additional funding for the headage schemes in the budget.  Those who come from rural constituencies will be aware that support schemes and support structures are essential to the industry.  I commend the Government in providing additional funding for headage payments and also funding for the control of farmyard pollution schemes.  It is easy for the Opposition to be critical but it left the mess and expected Fianna Fáil to tidy it up.  I commend the Government in providing funding for commitments given.  I commend it too on its initiative to support the live export trade.  It is important to have competition in the beef industry but it cannot be developed in the absence of live exports. Will the Minister ensure every effort is made by him and his Department and by the Department of Foreign Affairs to emphasise the importance of live exports?  The initiative involving State assistance for the <i>MV Purbeck</i> was welcome but I hope there will be an extra impetus in ensuring the live export trade is supported and that we get additional markets for our beef.</P>
      <P>The Government has rightly supported the REP scheme.  The Minister of State is involved in rural development and in rural policy making.  I support the REP scheme which has given excellent incentives to farmers and addressed the concerns of the environmental lobby.  I hope more farmers will be included in the scheme because from now on, with the exception of Leader, it will be the only scheme supported by the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have been as critical as any other Member of the House of area aid and the problems that have arisen in that regard.  Those problems caused a great deal of frustration for Members who made inquiries of the area aid unit and with regard to digitalisation.  I am glad we have grasped the nettle and hope we will be in a position to address any problems that may arise in the future.  I commend the Government, and particularly the officials in the Department, for ensuring that so many people have been paid.  More <Col N="376" /> than 10,000 people have been paid in full while the number of queries is in the region of 2,000.</P>
    <P>When new schemes are introduced it is important that, first, we ensure there is a sufficient number of officials to deal with any problems and, second, that farmers are facilitated with regard to their applications.  The number of people available in the Teagasc offices is minimal and consideration should be given to employing additional staff in those offices.</P>
    <P>Some of the regulations that have been introduced in European Union schemes are nonsensical. They do not address the problems of the farmers we represent or those that arise in animal husbandry.  The Minister should examine the possibility of changing some of the regulations. For example, if a person who has moved sheep applies for a ewe premium or a sheep headage payment, he must write to the Department of Agriculture and Food to get permission to do so. That is farcical and should be changed.</P>
    <P>The turn around figure of 21 days with regard to blood samples is fair and reasonable.  Consumer confidence in beef has been restored.  That is obvious when one goes to a restaurant for an evening and discovers that beef is back on the menu.  That is to be welcomed.  I welcome also the initiative by the Food Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>I support young farmers installation aid because it is important that we encourage young people to take up farming.  I am aware it is intended to introduce a targeted scheme.</P>
    <P>The approach to dealing with the problem of farmyard pollution, which will cost millions of pounds to address, should be twofold.  We should offer tax incentives to those who offer to participate in the scheme and grant aid to those who cannot afford to participate in it.</P>
    <P>We need regional policies in the farming sector because my needs in Donegal are not the same as those of the large farmers in the south.  Will the Minister consider coming up with a regional response to the problems in farming?</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this important topic. I fully support the amendment to the motion commending the Government for its positive promotion of the agriculture sector and the leadership the industry has been given since the end of last June by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his Ministers of State.</P>
      <P>Conveniently, the Opposition ignored the progress made by the Minister.  This Government, by its actions, demonstrates clearly its commitment to the agricultural sector and the importance of this sector for the national economy.  The importance of the sector is clear when one considers that the total expenditure of the Department in 1997 exceeded £2 billion.  The importance of the compensatory payments to farmers is underlined by the fact that the £941 million in direct payments amounted to 47 per cent of aggregate farm income in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As public representatives, we are all aware that <Col N="377" /> the administration of the various livestock schemes and the issue of payments has improved. As Deputy Coughlan said, all of us experienced frustration and annoyance in the past with the operation of the schemes.  Obviously any area of public administration can be improved and that is the case with the administration of the various schemes under the Department.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the work of the officials who deal with our representations.  They are courteous and efficient and the recent customer service action plan initiative brought forward by the Minister is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>All of us will recall clearly that this time last year, prior to the change of Government, farming was in a depressed state.  The necessary and welcome improvements that have been made in agriculture in the meantime are due to the efforts of the Minister, his Ministers of State and the Department.</P>

      <P>The facts hurt the Deputies opposite.  I will give them some statistics.  Nothing can demonstrate the marked improvements better than the prices paid to farmers.  This time last year the price of beef was below 79p per pound while the price this year is 90p per pound.  The price of milk in May 1998 was £1.05 per gallon whereas 12 months previously it was under £1 per gallon.  We know who was supposed to be in stewardship of the Department at that time.</P>

      <P>These improvements are obviously not welcomed by Deputy Sheehan but farmers welcome them.  The improvements have contributed to a necessary increase in farm incomes.</P>
      <P>In recent months, many farmers experienced undue delays in having brucellosis tests returned. This caused hardship to many farmers who needed to sell stock.  I welcome the initiatives taken by the Minister to cope with the extra volume of work arising from brucellosis testing.  The news that the processing of blood samples will commence on the date they are received in the laboratory will be welcomed by the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control of farmyard pollution scheme is extremely important.  In less than 12 months in office, the Minister has secured an additional £32.5 million for the scheme, which is welcome.  I <Col N="378" /> urge the Government to make every effort to reopen this scheme for new applicants as soon as possible.  The scheme is of particular importance to my own constituency where agricultural activity is intensive.  Coupled with intensive farming we have drumlin soil which is not free draining and, therefore, additional cattle housing and effluent facilities are needed.</P>
    <P>The farmers I represent want to put in place proper pollution prevention facilities.  Generally, they have small to medium sized holdings and they cannot afford the enormous expenditure that would be involved without grant assistance. The reintroduction of the scheme is vital for the future well-being of many farmers.  The Minister's announcement that he will examine the possibility of funding for more focused schemes to control farmyard pollution and dairy hygiene is welcome.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's ongoing efforts to secure additional markets for cattle and beef will be successful. He continues to address these important issues by seeking more markets and by taking direct action to provide livestock carriage by air and sea.  Indeed, the development of the Lebanon market provides a valuable market for live cattle.</P>

Judging by its record over this short period, I look forward to the day when the industry will make an even greater contribution to our economy.</P>
      <P>A vibrant farming sector is vital to the development of rural Ireland.  The family farm is the cornerstone of rural society.  The position that obtained under the rainbow Administration, when the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry had his hands tied behind his back, was disastrous for farming.  During his term in office the control of farmyard pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes ended.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to the reintroduction of these schemes.</P>

      <P>The Government has also acknowledged the importance of the agriculture and food industry to the economy.  These industries have an annual output of approximately £8.8 million and provide jobs for over 195,000 people. The work of the farming community is at the root of this country's economic success.  Fianna Fáil's agricultural policy shows a strong desire to provide leadership, sensible policy, a regulatory framework and working support to ensure that <Col N="379" /> this important industry continues to play a major part in the developing economy.</P>

      <P>The Minister's improved REPS package will bring close to £205 million per annum to rural economies.  He is also to be commended for his efforts in placing emphasis on ensuring the funding provided under the 1999 Leader programme is utilised before the termination of the 1999 deadline.  His defence of the national interest in CAP reform area by establishing a consultative group from farming, food processing, State agencies and universities to advise him on negotiations as they evolve is important.</P>
      <P>The Government has also taken major steps towards the introduction of animal traceability and quality assurance.  The Food Safety Bill, 1998, provides for the establishment of a Food Safety Authority.  The reorganising of the area aid unit has recently taken place and will ensure farmers will not encounter delays in respect of their 1998 area aid payments.  Significant measures have been introduced to speed up blood tests, including the appointment of 18 extra staff to ensure the processing of samples is commenced on the day they arrive at the laboratory.  Additional funding has been provided for headage payments and for control of farmyard pollution.  Last month, an extra £20 million was provided for control of farmyard pollution.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also worked hard in trying to secure markets for the export of cattle and beef. Ministerial or official delegations have visited Russia, Egypt, Iran, Lebanon and the Gulf States.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is acutely aware of the importance of agriculture to the economy.  His colleagues in the Cabinet and our parliamentary parties <Col N="380" /> support him in his endeavours to fight the cause of farmers to the bitter end.  The Minister does not share the attitude of the previous Minister that the problems which faced Irish farmers in the midst of the BSE crisis and which was not condemned by any of his colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion is a joke in that, when they were in Government, they treated farmers with contempt and brought confidence in the industry to a new low.  Ministers in this Government do not have their hands tied and I do not doubt that the Minister for Agriculture and Food can deliver for the farmer and rural Ireland for the next four years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MildredFox" hpid="Miss Fox Miss Fox">
      <NameTxt>Miss Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on a number of matters mentioned in this motion. While I recognise the Minister for Agriculture and Food has made strides to address some of the matters, there is still a major shortfall in many areas of agriculture and these must be clearly stated so that the situation can be rectified.</P>
      <P>Control of farmyard pollution grants were suspended in April 1995.  My family is involved in the dairy business so I fully appreciate how important these grants are to farmers who need to upgrade their yards.  Many farmyards are in serious need of an overhaul to fall in line with basic and acceptable pollution control.  If there had been a more tightly focused scheme at the time, the bulk of the funding could have gone to the smaller, more disadvantaged farmers who had a greater need to upgrade their farms in the first place.  This would have been a more bottom up approach. However, the position is that hundreds of farmyards need to be upgraded for environmental reasons.  Among these are farms prevented from entering REPS schemes because their farmyards are not up to standard.  In effect, some farmers are being penalised twice because of the suspension of CFPs.  Many feel the cart is being put before the horse.</P>
      <P>Installation aid is another vital grant which has been suspended and this is having a negative effect on the farming community, particularly younger farmers.  I have been in touch with the Minister a number of times in this regard.  We were given a commitment that a more tightly focused scheme would be drawn up between the Departments of Finance and Agriculture and Food.  However, this commitment was given in December and it is now June.  It has been six months since the commitment was given so I ask the Minister to deal with it with greater urgency than before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MildredFox" hpid="Miss Fox Miss Fox">
      <NameTxt>Miss Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not for me to say.  I want it to be dealt with quickly because it is important. Money was allocated for the backlog of files in Teagasc and I have received numerous calls, some as late as today, to say that many files have not been dealt with.  Installation aid is a vital <Col N="381" /> grant for younger farmers.  It is a once-off payment to ensure a lifelong job and it is vital that everything is done to encourage young people to stay on farms and to maintain rural life.</P>
      <P>Regarding third country markets, we cannot hold the Minister responsible for BSE and that Egypt and Libya banned European beef.  I acknowledge efforts are being made to have these markets reopened with various successes such as Lebanon.  I urge the Minister to keep trying.  We are all at one on this: live exports are vital.  I do not understand how we have survived for so long with the restrictions which have been imposed on us.</P>
      <P>The area aid unit has been operating almost as a fire brigade service and that is not acceptable. Instead of closing to clear a backlog of 20,000 files, the office should have remained open to farmers to advise them so that the type of mistakes which caused the backlog in the first place could have been avoided.  Farming has undergone many changes over the past number of years and more forms must be filled out.  This results in payments being delayed for the most ridiculous reasons.  Much of this can be prevented with a little advice and help at crucial times.  The area aid office could not have been closed at a worse time and I would not like to see it happen again.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Government was the first to agree to provide a district veterinary office for Wicklow.</P>

      <P>The situation has deteriorated and farmers now have to drive to Tallaght which is worse than driving to the city centre.  I urge the Minister to provide a temporary office in the meantime to facilitate farmers in their own area. This facility should have been provided years ago.</P>
      <P>Blood tests have taken longer than they should. I have heard numerous farmers complaining that they could not sell cattle because of inexplicable and inexcusable delays.  Results not being returned within 21 or 22 days is unacceptable and inexcusable and I do not want it to happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also had problems with the calf registration centre.  Time and again farmers have had forms returned to them stating they made a mistake. In one case a farmer had a form returned four times stating a mistake had been made.  He sent the form back each time without change and on the fourth occasion obtained the card he originally sought.  What is the excuse for that?  Was a different person working on the fourth occasion? What was the problem?  These are simple administration problems which should not happen but they interfere with the livelihoods of farmers at a <Col N="382" /> time when they need help, not hindrance.  I know the Minister is addressing this problem and I hope the result will be positive and effective.  I will support the Government amendment as the Minister is addressing the problems, particularly farmyard pollution.  However, there is still a long way to go and I will watch with interest.</P>

      <P>I am glad to speak on behalf of small farmers in my constituency.  I come from a county in which rushes and bushes are in plentiful supply as is water.  The problem is that the water is getting dirty and the lakes of Killarney are changing colour.  The reasons for this are known.</P>
      <P>At a time when farmers are coming under increasing pressure from local authorities, investment is critical to the future competitiveness of agriculture.  Young people are running away from farming.  No on-farm investment scheme exists and it is time for the Government to introduce positive measures to encourage people to invest in agriculture and to choose farming as a career.</P>
      <P>We should stop painting a Domesday scenario for agriculture.  Instead we should focus on developing policies which will ensure a vibrant agricultural sector into the next century.  The starting point must be the immediate introduction of the dairy hygiene, control of farmyard pollution and installation aid schemes.  This would encourage young farmers to invest in their business.</P>
      <P>An estimated £120 million would be generated in Kerry under the REPS scheme in five years if the CFP was reintroduced.  These schemes will not only benefit farmers but also the rural economy and the environment.  Farmers have shown their commitment to controlling pollution by investing almost £2 billion in farm building equipment since 1990, supporting more than 6,000 rural jobs in construction.  I am concerned that farm investment has fallen from £330 million in 1995 to an estimated £150 million in 1998.  These figures show a lower level of confidence in the industry.  The Government and the Minister must address this problem.</P>
      <P>Ireland must support its farmers given the importance of agriculture to the economy and the protection of the environment and the role of farmers in maintaining viable rural communities. The Government must ensure that adequate funds are made available without delay to reopen on-farm investment schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to strike a balance in this debate between laying legitimate criticism on a Government which is lethargic and indifferent to the plight of agriculture and avoiding talking down an industry which is going through a serious crisis.  That industry could go into a tail spin as a result of loose talk.  There is a serious crisis in agriculture but it is an industry creating a lifestyle which should be encouraged as it offers great potential for young people if managed properly.</P>
      <P>One indicator of the extent of the crisis is that approximately 5,000 people leave agriculture every year and only 600 or 700 are entering.  The result is that the average age of Irish farm holders is about the highest in the EU and the percentage of Irish farmers under 35 who own their farms is the lowest at 12 per cent.  These are frightening statistics if we want to rejuvenate agriculture and give it a future.</P>
      <P>One of the most depressing signals sent out by the Government was the abolition of the installation aid scheme, not so much in the numbers affected but by the nature of the signal.  In recent years this scheme has not been a huge driving force in terms of young farmers entering agriculture. That is probably because it was not index linked and never reached the proper levels.  If it had been indexed linked it would probably have been in the region of £10,000 or £12,000 rather than £5,600 when the scheme was terminated. The abolition of the scheme was a retrograde indicator to the industry and the Minister should re-examine the situation urgently.  We cannot afford the open chequebook which the Independent Deputies are giving the Government on these schemes.  We have had promises of DVO offices in Wicklow and commitments to reintroduce installation aid but nothing has happened. Until such time as we see positive signals the unquestioning support of the Independent Deputies should be withheld.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given a commitment to relocate the DVO office in Cork city to Clonakilty. This has incensed the majority of farmers in the area as it is seen as a home town decision by the Minister.  It has outraged the county executive of the IFA and most farmers in the region.  Notwithstanding that the Clonakilty Show Society and a number of other town based organisations may welcome the relocation of staff to Clonakilty, it is a huge inconvenience for the majority of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone who lobbied for the relocation of the DVO office from Cork city did so because the city was inaccessible &mdash; there were problems with traffic, office opening hours, parking etc.  To travel to Clonakilty from Carriganimmy, Macroom, Ballyvourney, Cúil Aodha, Clondrohid, Coachford and Dunmanway is a greater inconvenience. Given the amount of time it has taken to relocate the office to Clonakilty it is probable that the Minister is announcing this in the hope of picking up some kudos in his home town.  However, he should reconsider.  It would be easy to say it should be located in my constituency but I will <Col N="384" /> not do so.  However, all of the lobby groups ask that it be relocated to a central location accessible to all, namely, Bandon.</P>
    <P>Legitimate criticism has been levied during this debate on a series of matters outlined in the motion: installation aid, dairy hygiene, control of farmyard pollution and live exports.  Prior to the last election and during the election campaign, for electoral purposes Fianna Fáil and the present Minister cynically exploited an industry which was and still is in difficulty.  Since taking office the Government has done nothing to address these issues.  A cast iron guarantee was given to the IFA, ICMSA and Macra na Feirme that the installation aid scheme would remain in place if Fianna Fáil was returned to Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It was also stated that the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme would be reintroduced immediately and that the latter would cost only £5 million to cover outstanding applicants.  It was claimed that it was only a matter of removing Democratic Left and the Labour Party from Government and live export markets would reopen.  I accept that these are difficult issues as they involve considerable finance.  However, the manner in which expectations were raised and dashed is unforgivable and the farming community is very reluctant to forgive the Government.</P>
      <P>There is a significant danger that because the sheep meat sector is not mentioned in Agenda 2000, the Santer proposals, it will be neglected and measures proposed for dairy and beef will not impact on sheep &mdash; nothing could be further from the truth.  It is time that we looked for a flat rate ewe premium.  The manner in which the ewe premium is calculated has to be revisited in the present round of Structural Funds negotiations. It should be calculated with reference to what is happening in the marketplace both here and in Britain rather than in the entire 15 member states.  Prices are significantly lower here than in continental Europe.  The previous Government made submissions on this issue which, as we are aware from replies given at Question Time, the Minister is continuing to pursue.</P>
      <P>The process of establishing the third tier of disadvantaged areas which is of critical importance to sheep farmers in remote areas was delayed for a long period by the debate on special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas.  Now that those matters have been resolved it is time the process was completed.</P>
      <P>On traceability in the sheep sector, it is not possible to have an individual tagging system for sheep, particularly mountain herds.  While traceability is essential from the point of view of quality, it is also important that the system works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the dairy sector, a 1 per cent increase flies in the face of the commitments given in 1984 when the quota regime was introduced.  It has <Col N="385" /> been calculated that the dairy sector is six times more important to the Irish economy than to any other member state.  It is, therefore, legitimate to seek six times more than the maximum increase offered to any other member state.  An 8 per cent increase is being offered to hill farmers in Austria and Finland.  That is way off the mark in terms of what is needed here.  Many farmers are being forced out of dairy production because of inadequate quotas.  If we could secure a significant once-off increase in milk quota and redistribute it among smaller dairy farmers, it would be a job well done.  Nothing less would be acceptable.</P>

From the content of their contributions, Deputies Fox and Healy-Rae will find it difficult to support the Government amendment.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the general election all we saw on television were the Shandon Bells.  Unfortunately, the new messiah has turned out to be a false god.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, is aware, members of the agricultural community have good memories.  As he meanders his way through the villages of south Tipperary, he must be aware of the effect the slump in the industry is having on local communities.  Small garages and hardware stores are being boarded up thanks to the policies being pursued by the Government.</P>
      <P>On 3 February I highlighted on the Adjournment the difficulties being experienced in County Wicklow under the REP scheme.  I was informed in reply that the scheme was being reviewed and that an announcement would be made in the near future.  Approximately 300 farmers are caught in the trap.  I look forward to the problems being solved.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the general election a commitment was given to open a district veterinary office in County Wicklow.  All that is required is a little office, a little computer, a little desk and two members of staff.  I do not know what the difficulty is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The Government has failed to honour its commitments on the charter of rights introduced by Deputy Yates when Minister.  Farmers have <Col N="386" /> experienced difficulties this year in obtaining payments. There is a possibility that many of them will end up receiving double payments.  The Department should be aware of this from a taxation point of view.</P>

      <P>The motion calls on us to condemn the Government for its failure to honour its pre-election promises to provide funding in four major areas and to further condemn it for its failure to act in five other areas.  The Government, on the other hand, wants us to commend it on its efforts.  This is laughable.</P>
      <P>On 21 May 1997 Fianna Fáil's policy officer issued a memo on installation aid in which it was stated that Fianna Fáil was committed to the continuation of the scheme which it considered was of importance not only to young farmers but also to the general profile of agriculture.  It went on to state that Fianna Fáil would seek as a matter of urgency a review of the extension clause.  On 7 August 1997 the Minister issued a press release in which it was stated that the scheme was being suspended from that date.  As no warning was given, there was panic throughout rural Ireland. It was one of the fastest U-turns ever.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been asked many times by Members on all sides of the House to reintroduce the scheme.  He indicated on 7 October 1997 that he would not do so.  On 17 February, however, he said that the Department was in the process of drawing up a revised scheme targeted at smaller farmers and that meetings were being arranged with the farming organisations to discuss the revision of the existing scheme.</P>
      <P>On 19 February the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, said that the installation aid scheme had been a major success, that a meeting with Macra na Feirme would take place the following week to gain agreement for the introduction of a new and more focused scheme and that he would approach the European Commission to ensure a revised scheme would be approved as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>On 7 May Deputy Fox reported that the real Cabinet had met with the Minister before the budget.  Like Deputy Healy-Rae, she was feeling the heat and raised the matter on the Adjournment. We are approaching the end of the year and I can see this dragging on until September.  If the so called Independent Deputies vote with the Government tonight, they will be voting in favour of what the Government has done and has not done over the past ten months.  It has betrayed young farmers and sent out a signal that they do not count.  The Minister is responsible for a flight from the land by future farmers the likes of which we have not seen in decades.  The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, should not laugh since this is a serious matter.</P>

I will end on a positive note.  I hope that before the Dáil rises the Minister will announce the reintroduction of a new and focused scheme.  We have been waiting long enough for it.  I hope the pressure being brought to bear on the Minister and the Government will work and that that scheme will be reintroduced before long.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I compliment Deputy Connaughton on tabling this motion.  I wish to refer to area aid.  Farmers were very concerned when the area aid section closed down and no calls were taken about area aid queries by the Department. In the past fortnight many of those problems have been cleared up and many farmers have been paid.  However, the Minister indicated last night that farmers who had outstanding problems concerning area aid should contact the area aid section.  In every district office one member of staff should be responsible for dealing with outstanding queries on area aid.  If that was done, the outstanding problems could be dealt with in a month.  It is not practicable for farmers to spend half their day on the telephone.  I must compliment the staff in the area aid section who have been excellent.  They have been most helpful to Deputies who have contacted them.  That proposal would be one way to address this matter. The Minister said last night that he is anxious to deal with the outstanding queries and to make a fresh start.</P>
      <P>It is vital for dry stock farmers from my constituency that the control of farm pollution scheme should be reintroduced to allow at least 1,000 dry stock farmers to qualify for REPS.  That would mean a difference in income for them of £3,500 per year.  That vital section of the farming community has been badly hit.  Those farmers and their families are concerned about their future and the Minister should be conscious of their needs in the present negotiations.</P>

      <P>The Government's agricultural policy is in a shambles.  A promise was made to every farmer in May l997 in a glossy election pamphlet, with a photograph of the Minister and one of the Taoiseach on the front of it, that within six weeks of being elected to office they would resume the live cattle trade with Libya, Egypt, <Col N="388" /> Iran, Iraq and Russia.  Some 13 months later not one live animal has been exported to those countries and the Minister has not visited Russia, Iraq, Iran or Libya.  He went to Egypt, but he came back empty handed and with no promises.  What about the rosy promises the Minister and the Taoiseach made to the farming community? Farmers were led up the garden path by promises made in that glossy Fianna Fáil election manifesto.</P>
      <P>The Minister scuttled the farm installation grants by a stroke of a pen last August.  I warned him at the presentation of certificates to young farmers in Bandon last September that the decision would have disastrous effects on the numbers entering agricultural colleges.  My advice to the Minister has been vindicated with the 9 per cent reduction in the number of entrants to agricultural colleges.  Young farmers have lost confidence in the Government's ability to restore farming to the level at which it should be.</P>
      <P>The Minister boasted in his address last night that he had established a trial run of 2,000 live cattle to the Lebanon.  One week's mart in Bandon and Skibbereen, which are in the Minister's constituency, would fill that order.  We should be exporting at least 400,000 cattle on the hoof to those countries.  I am a firm believer that competition is the life of trade.  Unless there is competition for meat factories, farmers will not get a viable price for their product.</P>
      <P>Farmers with less than a 30,000 gallon milk quota should not be penalised if they exceed that quota.  Everybody knows that any farmer who produces less than that quota is not in a viable position.  I do not know how the Minister came back from Europe without securing an extra milk quota when Italy appears to have gained millions of gallons in extra quota.  It drove roughshod through every rule the EU ever made in regard to quotas, and it was rewarded by the EU authorities for doing so.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil in its election manifesto stated that it would introduce a third tier headage payment for farmers, but there is no talk of that promise now.  The Government has fallen into a slumber.  Swift action is needed if the farming industry is to survive.  Will we see vast tracts of land from Malin to Mizen Head turned into a <Col N="389" /> wilderness for wildlife to breed and multiply and create a safari park for wealthy Europeans to enjoy in the future?  Will we see rural Ireland reduced to parish ranchers?  Judging by current trends this seems to be the policy of the Government. I urge the Minister to wake up before it is too late.  We need action, not rosy projections and pie in the sky promises.  I am delighted my colleague from across the county boundary, Deputy Healy-Rae, is present.  I urge him to think of the plight of small farmers in his constituency which is similar to that of small farmers in south west Cork whom I represent.  There is nothing between Deputy Healy-Rae and myself but the tunnel between Cork and Kerry.  I ask the Deputy to give the Government a sudden jerk and vote with us in order to wake the Minister from his slumber. It is only by giving such an injection that the Government will return to reality.  I urge the Deputy to think before he enters the division lobbies. I urge Deputy Fox, who was promised a DVO office for her constituency, to do likewise. Promises are made to be broken.</P>

      <P>On the scheme to buy out Land Commission annuities introduced by the Minister's predecessor, Mr. Hyland, some years ago, at that time a substantial number of farmers availed of the scheme which was very successful. For up to five years Land Commission annuity demands were not sent to farmers &mdash; I am sure the Minister is aware of this.  I have been approached by three farmers in recent weeks who have received demands covering all the arrears plus interest.  It is very unfair to suddenly land a farmer with these bills for that period.  Some of the demands have been for up to £7,000.  Not much attention has been paid to the issue but I ask the Minister's officials to examine it.  I can give details of two cases to the Minister and I have been told details of two more cases are being sent to me.  It is an urgent matter.  One person who is advanced in years and who never owed money to anybody received a bill.  It was a terrible shock to him.  I will contact the Minister's office about that but I would like him to publicly address the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is major concern in the farming community regarding installation aid.  It only amounted to £5,600 but would be far more if it had been maintained.  Quite a number of electoral areas in my constituency have suffered a serious decline in population, amounting to approximately 15 per cent in one area and 9 per cent in another.  Most of the decline is the result of the absence of regeneration in the agriculture sector.  There is a serious problem in rural areas which are being depopulated.  One can talk about all the glowing schemes and incentives in the context of Europe, but unless Europe wakes up to what is happening &mdash; I think a similar problem is evident in other countries &mdash; we will be left with large centres of population and very few people living in rural areas.  If we do not take the initiative by trying to encourage young people to enter <Col N="390" /> agriculture a debate of this nature in ten years' time will certainly not attract the same level of interest evident tonight because many more people will have left agriculture.  The responsible authorities will ignore the problem at their peril.</P>
    <P>We must examine farmyard pollution control. Over a number of years we saw what happened in terms of the level of fish kills.  We have been fortunate in this regard so far this year.  However, it is a serious matter and if we do not look after our environment, rivers and lakes, and unless farmers are provided with finance to carry out the necessary work, we will all be facing failure.  The Government will fail in its duty if it does not restore farmyard pollution control grants, something it promised to do.  Fish kills and other problems arise because farmers do not have finance to invest in and carry out essential control, including provision of proper slurry tanks and proper drainage, in accordance with departmental guidelines under professional guidance.</P>
    <P>The motion is important and I congratulate Deputy Connaughton on moving it.</P>

More seriously, money was not provided when the Government knew the available installation aid would run out after August and money was not allocated for it in the budget.</P>

This support is expressed practically and at significant cost in national and EU funds through a wide range of measures aimed at ensuring our agricultural sector is strong, competitive and contributes fully and positively to the overall rural economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, set out in some detail the range of issues raised by the Opposition in the motion and I do not propose to repeat these points.  Unfortunately, most of what we heard from the Opposition in the debate was detached from reality.  Its comments have been ill informed and misleading, serving only to give a negative impression of farming and rural areas.  Deputies referred to the decline in the number of farmers. It is true that the number of people whose main source of income is derived from farming and <Col N="391" /> related activities declined from 237,100 in 1975, shortly after entry to the EU, to 137,000 in 1997. This decline has continued under all Governments and is an international phenomenon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The farming population is falling in all developed countries.  What is exceptional about Ireland is that farming still accounts for 7.2 per cent of employment, far higher than in most other developed countries.  These figures under-state the role of agriculture in terms of total employment as a large number of people who work part-time in the sector are not taken into account.  Figures from the CSO show that in 1996, 301,000 people worked full-time or part-time on farms, the equivalent of 223,400 full-time jobs. Family farm workers account for 92 per cent of this employment.</P>
      <P>Looking at farms as distinct from farm population we can see that in the period 1992-6 while there has been a decrease in the number of small uneconomic holdings of less than ten hectares, the number of farms over 30 hectares has increased over the same period.  This is not the pattern one would expect from a sector in decline.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it is remarkable that more than 40 per cent of the population still lives in rural areas.  The rural population has remained steady at approximately 1.5 million people over recent decades.  The 1996 census shows the population in many rural areas is increasing.  Where decline is occurring, it is a matter of real concern and the Government is pursuing policies to promote the revitalisation of these areas.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the issue of the pig salmonella control programme which was referred to in the House yesterday.  Salmonella is a common problem in pigs world-wide.  Four countries have implemented comprehensive control programmes including Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Ireland and a number of countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, are considering establishing such programmes.  A survey to establish the level of salmonella in the Irish pig herd was completed in late February 1997.  Tests were carried out on samples from the animals' gastrointestinal tracts and salmonella was isolated in between 12 to 13 per cent of the samples taken.  A total of 1,282 samples were taken from 225 pig herds.  It is important to understand that samples were taken from the gastrointestinal tract and that slaughter hygiene is aimed at preventing contamination of the edible parts of the carcase from such sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to reduce the potential for problems where such contamination occurs, the salmonella control programme was established in July 1997 in conjunction with the industry to reduce further levels of salmonella at farm level.  I am, therefore, satisfied the Department has taken the correct <Col N="392" /> measures to identify the problem and minimise any risks to consumers.  The greatest risk of salmonella poisoning arises from the handling of the product at post-retail stage and it is thus essential every precaution is taken to ensure proper cooking and the avoidance of cross-contamination of all meats, including pig meat.  This issue was discussed on the radio this morning and the incorrect impression may have been given about the industry.  The House will be aware the Bill on the Food Safety Authority was published recently and is currently at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies raised the issue of rural poverty. I agree that a real problem exists among some farmers in relation to low incomes.  The Government is specifically committed, under Partnership 2000, to examining the issue of poverty in farming households.  In that context, we will be co-operating with the Combat Poverty Agency which is undertaking a review of farm income support policy in the context of targeting resources at low income farm households.  My Department is also reviewing the position for the purposes of the preparation of the forthcoming national development plan under the next round of Structural Funds and in the context of the preparation of the White Paper on rural development which will be published towards the end of this year.  A total of 166 submissions have been received to date in regard to the White Paper and a further round of discussions will take place with some individual organisations.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the Opposition's analysis of rural poverty has been to blame the decline of farm income levels.  Facts show that agricultural income increased in the years 1991-6 with an overall increase of 36 per cent for the period or 22 per cent in real terms.  Unfortunately, farm income declined in 1997 by 4.5 per cent from £2,092 million in 1996 to £1,999 million in 1997. That was very disappointing, particularly in view of the good performance in incomes over the previous five years.  A positive aspect was the further increase in the amount of direct income payments made to farmers which, in 1997, reached a record £940 million or 47 per cent of farm income.  This amount represents an increase of more than 132 per cent since 1992.  It is a remarkable degree of direct public subsidy which is unmatched in any other sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>In considering farm incomes, it is important to recognise the degree of integration of Irish agriculture into the wider rural and national economy. A new model of agriculture is developing which offers a far more realistic opportunity of promoting rural development than ever before and farmers are central to that development.  Primary agriculture and the food industry will always be the backbone of the rural economy although an ever increasing diversity of manufacturing and service activities is now found in rural Ireland as our economy grows.  The tremendous growth in the economy and employment in recent years has benefited many rural families, including farm families.  A positive aspect is that many <Col N="393" /> farmers, including young farmers and young members of farming families, are finding employment and are protecting their position in rural Ireland by doing so.  We must welcome this unreservedly as it affords added protection for a fuller level of rural development.</P>

I want to comment on the management and organisation of the Department of Agriculture and Food and its staff in delivering the service farmers require.

      <P>Farm inspections are taking place after the due date has passed for applications under the ten and 22 month schemes.  I fear what will happen when a Minister, who negotiated the MacSharry reform proposals which had such a disastrous effect on this country, is in the front line for the negotiation of Agenda 2000 and I fear for the future of the farming community because of the Minister's inability to manage his Department.  I have no doubt the Minister's junior colleagues are doing their best but I do not believe proper leadership is being given or that the will exists on the part of the majority of departmental staff to deliver necessary services.  Many farmers are so frustrated by this that they are contemplating getting out of agriculture and I regret that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil was in Opposition, 2,000 or 3,000 angry farmers gathered outside the Davenport Hotel and Deputy Cowen outlined what the party would do for farmers.  The following year, Deputy Walsh travelled throughout the country telling farmers how bad the then Minister, Deputy Yates, was and making promises about what Fianna Fáil would do in office.  When <Col N="394" /> Deputy Walsh was appointed Minister for Agriculture and Food, officials within the Department took out the champagne having found a Minister they could lead rather than one who would lead them.</P>
    <P>The first disaster since the Minister took up office involved a reduction of £22 million in the Department's Estimates.  Next we were told that area aid would be dealt with.  I have never seen such a disaster in agriculture or as many people waiting for payments.  The issue of payments was only resolved in the past few weeks.  I second Deputy Belton's proposal that one member of staff in each office be designated to deal with area aid.</P>
    <P>The next disaster was the blood testing.  Farmers are outraged that, having been told that blood test results would be returned within seven or eight days, they have to wait up to 26 days for the results.  That is disgraceful.  The appeals section of the Department is another problem.  There are appeals with that section for up to nine months. Is anybody doing anything about them?  Must people wait that length for appeals to be dealt with even though they were told they would be dealt with quickly?  Nothing is happening.</P>
    <P>During the general election campaign letters were sent to my constituents bearing a picture of Deputy De Rossa with a sheep over his shoulder which said &ldquo;what will this man do for agriculture?&rdquo; I have met many farmers from the west who would give anything to have Deputy De Rossa appointed Minister for Agriculture and Food.  He is certainly better than the wise man from the south.  The three wise men came from the east bearing gold, frankincense and myrrh, but the three wise men from the south have only brought disaster after disaster since they came into office.</P>
    <P>Think about the weather we enjoyed in April, May and June last year.  The election was held on 6 June and it resulted in a new Government and a new Minister for Agriculture and Food.  What has happened since?  It has not stopped raining. The Government has even destroyed the weather.</P>
    <P>Now people declare that they wish Deputy Yates was Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I have good news for them.  There is an even better man than Deputy Yates, a man who understands agriculture and rural life.  He is the future Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Connaughton. When he returns to Agriculture House, farmers' problems will be resolved.  There has been nothing but problems with this Government.</P>
    <P>What about live cattle exports?  During the election campaign I thought Fianna Fáil would use the Government jet every night to bring cattle out of the country, they were so concerned about this problem.  What has happened since?  Nothing. In the Davenport Hotel Deputies Walsh and Cowen frothed at the mount when they spoke about this issue.  I expected that with the Government <Col N="395" /> jet and the Deputies carrying a few cattle themselves there would be no further problems.</P>
    <P>The farmers are waiting for the Fianna Fáil Deputies to campaign for election.  There is even a problem tonight.  If there is one thing Deputy Healy-Rae can do, it is talk.  That is also true of Deputy Fox.  However, I doubt that either spoke for longer than one and a half minutes in this debate because they had nothing positive to say about agriculture.  The only reason they did not decide to bring down the Government on agriculture is that they want to get through the summer first.</P>
    <P>We should be ready for an election in October or November.  When the Independent Deputies return to their constituents this weekend the farming community will demand that they do something for them.  Deputy Healy-Rae claimed that he represented small farmers.  He represented nobody but himself tonight.  If he wants to represent small farmers he should vote with the Opposition on this motion.  It probably will not bring down the Government but it will give the Taoiseach a fright.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when he was simply Deputy Ahern, preached a great deal about what he would do for rural Ireland.  He promised a western development commission even though the previous Government had appointed a Minister of State to look after western development.  He said in Westport, at a meeting of his Front Bench, that the first thing he would do in office would be to abolish that office.  He did that but he still has not established the western development commission and people are now threatening to resign.</P>
    <P>I could speak for a long time about farm incomes.  A recent report of a national farm survey carried out from 1992 to 1996 revealed that 30 per cent of family farms are viable, 26 per cent were classified as under pressure and the remainder were classified as unviable with limited resources.  The industry requires new ideas from Agriculture House.  We must help and encourage young people to stay on the land and we must put policies in place to do that.  Many of the grants that were available must be reintroduced and social welfare officers in north Mayo should not be allowed to count the sheep, cattle, pigs and ducks.  That must stop.</P>
    <P>I could speak for much longer but I must allow Deputy Connaughton to conclude the debate. The farmers are waiting for Deputy Connaughton and this party to get back into Government because the three wise men from the south have let them down badly.</P>

      <P>I thank Members who contributed to this debate.  The Opposition and the Government might not agree on many of the <Col N="396" /> issues discussed but it is most important that this debate was held.</P>
      <P>I attended the committee meeting today to discuss the revised Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The Minister openly admitted that he would hold a series of bilateral talks with the Minister for Finance over the next few days to secure the moneys he needs for his Department over the next 12 months.  A number of vitally important issues have been discussed at length in this debate.  However, the proposed reductions in expenditure in the revised Estimate are revealing.  Farm investment has been reduced from £67 million to £36 million.  Grant aid for less favoured areas was reduced by 13 per cent and there was a 6 per cent reduction in investment in alternative enterprises.  Funding for every farming enterprise that required investment was reduced by this Government.</P>
      <P>The Government removed 9 per cent from the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The reason for the reduction was the insertion of an allocation of £9.7 million to pay for the beef tribunal.  Can the Minister of State expect a small farmer in County Clare, who legitimately believes he or she should have received a farm installation aid grant of a measly £5,600, to understand that?  Now we know where that £5,600 went.  What about a small farmer in west Cork who has 20 or 30 cows and needs a dairy hygiene grant to stay in business?  He could not get that grant aid this year because the Government decided to pay it to the lawyers involved in the beef tribunal.</P>

      <P>Contrast that with the action taken by the Minister for Defence who had to deal with Army deafness claims.  The claims involved huge amounts of money.  The money was found to pay the claims but the Minister did not take it from the Estimate for the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>No matter what happens, there is a reduction in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food because this Government does not take agriculture seriously.  Many farmers will be livid tomorrow when they discover that the money they were due to be paid has been transferred to that subhead.  It is intolerable and the Government should be ashamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House is a political issue.  Deputies are in Government to make choices. Over the next couple of months the members of the Government will be able to prove, once and for all, whether this Government is interested in agriculture.  Its first year has been a disaster from the point of view of investment. The Minister has not done well so far but we will give him a chance.  However, if no on-farm investment scheme is put in place, whether it is for control <Col N="397" /> of farmyard pollution or installation aid, on the next occasion this matter is debated, the farmers will deal with the Government in their own way.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a special plea.  This issue is about politics and choices.  I call on the three Independent Deputies, Deputies Fox, Healy-Rae and Blaney, to take a stand on this issue.  They also have farmers in their constituencies who have the same problems.  They should not be tied to this Government on every issue &mdash; they said <Col N="398" /> they would not be.  I cannot think of a more important issue on which to send a signal to the Government that they are not prepared to put up with it.  In fairness, they went half way, but that is no good to a farmer who should get on-farm investment or a young farmer who should get installation aid.  The half promises we heard tonight are not good enough.  I hope that when they go up to the lobby tonight they will turn the right way.</P>

      <P>I had said that by adding two Members to the total membership of the House, as proposed by Fine Gael, there could be a rational distribution of constituencies with minimal change in boundaries and no change in representation. Everybody would see that as a modest proposal and a reasonable approach to the matter, but unfortunately the commission took a different view.</P>
      <P>I would point out to future Governments and commissions the question of the distribution of constituencies.  There are still five two-county five seat constituencies.  Carlow-Kilkenny is a little more than two counties since it also includes part of County Wicklow.  Two-county constituencies are difficult to manage, as you will know.  It is difficult for Deputies, party organisations and sometimes electors who find themselves influencing the outcome of an election in a county other than their own with which they feel very little affinity.  Longford-Roscommon is a case in point. There is very little link between the two counties in affinity, topography, their economic base or their interests.  One is in Connacht while the other is in Leinster.  Although they both border the Shannon, that river divides them.  I regard that constituency as the most anomalous in the current structure.</P>
      <P>A new constituency has been created in Dublin Mid-West.  The constitution of that constituency affects two of the current constituencies, Dublin South-West and Dublin West.  The boundaries of those three constituencies depart substantially from any obvious natural or man-made divisions. I have a great deal of sympathy for people feeling dislocated, a feeling articulated by people of many political parties in the Rathcoole and Saggart areas.  There will almost certainly be further changes in the boundaries of those three constituencies at the next revision of constituency boundaries. I suppose I should extend sympathy to the electors and Deputies in Dublin North-East, Dublin North-Central, Dublin Central, Dublin North-West &mdash; particularly Deputy De Rossa &mdash; and Dublin North, where there have been a number of boundary adjustments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as we have a mixture of three, four and five seat constituencies we should try to construct the system rationally.  In theory at least, five seat <Col N="400" /> constituencies should be a feature of heavily populated urban areas, three seat constituencies should be a feature of relatively thinly populated rural areas, with four seat constituencies, which are an aberration, somewhere in the middle.  That is not the way the constituencies are distributed. Of the 12 constituencies in Dublin county, three are five seaters, five are four seaters and four are three seater constituencies.  That sum might not add up, but I think it makes the point.  That is not a rational structure of constituencies.</P>
    <P>The rural constituencies of Mayo, Galway West, Cavan-Monaghan, Laoighis-Offaly, Carlow-Kilkenny, Wicklow and Meath are all five seat constituencies.  Mayo has probably the largest constituency land area in the country. Whether by accident, design or the innate cuteness of the people, the most logical distribution seems to be in County Cork, where there are two five seat constituencies in the city and two three seater and one four seater in the county.  It would be interesting to know the result of a concentration of five seat constituencies in heavily populated urban areas and a concentration of three seaters in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Bill has given rise to another round of discussion on electoral reform, much of which is very fanciful.  We cannot simply impose our current pattern of voting and structure of constituencies on another model of constituencies and claim one party would dominate and another would be annihilated.  That is not the way people vote.  If we changed the configuration of constituencies, there would be a noticeable change in the way people vote, even if only for tactical reasons.</P>
    <P>I utterly reject the proposition that is frequently and glibly made that multi-seat constituencies give rise to clientelism.  Single seat constituencies are just as likely to give rise to it.  In a single seat constituency councillors, snapping at one's heels wanting to take one's seat, will not go away.  If we are to debate the relative merits of different types of electoral systems, we should do so on the basis of reality, not myth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this debate.  Since 1997 we have put all changes to constituencies on a sound legislative footing.  I welcome the legislation that was put in place in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of the commission's report, it is obvious that Dublin is the poor relation.  In terms of variation from the national average, in every Dublin constituency except one the number of Deputies to the number of electors is much greater than in any other electoral district.  Every constituency in Dublin, except Dublin North-Central, is under represented in the Dáil.  There has been massive expansion of the city of Dublin over the past 15 years, but it has not been allocated additional seats.  In contrast, every Cork constituency has an over representation of Deputies in terms of the number of electors.  That matter must be addressed following the next census. <Col N="401" /> Dublin should have more Deputies representing its constituencies.  The matter was referred to on the last occasion we held a census and at the last revision of constituency boundaries, but nothing has been done.  At least one extra seat should have been given to the Dublin constituencies to reflect population growth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes referred to the new constituency of Dublin Mid-West.  A large proportion of the Dublin South-West constituency, which I have the privilege of representing, has been transferred into the new constituency of Dublin Mid-West, taking in the large conurbation of Clondalkin, Lucan and the villages of Rathcoole, Saggart, Brittas and Newcastle.  There is a sense of complete disbelief that Saggart, Brittas and Rathcoole, which have much closer connections with the Tallaght area, have been hived off into the Dublin Mid-West constituency.  One would not need an expert to tell us the most obvious distinguishable physical division between the two constituencies is the Naas Road.  Saggart, Brittas and Rathcoole have no connection with the large conurbation of Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>This sense of disbelief was appropriately expressed in a recent unique letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> which carried the signatures of parties as diverse as Sinn Féin and the Fine Gael Party.  We should take note when parties of such a diverse nature and origin agree on a matter.  There is a palpable sense of disbelief in those rural communities that they are to be part of the new Dublin Mid-West constituency.  It does not even look right on a map.  I told the constituents involved, which I will have the privilege to represent until the next election when I will stand in the Dublin South-West constituency, that I would articulate their views in the Dáil.  Their views have also been endorsed by the district councils in Saggart and Rathcoole. Even though the Tallaght-Rathcoole local division is different from the Clondalkin area, the new constituency straddles those divides.  That is something we have been trying to move from.  I cannot understand why it has occurred.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's contribution in the Seanad, he referred to the idea that in future local or general elections photographs of candidates would appear on ballot papers.  Will the Minister throw some light on the subject in his summation?  I think that is the way to go and I encourage the Minister to do it, as we are living in a visual age. While people may not recognise candidates' names, they might recognise their pictures.  We must do everything in our power to ensure that voters can discern between different candidates.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister comment on the Laver report produced last week, in the light of his own rather courageous views on the matter?  In Opposition and Government the Minister has been ploughing a lone furrow and I compliment him for doing so. We need more individual views from all sides of the House.  When the Minister sent a questionnaire to colleagues last year it provoked a response.  The Minister may wish to comment on <Col N="402" /> the significance, or otherwise as he sees it, of the report issued by Professor Laver and his colleagues for the All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all heard the aphorism of US Congressman, Tipp O'Neill, to the effect that all politics is local.  There is certainly nothing more local, politically speaking, than the redrawing of constituency boundaries.  There is also nothing more fatal to the future political ambitions of those who find that constituency boundaries have been redrawn to their disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I note that there are not many people in the House.  Those present are Deputies who are directly concerned by the redrawing of the boundaries and I confess to be one of them.  Politics is a hard game and we have seen the most capable of Deputies, through no fault of their own, being put out of politics because constituency boundaries are redrawn.  That is one of the hardest ways for some Deputies to go.</P>
      <P>To some extent, members of an independent commission whose recommendations are automatically accepted, play God with our futures and our ambitions.  I, of course, support the independent commission and it is right to accept that body's recommendations.  However, I cannot help but remember the story about an unsuccessful candidate in an American election who said, &ldquo;The people have spoken and, of course, I accept their verdict.  Damn them&rdquo;.  I feel like saying, &ldquo;The commission has spoken and, of course, I accept the verdict.  Bless them&rdquo;.  That is the reality of the situation.  We must accept where the dice falls and I have no problem with that.</P>
      <P>When I first stood for election in this jurisdiction, I was in a five-seater constituency in Dublin west.  It then became a four-seater and is now a three-seater.  If I was practising my profession of politics north of the Border, in the days when the Unionists were in control and we did not have an independent commission, I would have got the message very clearly by now.</P>
      <P>I accept the independence of the commission but, as Deputy Conor Lenihan said, I have also noticed that the two people who will gain most as a result of the commission's recommendations are the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  I have also noted the, presumably divinely inspired, forecast of certain Fianna Fáil Deputies &mdash; made some six weeks before the report was published &mdash; that there would be two three-seaters in west Dublin.</P>
      <P>I wonder about three-seat constituencies in large urban areas, particularly in Dublin.  In Northern Ireland there are now 18 six-seater constituencies to make it as democratic as possible and to make sure that minority interests are represented as much as possible.  In that context, the increase of three-seaters in Dublin is not a move towards democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When my constituency was a five-seater I could be in any part of the constituency in about 25 minutes, because of the toll bridge.  Now I can be <Col N="403" /> in any part of Dublin west and most parts of Dublin mid-west in 15 minutes.  There are more houses being built around Dublin 15 in Dublin west and in Lucan, in the new mid-west constituency, than anywhere else in the European Union. The census returns for both constituencies are already out of date.  By the time of the next census the three TDs representing those two constituencies will probably be representing more voters on a <i>per capita</i> basis than anywhere else in the State.  That is the way the situation is developing.</P>
    <P>One of the factors upon which the commission made its recommendations was to take into account what it described as &ldquo;significant physical features&rdquo;.  No one can discount the fact that the Liffey is a very significant physical feature and ought to be taken into consideration.  However, I will return to an old hobby horse, which is my concern about the future of the Liffey valley.  We now have a situation where nobody actually represents the Liffey valley except that small section where Palmerstown is linked up with the rest of Dublin west.  In the interests of those who want to protect the amenity of the Liffey valley we ought to examine the possibility of establishing a Liffey valley authority.</P>
    <P>The exception to this rule concerning the Liffey as a significant physical feature relates to Palmerstown and Quarryvale.  It is particularly unfortunate in the case of Palmerstown which now finds itself as the only part of Dublin west which is in a different council area.  It is located in the South Dublin Council area.  Lucan is also in that area, but is now in a different constituency.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that Palmerstown has been repartitioned and I use the phrase advisedly. Unfortunately, the Lucan bypass went straight through Palmerstown disrupting community life there.  People feel very strongly about it.  They have had major traffic problems between both sections of the village causing considerable disruption, particularly for people attending church.</P>
    <P>Palmerstown has now been separated from Lucan and is in the Dublin mid-west constituency, but it is in a different local authority area from the rest of the constituency which is in the Fingal local authority area.  That is very bad.  For them to read in the report that the only reason Palmerstown is included in Dublin West is to make up the numbers underlines what many people in the Palmerstown area have suspected &mdash; that sufficient attention is not being given to that area.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Hayes, on the objections of his current constituents in Rathcoole, Saggart and Brittas who felt strongly enough about their situation and isolation from Tallaght to write to the papers.  I was told of the strength of their opposition and their anger at what has happened to them.</P>
    <P>One has no alternative but to accept the recommendations of the independent commission because it is right that we do so.  To have constituency boundaries as a matter of intense political <Col N="404" /> dispute would be wrong.  I have no hesitation in supporting the recommendations of the independent commission but I regret the recommendations came out in this way as far as west Dublin is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation contrary to what might be the view, primarily because our spokesperson on this area is unavailable tonight.  I thank Deputy Dukes for his kind concern about my likely survival in Dublin North West or unlikely survival as some predict.  As a person concerned about my political future, I carried out a mathematical exercise as regards the new three seater constituency.  I will be marginally better off next time round than the last time as a result of the carve up.  I say carve up not in a sense of criticism of the commission but, as Deputy Dukes and others have said, three seaters in heavily population urban areas are anomalous for a PR multi-seat constituency.  Despite what the commission says, it does not take account of the intensity of the representation required in urban as against rural areas.  The argument in the report says that the compactness of the areas is an argument in favour of three seater but I believe the reverse is the case.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a technical measure to implement the recommendations of the constituency commission. The only option open to any Member of the House in terms of amendments is to effectively rewrite the recommendations in relation to the composition of the constituencies made by the commission.  That would be entirely inappropriate given that it is a statutorily established commission with an independent remit.  That is not to say important issues have not been raised by the commission's report and the consequent legislation to be considered by the House.  Thankfully, we have long moved on from when decisions about the size and composition of Dáil constituencies were made by a Minister and political advantage rather than fairness or the interests of the electorate were, in most cases, the determining influence.  On some occasions, efforts to gerrymander, constituencies totally backfired on those who had redrawn them.</P>
      <P>As a matter of general principle, it is good and desirable that the constituency should be redrawn by an independent body whose members have no vested interest in the outcome.  The Rainbow Government recognised this and placed the commission, which had previously operated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, on a statutory footing.  I also accept that the members of the commission were public servants of the utmost integrity who performed their duties with honesty and impartiality within the confines of the terms of reference given to them by the Minister for the Environment and Local Goverment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have serious reservations about the terms of reference given to commissions by all recent Governments and we need to look closely at the terms given to commissions now and in the future.  The main concerns I have are that the <Col N="405" /> terms given to all recent commissions have resulted in an excessive number of changes to constituencies and that it has made our proportional representation system less fair and less proportional.  Given that our Constitution allows a significant degree of flexibility between the upper and lower ratio of electors to Deputies, the number of changes to constituencies over the past 20 years has been excessive.  This has been particularly so in the Dublin area and this is reflected in the report and Bill before us.</P>
    <P>There is hardly a constituency in Dublin which has not been subjected to major redrawing.  Many constituencies are unrecognisable compared to 20 years ago.  Some unfortunate neighbourhoods have been hurled from one constituency to another at virtually every revision.  It makes life difficult for Deputies and anecdotal evidence suggests electors do not like being transferred from one constituency to another.  It causes confusion and people do not know what constituencies they are in, who their TDs are or who they will be asked to vote for at the next election.</P>
    <P>An example of this is an area in my constituency which was in Dublin North before the redrawing.  Recently, people in the Santry area have been campaigning on the port tunnel access issue.  In order to get any representation, they had to invite the TDs from three constituencies, Dublin North West, Dublin North and Dublin North Central, in addition to councillors from Dublin North, the Drumcondra-Ballymun and the Artane areas.  Because they were an island in a Dublin North constituency but affected by a decision taken in the Dublin Corporation area, they were not effectively represented by anybody.  Counting councillors and TDs as individual representatives, although many serve as both, we are talking about more than 20 representatives.  These people are now in the Dublin North West constituency but as far as the local authority is concerned, they are in the Fingal area.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference given to the most recent commission include the desirability of not breaching county boundaries, that each constituency should be composed of contiguous areas and that there should be regard to geographical considerations.  These are all desirable objectives but future terms of reference should also include the desirability of not <Col N="406" /> unnecessarily moving electors from one constituency to another.</P>
      <P>It has been brought to my attention &mdash; and this is an issue raised by Deputy Hayes &mdash; that the commission has switched the main boundary in west Dublin from the canal to the Naas Road, which is a defensible decision.  However, it is distinctly odd that having taken that decision &mdash; the Naas Road to be the new boundary &mdash; the commission then recommend when one gets to Newcastle-Rathcoole, the Naas Road should be breached.  As a result, and somewhat mysteriously, Rathcoole, Saggart and Brittas are all taken into the new constituency of Mid West with Newcastle and Clondalkin.  There is presumably a reason for this but it is difficult to discern it.</P>
      <P>Our electoral system is one of the fairest and most proportionate of any in the world.  It is also an established fact that the larger the constituency the more proportional the PR system.  It is worth reminding the House that in the 1920s and the 1930s we had six, seven, eight and one nineseat constituencies.  There is certainly an argument about whether we should have such large constituencies because of the huge geographic areas involved but there is little or no case against four and five-seat constituencies in Dublin and other areas.  Yet it is here that the increase in three-seat constituencies has been most pronounced.</P>
      <P>In the multi-party negotiations in Castle Buildings, our Government insisted that the constituency should be as large as possible to ensure political diversity in the new Assembly in Northern Ireland.  Why should not the same principle apply in the Republic?  Fianna Fáil has never liked the PR multi-seat system and has looked enviously across the water at the first past the post system in Britain when 40 per cent of the popular vote can deliver a whopping overall majority.  Fianna Fáil has made two attempts to have the PR system ditched, both of which were rejected by the electorate.  The advent of a Fianna Fail Government has invariably been the signal for a new assault on the PR system.  As recently as November 1997, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, used the opportunity presented by an interview in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> to attack the PR system and to make it clear he was absolutely committed &ldquo;to change from the current system&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>No electoral system is without blemish but ours is one of the fairest there is.  Multi-seat proportional representation ensures that parties receive roughly the same proportion of seats in the national parliament as the votes in an election. We should be loath to interfere with a system that has a proven track record as being fair and democratic and abandon it in favour of something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PR system is so manifestly fair and democratic that opponents have to find other grounds for an assault on it.  All our political ills are attributed to the PR system.  In the early 1980s when there were three general elections in succession, PR was blamed for inflicting instability on the <Col N="407" /> country.  Now we are told that PR is the main reason for the growth in clientelism in recent years although, I think, clientelism is not as recent a phenomenon in Irish politics as many people believe.</P>
    <P>The report prepared for the all-party committee on the Constitution by Michael Laver is interesting.  By way of an aside, the title of the pamphlet is &ldquo;A New Electoral System for Ireland?&rdquo; while the Foreword by Deputy Brian Lenihan, Chairman of the committee reads: &ldquo;A New Electoral System for Ireland&rdquo;&mdash; without the question mark.  This is perhaps wishful thinking on his part.  It is interesting that in the course of this paper, Michael Laver quotes from an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 30 November in which the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, said many politicians spend more time going to local funerals than they do preparing for Dáil debates. Some do and many do not.  I do not, and I never have, yet my vote has varied from 1,300 in 1977 to as high as 8,000 and now to 4,000.  It was not the attendance or the non-attendance at funerals that has increased or decreased my vote.</P>

      <P>We need to look at the distinction between urban and rural Ireland in relation to elections and how people vote.  It is not enough to take a truism i.e. our multi-seat constituencies give rise to clientelism but there is evidence that it does not in many cases.  Perhaps it does in other areas, depending on the nature of the area.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, goes on to argue that we need to devise a system that ensures accountability without enslaving politicians to local client-bound pressures.  When the Minister talks about a system I presume he is talking about an electoral system.  It is the nature of our political culture rather than the system that gives rise to the clientelism to which many of us are prone.  There are different forms of clientelism than attending funerals.  Michael Laver, in his conclusion to the second paragraph, said there is little systematic evidence therefore that it is the STV system rather than the intensely local political culture, so characteristic of Ireland, that is the root cause of punishing constituency workloads.</P>
      <P>I welcome this report not because I agree &mdash; I do not agree &mdash; with the electoral system put forward in it as a possible alternative but because there is a need for a debate on the issue of our political culture and our political system.  The point made by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, regarding local politics and national politics is well worth looking at as well as the issue of the dual mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether there is a clear distinction in rural areas between local councillors and TDs.  In the Dublin area there are very few constituents who know the distinction between a councillor and a TD and their respective roles <Col N="408" /> and functions.  I was present at a meeting recently in my constituency where I was the only TD present because I am the only TD in the area who is not a member of Dublin Corporation.  A Dublin Corporation meeting was being held that night and the other three were present at it.  One of the councillors who is not a TD arrived late at the meeting and was introduced as a TD.</P>
    <P>Immediately the two of us were asked about getting the road swept in the area.  I have no objection to doing that because I have to get elected in the same way as the next person but it is clear there is a great deal of work to be done in sorting out what a TD is elected to do and what a councillor is elected to do.  There is nothing wrong with councillors aspiring to be TDs or even the odd TD aspiring to become a councillor.  I do not think there are too many of the latter around. My theory is that the growth of clientelism has more to do with the nature of our party system than with how we elect our TDs.  It is a direct result of the relative lack of political or ideological difference between the two main parties that have dominated politics for the past 70 years.  The absence of political differences encourages TDs and councillors from parties to compete for votes through intensive clientelism.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting the PR system should be regarded as sacred or inviolable but I am suggesting we should be careful about the motives of those who continually criticise it.  The booklet by Michael Laver on the Constitution is a useful contribution to that debate and merits careful consideration. However, I would like to see reports produced on other alternatives and the various problems in the political process.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the question of voter turn-out at elections and referenda.  I suggested here some time ago that we should establish an all-party committee to address the issue of voter turn-out. I was assured by the Taoiseach at that time that he did not think it was necessary.  I believe it is more necessary than ever.  We have just come through a referendum on the British-Irish Agreement and the Amsterdam Treaty.  A total of 95 per cent of those who turned out voted for the Agreement and approximately 62 per cent voted for the treaty.  Clearly those who turned out to vote were well clued in and made their choice between the two issues, but despite the overwhelming desire of people in this State for peace, only 56 per cent of the electorate turned out to vote.  Therefore, 44 per cent did not vote even when a critical issue affecting the future of this island was placed before them.</P>
    <P>It could not be argued that the people did not have sufficient information or that there had not been an intense debate.  This was a crucial issue which involved changing our Constitution in the most fundamental way in terms of the way we identify ourselves, yet over 40 per cent of our electorate did not vote.  That must deliver a warning signal if none of the other turnouts in previous referenda delivered a warning signal.  We must be serious about the way we encourage <Col N="409" /> young people in particular to participate in the electoral system.  Because of the McKenna judgment and other judgments we must ensure there is an impassioned political debate on the issues put before the people.  One way to do that would be for a Government to agree to set up an all-party committee which would have a limited time span &mdash; perhaps six months &mdash; to address the issues and bring forward a report.  It may not produce all the answers but it may begin a debate which is necessary if we are to ensure the continued legitimacy of this House.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or that of Tony Blair in the north of England.  It is possible that some members of the public here might construe this debate as an attempt to ensure that the Taoiseach represents a relatively safe constituency, although many people are of the opinion that Dublin Central should include both sides of the Liffey or perhaps the area between the canals whereas in reality it is a north central constituency.</P>
      <P>There is general annoyance in the Dublin area, certainly among the activists and supporters in my own party who read the commission report, in regard to what we believe is a general discrimination against Dublin, a blatant under-representation in this House of the Dublin area which has a population of almost 1.2 million people.</P>
      <P>Why should boundaries which were decided by King John in the year 1180 or thereabouts be utterly sacrosanct, yet localities in the Dublin area which have a distinct culture are divided by the new constituency boundaries?  Why do we have only 166 seats in this House?  Deputy Hayes referred to the list of Dublin constituencies which, like my own, are now seriously under-represented in this House.  My constituency will now become a three seater.  I am not afraid to fight a three seater although I would be a fool if I did not regard it as a more difficult task than winning in a four or five seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> There is no reason we could not have 168 or 169 seats in this House with the Dublin area being properly represented.  We should have had an extra seat in the west of Dublin and at least one more seat on the north side to give us demographic parity with other parts of the country. Why should it be the case that electors in Leitrim, for example, can return two Deputies to this House while an area which has the same population as my city council ward finds has difficulty returning 1.5 Deputies?  That is the nature of the under-representation.  There may be some other implications but the end result is that this measure will satisfy a Dublin Taoiseach.  The whole Dublin area will be seriously under-represented in the 29th Dáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred at length to the position in regard to three seat constituencies. Our proportional representation system, which we were encouraged to use by the electoral reform society of Great Britain in 1918 and which is also utilised by the people of Malta, cannot work properly in constituencies with fewer than four seats.  It is worth noting that this Government demanded that there be 18 six seat constituencies in the North, and that is the democratic way to proceed.  We were obviously trying to protect smaller groups such as the Progressive Unionist Party, the Women's Coalition, the Northern Ireland Labour Party and others who may have snatched one seat out of six but would not have a ghost of a chance in a three seat constituency. The PR system cannot work in a one or two seat constituency.</P>
    <P>We will now have a plethora of three seat constituencies in the Dublin area.  The last time a Minister for the Environment from Meath inflicted three seat constituencies on the Dublin area, it rebounded on his party, which was my party, and the Government of the day.  I hope the same fate does not befall the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>The three seat constituency phenomenon is nonsense and discriminates against smaller parties. My constituency of Dublin North Central and the constituency of Dublin North East, the two constituencies with which I am most familiar, were reorganised by the commission.  I wonder how familiar the members of the commission were with the intricacies of cultural life in Dublin. In my constituency, for example, the area of Coolock, which most people regard as an historic area of Dublin, has a population of perhaps 40,000 or 50,000, yet in every revision over the years that constituency has been divided in two.</P>
    <P>I recognise the phenomenon to which Deputy De Rossa referred.  When a meeting is held in Coolock, a minimum of eight TDs show up.  It could be said that if a person is represented by eight TDs they are effectively represented by none.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>I am from Clondalkin and that area also suffered over the years.  One benefit of this revision is that my ancestral area of Clondalkin will at long last be in a constituency of its own.  It has <Col N="411" /> suffered drastically by being split between nine TDs for most of its history.</P>
    <P>Raheny is a village in my constituency which most people would say is a historic area of Dublin. There has been a settlement there from the time of our Celtic predecessors.  People have lived there, through the Viking era until now.  Raheny has been in my constituency of Dublin North-East for the past nine to ten years and is represented by me, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, Deputy Martin Brady and Deputy Cosgrave.  It has been represented in the recent past by the former Deputies Seán Kenny, Pat McCartan and others. Its integrity was respected.  With the revision, a line has been drawn through the middle of the village using Raheny Road as a boundary.  This means people on the east of the road are in Dublin North-East and people on the west side are in Dublin North-Central.  I do not understand how the people examining this did not recognise that it makes matters extremely difficult for local cultural organisations, such as Raheny business association, football and GAA clubs, the tidy towns committee and other groups, as they must now operate across a constituency boundary.  I know this happens to a small extent around the country but it seems to happen in a big way across Dublin.  The integrity of the different regions of Dublin is not taken into account.  That said, it is sometimes not taken into account by the planners in the four Dublin counties.</P>
    <P>One of the instructions given to the commission was to respect county boundaries.  I do not see how it did this on the north side of Dublin because I will represent a significant part of Fingal as well as a significant part of Dublin Corporation in the next Dáil.  If anything, the Malahide Road should have been used as a boundary, although that might have suited some of my predecessors or those who wish to be TDs again more than it would have suited me.  It seems to me that a sensible Dublin North-Central constituency could have been built around the Clontarf and Artane wards with the Donaghmede and Howth wards being included in Dublin North-East. This does not seem to have occurred to members of the commission.  I know when they read this debate they will see that a common theme will be that they did not respect the regional and cultural differences of the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>We have been left with a situation whereby a significant group of Dublin constituencies are under represented.  That means that, when major Dublin issues arise, some of which have been discussed in the House, such as Luas, the next tranche of Structural Funds, the various schemes for the millennium, crime, etc., there will be three fewer Dublin Deputies than there should be in the 29th Dáil.  I regret that; it is wrong and should have been avoided.  The independence of the commission must be accepted but, in future deliberations, the Dublin area should be treated with <Col N="412" /> respect and given its full weight in the national political system.  Its villages and local cultural differences should be fully respected.</P>
    <P>In general, I do not believe there should be three seat constituencies because it is not good for the democratic process.  As Deputy De Rossa stated, there were seven, eight and nine seaters in the early history of the State and we now expect Northern Ireland to have six seat constituencies. Nonetheless, we persist with three seaters.  I hope it is not something the Government lives to regret.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  I will deal with the main points made, especially those relevant to the Bill.  I will also make some general remarks about the commission and its responsibilities.</P>
      <P>There was a general welcome for the introduction of an independent commission by Fianna Fáil in 1977.  The concept of having independent commissions decide on constituency revisions is generally welcomed in the House.  At the time it was introduced, it was regarded as an advance on the old and unsatisfactory arrangement by which constituencies could be redrawn by the Government. Deputies mentioned some of the famous attempts by previous Governments to use that system and which backfired on them.  In that context, I do not wish Deputy Broughan's last comment to stand on the record unchallenged.  The commission, not the Government, proposes three seaters and we accept in full its proposals.  Speaking as a Fianna Fáil member, three seaters do not particularly suit Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>They did in 1977 when Jimmy Tully did his job but it was the only time they did. Three seaters especially do not suit Fianna Fáil in Dublin and that is a proven fact.  I do not want to leave Deputy Broughan's remarks unchallenged. I am implementing the independent commission's recommendations.  I will address later some of the insinuations made in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter how constituencies were drawn up and no matter what results the commission came up with, people were always going to be unhappy, especially those affected by the changes.  That is human nature.  All in this House sympathise with those affected by changes because changes can be traumatic for a Deputy and for an electorate which has become accustomed to its public representative and which is getting a good service from him.  However, we must recognise the reality that the Constitution requires that constituencies be revised, that there be equality of representation and that any revisions take account of the distribution and changes in population.  They must be based on the previous census and Deputy <Col N="413" /> Currie is probably right in the point he made about the changes which have taken place since the 1996 census, especially in the Dublin West area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming I have not done my calculations incorrectly, I examined the Meath constituency registers for the election last year and for the previous election and found a difference of about 8,000.  I can imagine how much greater it must be in Dublin West.  Unfortunately that cannot be taken into account until the next census.  With all these constitutional considerations, someone is bound to be affected and that is the price we pay for our system of democratic representation.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed such revisions should be left to an independent commission and it would be less than honourable of us to criticise it for the way it has fulfilled its responsibilities.  I am sure it did its work in the best manner possible. Members of the commission would be the first to admit that if five other people were appointed and faced with the same facts and population they could have come up with a different solution.</P>
      <P>We should accept the report.  The commission strove conscientiously to produce proposals in keeping with the Constitution and the terms of reference.  It has a legal obligation to operate within those terms of reference as far as practicable and it has done so.  It had to make choices and we cannot blame it for doing so.  However, it has done the job in the best way possible and in compliance with the terms of reference.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies spoke of the terms of reference which were set out in the Electoral Act, 1997.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa was in Government at that time.  I had serious reservations about writing the terms of reference into legislation.  I still have those reservations. However, it is in the legislation and if we want to change it I have no difficulty talking about that in committee.  The primary legislation would have to be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies, while accepting the independence of the commission and that the recommendations were made in accordance with the guidelines, made points about political interference which were less than worthy.  They were careful not to allege but to insinuate that the decisions of the commission were reached for political reasons or as a result of political interference. No such allegation has been made outside the House.  If Deputies have evidence for it they should bring it forward.  Under the legislation, any interference other than through the normal procedures is a criminal offence and must be reported.  It is less than worthy of any Member to insinuate that there was political interference <Col N="414" /> or that the commission made a recommendation to suit or at the behest of someone.  It suits me that Meath was not changed.  Some changes suit some Deputies more than others but to allege or insinuate that the commission's motivation was political or as a result of political interference is unworthy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to the Deputy.  The Deputies concerned will know who they are and perhaps they might withdraw the comments at a later stage.  During the last revision I heard insinuations that boundaries were drawn to suit one Deputy and to entice him into contesting an election.  I treat that with the same contempt as I do other similar remarks.</P>
      <P>It is not my role to respond to Deputies who have put the case for their constituencies and how they are being affected.  Deputies in west Dublin &mdash; and others &mdash; have raised various queries.  The commission did the job and I should not have to defend it.  It explained its intentions and why it made its decisions and I need not defend it any further.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes and others raised the issue of recommending that there should be 168 seats. The commission considered increasing the numbers but it indicates in the report that the present number of Members allowed for a reasonable arrangement of constituencies in accordance with its terms of reference.  That is the reason given for not increasing the number of Deputies from 166 to 168.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the matter of three seat constituencies.  Some people make the point that this runs counter to the principle of proportional representation.  I do not accept this point.  The Constitution envisaged three seat constituencies.</P>

      <P>That is correct and three seat constituencies comply with the principle of proportional representation as provided for in Article 16.2.5º.

      <P>No hope.  We are going to try this for the European elections.  Logistically it is easier and we want to see how well it works.  If it works well we will examine the situation regarding other elections.  There is a time factor <Col N="415" /> involved.  Candidates are selected earlier for European elections than for local or general elections. We will be able to try it for the European elections and then see about extending it.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies spoke of reviewing the electoral system and Michael Laver's report.  I responded to a statement made by Deputy De Rossa some time ago regarding something I had been quoted as saying in the newspapers.  I am not leading a crusade to have a first past the post electoral system introduced.  The Deputy and I are at one on the issue but the time has come to make a change.  It is important that the matter be debated fully.  Those who hold a different view should express it as strongly as possible.  Multi-seat constituencies have caused Members to divert their focus from their work as legislators and as scrutineers of the actions of the Executive. The system studied by Professor Laver is a reasonably good alternative, although there may be better ones.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked how fair is the current system. Based on the percentage of votes received in the last general election, Fianna Fáil received a 12 seat bonus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has sparked my curiosity. Subsection (2) (a) reads, &ldquo;a reference to a former rural district shall be construed as a reference to that district as constituted immediately before the 1st day of October, 1925&rdquo;.  It is time definitions such as this were tidied up.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) (b) reads, &ldquo;a reference to a line drawn along any motorway, road, railway or pathway shall be construed as a reference to a line drawn along the centre of such motorway, road, railway or pathway&rdquo;.  That is clear and succinct but, from a cursory examination, there are a number of cases where the border between constituencies is marked by a lake or river.  I am aware that, as far as Lough Corrib and Lough Mask are concerned, the borders have been defined otherwise by ancient agreements but Lough Rea is not in the same boat.  The Shannon marks the border between Laoighis-Offaly and Longford-Roscommon and Galway East.  Lough Derg marks the border between Tipperary North and Galway East and Clare.  The Shannon estuary marks the border between Clare and Kerry North, Limerick West and Limerick East.  Is it clear beyond doubt from other statutes where the borders lie or are these areas defined with reference to the former rural districts as constituted immediately before 1 October 1925?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer is that it is time new definitions, other than rural districts, were found This matter can be looked at in the context of electoral reform.  It would be a major task in terms of mapping.  Adjoining electoral divisions have similar names in many instances.  They are distinguished by being included in different rural districts.</P>
      <P>In city areas, particularly in Dublin, boundaries are marked by physical features.  Constituencies run from the centre.  That is logical, although it is not a technical explanation.</P>

      <P>In theory, this is a good idea.  It would be inappropriate to have practising politicians on the commission but a case could be made for including someone with political expertise. It is no criticism of the existing commission to say that there appears to be a lack of consciousness of the difficulties changes in boundaries can create for electors on the one hand and the elected on the other.  Arguably, it would be inappropriate for it to take into account that this might affect X or Y. There seems to be a case for having access to the acquired political expertise of a politician, but how would we identify such a person?

      <P>I wish to raise a point on the number of Deputies in a constituency, which was made during the Second Stage debate.  It relates to the terms of reference that are provided for three, four and five seat constituencies.  From the contributions made from this and the Fianna Fáil side, it seems Members have become increasingly unhappy with the proliferation of three seat constituencies, particularly in urban areas. Deputy Dukes made the point that three seaters are more suitable to the more widespread rural constituencies and, presumably, they would overcome the problem of joining two counties together to make up a five seater constituency.</P>
      <P>We seem to have got out of kilter with the underlying principle of the multiseat constituency idea.  The fewer the number of three seat constituencies we have, the better.  It has long been my conviction that this House should be as widely representative as possible.  That has been one of the strengths of this Parliament since l922.  It overcame many of the difficulties which might have existed if we had a first past the post system. That division at the time would have lasted much longer, if we did not have a PR multiseat constituency system.  The likelihood was that one of the representatives people voted for would have been successful and the people felt they were represented in this House.  That is also true today. There are Members from my party, the Progressive Democrats and other parties, who would not be here if we had a first past the post system or the likelihood is we would be unlikely to be here with a single seat constituency system.  However, that is debatable and we could spend all night discussing it.</P>
      <P>We need to find a way to re-examine the terms of reference of the commission.  They are locked into the Electoral Act, but we need to find an objective way to examine them and reach a conclusion as to what they ought to be.  The terms of reference have been in place more or less since 1977, but some minor change may have been made to them.  We need to review them and to find, in so far as one can in a political arena, a mechanism which comes up with an objective view on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being critical of the commission, but from a party viewpoint and, I might be speaking for quite a number of my party colleagues, party, I am not very happy with the <Col N="419" /> number of three seat constituencies.  We could always compromise with a four seat constituency. Guiding principles of the commission are outlined in relation to Dublin on page 32 of the report.  It states that it seeks to unite communities in particular constituencies, that the 1995 commission had gone some way towards doing that and is trying to continue that work.  It wanted to rationalise the Dublin Central constituency and it sought to align boundaries with significant physical features, notably the Liffey and the M50.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if it is stated in the report, it may have been stated in the press release that accompanied it, but if the commission did not state it explicitly, it seemed to be implicit that it designed these constituencies in such a way that perhaps, in the future with the increasing population in Dublin West, there would be less need to change boundaries and that on the next occasion seats could be added in some of these constituencies.  That is a good idea and the commission is to be commended on that, but it has given rise to the extra number of three seat constituencies for the next election.  If the Government runs its full course, a census will be completed, we might have a new set of figures to work from before the next general election and all this might change.</P>

The net difference <Col N="420" /> between both texts is that the text in this Bill excludes the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1995, which will be repealed when the Bill's provisions become effective following the next dissolution of the Dáil.  The proposed collective citation provided for in the amendment includes the 1995 Act.  Following the repeal of the Act there will be a break in the current citation.  It is necessary that it is inserted as a result of section 5 and the repeal of the 1995 Act and I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Fisheries Council meeting on Monday, 8 June, was a black day for Irish tuna fishermen with the phased banning of drift nets over the next few years.  It is sad to see how Spanish fishermen and environmentalists combined to convince the majority of EU Ministers to bring the drift net ban into effect.  The ban will hit drift net fishermen in the south as the tuna fleet operates out of Castletownbere, Union Hall and Dingle.  It is most regrettable that the Minister was not able to convince other Ministers that, based on scientific evidence, there was no justification for the drift net ban.  This fishery was of vital economic importance to the south west communities.  The ban comes on top of the collapse <Col N="421" /> in herring prices and is a further hammer blow for these communities.</P>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question on Tuesday, 31 March 1998, the Minister indicated that EU financial support will be made available.  As the emphasis will now shift to compensation, the Minister will have to consider compensation arrangements in respect of lost future revenue and aid for conversion to new gear if the fishermen decide to continue in this fishery.</P>
      <P>Reporting of this issue has given the mistaken impression that the drift net ban will operate from 2002.  It is important to bear in mind that there is to be a phased reduction this year of 40 per cent.  On behalf of fishermen I welcome the fact that at the Estimates meeting today it was decided the phasing out will not apply to Irish fishermen this year.  I am aware that the Minister still has to assess the regulations which will apply to tuna fishermen.</P>
      <P>Surely, the Minister is aware that Spanish fishermen, who primarily use a different method of fishing, namely trolling, advocated the drift net ban in pursuit of their own selfish interest in the fishery.  Up to the talks in Luxembourg they consistently stated they did not use drift nets.  Were they being economical with the truth as it has now transpired they have about 100 vessels using drift nets?</P>
      <P>In his response to this issue on 31 March the Minister, in a reference to the proposal to ban drift net fishing for tuna, stated the proposal exceeded international legal requirements.  If this is the case what course of legal action does he intend taking to get the decision revoked?  It is interesting to note that following his walkout from the Fisheries Council meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, he again stated the Attorney General would review the legal implications of the decision regarding the horse mackerel allocation.  A statement was made that everything political and legal would be explored to see how the quota share out could be overturned.  Six months later these commitments have a hollow ring.</P>
      <P>Should the Minister fail in his legal efforts regarding tuna fishing, it is most important he ensures there are adequate compensation measures for the fishermen and I hope he will provide appropriate reassurance for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to brief the House on the outcome of last Monday's Fisheries Council meeting when I secured, in the face of overwhelming opposition, a four year stay on the ban on drift net fishing for tuna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During marathon discussions over ten hours I faced down on five occasions the original proposal to implement the ban within two years and won Council agreement to postpone the ban for four years until January 2002.  I also copperfastened assurances on the availability of research funding from the Commission and a further window of opportunity to pursue additional financial <Col N="422" /> support measures to assist the industry convert to other means of fishing.  Deputy Finucane is correct when he says the Spanish admitted in the course of the Council meeting that they had 100 vessels using drift nets.</P>
    <P>Having secured every possible concession against all the odds for Irish fishermen, I then voted against the ban.  I was joined only by my French colleague in this action while Italy abstained.  The size of the majority vote underlines the essentially political nature of the decision.  Twelve member states, with a combined 64 votes, were in favour of the ban from the start with the full support of the Commission.  The House should be under no illusion about the way the odds were stacked.  I voted against the ban for the reasons I have opposed it all along.  I do not accept that there is scientific justification to back up the ban which goes beyond the international requirements of the UN resolution of 1989 which allows for drift nets of 2.5 kilometres.  This was the standard by which our fishermen abided and operated.  They were in full compliance with the UN resolution.</P>
    <P>There are strict control measures governing the tuna fishery and I have consistently pointed out the risk that the ban would simply put more pressure on white fish stocks which are already over fished in our waters by the fleets of other member states.  I took a strong principled stance from the start of the negotiations in January which were being driven as a priority by the UK presidency.  At the Council in March, I made my position on the legal and scientific issues abundantly clear and had the support of France in doing so.  Most significantly in March I won Council recognition of the human consequences of a ban and agreement to put off a decision until the socio-economic consequences for Irish fishermen and coastal communities were addressed in a framework which would allow funding for research into alternative techniques and for reconversion and retraining of fishermen.  My objective was to ensure that irrespective of a drift net ban, Irish fishermen would be helped to remain in the tuna fishery.  My strategic approach between March and this week was to work intensively at all levels to push the date of implementation as far back as possible and create an explicit commitment to allow for research and other funding options for the sector to be pursued, particularly technology transfer.</P>
    <P>I worked intensively with Minister Cunningham and Commissioner Bonino in the interim period, as well as liaising directly, and in person, with the German and French Ministers and other colleagues, right up to Monday. Throughout these negotiations, I have been in close contact with the tuna fishermen in the south west.  Their backing was critical for me and I was very glad to see them in Luxembourg to forcefully underline their case to the media and the public generally.</P>
    <P>While I have at no point relented on my principled opposition to this ban, up to and including <Col N="423" /> the Council negotiations on Monday, I have consistently and I believe successfully, fought the case for postponement and a framework which will allow us to work with and support Irish fishermen to ensure their continued participation in the tuna fishery.</P>
    <P>The stark reality at the outset was that the overwhelming majority of member states, the UK Presidency and the Commission favoured the ban.  My negotiating approach in the face of 64 votes from the start was to fight, inch by inch, to gain the maximum in that scenario for the Irish fishing industry.  With a total of 23 votes, we did not even have a minimal blocking minority.  I must acknowledge the positive spirit in which the UK Presidency was prepared to work with me in the past two months.  I am also appreciative of the support of my French colleague who shares my fundamental concerns about this and worked with me throughout.  The fact the decision which was inevitably arrived at on Monday gives us four more years and a clear window of opportunity to develop support plans to remain in the fishery underlines the importance for a small country like Ireland of taking a tough and principled negotiating stance in Europe.  I will be working intensively with the industry in the coming months to ensure we use the next four years to best effect to prepare for a new future in the tuna fishery.  I have no doubt I will have the support of Deputies in this endeavour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with some reluctance I sought permission to raise this matter.  On October 2 1997, when the Children's Bill was being debated in the House, I referred to the fact that there are so many single parents nowadays that young people do not know whether they may be meeting their half brother or half sister.  With today's standards of blood and DNA testing, it should be easy to establish whether people are related to each other.  Problems will arise in the future if this problem is not tackled now.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider introducing legislation to make blood testing compulsory for people wishing to marry as has been the case in America for some years.  Moreover, if a person is HIV positive, their partner is entitled to know that as is the person involved.</P>
      <P>When I contributed to the debate on the Children's Bill in this House last October, I received a huge reaction from people all over the country. I spoke to the Minister about the matter and he said it had been referred to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey.  I have spoken to Deputy Fahey on a number of occasions and he keeps telling me the matter is being dealt with.  However, I have not received any information on it.  I received a letter on the matter from Friends of Galway &mdash; Cáirde na Gaillimh, in the Minister's own constituency. It reads as follows;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> Dear Ben Briscoe,</P>
    <P>Having just heard you talking on the radio, my personal congratulations on both the points you raise.  Here in Galway, some of our people have long been concerned about the possibility of unwitting incest because of large promiscuity among young people.  These older people are by no means Victorian moralists, just concerned about future problems for society locally so by all means press on with your blood test proposal for which the case is surely very strong.</P>
    <P>I also received letters from other organisations which refer to the fact that legislation has been introduced in Britain, particularly for adopted people wishing to trace their parents.  The lack of birth information creates a very real possibility of unwittingly causing an adopted or fostered person to commit incest with birth relatives, particularly siblings and half siblings.  The risks of adopted people marrying a sibling are above average.  For example, many women place more than one child, who may have the same father, up for adoption.  Many women who placed children for adoption subsequently went on to marry the father and have a family.  Simple figures show that if 40,000 people are legally adopted, there are 80,000 biological parents and 160,000 biological siblings which amounts to a total of 280,000 people.</P>
    <P>I have stated on previous occasions that it would not be very difficult to introduce this test. People have asked who would pay for such a test. The people who are getting married should pay for the blood test as they are already paying out a lot of money for their wedding.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, will be able to inform me how much a blood test would cost.  It may cost in the region of £30, £40 or £50 but the cost would be low in comparison to the overall outlay.  We must pay attention to this serious problem.</P>
    <P>The statistics are frightening; in certain parts of the country, 80 per cent of babies are born to single parents although the national average is approximately 25 per cent.  That should serve as a warning.  In a small area or a small town, young people meeting each other in dance halls would not know whether they were related.  If people intend to marry, it is in their interest to ensure they will have a long and happy life together and not one in which danger will lurk.  I would like the Minister of State to refer this matter to the Minister as it is time some action was taken on it. It should be relatively simple and inexpensive to introduce compulsory blood tests.  We owe it to our future generations to look after their interests now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Parties within the prohibited degrees of relationship cannot marry.  Prohibitions are based either on consanguinity, blood <Col N="425" /> relationship, or affinity, relationship by marriage. The prohibited degrees to a wide range of family relationships of the half blood, namely stepsister and brother, as well as those of the whole blood. Section 2 of the Marriages within Prohibited Degrees Act, 1835 provided that all marriages after 1835, between persons within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity shall be absolutely null and void.</P>
      <P>There are some safeguards preventing a couple knowingly intermarrying within the grounds of blood relationships.  A celebrant or registrar is expected to make the necessary inquiries in relation to the capacity of parties proposing marriage and the preliminaries to the issuing of a licence, either by the registrar or licenser of marriages, in respect of specified religious denominations, other than Roman Catholic, require the person serving notice to make an oath or declaration that there is no legal impediment to the marriage.  There is a requirement for a declaration on similar lines required for a marriage by registrar's certificate.  However, parties are not obliged to furnish evidence of non-relationship by means of a blood test.</P>
      <P>In the case of marriages according to the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church, which are registered after the event, the preliminaries, with the exception of the marriage notification required under section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995, are a matter of Canon Law and, in this connection, it should be noted that the provisions of Canon 1091 prohibits marriage between all parties related in the direct, bloodline and marriages in the collateral line, namely cousins, to the fourth degree.  Canon Law also restricts marriages between parties related by marriage in any degree of the direct line.</P>
      <P>The Marriages Acts, 1845 to 1972, as amended, set out the procedures to be followed and the preliminary requirements for the celebration of a valid marriage.  There is no legal requirement under those Acts for the taking of a blood test by the parties to be married.  Any change to make the taking of a blood test a mandatory prerequirement for marriage would be a fundamental change in marriage law and its implications would have to be examined.  This will be done as part of the existing review of the law in relation to the registration of births, deaths and marriages.  This comprehensive review will, of necessity, entail consultations with a number of Departments and other interested parties.</P>
      <P>I will convey the Deputy's remarks on this important matter to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time in a month that the Minister of State has come to the House to discuss this important issue.  I thank him sincerely. <Col N="426" /> He had an intense interest in this issue prior to his appointment as Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The announcement by the Central Statistics Office that 433 people committed suicide last year, an increase of almost 15 per cent, has rightly caused shock in Irish society.  Most of these suicides were under 25 years of age and eight were less than 15 years.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children must immediately examine this trend.  The increasing levels of suicide is no longer just a serious issue, it is a crisis.</P>
      <P>Action must be taken immediately.  Other states have introduced effective suicide prevention programmes and it is urgent that the Minister follow suit.  We must reduce the levels of suicide and ensure that those who feel suicidal can get help from State agencies.  This help must be readily and easily contactable for 24 hours a day, every day for the 52 weeks of the year.  The recommendations of the national task force on suicide are clear and unambiguous and I call on the Minister to implement them in full immediately. I appreciate that other Departments, such as the Department of the Environment and Local Government, have an involvement in this area.</P>
      <P>Last year 433 people in the Republic committed suicide compared to 378 in the previous year. The vast majority of people who took their lives last year were male; 355 men committed suicide compared to 78 women.  More 15 to 24 year olds committed suicide than any other age group, with 103 or 23.8 per cent of the total taking their lives in 1997.  A further 22.9 per cent of suicides were aged between 25 and 34 years.</P>
      <P>The Government must ensure that the training of medical personnel includes recognition and management of suicidal behaviour as an integral part of such training and continuing education. Health boards should immediately establish a directory of voluntary and statutory services for those at risk of suicide.  This should be available in all appropriate statutory and voluntary services and in the offices of general practitioners.  The Government must introduce proper treatment for the mentally ill who are in prison.</P>
      <P>As a result of the recent information becoming available, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, announced that a national educational and psychological service will be available to all primary and post-primary schools and to the young who are no longer in formal education.  That is important because a higher number of young people who leave the education system early commit suicide than those who remain in the system. He also announced that a new social, personal and health education subject will be introduced in the primary curriculum to deal with issues such as self esteem and the need to express feelings.  When will this be introduced?  At the latest it should be introduced at the start of the next school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> It is urgent that assistance be provided to young people who leave school early as there is a particularly high rate of suicide in this group.  The Minister should make an order that radio and television programmes which deal with suicide and related issues should display helpline numbers and referral information.  The Minister must take steps to ensure that the health services, including mental health services, are more accessible to the public, particularly the young who might perceive them as not being readily available to address their needs in times of crisis.  This is especially important for remote rural areas where these services are not readily available.</P>
    <P>It is vital that all children be taught to swim as part of their general education with a view to enhancing health and preventing accidental drowning as well as suicide.  Life saving apparatus should be available at appropriate places where there is easy access to water.  All applications for firearms should be carefully scrutinised and the licensing authorities should produce and make available for distribution a code of practice for the safe storage and disposal of firearms.  It is also vital that the availability of medicines which are harmful in overdoses be restricted.</P>
    <P>On 14 May last, the Minister of State announced the establishment of a suicide research group by the chief executive officers of the health boards.  At that time the chief executive officers were in the process of establishing the group.  Has it convened?  The main responsibility of the group will include a review of the ongoing trends of suicide and parasuicide, co-ordinating research into suicide and making appropriate recommendations to the chief executive officers.  How many times has the group met and when will it complete its programme of work?</P>
    <P>Adolescence, the period between childhood and adulthood, has gradually been extended during the 20th century.  For many it stretches from puberty to the early or mid 20s.  The pace of social and cultural change has never been faster.  The life expectancy of most jobs is now less than five years and skills can fast become redundant.  Individuals must be more and more adaptable.  What is an opportunity for some is a threat for others. Stresses affect both young men and young women although males are currently proving less adaptable to changes in their status.</P>
    <P>Education which is protective against both suicide and attempted suicide must be broadened, particularly in the case of boys, to encompass the various modern social and domestic conditions. Whereas the physical health of young people might be better in comparison with years ago, the same cannot be said with regard to the social and psychological pressures to which young people are exposed.  This is partly due to the increasing instability of family life and a changing sense of personal and family relationships.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> In this context, the Minister of State should establish a committee or task force or group to examine the pressures on young people, to determine the range and size of the problems facing them in modern society and to determine the best methods of addressing them from a social, recreational and educational perspective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this issue again.  The report of the national task force on suicide which was published in February 1998 put forward a national suicide prevention and reduction strategy and identified the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities. The action recommended in the report to reverse the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide is set out in a series of recommendations outlined in the report under the following headings: the prevention of suicide and parasuicide, intervention, aftermath and aftercare, research and evaluation.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the report the Minister for Health and Children has been in contact with his ministerial colleagues in the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and the Environment and Local Government with a view to implementing the task force recommendations in so far as these Departments are concerned.  My Department has also contacted all the statutory agencies identified in the report with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies requiring that the necessary measures are put in place to ensure the implementation of the recommendations which relate to their respective areas.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a suicide research group by the chief executive officers of the health boards is central to the strategy to prevent and reduce suicides and attempted suicides.  The chief executive officers recently established the group and its inaugural meeting took place on 2 June. The group's main responsibilities include the review of ongoing trends in suicides and parasuicides, co-ordinating research into suicide and making recommendations to the chief executive officers of health boards to assist in the reversal of the growing incidence of suicide.  The task force recommended that steps be taken to make the mental health services more accessible to the public, particularly to our young people.</P>
      <P>Concern was also expressed at the risk of suicide in older people.  In response to these concerns, I have given priority to the further development of mental health services for both older people and children and to adolescent psychiatric services. Resources have been made available this year to enable improvements to be made in each of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be assured that the Government is committed to implementing the national suicide prevention-reduction strategy recommended <Col N="429" /> in the report of the National Task Force on Suicide in order to tackle this growing and tragic problem in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this matter at the request of my colleague, the former Deputy, Mr. Liam Kavanagh.  The official strike of ambulance drivers based in Wicklow Town is a serious cause of concern to the public in the county.  The dispute revolves around the transfer of some ambulance staff from Wicklow to the new base in Arklow and the proposed new staffing levels at that base.</P>
      <P>Since Monday, the people of Wicklow have been denied their normal ambulance service. Emergency cover is being provided by the Army. While I acknowledge that officers involved are as well trained as their civilian counterparts, they cannot know the local terrain as well.  The daily cover on which hospitals rely to perform their functions is not being provided by the Army, for understandable reasons.  The absence of this service will inconvenience many people and cause difficulties for local hospitals.</P>
      <P>I am aware the Labour Court has already made recommendations in this dispute.  Unfortunately, these recommendations are unacceptable to the workers involved.  Their fear is that if they accept the new working conditions on offer, they will undermine the case for review of those conditions after six months, as recommended by the Labour Court.  They argue that if the inconvenience is to be incurred now, the compensation should also be paid now.</P>
      <P>This dispute has been an issue now for three days without any sign of resolution.  A protracted dispute must be avoided at all costs.  There is a precedent for a second intervention by the Labour Court in disputes such as this and in this situation that may be worthy of consideration.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, has a clear responsibility to the people of Wicklow to resolve this dispute.  If both sides accept the principle that a review of the workers' conditions is appropriate, it would be unfortunate if a dispute about the timing of that review would deprive the people of Wicklow of this vital new service.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is aware that at a union meeting today, ambulance drivers from around the country indicated their intention to support their Wicklow colleagues.  This dispute is gathering dangerous momentum.  Rather than being faced with a national ambulance drivers' dispute, now is the time for proactive intervention from the Minister and State agencies.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy <Col N="430" /> for raising this issue and for providing an opportunity to discuss the issue of the Arklow ambulance base, which has also been raised by the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob and other Deputies.  The ambulance service for Arklow is provided by the Eastern Health Board.  Prior to the current dispute, an ambulance was assigned to cover the Arklow area, four days a week from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. During those hours the ambulance was based in Arklow.  Outside of those hours calls from the Arklow area were responded to by the Wicklow town ambulance base.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board identified the need to develop an ambulance base at Arklow, County Wicklow, and this was completed in January 1997 at a cost of £300,000.  In anticipation of completion of this project the board entered into discussions with staff representatives in mid-1996 with the objective of ensuring a smooth transfer of the staff involved to the new base.  As a result of failure to reach an agreement with the staff side the case was referred to the Labour Relations Commission in June 1997 and was then referred to a full hearing of the Labour Court. The hearing took place on 15 September 1997.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court issued its recommendations which included the recommendation that the employees agree to move to the new Arklow base as a matter of urgency and that new working arrangements, involving 24 hour, seven day operation of the base, should be introduced within a period of six weeks from the date of the move. The court further recommended that when the new arrangements had been worked for six months, the parties should meet to examine their impact on earnings and any social disruption incurred.  In the event of losses being established, the recognised formula for calculating compensation for losses should be applied.  Failure to agree at that stage could be referred back directly to the court for final recommendation.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board fully accepted the Labour Court's recommendations.  The staff moved to the new Arklow base and were still working the old arrangements, which involved the two bases in Wicklow and Arklow, but were not providing a 24 hour service from the Arklow base.  The staff are seeking compensation prior to implementing the new arrangements, which is in contravention of the Labour Court's recommendations.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, the ambulance staff involved decided to take industrial action, despite the Labour Court's recommendations and it has been necessary to engage the Army to provide the service. The Army is now providing a 24 hour service from both Wicklow and Arklow.  I call upon the personnel taking part in the industrial action to resolve the dispute through the available industrial relations machinery and resume normal working.</P>

    <P>As the issues in the dispute have already been <Col N="431" /> the subject of discussions and a fair and equitable means of resolving the matters at issue has been recommended by the Labour Court, I urge that discussions resume with a view to trying to find a solution in the context of that recommendation.</P>
    <P>The ambulance service is a vital emergency service and while I would reassure the public that the Eastern Health Board and the Army have <Col N="432" /> been ensuring that the emergency ambulance service in the affected area has been maintained, I must call upon the staff involved in the dispute to consider the vulnerable group being affected by their action, to return to work and to utilise the established industrial relations machinery.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11 June 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met in Vienna, on 4 June last, the Austrian Chancellor, Mr. Viktor Klima, who will become President in Office of the European Union on 1 July 1998.</P>
      <P>We discussed a wide range of European issues, including the forthcoming European Council in Cardiff and the priorities for the Austrian Presidency of the European Union during the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>The Austrian Presidency will have the task of completing the final stage of preparations for the introduction of the euro, and this commenced on 4 June last, with the inaugural meeting of the Euro-XI group in Luxembourg.  In addition, it will fall to the Austrian Presidency to make substantial progress on the Agenda 2000 negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Agenda 2000, I outlined to Chancellor Klima Ireland's position on the Commission's current proposals on Structural and Cohesion Funds.  I re-emphasised the need for <Col N="434" /> generous transitional arrangements for Ireland under the Structural Funds and our opposition to the Commission proposals for CAP reform as they currently stand.  It is this Government's intention to pursue real improvements on the terms on offer.</P>
    <P>My visit to Austria is a continuation of a structured programme of consultations with the leaders of other member states on a range of European Union issues in preparation, among other things, for the detailed negotiations on Agenda 2000.</P>
    <P>The preparations for the European Council are a matter in the first instance for the member state holding the Presidency.  As regards the forthcoming European Council in Cardiff on 15 and 16 June next, following my recent meeting with Prime Minister Blair it is clear that key items to be discussed will include the Agenda 2000 negotiations, broad economic guidelines for the Union and the national employment action plans, EU enlargement and the future shape of the Union. Other important issues to be covered will be the progress being made in relation to the Union's policies on drugs and organised crime.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions on issues for the European Council in my recent meetings with Chancellor Klima, Prime Ministers Lipponen, Aznar and Blair and on Tuesday, 9 June last, in Lisbon with Prime Minister Gutterres of Portugal.</P>
    <P>The term of office of the current European Commission does not expire until the end of 1999.  The question of who will represent Ireland on the next European Commission will be considered by the Government closer to that date.</P>

      <P>The Strategic Management Initiative co-ordinating group was established in 1996 to oversee the implementation of the recommendations made in the report, Delivering Better Government, which was published in May 1996. The group is made up of representatives from the social partners, academics and senior civil servants and has met on eight occasions, the last being in November 1997.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the group are to oversee the implementation of the Government's programme for change in the Civil Service; to validate reviews of particular programmes as requested by Government; and to report regularly to Government on progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the establishment of the Implementation Group of Secretaries General and Heads of Office last July, with a mandate to drive the change process forward within the Civil Service, it was agreed that the co-ordinating group would <Col N="435" /> discharge its role by considering and commenting on the regular progress reports to Government of the implementation group.</P>

      <P>Outside legal advice is sought as a matter of routine by the Office of the Attorney General, including the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. This would include seeking opinions and engaging counsel to act on behalf of the State.  The provision in the 1998 Estimates for these offices for fees to counsel and general law expenses amounts to £5.5 million.  Expenditure under this heading to date in 1998 amounts to £1.7 million.  This figure encompasses a variety of legal services and it is not possible to isolate amounts paid for advice only.  In 1997, the figure was in the order of £3 million and in 1996 a total sum of £3.23 million was paid to counsel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Delivering Better Government, the 1996 report of the group of secretaries co-ordinating the introduction of the strategic management initiative, SMI, recommended that a multi-annual budgeting system be introduced.  Moves towards a multi-annual budgeting system are a central part of SMI.  The aim is to put in place a framework within which the Government can consider overall budgetary, taxation and expenditure priorities in a medium-term context.</P>
      <P>This Government has firmly endorsed the strategic management initiative.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made with the introduction of the new multi-annual system.  A multi-annual projection of the major revenue and expenditure aggregates on the assumption of unchanged policies was published with the 1997 budget.  The expenditure data were in aggregate form, without a breakdown by Vote groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I developed the approach further by publishing, as part of the presentation of the medium-term implications of the 1998 budget, projections showing expenditure by individual ministerial Vote groups for the period 1998-2000.  Again, the projections are on the basis of a no-policy-change <Col N="438" /> assessment of the final 1998 expenditure allocations decided by the Government.</P>
    <P>In my 1998 budget speech, I said that I will be considering, in preparing for the 1999 budget, the next stage of the move to multi-annual budgeting, as envisaged in Delivering Better Government. This would involve the Government making decisions for resource allocation over a three year period covering the main budgetary aggregates. Voted expenditure, current and capital, would be desegregated into financial envelopes for ministerial Vote groups.  These would be the amounts which would be allocated to Departments for the three years, and within which they would be expected to contain their spending, including the cost of any new policies or improvements in existing services.</P>
    <P>The first step towards introducing this system with the 1999 budget is the settlement of benchmark projections for each Vote group of the cost in 1999-2001 of continuing the existing level of programmes and services.  This work is under way and discussions with Departments on their projections are continuing.</P>
    <P>I intend to seek Government approval to the no-policy-change projections of expenditure by Vote group for the period 1999-2001; to advise the Government on the projected development of the budgetary aggregates over that period on a no policy change basis in regard to both the expenditure and taxation; and to seek a Government decision on the targets to be adopted for the budgetary aggregates for the period 1999-2001. The targets for expenditure would not, at that stage, be desegregated by Vote group.</P>
    <P>In the light of those targets, Departments will then be asked to propose their detailed Estimates for 1999 and for their financial envelopes for 2000 and 2001.  Following official discussions, the Government will decide the 1999 Estimates and the medium-term financial envelopes.  The final step will be for the Government to finalise the 1999 budget.</P>
    <P>This move to the final phase of multi-annual budgeting is an ambitious exercise, involving fundamental change in the way in which the budget and the Estimates are prepared.  I am hopeful that it will be possible to carry it through as planned with effect from the 1999 budget.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding the proposed changes to the self-assessment system which he made in the Finance Bill, 1998; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This year's Finance Act contained a number of provisions aimed at streamlining and simplifying the system of self-assessment for income tax and facilitating improved compliance in the area of preliminary <Col N="439" /> tax &mdash; that is the payment on account which has to be made by every self-employed person during the course of the tax year.</P>
      <P>The main provision involved bringing together, with effect from 1999, both the preliminary tax payment deadline and the return filing deadline to a new single pay and file date of 30 November, This single deadline would replace the present dual system whereby preliminary tax for the current year is paid on 1 November and the return filing deadline for the previous year is the following 31 January.  The new pay and file date proposed, 30 November, was at the outer limits of what was feasible given the need to make sure that preliminary tax did not spill over into the following financial year and at the same time allow practitioners the maximum possible time within which to prepare and lodge business accounts and returns with Revenue.  To help support the change, and reduce the paperwork burden on practitioners, Revenue undertook to reduce significantly the extra documentation that must at present be sent in with the tax return.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the new provisions in the Finance Bill, a case was made to me by the accountancy bodies and the Institute of Taxation that bringing forward the filing deadline by two months would cause difficulties, particularly for some smaller practices.  I responded to these concerns by making an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure that the proposed changes as regards bringing forward the filing date, and the consequential changes to the preliminary tax payment date, which were due to come into effect from November 1999, will not now come into operation without a ministerial order for a particular year of assessment.  This is to allow time for further discussion with the practitioners on their problems and concerns and to see how we can possibly get around them.</P>
      <P>The matter has been referred to the tax administration liaison committee, which is a standing committee made up of senior Revenue officials and representatives of the accountancy bodies, the Institute of Taxation and the Law Society. This committee is at present carrying out a full assessment of the impact of the proposals on tax practitioners and will report back to me in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that I have asked this committee to look also at the implications of moving the income tax year from a 5 April basis to a calendar year basis, particularly in so far as any such change would impact on self-employed taxpayers and on tax payment and return filing dates.  I have made clear on a number of occasions that I believe this is ultimately the simplest and best way forward.  Moving to a calendar tax year has of course implications beyond just the self-employed &mdash; for example, on the PAYE and PRSI systems &mdash; and I have established an interdepartmental <Col N="440" /> working group chaired by my Department to consider the overall issues involved in making the change as and from the calendar year starting 1 January 2000, and to make recommendations on how this can be achieved.  This working group will be reporting to me later this year.</P>

      <P>Almost all public bodies within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act have produced publications in accordance with section 15, and section 16 where appropriate, of that Act.  These can be obtained from or inspected through the public bodies involved.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that section 15 of the Freedom of Information Act provides for production of publications relating to the general structure of the organisation, its functions, duties and powers; the services it provides, the records it holds and the arrangements made to facilitate access to those records by the public.  All public bodies under the aegis of the Act are obliged to produce a publication under this section and these are widely available.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that section 16 of the Act provides for production of more detailed publications relating to the rules, procedures, practices, guidelines and interpretations used or kept by a public body for the purposes of enactments or schemes administered which affect members of the public.  Most public bodies have met this publication requirement.  However, in some instances, section 16 texts are available for inspection only, and the public bodies involved are making arrangements for general publication of these documents in the near future.</P>
      <P>I have made arrangements for a leaflet on freedom of information which provides contact points for the public bodies under the scope of the Act to be made available to the Deputy should she wish to obtain access to publications required under the Act.  A small number of public bodies have yet to finalise their material.  Their work is at an advanced stage and I expect that their publications will be available in the very near future.</P>

These payments are made to the Exchequer.  In addition and again like all other vehicles, taxis attract annual road tax, which is payable to their local authority.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to amend the relief in the way described by the Deputy.

Also, it is hoped that the establishment of the Screen Commission of Ireland, will, <i>inter alia</i>, bring the many unique locations available throughout Ireland to the attention of the international film industry.</P>
      <P>I should mention that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has established a think tank for the Irish film industry.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply on 28 April 1998 to Question No. 56 from Deputy Ferris and Question No. 61 from Deputy Olivia Mitchell.  For the record, I will repeat the answer I gave at that time.</P>
      <P>At budget day, I forecast an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £89 million or 0.2 per cent of GNP.  The latest projections from my Department suggest that we are on course for a budget surplus of £400 million or 0.9 per cent of GNP.  In general Government terms this amounts to 1.2 per cent of GDP.</P>
      <P>The Deputies may recall that in the recent budget I set out my budgetary strategy for the next three years.  For the assistance of the House I would like to cite this.  I said that it was necessary to take account of a number of strategic issues: provide for capital investment; reduce the tax burden; pursue social inclusion; prepare for EMU; anticipate changes in European Structural Funds; plan for an ageing population and reduce our National Debt.</P>
      <P>In relation to the national debt I went on to say &ldquo;As a country we are still deeply in debt.  At the end of this year it is likely to exceed £30 billion or about £22,000 for every person at work.  The interest cost alone will be over £2,300 million.  We must free up these resources.  Think of the alternative uses we could make of them: in increased investment, improved social services, or a reduced tax burden.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not propose to depart from this strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 45, 65 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>The original 1997 budget day forecast for consumer price inflation was 2.2 per cent, whereas the outturn for that year was 1.5 per cent.  The forecast for 1998, as included in my budget last December, was 2 per cent.  This was based on unchanged interest and exchange rates prevailing at that time.  This forecast will be updated in the annual <i>Economic Review and Outlook</i> to be published next month.  I note that the most recent forecast from the Central Bank in its 1997 annual report on 25 May 1998 is 2.75 per cent, and from the ESRI &ldquo;Quarterly Economic Commentary&rdquo; in April 1998 is 2.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out in my reply to previous questions on this topic, there are a number of factors working to keep inflation low.  These include low international inflation, including commodity and oil prices &mdash; as a small open economy, this is of particular importance; Partnership 2000 is helping to moderate wage pressures; the Asian economic crisis is expected to have a downward influence on prices, as the countries involved strive to regenerate their economies through export-led growth, underpinned by the fall in their exchange rates; structural reform in the State utilities sector, which is delivering benefits to the consumer; continuing competition in the retail sector, especially resulting from the increasing numbers of UK retailers setting up in Ireland and higher volumes of sales which are allowing producers and retailers to absorb increases in costs.</P>
      <P>Over the last four months, the monthly increases in prices were:</P>

    <P>The pattern of increases for the rest of the year will influence the CPI for the year as a whole. These will reflect the impact of movements in sterling and other currencies and any movements in interest rates over the period in question.</P>
    <P>I reassure Deputies that the Government will continue to pursue prudent policies based on Partnership 2000 and the Government's Programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium. One of the commitments in both these programmes is the maintenance of price stability. Specific action has been taken to reinforce this approach.</P>
    <P>In response to the Bacon report, measures have already been taken to stabilise house prices. These included tax initiatives, coupled with measures to increase the availability of serviced <Col N="444" /> land and, together, they are expected to reduce the rate of increase of house prices.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget will have the maintenance of low inflation as the primary focus.  The Government will, therefore, be carefully monitoring price developments over the months ahead in the context of the formulation of policy for the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>The basic rule of the Freedom of Information Act is that requesters can access information sought under that Act unless it is protected by an exemption. This position is no different for records created in the process of responding to parliamentary questions.  Under freedom of information a person can obtain background information relating to a parliamentary question, as is protected by an exemption.</P>
      <P>In practice this means that material for supplementary questions must be provided to a freedom of information requester.  The reasoning for this is straightforward &mdash; if the material was liable to be publicly disclosed in the course of an Oireachtas debate it cannot subsequently be regarded as confidential and exempt under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>As regards briefing material for a parliamentary question, access will be determined by reference to the content of the documents involved. For example, where some of the briefing material for a parliamentary question contains economically sensitive material, or material relating to State security, this element of the briefing could be exempted from release.  However, the balance of non-exempt information would be accessible under freedom of information.</P>
      <P>A freedom of information central policy unit was established last year in my Department.  In conjunction with an interdepartmental working group, it has prepared a manual for Departments and public bodies setting out extensive guidance on the application of the various provisions of the Act.  Because the ground rules for records created in response to parliamentary questions are no different to those for records generally no particular written guidance has been provided in that regard.  However, Departments are well aware of the arrangements which apply.</P>

    <P>In view of the interest of the Deputy in freedom of information I have made arrangements for the freedom of information manual to be <Col N="445" /> made available to him.  The unit is continuing its work in supporting and guiding Departments and public bodies.  The manual will be updated from time to time to take account of the findings of the Information Commissioner and the work of the unit.</P>

      <P>As I have previously advised the House, in response to the significant public concern about certain of the activities of particular banks and indeed the banking industry generally, I decided to establish a working group of representatives from my Department, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Central Bank, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General, with the task of investigating the law and practice governing the provision of financial services in Ireland and the impact this has on consumers.  In this regard, the group is undertaking an assessment of the laws relating to both the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the role of the Central Bank, including the procedures used to give effect to these roles, with a view to identifying the impact of these on consumers and, in particular, to identify if there are gaps in consumer protection that need to be filled.  The group has also been asked to consider what steps may be required to increase the public understanding of the regulatory systems, including the manner of their implementation.</P>
      <P>I understand that the group has met on four separate occasions to date on 3, 8 and 24 April and on 3 June.  A further meeting is scheduled for Thursday, 11 June.  I have been advised that significant progress has been made and that the group is near to completion of its report.

      <P>The European Council meeting in Luxembourg on 13 December 1997 adopted a resolution on economic policy co-ordination in stage 3 of EMU. This Resolution provided for informal meetings among the member states participating in the euro area to discuss issues connected with their shared specific responsibilities for the single currency. The resolution describes the status, remit and function of the informal meetings in the following terms:</P>
      <P>By virtue of Articles 103 and 145 of the Treaty, the ECOFIN Council is the centre for the co-ordination of the Member States' economic policies and is empowered to act in the relevant areas.  In particular, the ECOFIN Council is the only body empowered to formulate and adopt the broad economic policy guidelines which constitute the main instrument of economic co-ordination.</P>
      <P>The defining position of the ECOFIN Council at the centre of the economic co-ordination and decision-making process affirms the unity and cohesion of the Community.</P>
      <P>The Ministers of the States participating in the euro-area may meet informally among themselves to discuss issues connected with their shared specific responsibilities for the single currency.  The Commission, and the European Central Bank (ECB) when appropriate, will be invited to take part in the meetings. Whenever matters of common interest are concerned they will be discussed by Ministers of all Member States.</P>
      <P>Decisions will in all cases be taken by the ECOFIN Council in accordance with the procedures determined by the Treaty.</P>
      <P>I participated in the first meeting of the Euro-XI Group which took place in Luxembourg on 4 June.  This meeting discussed mainly organisational matters and the general macroeconomic situation in the euro area.</P>
      <P>The ECOFIN Council, meeting on 5 June, was informed about the outcome of the meeting of the Euro-XI Group by Mr. Edlinger, Finance Minister of Austria, who chaired the first meeting of the group.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware I introduced a pilot rural renewal scheme in this year's Finance Act. As it is impossible to designate all of rural Ireland, this pilot initiative is applicable in the first instance in parts of the Upper Shannon region, namely all of counties Leitrim and Longford, and parts of counties Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo.  The aim of the scheme is the renewal of this rural area on similar lines to what has occurred in urban renewal centres under the urban renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>The tax reliefs for areas covered by the scheme include capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of certain industrial and commercial buildings and a section 23 type relief for the expenditure on the construction, conversion or refurbishment of rented residential accommodation. The section 23 element of the scheme commenced on 1 June 1998.  However, EU approval is required for the non-residential incentives. Once such approval is received, this element will begin by way of a commencement order.</P>

      <P>The main item for discussion at the meeting of Finance Ministers of the European Union (ECOFIN) on 5 June last related to the preparation of a number of economic issues to be <Col N="448" /> taken at the forthcoming European Council in Cardiff on 15 and 16 June.</P>
      <P>The ECOFIN Council discussed the economic and financial aspects of Agenda 2000 on the basis of a draft report which is to be submitted to the Cardiff European Council by the General Affairs Council.  We agreed draft conclusions which focused on the importance of Agenda 2000 to the future of the EU, the Luxembourg European Council Conclusions on budgetary discipline and on dual programming, the importance of sound financial management and on the entry into talks with the European Parliament on a new Inter-Institutional Agreement, on the basis of maintaining an appropriate balance between the institutions. The Council also noted the European Commission's intention to bring forward a report on the operation of the own resources system in the autumn.  It was agreed that the Council will continue to consider the important economic and budgetary issues arising from Agenda 2000.</P>
      <P>The broad economic guidelines were agreed by ECOFIN and remitted to the Heads of State or Government at the European Council in Cardiff. The guidelines are prepared annually under Article 103 of the Treaty as part of multilateral surveillance of the EU economy and contain recommendations for the conduct of economic policy including some country specific recommendations. The guidelines urge Governments and the social partners to make all the required efforts to support the stability objective of the single monetary policy and call for structural reforms of the product, service and labour markets to facilitate growth, to improve competitiveness and to translate growth into employment. I fully endorse these principles.</P>
      <P>As regards the recommendations for Ireland, the guidelines propose that Ireland prepare the 1999 budget with the objective of the continuation of low inflation.  The Government is already committed to this objective in the Communique on the revaluation of the Irish pound on 14 March last.</P>
      <P>The Council held a discussion on the employment action plans presented by member states in implementing the 1998 employment guidelines agreed at the extraordinary European Council of last November in Luxembourg.</P>
      <P>Ministers welcomed progress across the EU to ensure that the young and long-term unemployed and other socially excluded groups are reintegrated into the workforce and reaffirmed the importance of using active labour market measures, sound macro-economic policies and structural reform to markets.  Ministers also agreed on the need to ensure that tax and social security systems are employment friendly and noted the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises and of creating a culture of entrepreneurship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar discussion on the plans took place at the Social Affairs Council on 4 June.  On foot of the discussions in the two Councils, the Presidency <Col N="449" /> will prepare an overall report on the plans for the Cardiff European Council.</P>
    <P>The Commission paper &mdash; Risk Capital: A key to job creation in the European Union &mdash; was discussed at ECOFIN on 21 April.  The Commission presented a revised paper to ECOFIN last week which took account of the discussion in April.  The Commission paper includes an action plan to remove barriers to risk capital markets contributing to the growth of SME's leading to increased employment.  The Council welcomed the Commission report and concluded that the Council and member states should now examine the Commission's recommendations in further detail.</P>
    <P>Other items on the agenda included the following: The Council adopted, without discussion, a decision on the statistical data to be used for the determination of the key for subscription of the capital of the European Central Bank and Regulations on the status and treatment of European Central Bank officials.</P>
    <P>Mr. Edlinger, Finance Minister of Austria, who chaired the first meeting of the Euro-XI Group held on 4 June, informed the Council about the outcome of that meeting which discussed mainly organisational matters for the group's meetings and the general macroeconomic situation in the euro area.</P>
    <P>The Commission gave a presentation of their proposal for a Directive on cross-border savings. This followed on from the ECOFIN Council conclusions on taxation policy adopted on 1 December 1997 which, <i>inter alia</i>, approved a text on the taxation of savings as the basis for a Directive in this area.</P>
    <P>The aim of the latest proposal is to ensure a minimum level of effective taxation of interest paid in each member state to private individuals who are resident for tax purposes in another member state.  The Commission's proposal envisages that each member state will be required to either operate a withholding tax or to provide the other member states with information on savings income paid to their residents.  The adoption proposal would give member states the option of either applying a withholding tax, levied at a proposed 20 per cent; minimum rate by the paying agent, or of providing information on savings income to other member states, or using a combination of both systems.  It was agreed at the meeting that the competent Council bodies would carefully examine the proposal.</P>
    <P>The Council took note of the conclusions adopted by the Telecommunications Council on 19 May last and heard a progress report by the <i>ad hoc</i> working group on electronic commerce concerning Community co-ordination in this field.  The Commission also indicated that a report on the indirect taxation aspects of electronic commerce will be submitted to a future meeting of the Council.</P>

      <P>The proposals contained in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, are designed to restore a balance to the housing sector &mdash; a balance between supply and demand, between investors and owner occupiers and between tax concessions and removal of reliefs. As I said during the recent Dáil debates on this issue, what these measures are trying to achieve is a change in the balance in the market.  The overall policy goals are to increase the supply of serviced land, to reduce excess investor demand and to assist ordinary house purchasers, thus defusing the house price spiral and increasing the affordability of housing.</P>
      <P>It is too early to measure the effectiveness of the total Government package.  However, I take heart from recent media reports of residential units coming to the market and being purchased almost exclusively by owner occupiers, where in the past a substantial percentage would have been sold to investors.</P>
      <P>Finally, the effectiveness of the Government package will have to be gauged by reference to the policy goals mentioned above and as I indicated on Committee Stage of the Bill the matter will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>On 16 December 1997 the Tribunal of Inquiry (Payments to Messrs.  Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry) served an order for production on me, as Minister for Finance, relating to documents pertaining to the operation of exchange controls in the years 1954 to 1993, inclusive.  This production order also covered the Central Bank. The Central Bank was delegated responsibility for the day to day operation of exchange controls with effect from 3 May 1965.  This order did not specify any particular file or document and required that all documents be produced.</P>
      <P>When the order for production was received, I immediately wrote to the Governor and authorised the Central Bank to take all the steps necessary to comply with the order.  I also directed my Department to ensure that all relevant documents should be produced and that every assistance be given to the tribunal.  The process followed by the Department in relation to the production order was one which was adopted, in consultation with legal advice, with a view to offering the maximum assistance to the tribunal.</P>
      <P>Despite the most strenuous efforts on the part of the Department, it has not been possible to locate some of the files listed on the Department's register of files relating to the operation of exchange controls for the period in question. A listing of the files covered by the Order for Production together with a listing of those files which have not been located was forwarded to the Tribunal of Inquiry (Payments to Messrs. Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry) on 30 April 1998.</P>
      <P>On 6 May 1998, in order to allay public concerns, and having taken legal advice, I made public the list of the files which have not yet been located.  This listing gave the details of 130 files which have not yet been located and of 12 incomplete files.  I also forwarded a copy of this list to the three main Opposition spokesmen on finance.</P>
      <P>No further files have been located since this list was published on 6 May and the list remains valid.</P>
      <P>I have advised the tribunal that the files that have been located have been secured and remain available for inspection at its convenience and that officials of the Department of Finance remain at the disposal of the tribunal to assist it further.</P>
      <P>During 1997 my Department had begun the development of a new computerised file classification system and file tracking system, the purpose of which is to track the movements of files and identify their whereabouts at any given time. Work on this system is now well advanced and it is expected to be fully operational over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> The Office of Public Works is preparing plans for the upgrading of the Department's main file storage area in Government Buildings.  It is hoped that this work, which will improve the storage and retrieval of files, will commence later this year.</P>
    <P>My Department is in the process of engaging contractors to conduct an independent professional inventory of Departmental files opened since 1948.  The purpose of this inventory is to confirm the existence and whereabouts of all files opened over the past 50 years.  This exercise, which it is envisaged will take in the region of three months, will include the transmission to the National Archives of those files which should have been archived previously.</P>
    <P>I am confident these measures will significantly improve existing filing standards in the Department.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent trends in wage levels in the construction industry which indicate a 20 per cent increase in wages in the past 12 months; whether there is evidence of similar trends in other sectors; whether this is consistent with the commitments under Partnership 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Construction industry wages have been increasing at a much faster rate than those in other sectors.  The increase of 19.1 per cent reported by the CSO for the year to December 1997 includes both an increase in the hourly rate of 14.1 per cent and an increase in hours worked of 4.5 per cent.  The increase in hours worked can lead to increased overtime payments with a resultant impact on hourly rates.  An increase in the rates of pay was agreed between the Construction Industry Federation and the unions, including special pay increases for electricians and apprentice electricians. Some of these were due earlier in the year, but were not implemented until the last quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increase in earnings in a sector above the percentage terms of Partnership 2000 does not of itself, mean that the terms of Partnership 2000 are not holding.  For example, in a sector with strong output and employment growth, as has been the case in construction, and with high mobility of staff between firms and skills shortages, recruitment rates may be forced up to attract in new workers.  Increases in the average rates paid as a result of this would not be the result of breaches of Partnership 2000.  It is likely that some element of the increase in rates in the construction industry is due to this. While they may not be in breach of the terms of Partnership 2000, such increases would, however, have the potential to put pressure on rates in the industry and the economy generally and this would be of concern. <Col N="453" /> There is no evidence of similar trends in other sectors for which CSO data is available: manufacturing-industrial, banking, insurance and building societies and the public sector.  The latest CSO provisional published data for industrial weekly earnings indicates that the year on year increase to September 1997 was 4.1 per cent.  Part of this increase may reflect changes in the structure of employment that would affect basic levels of earnings.  Earnings in banking, insurance and building societies increased by 2.8 per cent in the year to September 1997.  The year on year increase in public sector earnings, excluding health, was 4.3 per cent to June 1997.  The increase in the public sector would include an element resulting from the settlement of certain PCW local bargaining negotiations, as well as the provisions of Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>While there is no evidence that the commitments under Partnership 2000 are not being maintained, there is obviously no cause for complacency. The increases in the construction sector in particular, are a cause of concern if they put pressure on rates elsewhere in the economy.  All parties to Partnership 2000 must remain vigilant in ensuring that the commitments entered into continue to be observed.</P>

      <P>In light of the buoyant tax revenues for the first three months of the year, I announced, in connection with the publication of the end-March return that tax revenues would be about £500 million ahead of the budget day projection.

      <P>My functions in relation to the savings certificates scheme have been delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency and it is operated by An Post on the NTMA's behalf.</P>
      <P>Savings certificates are the most important and successful of the Government savings schemes. Almost £2.15 billion was invested in savings certificates at 31 December 1997.  This represented over 50 per cent of the total outstanding in the Government savings schemes.  An estimated £1.13 billion was outstanding at end-1997 in accrued interest on savings certificates.  The fees paid to An Post by the National Treasury Management Agency in respect of savings certificates in 1997 amounted to £3.1 million, or less than 0.15 per cent of the outstanding principal.</P>
      <P>There have been a total of 15 issues of savings certificates.  The most recent was introduced on 5 May last.  This new issue offers investors a return of 25 per cent after five years and six months, which is equivalent to an average annual rate of interest of 4.14 per cent.  This return is tax free, but investment in the new issue of savings certificates is subject to a maximum of £60,000 or, in the case of a joint holding, £120,000.  There is a minimum investment of £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Post's accounts in relation to savings certificates are audited by KPMG on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In addition, An Post complies fully with provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in relation to measures and procedures to counteract money <Col N="455" /> laundering when accepting moneys for investment in savings certificates.</P>
    <P>Some delays in the operation of the savings certificates scheme have occurred; in particular, delays in issuing documentation at times of high volumes of transactions.  A major factor contributing to these delays was the fact that savings certificates have been issued continuously since the 1920s and the records of investments made before 1985 have not been computerised.  However, post-1985 records are held on computer and the National Treasury Management Agency has recently approved a programme of work by An Post for the computerisation of the earlier records.  The target date for completion of this work is the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that An Post has recently introduced new procedures for informing customers when their investments in savings certificates mature.  Previously, this was done only in response to customers' inquiries, but now all investors will automatically receive maturity notices.  I greatly welcome this development, and look forward to further improvements in the quality of customer service.</P>

One would also have to weigh against that the extra administrative costs of a differentiated levy.</P>
      <P>Levies on insurance premia exist in most other EU countries and, in general, at rates much higher than 2 per cent.  This levy was introduced to broaden the stamp duty base, thereby raising additional revenue.  Consequently, at this stage, I have no plans to make changes to this levy.</P>
      <P>Finally, as I stated previously, the issue of the level of car insurance premia paid by young drivers is a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the proposals on energy taxation which the EU Commission presented in March 1997.  That proposed directive suggests <Col N="457" /> both increased taxes on items such as petrol and proposes new taxes on coal, gas and electricity.  If he is, I would like to inform him that discussions on it are ongoing by technical experts reporting to the ECOFIN Council.  No level of agreement on measures have been reached in those discussions. The draft directive would not apply outside the EU and is therefore not strictly pan-European.</P>
      <P>My particular concern as Minister for Finance is to ensure that any measure which is advanced to promote energy saving does not adversely affect Ireland's international competitiveness. I am also concerned about the effect the imposition of any such tax would have on the Consumer Price Index and how the tax would impact on the less well off members of the community.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 69 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>At my specific request the issue of the abolition of duty free and tax free sales was placed on the agenda for the ECOFIN meeting on 19 May 1998. At that meeting, I referred to the report, commissioned by my Department and undertaken by KPMG management consultants.  It was not possible to get the EU Commission to agree to carry out a community wide study into the economic and social effects of the abolition of duty free and tax free sales, post 30 June 1999.  Neither was there agreement among member states that such a study was warranted.  Some member states, notably Spain, France, Greece and Germany were broadly supportive however.</P>
      <P>As I said at my press conference following the ECOFIN meeting, it is important that interest groups in all member states should continue to lobby their Ministers to help change attitudes.</P>
      <P>We will also continue to try to change attitudes in other member states on this subject.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be referring to the comments in the Commission's recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the member states and the Community.</P>
      <P>In that paper, the Commission stated that the Irish budget position was expected to be one of increased surpluses in the coming years, with the debt ratio falling below 60 per cent of GDP in 1998 and continuing to decline thereafter.  It went on to say that &ldquo;in view of the present strong growth of the economy and the possibility of overheating, any revenues received over and above those anticipated in the 1998 budget should be used to raise the budget surplus.  Moreover, a tight fiscal stance is required in Ireland to reduce the risk of overheating&rdquo;.  It also noted that &ldquo;the authorities are resolved to propose a budget for 1999 having as its primary objective the continuation of low inflation in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that on a number of occasions I have referred to inflationary pressures in the economy and the need to curtail them.  I <Col N="460" /> am determined to ensure that budgetary policy should not add unduly to demand in the economy but that it should help to maintain the price stability which has been a crucial ingredient in our recent economic performance through social partnership.</P>
    <P>This stance is consistent with the communiqué issued on behalf of the EU Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors following the meeting on 14 March 1998 at which the revaluation of the Irish pound's central rate in the ERM was agreed. In that communiqué it was stated that &ldquo;the Ministers and Governors noted the firm resolve of the Irish authorities not to exceed the expenditure commitments in the 1998 budget and to ensure that any revenues above those anticipated in that budget are used to raise the primary surplus, and thus the general government surplus, above the planned figures&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Both the broad economic guidelines and the communiqué acknowledged the Government's commitment to a budgetary strategy geared towards maintaining non-inflationary growth.  I intend to deliver fully on this commitment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 76 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the meeting of the ECOFIN Council on 1 May this year, it was announced that for the coming years, strong, sustained and non-inflationary growth will continue to be based in all member states on economic convergence.  Moreover, sound and sustainable public finances are prior conditions for growth and higher employment. <Col N="461" /> The Stability and Growth Pact provides the means for securing this objective and for increasing the scope in national budgets to deal with future challenges.</P>
    <P>It was also announced that in accordance with the pact, that the council would begin to implement the regulation on &ldquo;the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and co-ordination of economic policies&rdquo;, with effect from 1 July 1998.</P>
    <P>In order to support the success of EMU I propose to adopt and to support at EU level budgetary and economic policies which help to sustain non-inflationary growth.  In this regard the role of the stability and growth pact will be vital.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware the pact requires all member states to adopt a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus in normal economic circumstances.  This means that when the economy is growing strongly, as is currently the case in Ireland, the budget should be in surplus.  This is necessary in order to ensure that even in the event of an economic slowdown the deficit can be kept below the 3 per cent of GDP reference value in the Maastricht Treaty.  It will be recalled that, in the updated convergence programme published on budget day, the Government committed itself to run a budgetary surplus so long as the present good economic conditions prevailed.</P>
    <P>The stability and growth pact also involves a system of multilateral surveillance whereby the Commission will have the role of assessing the budgetary plans set out in member states &ldquo;stability programmes&rdquo; for consistency with the overall objectives of the pact.  The Commission will also monitor the progress being made by member states in delivering on their budgetary targets and where there is a deviation from the planned objectives will make recommendation for corrective action.</P>
    <P>I consider that the mechanisms put in place by the pact will play a key role in both the co-ordination of budgetary policy across the EU and in the success of EMU itself.  I would ask the House to note that it is my intention to prepare the first &ldquo;stability programme&rdquo; for Ireland covering the period 1999 to 2001 as part of the 1999 budget and to publish it as part of the budget day documentation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Moriarty tribunal is required by its terms of reference to make whatever recommendations it considers necessary or expedient &ldquo;for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud or evasion in the establishment and maintenance of offshore accounts, and to recommend whether any changes in the tax laws should be made to achieve this end&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I propose to await the tribunal's recommendations together with the report of the Revenue and Department of Finance review rather than proceed by way of piecemeal changes.  Any proposals for new powers would need to be carefully gone into to ensure that they would be effective; could not be easily circumvented; would not needlessly disrupt the affairs of law abiding taxpayers; and would be proportionate in their effect on the financial sector when measured against the problem to be tackled.</P>
      <P>There should be no doubt about the Government's determination to combat tax evasion and avoidance.  I will not hesitate to take further action as the need arises whether as regards increasing the powers of the Revenue Commissioners or implementing other measures that are likely to be effective.</P>

      <P>No general instruction has issued to Government Departments regarding Supplementary Estimates. However, in line with normal practice, an instruction issued to Departments at the end of 1997 on the arrangements for the monitoring and control of expenditure during 1998.</P>
      <P>These arrangements require the Departments to prepare profiles of monthly expenditure in 1998 consistent with their agreed allocations and to report monthly actual expenditure, and the forecast outturn for the year to the Department of Finance.  The monthly returns must identify at individual subhead or programme level any likely overruns or savings on the Vote expenditure.</P>
      <P>Using these arrangements, my Department will continue to monitor closely expenditure trends during the year.  My statement on the end-March Exchequer returns said that spending in the first quarter was broadly in line with expectations.</P>

      <P>My functions in relation to the Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) under sections 103, 104 and 109 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 have been delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency and the POSB is operated by An Post on the NTMA's behalf.</P>
      <P>Moneys raised through the POSB are paid by An Post into a special fund created under the Post Office Savings Bank Act, 1861.  This fund, known as the Post Office Savings Bank Fund, is under the control of the National Treasury Management Agency.  Moneys in the fund are primarily lent to the Exchequer either as ways and means advances or through the purchase of Government securities.  The Exchequer effectively underwrites the solvency of the fund and the moneys deposited in POSB accounts are, therefore, State guaranteed.</P>
      <P>There are two categories of deposit accounts offered by the POSB, as follows:</P>
      <P>The demand deposit account, which is subject to DIRT at the full rate of 24 per cent; and</P>
      <P>Deposit Account Plus, which is a special savings account attracting DIRT at the reduced rate of 20 per cent and with a requirement to give a minimum of 30 days notice of withdrawal.</P>
      <P>The current rates of interest on these accounts are as follows:</P>

    <P>The total amount on deposit in the POSB at 31 December 1997 was £465 million, of which £407 million was held in demand deposit accounts and the balance of £58 million in Deposit Account Plus.  During 1998 to date, there has been a very modest growth in the POSB deposit base.  The total amount on deposit at 8 June 1998 is almost £467 million.  The management fees for the POSB amounted to £12.3 million in 1997.</P>
    <P>The accounts of the Post Office Savings Bank are audited by KPMG on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Moreover, the POSB complies fully with the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in relation to measures and procedures to counteract money laundering.</P>
    <P>There are no plans at present to extend the business of the POSB beyond the two categories of deposit accounts now on offer.  However, significant improvements in the quality of customer service are now being achieved under An Post's counter automation programme.</P>

However, in April of this year DG IV, the competition directorate of the European Commission informed the Irish authorities that it had received a complaint concerning the present tax treatment of credit unions and sought information on the matter so that it could assess whether or not this treatment could be perceived as a form of State aid.  A reply was sent to DG IV at the end of May in which it was stated that the Irish authorities believe that the benefits enjoyed by credit unions are not sufficient to be regarded as aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Community has made a generous and substantial contribution to reconciliation and to economic and social development in Northern Ireland and in the Border counties.</P>
      <P>In this context, President Santer has spoken of finding new creative ways of availing of the fresh opportunities the Good Friday Agreement will bring.  The General Affairs Council of the community's Foreign Ministers, noted the contribution made by community assistance in promoting the prospects for peace and agreed that the community should continue to play an active role. The European Parliament has also called for consideration of how the agreement can be supported in practical terms.  Ireland warmly welcomes the ongoing support of our partners and the Government will continue to work with our community partners in examining the options for continued support in this regard.</P>
      <P>However, it is not yet clear what form community support for securing and consolidating the peace will take.  We are not aware at this moment of any particular proposal by the UK authorities for such community support.  More specifically, we are not aware of any proposal by the UK authorities to obtain full Objective One status for Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland on the basis of its GDP figures is facing the same situation as Ireland, i.e. graduating over the seven years after 1999 from full Objective One status to lower levels of Objective Two type assistance.</P>
      <P>The Government is, however, conscious that the recent prosperity achieved by Ireland has not applied uniformly throughout the country.  Certain regions have not done as well as the rest of the country in terms of indicators applying at the more localised level.  In particular, the regions of the Border, the west and the midlands currently have a per capita GDP of less than 75 per cent of the EU average.</P>
      <P>In this context one possible strategy to address the development needs of these regions, including the Border counties, is to pursue a regionalisation approach to the next round of structural funding whereby the country would be divided into two new regions, of which one, comprising the Border, the west and the midlands regions, would qualify for Objective One status.  Ireland cannot unilaterally adopt a regionalisation approach.  It would be for the European Commission as a whole to approve a regionalisation approach.  It has to be said that indications to date as to the likely response to this option are not positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, however, reiterate the Government's commitment in the Action Plan for the Millennium to those regions of the country, including the Border region, whose development is lagging <Col N="467" /> behind.  It remains to be seen whether this commitment can be best met by a regionalisation approach or by an approach where the best possible terms are secured for Ireland as a single region in transition.  This matter is receiving detailed consideration and has been raised with the commission at political and official levels.  A decision on the issue will be made at the appropriate time.</P>

Under present Irish law it is illegal for a person within the State to place a bet with a person outside the State.  As for revenue receipts, I would point out that there has been no falling off in receipt performance to date.  At £45.5 million in 1997 this is a significant source of revenue.

    <P>The Government's response in the matter, to which I fully subscribe, was set out in the statements issued at the time by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  These statements welcome this very detailed report on future pension provision and indicated that it would receive comprehensive consideration by the Government.  Indeed, the <Col N="468" /> Government has already accepted in principle the board's proposals regarding the introduction of a personal retirement savings account and of more simple and flexible tax arrangements for pensions generally.  Working groups, in which my Department will participate actively, are in the process of being established to carry out the necessary detailed examination of these issues with a view to introducing legislation at an early stage.</P>
    <P>In addition, a further working group, to be chaired by my Department is being set up to consider the board's recommendation that there should be part pre-funding of the future cost of social welfare pensions.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the board's recommended target rate for old age pensions, my representative on the board outlined my reservations on this matter in the report.  Subsequently, the Government decided that the issue of increases in pension rates and the PRSI financing implications of these should be examined in the context of the overall budgetary situation and economic climate.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in the course of my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 65 and 79 of 3 March and No. 55 of 28 April 1998, it was necessary, in light of the commencement of the Freedom of Information Act, to rescind those elements of circular 15/79 &mdash; Official Secrecy and Integrity &mdash; relating to the disclosure of official information. The new circular, 7/98, rescinds the relevant provisions in 15/79 and is designed to set out the principal precepts which now govern the proper disclosure of information e.g., by emphasising the public's right of access to official information and the importance of safeguarding the confidentiality of information of a private or commercial nature.  It has, of course, been long standing practice by public bodies to regularly release routine, non-contentious information to the public.  I am eager that this practice should continue in tandem with FOI.  For this reason, my department requested public bodies to put better arrangements in place for access by the public to such information outside of FOI.  More recently, I have asked the FOI interdepartmental working group to consider how well such arrangements are working in practice.  This matter will be addressed at the group's next meeting later this month.  If there are any difficulties arising I will be very happy to take action to ensure that these are addressed.</P>
      <P>It had been hoped to replace 15/79 with appropriate provisions in a new Civil Service code &mdash; currently under preparation, which would set out the principles and standards governing the work of civil servants.  However, it did not prove possible to have the code ready before the commencement of the Freedom of Information Act on 21 April 1998.  I propose to replace 7/98 when the code is promulgated.</P>

The Office of Public Works, in its general specifications, also requires contractors to comply with this Act, by disposing of hazardous waste to companies holding the relevant local authority permit and complying with EU (Waste) Regulations, 1979, EU (Toxic Dangerous Waste) Regulations 1982 and the Waste Management Act, 1996.</P>

      <Quest>the role, if any, his Department envisages for the Irish Sea Co-ordination Group in relation to dealing with the recent coming ashore of highly flammable phosphorous tubes in County Louth; if these incidents are covered by the joint Irish and United Kingdom Memorandum of Understanding on Search, Rescue and Pollution Control; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the recent appearance of dangerous devices on the east coast and the hazards these constitute for health and safety.  The Irish Sea Co-ordination Group, established in 1992 to advise on the potential for better integration of research and monitoring programmes, completed its deliberations in 1995 with the issue of its final report and became defunct at that time.  One of the immediate outcomes is the current Irish-UK exercise for the quality status report, QSR, which is under the OSPAR Convention and which is scheduled to be completed by the year 2000.  The QSR exercise does not have a direct role regarding chemical dumpsites but may yield some useful data.</P>
      <P>The joint Irish-UK draft Memorandum Understanding on Search, Rescue and Pollution Control referred to is under examination in my Department. It is proposed that the memorandum will apply to oil and chemical substances, as defined, which are carried on board a ship as cargo.</P>
      <P>The public concern which had arisen regarding the extent and stability of the dumpsite following disturbances of the seabed from the laying of the gas pipeline between Northern Ireland and Scotland led to close ministerial, official and scientific contact with the UK authorities and a comprehensive study of the dumpsite.  Irish scientists were fully involved in all aspects of this study so that we can have a high degree of confidence in the findings and recommendations.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned that, despite the survey and the putting in place of a management regime for the site, that materials very similar to those established to have arisen in the dumpsite are arising on our shores.  I have therefore been in close touch with relevant UK Ministers in the matter and I have directed my officials to work closely with the UK authorities in an effort to discover the causes of the current disturbance of the dumpsite and what immediate measures can be taken to restore and maintain its stability.  I have also asked that a full report be presented by the Army authorities to the UK defence attaché for transmission to the UK Secretary of State for Defence.  In view of the all island dimension of the matter I have been in close touch with the responsible Northern Ireland Minister, Lord Dubs.</P>

      <P>The Marine Institute advises that 16 fish kills have been reported to date in 1998, involving approximately 7,000 fish.  The following table gives the breakdown of incidents.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, I have given the highest priority to tackling pollution and the causes of pollution in fisheries and fish habitats.  I announced last August a six-point action plan on water quality management which is designed to ensure the resources of the fisheries boards and all relevant agencies are co-ordinated and deployed to best effect to deal with water pollution, by tackling its causes at source and by acting swiftly when it occurs.  I have directed the Central Fisheries Board to give immediate and top priority to continued implementation of the action plan in the weeks ahead.</P>
      <P>Progress has been made on a number of points, notably in terms of improved liaison, dialogue and co-operation between the fisheries boards and other relevant agencies as well as the farming organisations, and the current development of water quality monitoring programmes between the fisheries boards and the EPA.  Dialogue and co-operation is also ongoing between the Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  The Central Fisheries Board has invested in new equipment which considerably enhances the fisheries boards' capabilities in the analysis of water samples, nutrient analysis and pollution investigations.  Information dissemination and the publication of codes of practice by the IFA on silage effluent control and phosphate usage are heightening awareness generally of pollution risks and the need for constant vigilance and care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned about the situation in Nigeria and deplores the continuing human rights violations and the failure of the process of transition to civil rule.  The death of General Abacha last Monday will inevitably be followed by some political change, although the extent of this cannot be forecast.  We hope very much that his successor, General Abubakar, will fulfil General Abachas commitments with regard to ensuring a return to democracy and the rule of law in Nigeria before 1 October 1998.  The Government looks forward to the election of a civilian government which will not only restore democracy to the people of Nigeria but also significantly improve Nigerias standing internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent developments gave rise to increased concern in recent weeks regarding the stability of the country.  The adoption by the five registered political parties of General Abacha as their sole presidential candidate in April cast further doubts on the credibility of the process of transition to democracy.  The conclusion drawn by Ireland and the EU was that the Nigerian people no longer had confidence in the process.  Accordingly, at the Development Council on 18 May 1998, EU Ministers noted that there was no prospect of the Council lifting the sanctions imposed against Nigeria and emphasised that the European Union should focus attention on the need to build civil society and develop an alternative political culture in Nigeria.  EU embargoes and restrictions on relations with Nigeria are set out <Col N="474" /> in two EU Common Positions.  However, the Council agreed in November 1997 that the EU would adopt further restrictive measures if elections failed to produce a return to democracy and the rule of law in Nigeria before 1 October 1998. A group of experts is studying possible additional measures, in continuation of recent substantive discussions within the EU on its future relations with Nigeria.</P>
    <P>With regard to Chief Moshood KO Abiola, victor in the 1993 presidential elections, Ireland has repeatedly joined in calls by the international community for his release, most recently in an EU declaration issued on 27 May 1998.  In this declaration, the EU expressed its concern at the human rights situation in Nigeria and at a marked increase in the arbitrary arrest and harassment of human rights and pro-democracy activists and reiterated its call for the release of Chief Abiola and other political prisoners.  Ireland also strongly supported the international community's call for the release of Chief Abiola and all other political prisoners, as set out in the Resolution on the situation of human rights in Nigeria adopted on 21 April 1998 at the 54th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to support concerted international action aimed at achieving an early return to democratic government and full observance of human rights in Nigeria.</P>

      <P>Following a trial voyage the new Irish Ferries ship, the <i>m.v. Normandy</i>, has been approved by my Department to carry two units of calves and weanlings, with the option of increasing to four livestock units subject to certain conditions.  Pandoro is, I understand, continuing to carry some categories of livestock.  In addition my Department has recently inspected and approved an airplane for calf transport &mdash; a number of flights to the Netherlands have taken place thus far with further flights reserved every day this week.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available within my Department. However, statistics are available for the number of non-qualified persons who applied to the Irish Land Commission for consent to purchase agricultural land under section 45 of the Land Act <Col N="478" /> 1965 in each year since 1989.  Although the term qualified person is sometimes assumed to refer only to Irish nationals there are other categories of qualified persons, in that it was broadened in 1995 to include, among other categories, persons whose principal residence is in an EU member state.</P>
      <P>Statistics for the number of Land Commission consents issued on a county basis to non-qualified individuals over the years 1989 to 1997 are as follows:</P>

      <P>The Government's Action Programme for the Millennium <Col N="480" /> contained a number of commitments in the area of taxation.  I am glad to say that the last budget gave me the opportunity to advance these commitments significantly.</P>
      <P>My priority in the 1998 budget was to increase the personal allowances and reduce tax rates.  Personal allowances were increased by £250 in the case of a single person and by £500 for a married couple.  Both the standard and top rates of income tax were reduced by 2 per cent.  Furthermore, the PRSI allowance was increased by £20 to £100 per week for full rate PRSI contributors.</P>
      <P>Due to the considerable cost of these measures it was only possible in the budget to widen the bands by £100 single and £200 married.  In light of the above, and allowing for growth in incomes due to strong economic growth in addition to a greater propensity of both partners in a marriage to be working, it is estimated that the proportion of taxpayers who are taxed at the higher rate of income tax will increase slightly in the current tax year.</P>
      <P>The commitments set out in the Action Programme for the Millennium, including reducing the proportion of taxpayers being taxed at the higher rate, will be implemented over the five year period of the programme.  However, as stated in the programme, the full implementation of the measures will depend on continued strong growth in the economy, as all policies will be subject to the overriding requirement to stay within the terms of the EU stability and growth pact and the Maastricht criteria.  The precise changes to be included in any budget will be only decided at budget time each year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 116 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the national primary childhood <Col N="484" /> immunisation programme is a matter in the first instance for the individual health boards which enter into contracts with general practitioners for the delivery of the service.  The aim of the programme is to achieve an uptake level of 95 per cent and so eradicate the diseases in question.</P>
    <P>The most recent figures from the eight health boards indicate that uptake levels for completed DPT immunisation among children aged 12-18 months range from 68 per cent to 88 per cent. Where the uptake of immunisation among particular groups or in geographical areas is unacceptably low, the health board, which is statutorily responsible for the control of infectious diseases, may take whatever measures are required to achieve and maintain immunisation uptake.</P>
    <P>One of the main difficulties in the operation of the new system was the non-co-operation of public health nurses.  Following negotiations between the Department and the INO, this issue has been resolved.  The technical steering group, established to provide a mechanism for resolving any outstanding issues arising in the implementation of the new programme, is being reconstituted as an advisory group comprising representatives from the Irish Medical Organisation, the Irish Nurses' Organisation, the health boards and the Department.  The advisory group's remit will be to advise on all service issues related to the immunisation programme, particularly in relation to uptake levels.  Specifically, it will advise on the maximisation of uptake levels in particular geographical areas and among identified groups within the community, with a view to maximising all professional contributions to the primary childhood immunisation programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have responded to submissions made on behalf of student nurses participating in the nursing registration-diploma programmes regarding the matters referred to by the Deputy.  For the benefit of the Deputy, I will restate my position in relation to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to outline the change that has taken place in pre-registration nursing education and training.  The traditional apprenticeship model has been replaced by the nursing-registration diploma programme.  As a result, the concept of a student nurse as a salaried employee of a relevant health agency no longer applies in the case of students participating in the diploma based programme.  Such students are affiliated to <Col N="485" /> a third level institute and have student status only.  Nursing students are, therefore, supernumerary and are not paid a salary, but receive a package of financial supports including an annual maintenance grant.</P>
    <P>I recently approved a package of enhanced financial supports for student nurses participating in the nursing registration-diploma programmes, including a 20 per cent increase in their annual maintenance grant.  The total extra cost of these improved supports in 1998 alone is in the region of £1 million.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that student nurses participating in the nursing diploma programmes receive a far higher level of financial support than other third level students.  Each student nurse receives an annual maintenance grant of £3,000.  This grant is not subject to a means test.  In contrast, other third level students are required to satisfy a means test in order to qualify for a maintenance grant, the maximum rate of which is £1,624 per annum.</P>
    <P>Since the abolition of third level fees does not extend to the nursing diploma programmes, the student nurses' fees continue to be paid by the relevant health agency on their behalf The average annual fee is about £1,300.</P>
    <P>A book allowance of £200 and a uniform allowance of £120 is also provided for each student commencing the diploma programme.  They are also entitled to receive free meals on a seven day per week basis in designated restaurants in health institutions.</P>
    <P>In addition, a new allowance of £20 per week was recently introduced to assist students undertaking external placements.  This is payable where it is necessary for the student to find accommodation for the duration of the placement. Students undertaking such placements who do not require accommodation receive a free weekly travel pass.</P>
    <P>The average annual total value of these supports is £6,000 per student, which compares most favourably with the level of funding available to other third level students.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of fees payable in respect of the one year full-time degree course, the position is that successful completion by a student of the three year nursing registration-diploma programme leads to registration as a nurse with An Bord Altranais, at which point he or she will become eligible for employment as a nurse. Since a degree in nursing is not a requirement for registration as a nurse and subsequent employment, such a qualification would be an optional post-registration qualification.  Members of the nursing profession wishing to undertake a nursing degree programme are, therefore, responsible for making their own arrangements, including the payment of course fees.  I am not in a position to provide funding for these courses.</P>
    <P>The whole area of pre-registration nursing education and training is currently being examined by the Commission on Nursing.  It is my intention to review the present arrangements <Col N="486" /> in the light of the recommendations made by the commission in its final report, which is expected later this year.</P>

However, as the issue is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board I have asked him to have the matter investigated and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent report of the Environmental Protection Agency on drinking water quality in 1996 indicates that overall quality continues to be satisfactory in the public supplies.  Apart from coliforms and fluoride, compliance levels in respect of strictly health-related parameters were above 99 per cent in 1996.  In the case of coliforms and fluoride, the compliance levels were 92.39 per cent and 90.48 per cent respectively, representing a slight improvement on the 1995 position.  I have asked local authorities to ensure that intensive <Col N="488" /> follow-up measures are taken where exceedances from statutory quality standards have occurred.</P>
      <P>My Department is pursuing a programme of substantial capital investment in upgrading and providing water supply schemes to cater for demands generally and ensure compliance with the quality standards of the drinking water directive. Expenditure on major water schemes since 1994 has totalled more than £190 million.</P>
      <P>Almost £185 million is available for my Department's water and sewerage investment programme in 1998, an increase of £22 million or 13 per cent on the 1997 provision for these services. This will facilitate increased activity under the programme in respect of water supply schemes.</P>
      <P>There is a lower level of compliance with the drinking water standards in the case of private group and small private supplies, particularly for the coliform parameter.  A range of measures was introduced by my Department in 1997 to deal with water quality problems in these supplies.  I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 225 of 6 May 1998 for details of measures being taken to address problems in such supplies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Reports of fish kills from local authorities and fishery boards are collated by the Marine Institute's fisheries research centre.  I understand that the Fisheries Research Centre has recorded 16 fish kills involving approximately 6,800 fish to date in 1998.  The relevant details are set out in the following table.  I share the Deputy's concern about the number of fish kills recorded to date in 1998.  Primary responsibility to prevent pollution incidents rests with those engaged in activities that could entail a pollution risk. However, local authorities, as statutory pollution control authorities, have a key role in protecting water resources.  The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible in so far as activities licensed by the agency are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of my concern about the number and impact of pollution incidents during the summer of 1997, I wrote to local authorities in August 1997 urging them to intensify their efforts to identify potential pollution sources and to take appropriate follow-up action to eliminate the risks involved.  The measures I outlined then continue to provide an effective basis for action to minimise damage from pollution.  Local authorities were particularly asked to ensure that industrial effluent discharge licence conditions, operational practices and material-waste storage facilities are adequate to safeguard water resources.  In relation to agriculture, I asked the authorities to pursue a programme of visits to farms and intensive livestock and poultry production units and to give special attention to the management of animal slurries, silage effluent and sheep dip facilities, including disposal arrangements.  I also emphasised the need to ensure that water and sewage treatment plants are maintained <Col N="490" /> and operated to design specification to prevent pollution.</P>
    <P>With the onset of summer 1998 and the high risk period for water resources, I made a public appeal to all involved in activities entailing a pollution threat to adopt appropriate management practices to prevent pollution.  I again wrote to local authorities to remind them of my concern to ensure that each authority actively pursues an anti-pollution programme and that potential water pollution risks should be assessed in line with the advice given in 1997.  I also urged them to use the full range of powers and remedies available under the Water Pollution Acts, 1977 and 1990, including the provisions consistent with the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle to deal with pollution incidents and risks.  The provisions concerned cater for the recovery of costs associated with the prosecution of offenders, and the cost of measures to mitigate or remedy the damage done. They offer a mechanism to offset the effects of pollution and augment the deterrent value of penalties imposed by the courts.</P>
    <P>Alongside my immediate concern to ensure that every effort is made to minimise the risk of pollution incidents, a broadly based and comprehensive strategy is in place to address the increasing levels of eutrophication in rivers and lakes. This strategy incorporates a wide range of measures to tackle phosphorus inputs to waters from sewage, industry and agriculture.  In implementing the strategy, local authorities have been urged to adopt an integrated catchment based approach to the development and implementation of their pollution control policies.</P>
    <P>The catchment strategy also involves a major investment by my Department in upgraded sewage treatment facilities throughout the country, including provision of phosphorus reduction facilities where warranted in light of local water quality conditions.  Catchment based projects supported by the Cohesion Fund provide, in addition, for comprehensive monitoring and management systems which will enable pollution control strategies to be tailored to the particular needs of the local situation.</P>
    <P>A wide range of measures is in place to address the environmental impacts of agriculture, including impacts on water quality.  These include: nutrient management planning, promoted by Teagasc and local authorities as a key management tool in reducing phosphorus losses from farms; efforts to achieve greater uptake by farmers under the rural environment protection scheme, REPS; an improved package of measures has been approved by the EU Commission in respect of Natural Heritage Areas, NHAs, and commonages; improved capital allowances for targeted investment by farmers in pollution control measures; a targeted reduction in artificial P fertiliser usage over the next five years and detailed advice and recommendations in the code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates.</P>

      <P>The enforcement of the law is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the House before, I am aware that the holders of liquor licenses in certain western counties are concerned that law enforcement, in so far as it relates to closing times, is more rigorous than was perhaps the case in the past.  I have also been made aware of the perception that there is less rigorous enforcement elsewhere. I asked the Commissioner to examine what was being suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioner has informed me that since the laws governing the opening hours of licensed premises, including the provisions governing the granting of special exemption orders, have uniform <Col N="494" /> effect, they are enforced uniformly.  The Commissioner has also informed me, however, that the gardaí, on occasion have experienced difficulties of a public order nature in the enforcement of the liquor licensing laws.</P>
    <P>In one region, arising from these difficulties, it was the view of divisional officers that the maintenance of public order required priority attention and, as a result, there was agreement that enforcement of the licensing laws should be refocused. As part of this refocusing, due consideration was given to the processing of applications for special exemption orders, having regard to the statutory provisions governing the granting of such orders.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner has further informed me that, in accordance with his statutory responsibility for the general direction of the Force, a general circular was issued recently to all members on the topic of special exemption orders.  The circular recommends that the inclusion of certain conditions be sought in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions with a view to ensuring that the legislation is enforced in a uniform manner.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reference in the Deputy's question to a Garda memo, I am not clear as to which memo the Deputy has in mind.  Perhaps he could supply me with a copy of whatever document is in his possession.</P>

      <P>In February 1994 the Minister for the Environment passed to the Minister for Justice an application from the National Graves Association for the removal of the remains of all ten persons buried in Mountjoy for reinterment in the republican plot in Glasnevin Cemetery.  This request was considered by the then Minister who agreed to the proposal subject to the agreement of all of the next of kin.  When it emerged that one of the families had not consented and were not prepared to consent to disturbing the plot, the Minister felt that she had no option but to withdraw her consent.</P>
      <P>The remains of the volunteer whose family withheld their consent were interred in the same location as five others on the same day in March 1921 and the precise location of the various remains within the plot is uncertain.  In these circumstances it is clear that no exhumation of the remains could be attempted without risking an infringement of the stated wishes of one of the families concerned and, while I have no objection in principle to the proposed exhumation, I cannot agree at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 140, 141 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not keep records of visa applications according to purpose of visit and it would take a disproportionate amount of time to provide information on the number of student visas which have issued in the past year.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the significance of the English language industry in terms of foreign earnings, employment and Ireland's profile abroad.  Of course, in the case of many countries the requirement for a visa does not arise.  In those where it is required, my Department is committed to facilitating bona fide students in so far as is possible, while guarding against the risk that persons overstay illegally.</P>
      <P>To this end, my Department liaises on a regular basis with individual schools, is represented on the Advisory Council for English Language Schools and has established good channels of communication with industry associations. Officials from my Department have met industry representatives on three occasions to date this year and I intend that this liaison will be ongoing and productive.  One of the practical results of this co-operation has been the agreement of expanded guidelines for those involved in applying for visas for study which should issue shortly.</P>
      <P>The possibility of introducing special arrangements for the issue of visas for the purpose of study could be discussed in this forum, if industry representatives so wish.  However, regard would have to be had to EU regulations on visa formats and to the possibility that such separate arrangements might give rise to requests from other groups for specialist visas with the end result of unnecessarily complicating the visa system and contributing to delays.</P>

    <P>In so far as the question of staffing is concerned, additional resources have been made available to the visa section this year and I will keep the situation under review, having regard to available resources and the many other demands on my Department.  I am not convinced that the appointment of a dedicated English language student visa officer would represent an efficient utilisation of our scarce resources.  At present all staff deal with all categories of applicants and as such are in a position to respond flexibly to the <Col N="498" /> areas of greatest demand and also to cover for one another as required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's commitment to giving primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources is set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium. This commitment is clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates, where I have provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education versus the 1997 budget allocation. In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level represents an important step forward in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.  This increased capitation funding which I have provided for this year is reflected in the fact that the school referred to by the Deputy received a total of £40,140 in respect of 892 pupils in 1997.  In the current year the school has already received £30,310 in capitation funding while a further £12,990 will be paid at the end of June, bringing the total to £43,300.  In effect, the school will this year receive £3,160 over and above last year's allocation despite the fact that its enrolment has declined from 892 to 866 pupils.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to seek further improvements in the level of capitation funding for primary schools.</P>

      <P>The overall level of funding being made available for the provision of youth work services in 1998 is £13,567,000.  This represents an increase of 1.7 per cent over the provision for 1997.  The funding allocation for the Irish Girl Guides for the provision of youth work services is made available from the proceeds of the national lottery. A sum of £193,000 was made available for this purpose in 1997 and a similar amount has been allocated for 1998.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge and place great value on all aspects of the work carried out by voluntary youth organisations, including the Irish Girl Guides, in their communities.  My Department supports the work of these organisations through the provision of grant aid.  The overall level of resources made available for the provision of youth work services in 1998 is £13,567,000 representing an increase of 1.7 per cent over the provision for 1997.</P>
      <P>Due to the high level of ongoing commitments, it has not been possible in the current year to provide for increases in the level of grant aid made available to individual organisations and initiatives.  However, additional funding is being sought for 1998 and in the event of such funding becoming available, the level of support made available to youth organisations will be reviewed.</P>
