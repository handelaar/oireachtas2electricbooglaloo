      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I request the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific matter of public interest: the threat by thousands of members of the Garda Síochána to take sick leave on Friday leaving large sections of the country seriously underpoliced; the arrangements the Government is making to ensure adequate policing of the country and the security and safety of citizens; and the steps the Government intends to take to secure a settlement to the pay dispute with the Garda Representative Association.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration: the major threat to the security of the State and to public order and safety posed by the threatened and anticipated actions of individual members of the Garda Síochána; the failure of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to manage pay negotiations with the Garda, especially in light of the clear and unequivocal commitments given on the issue of Garda pay by the Minister as his party's spokesperson in Opposition; and the urgent need for the Minister to outline to the House the contingency arrangements which have been put in place to ensure State security, public order and public safety are maintained and upheld at all times.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 9a, motion re.  Membership of the Joint Committee on Broadcasting and Parliamentary Information; No. 9b, motion re.  Ministerial Rota for Parliamentary Questions; No. 9c, motion re.  Referral of Estimates for the Public Services (1998) to Select Committees; and No. 21, Statements on the Report of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child on child care services in Ireland.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 9a, 9b and 9c shall be decided without debate and that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 21: the opening statement of the Minister or Minister of State and the main spokespersons of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; Members may share time; and the Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes.  The Dáil, on its rising today, shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 May 1998.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a problem with No. 9c.  I believe the Dáil should have an opportunity to debate on the Estimate for the Department of Finance.  The revelation that the Department of Finance cannot find files in its possession after a three month search and that it has been less than frank in disclosing its difficulties in this matter until now suggests that the Estimate for the Department of Finance should not be referred to a committee of the House but should be discussed in the House.  If the Department which is responsible for administrative procedures and for the implementation of strategic management in the <Col N="611" /> public service is unable to maintain proper care over its own files, questions need to be answered in this House.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business was agreed by the Whips.  It is the normal practice that Estimates such as this are referred to a committee. If there are other matters about which Members wish to table questions, they are entitled to do so.  The item to which the Deputy referred was debated last night.</P>

      <P>Some time ago the Fine Gael Whip, Deputy Barrett, raised with the Taoiseach the fact that a number of Bills referred to committee are delayed and the committees have not met in some cases to consider these Bills.  This matter is in the Government's hands as its parties hold the Chair on most of these committees.  The Taoiseach said that he would inquire into this. What are the results of his inquiries?  Have they determined that the problem was that Ministers were not available to take the legislation or that the Chairs were unable to call meetings to facilitate Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett raised this matter with me on the Order of Business at 4.30 p.m. on Tuesday.  Yesterday I asked the Government Whip to investigate the matter and write to all the Chairmen.  There are a variety of reasons legislation has been delayed.  Through the Government Whip's letter I asked all the Chairmen to move on the Bills as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>On Tuesday's Order of Business the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, raised the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal with the Taoiseach who stated that the interpretation of the court was in accordance with the views expressed in the House.  Has he had a chance to reflect on this.  I reread the record of the debates and when an amendment was moved by Deputy Noonan to the terms of reference to specifically require that &ldquo;public office&rdquo; would include membership of the House, so that someone being looked at would have their periods in Opposition examined as well as periods in Government, Deputy McCreevy said that was the interpretation of &ldquo;public office&rdquo;.  This was the clear view of the House.  It would run counter to that if the term &ldquo;holding public office&rdquo; was now to be solely and narrowly defined as holding ministerial office.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not read the judgment. The Attorney General has extensively examined it and I may give a report on that when he reports to me.  The Chairman of the tribunal felt a number of matters required clarification as there may have been some ambiguity.  Two of these matters were mentioned by Deputy Quinn on Tuesday. The Chairman went on to correctly interpret them.  I have not examined the full statement but I will do so over the next few days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that it is the will of the House, and it was the expressed will of the House when the terms of reference were agreed, that &ldquo;public office&rdquo; would mean periods as a member of either House of the Oireachtas as well as periods in ministerial office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Ireland is a party to this convention.</P>
      <P>Successive Irish Governments are well aware that the decision to ratify any convention involves the voluntary acceptance of obligations and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is no different.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has asked me to prepare a comprehensive statement on the rights of children and there has been an informal Government decision in this regard.  The Department of Health and Children has been assigned the lead role in co-ordinating the response on these issues across the range of Departments concerned.  This will require detailed work by the relevant Departments to decide on how some of the more wide-ranging articles of the convention might be put into practice.  The objective of this exercise will be to improve the co-ordination of policies for children across Departments, to promote a rights-based approach and to progress the recommendations of the UN committee.</P>
      <P>When ratification of any convention is being considered an initial assessment is always conducted into the compatibility of the convention which it is proposed to ratify with the Constitution, our current legislation and any proposed legislation. Consideration is also given to any necessary administrative steps which will be required to give effect to the convention in question.  This procedure was fully followed in the case of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The decision was that there was no incompatibility between the Convention on the Rights of the Child and our Constitution and legal provisions. For that reason, the convention was ratified without any reservations.</P>
      <P>The UN convention follows the model of most similar conventions in that it includes a mechanism to monitor compliance with its provisions. This is a necessary discipline &mdash; it is useful to have an independent outside assessment in this area.</P>
      <P>The Convention on the Rights of the Child has what is probably the most thorough such monitoring mechanism.  It involves a reporting system &mdash; States Party to the convention prepare reports in a standard format which are discussed in draft forms with the relevant NGOs.  There may be agreement or disagreement following these consultations but I am happy to report there was broad agreement between the Government Departments concerned and the NGOs when we carried out this exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report is then submitted to the appropriate monitoring committee &mdash; the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  This committee is a high powered body, comprising international experts in the field and highly experienced in its task.  It holds a pre-sessional hearing at which it considers <Col N="617" /> the Government report in conjunction with the NGOs who are in a position to brief the committee and to have a substantial input into its analysis of individual country reports.  The NGOs bring their specific expertise to bear and, in conjunction with the expertise of committee members, the joint analysis can be formidable.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work of Irish NGOs &mdash; primarily the Children's Rights Alliance, the ISPCC, UNICEF and Focus on Children.  They made a very significant input both into the finalisation of the Irish Government's report and also into the preparatory work of the UN Committee.</P>
    <P>Following the pre-sessional hearing, the committee submits a list of additional queries to the Government.  Generally, these are issues which have been highlighted by the NGOs.</P>
    <P>The culmination of the monitoring process is the detailed examination by the UN committee of individual country reports.  The committee's examination of the Irish report took place in January and the Irish delegation was ably led by my colleague, Deputy Liz O'Donnell, Minister of State with special responsibility for human rights.</P>
    <P>The committee's examination was thorough. The delegation, which included officials from the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Foreign Affairs and also from the Office of the Attorney General, was involved in assisting the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, in responding to some very searching questions from the committee.  Following this examination the committee issued its conclusions and recommendations.</P>
    <P>Before summarising these recommendations, I shall identify strengths and weaknesses of our performance.  Our consultation with NGOs was thorough.  The Department of Foreign Affairs took the lead and the views of NGOs were welcomed and their input is valued.  Some States Party to the Convention did not make similar efforts to involve the NGO sector but no criticism has been made against us on this score, nor do I believe any such criticism could fairly be made.</P>
    <P>The NGO sector has spoken appreciatively of the openness of the Government Departments concerned to full and constructive dialogue.  The main NGO, the Children's Rights Alliance, which is an umbrella organisation, reciprocated when it discussed its pre-sessional submission with the Government Departments concerned.  This mutual recognition and respect is healthy and constructive and it ensures that issues are clarified prior to any public airing of issues which it is not possible to resolve.  I welcome this approach and I am sure it will continue.</P>
    <P>Our national report was a comprehensive analysis of our compliance with the convention. It sets out the position which was current at the time in a very lucid and readable fashion and is an excellent snapshot of the overall response of the State to issues affecting children.  In its concluding observations the UN Committee expressed its appreciation of the comprehensive <Col N="618" /> nature of the report and also of the additional material which had been supplied following the pre-sessional hearing.</P>
    <P>Our presentation to the committee in January was professionally handled.  The ministerial delegation included officials from all Departments involved.  It was in a position to respond very effectively to a wide range of questions raised by the committee.  In its concluding observations, the committee welcomed the constructive, frank and open dialogue it had with the delegation.  In informal discussions with committee members and with observers from international bodies which are routinely represented at committee sessions the performance of the delegation was favourably commented on and this is something we can be proud of.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the points made by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in its concluding observations.  The purpose of the committee is to criticise the performance of countries which have accepted the disciplines of the convention. It is not the committee's role to award plaudits &mdash; in the case of developed countries in particular, the committee makes assumptions about the commitment of the country concerned to ensuring compliance with the convention and the availability of resources to ensure this happens. Accordingly, it is easy to misconstrue the committee's concluding observations if one is unfamiliar with its remit and I ask Deputies to bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>The committee commented favourably on Ireland's commitment to adopting further measures to implement the convention.  It noted with satisfaction the welfare services established for the benefit of children and their families.  The committee also expressed appreciation at the high level of education and the advanced health system available.</P>
    <P>The committee welcomed recent law reform measures &mdash; especially the reference of the question of incorporating an amendment into the Constitution guaranteeing children's rights to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  It also welcomed the enactment of the Child Care Act, 1991; the Family Law Act, 1995; the Domestic Violence Act, 1996; the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996 and the proposed education and adoption Bills.</P>
    <P>The committee commended Ireland on its efforts to protect children from sexual exploitation. It was particularly complimentary in regard to the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>The committee then moved on to areas of concern. It commented on the absence of a national policy in regard to children which led to the State's response to the rights of the child being somewhat fragmented.  This is an issue we will have to address and I am anxious to bring forward proposals, which I intend to do shortly.  The committee felt existing services for the welfare of children do not adequately reflect the child's rights approach of the convention and commented <Col N="619" /> that not enough emphasis was placed on preventive measures.  We agree.</P>
    <P>In response to this comment, many of the initiatives taken since 1991 in the context of bringing the Child Care Act into operation have been in response to specific problems.  I do not need to remind Deputies in detail of the series of reports regarding the Kelly Fitzgerald case, the Kilkenny incest case and the Madonna House inquiry, which pointed to the need for the rapid development of our child protection services.  The criticism of the committee is not without merit but it is a counsel of perfection: we dealt with the problems we faced at the time, and in the circumstances I do not see that there was an alternative course of action.  Considerable investment of over £50 million has been made since 1993 in providing an effective infrastructure to enable health boards to carry out their responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, to protect children at risk.  The position has now changed, a significant base of services is in place and the committee's criticism is one we can now take up.</P>
    <P>In regard to the development of preventive services, I recognise their importance in adopting a strategic approach to helping families and am fully committed to expanding such services.  I expect this issue to be addressed comprehensively in the forthcoming report of the Commission on the Family and our response will be developed in that context.  I am conscious of the need for early intervention and am developing a series of pilot projects in conjunction with health boards and voluntary agencies in selected disadvantaged communities to identify strategies that will be effective.</P>
    <P>The committee was critical of the lack of co-ordination between Government Departments on child care issues.  However, since the hearing last January, my responsibilities in regard to the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have been clarified and interdepartmental co-ordination arrangements have been put in place. This goes a long way towards meeting the committee's criticism.  There has been much co-operation and co-ordination between the three Departments since I took over, following the footsteps of Deputy Currie.  It has now been put on a formal footing.</P>
    <P>The committee welcomed the decision to establish a social services inspectorate but was critical of the absence of an independent monitoring mechanism such as an ombudsman for children. The social services inspectorate will be put in place this year.  As I said previously, the establishment of an ombudsman for children is not my priority for 1998 but I note the committee's criticism and recognise that the issue must be addressed as soon as we can get around to it.</P>
    <P>The committee was critical of deficiencies in our statistical information.  I accept this area is in need of improvement and intend commissioning a consultancy study on this issue during the current <Col N="620" /> year.  In regard to promoting awareness of the Convention, the committee felt not enough had been done.  This is an issue we are addressing in conjunction with the Children's Rights Alliance.  My Department is involved with the alliance in preparing a publicity campaign and I intend to meet its members shortly to discuss the matter.  I recognise we also need to promote awareness of the Convention among the relevant professionals and we will also be looking at this.</P>
    <P>While recognising the willingness of the State to co-operate with NGOs, the committee felt their potential in contributing to the development of children's rights had not been fully recognised. This is a point we will consider and while I do not wish to be over-defensive I think it is a somewhat unfair criticism.  One of the main characteristics of Irish public administration is the close working relationship between all Government Departments and other statutory bodies such as health boards and local authorities and the voluntary sector, and clearly this will continue.  I welcome suggestions from the NGO sector in response to this point.</P>
    <P>The committee was critical of the current age of criminal responsibility, which is seven, and the proposal to increase this to ten in the Children Bill.  This criticism has been considered and was comprehensively responded to at the meeting. When the Children Bill is enacted it will include many substantial measures to update our juvenile justice system and at this stage I do not intend increasing the age of criminal responsibility beyond ten.  I think the committee's thinking in this area is influenced by the practice in civil law rather than common law jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The committee raised issues in regard to social exclusion of children, particularly the deprived and children from traveller families and refugees. The concerns expressed by the committee will be taken on board.  The committee was critical of the failure to take account of the views of children in the family, school and society.  Clearly, innovative responses will be required to allow society in general to respond to this criticism.</P>
    <P>The committee expressed concern about the lack of prohibition in legislation of corporal punishment. I should explain to Deputies that the Convention <i>per se</i> does not call on states party to it to prohibit corporal punishment but the committee sees this as being implicit in it.  It would be reasonable to ask why the framers of the Convention did not include such a specific provision if that was what was intended but this is an issue on which it would have been difficult if not impossible to have reached consensus and I am not sure I can solve that conundrum.  Currently corporal punishment is banned in schools but &ldquo;reasonable chastisement&rdquo; of children by their parents is not illegal.  This is an issue on which we perhaps need a wider debate and I would welcome views.</P>
    <P>The committee also criticised the lack of mandatory reporting mechanisms in the case of child abuse.  Again, the Convention does not provide for the introduction of mandatory reporting <Col N="621" /> and there is considerable divergence of views internationally on this issue.  However, the committee's views are noted and the Government is committed to the introduction of mandatory reporting within the lifetime of the current Dáil.</P>
    <P>The committee is concerned at the position of children born outside marriage and I will be responding in detail to this matter in reply to a parliamentary question this afternoon.  The committee also addresses issues relating to disability, drug and alcohol abuse as well as teenage suicide. Clearly these are important issues separate from our responsibilities under the Convention.</P>
    <P>The Convention also recognises the important role played by education in the development of children and stresses the need to ensure all children have full right of access to education services. The Convention emphasises the particular need to ensure that children with special educational requirements have access to an education service which enables them to reach their full potential.  We all agree we have some way to go before achieving that objective.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the Government to ensuring equality of access to education services is reflected in the Education (No. 2) Bill, which contains statutory safeguards for the rights of all children, including those with disabilities, to an education service.  One of the key objectives set down in the Bill is that of promoting equality of access to and participation in education and the promotion of means whereby all students may benefit from education.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the Bill, the Minister for Education and Science and his officials have had consultations with a wide range of interests in education, including parents of pupils with disabilities. The Minister is currently considering proposals for amendment to the Bill to further clarify areas of concern to such interested parties. The Minister has committed himself to addressing, as far as practicable, the shared objective of strengthening the educational rights of parents and their children.  In this connection, I am pleased to note the welcome for the Education (No. 2) Bill expressed by the Children's Rights Alliance.</P>
    <P>The many detailed recommendations made by the committee are being examined in the Government Departments concerned.  One of the problems I have faced, especially in the Department of Health and Children, is a shortage of staff to progress the many initiatives under way in the child care area, including the adoption area.  I have finalised my discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in regard to additional staff and expect to announce the details shortly. This will be of great assistance in bringing our consideration of the issues raised by the committee to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>The convention adopts a radically different approach to children than we are used to.  It presents challenges to the State, society generally, schools, everybody dealing with children and, in particular, parents.  No one should be afraid of <Col N="622" /> the principles set out in it.  We will all benefit from living in a society where the position of children is recognised and cherished.</P>
    <P>The convention should be seen as a positive document.  The principles set out in it should guide us all.  The debate should attempt to address it in an informed way.  It would be a great pity if the many significant developments of recent years were to be devalued in an attempt at point scoring.  Let us recognise instead that, while much remains to be done, much has been achieved and for most Irish children, though unfortunately not all, life is rich in many possibilities for a full and happy life.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate and responding to the points Deputies will make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister of State's contribution in the context of it being a response to the criticisms voiced by the committee which looked at our performance concerning the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and, while I have no wish to engage in political points scoring, I found it extraordinarily depressing. It was a litany detailing the complaints made by the committee, noting them in some instances and commenting that perhaps something will be done about some of them on some specified date. There was a failure to acknowledge the extent of what needs to be done if the rights of children in this State are to be fully protected.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is correct that, fortunately, many children lead enriching and good lives and many of the problems we will discuss do not touch on the majority of children in this State. The convention is primarily concerned with ensuring that the rights of children are properly protected and that, where children are in difficulty, due to family problems, abandonment, neglect, personal difficulties or difficulties due to circumstances over which they have no control, certain minimum standards will be applied.</P>
      <P>It is clear the Government has no coherent policy or approach to any of the issues which directly affect or impact on children.  Its record is little short of appalling compared to that of its predecessor. I say that as much in sadness as in anger. The previous Administration took children's issues by the scruff of the neck, imposed on Government Departments a degree of co-ordination that had been sadly lacking and, as a consequence, produced within its short lifespan a series of Bills which had long been awaited and were badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been in office for ten months.  A political party such as the Fianna Fáil Party or the Progressive Democrats which said so much about these issues on the Opposition benches could have been expected to have legislation prepared to be put through the House on assuming office and a coherent idea of the direction it would take.  To date, no legislation relating to children has originated from the Government. The only legislation relating to children that it has enacted is legislation published by the previous <Col N="623" /> Administration which did not manage to get on the Statute Book before the last election was called.</P>
    <P>When the Government came to office we returned to the past chaotic position when various Ministers had different responsibilities for children and child care and there was a total lack of co-ordination and co-operation.  The Minister of State was not allowed to fulfil a co-ordinating role until his ministerial colleague at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, found herself embarrassed at the hearing which took place before the United Nations committee. I say that with no sense of satisfaction but with regret.</P>
    <P>If the Government was serious about the Minister of State fulfilling a co-ordinating role and having the capacity to bring forward the many initiatives required, he would not have to justify, every two or three weeks, his inaction and inability to deal with issues by citing the lack of staff within his Department.  I would have expected that by now he would have been allocated the funding required to ensure he had adequate staff to make a dynamic impact on the various issues that need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The only legislation the Minister of State has promised to introduce this year is the Social Service Inspectorate Bill.  It is not listed among the Bills to be given priority which have some prospect of being published before the summer recess. There is a minimal possibility that it will be published this year.</P>
    <P>We have been informed by the Minister of State that it is the Social Service Inspectorate Bill to which he will give priority over and above all other issues concerning children.  God help us if that is the speed at which the many outstanding issues that need to be addressed will be addressed.  Apparently, everything else is on hold while this legislation which might be published before Christmas is being drafted and prepared.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is correct that a number of things the United Nations committee said were praiseworthy in the context of the advances made in relation to children but it remains the position that in a broad spectrum of areas, in the context of legislation, administrative practice and social services, the best interests of the child are not being properly protected in this State, although they might nominally be protected under legislation which genuflects in that direction.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary, no matter how deficient the number of staff, that the Minister of State's Department is bereft of up-to-date statistical information to analyse needs in the area of child care.  This is highlighted in the United Nations committee's report.  It was highlighted by me, well before the committee published its report, in questions tabled last year.  There has been a series of questions tabled not alone by me but other Deputies, including Deputy Shortall who is in the House, seeking information about issues on which one would expect the Department to be <Col N="624" /> fully informed.  For example, Dáil questions have been tabled seeking to ascertain how many reports have been made to health boards of alleged child abuse, physical and sexual, at particular moments in time which remain to be investigated. I have asked the Minister on a number of occasions this year where the health boards stood on 31 December 1997, the date by which they were supposed to collate statistical information. As we approach 1 May 1998, I understand the Minister for Health and Children is unable to tell the House how many reports of child abuse or neglect made to the health boards remain to be investigated and in respect of which no assessments have yet been undertaken, as of 31 December 1997.  I find that quite extraordinary.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked in a parliamentary question last week about the number of children in care at the end of 1997 and whether they were in residential or foster care.  His Department was only able to give statistics for 1996.  On 23 April 1998 the Minister could not tell us the position at the end of 1997.  That means the Minister and his Department, when making policy decisions and determining financial allocations for children at risk, are flying on a wing and a prayer and making &ldquo;guestimates&rdquo; of the extent of problems.  Health boards have not yet been properly disciplined to ensure they maintain accurate and up-to-date records in regard to fulfilling their duty to ensure the welfare of children in each health board area is protected, as required by the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>The United Nations committee is critical of this State's failure to have coherent and up-to-date statistical information on children, particularly children at risk, available to it.  What is the Minister's response?  He told us today he accepts improvement is needed in this area and that he will commission a consultancy study on the issue. I asked the Minister very substantial questions in the Dáil on this issue a couple of months ago.  Has the need for a consultancy study only occurred to him now?  What has the Department been doing about this issue?</P>
    <P>Does it not occur to the Minister that it an outrageous failure on the part of the Department of Health and Children, which bears central responsibility for ensuring the child care system is properly funded, not to have up-to-date and comprehensive information available to it on children at risk and what the social services are doing to protect them?  That is inexplicable and an indictment of the manner in which this Government is dealing with its child care obligations.  It is symptomatic of a lethargic approach which is in violation of our obligations under this convention. We have a very profound duty to ensure children at risk are properly protected.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he does not see the appointment of an ombudsman for children as a priority.  An ombudsman for children, which was recommended by the Children's Rights Alliance and the need for which was accepted by the previous Government, would have provided a central <Col N="625" /> focal point to ensure the departmental failures in assessing the impact of child care legislation and of maintaining up-to-date information would be rectified by an independent person who saw that as a primary obligation.  Presumably, the Minister's consultancy study may redo some of the work done previously by the Children's Rights Alliance and return to us in a year's time to say that part of the solution is a children's ombudsman.</P>
    <P>There is no reason the Minister could not put in place a children's ombudsman at the same time as dealing with the social service inspectorate.  We have been told the social service inspectorate will commence operating without a statutory basis and that the legislation will eventually be put in place.  While that is not a satisfactory arrangement, at least it means a step forward.  When will the social service inspectorate start operating?  I recall the Minister telling us towards the end of last year that it would be operating by the spring of this year.  If the Minister has a difficulty in drafting the necessary legislation to give the ombudsman a statutory base, there is no reason it could not be put in place on a temporary basis while the legislation is being prepared.  The need for such an individual is quite clear from the Minister's departmental failures.</P>
    <P>This Government lacks a dynamic in dealing with the issue of children's rights and protection. We have watched the Government muddling along in the adoption area.  The adoption legislation which was finally passed recently was initially brought before the Dáil and Seanad by my colleague, Deputy Currie, when he was a Minister of State.  The Government did not have any new insights which would enable it to make any changes or amendments to that legislation, beyond changing a reference to &ldquo;the Minister for Health&rdquo; to &ldquo;the Minister for Health and Children&rdquo;. That is indicative of the fact that the Government has no additional policy initiatives in the adoption area.</P>
    <P>A Supreme Court judgment was delivered in the past two weeks dealing with the issue of the rights of persons placed in an adoptive arrangement prior to 1952 to trace their parents.  The waiting period for that judgment was used as an excuse by the Department for not drafting legislation to deal with the issue of adopted children tracing their origins or making available to natural parents of such children a statutory mechanism to enable them to make contact with their children.  It is extraordinary the Minister did not refer to that issue.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court judgment has effectively said that children have a right to trace their origins and natural parents have a right to privacy. It is for the Oireachtas to legislate to reconcile those rights and put in place mechanisms which facilitate people who wish to make contact with each other.  What are the Government's intentions in regard to legislation in that area?  Thousands of people are affected by the need for such legislation.  There is not an adoption agency <Col N="626" /> which does not receive inquiries on a weekly basis about the tracing of origins.  There are no proper statutory arrangements in place to facilitate dealing with this in a coherent manner.  The Government has an obligation to put those arrangements in place.  If the necessary legislation is not provided, the United Nations committee will be extremely critical of this State, and rightly so, as this falls within the rights of children.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to take some important initiatives.  I note with great sadness there was nothing in the Minister's speech to indicate any initiatives on any matters affecting children.</P>
    <P>Members and the public have watched the litany of court cases in which convictions have been sustained for child sexual abuse.  We have observed the manner in which people have courageously come forward in this area and in some instances, convictions were sustained as a result of their courage.  As far as I am aware, there are at present over 100 cases in the courts in which members of religious orders, religious orders themselves and the Roman Catholic church are defendants in proceedings in which damages are claimed by victims of abuse suffered at the hands of clerics.  This has been a source of great pain and distress to many members of the Church who had no idea these incidents were taking place and who now find they were unwittingly working in their parishes with child abusers.  The case of Fr. Payne was mentioned in the newspapers this week.  He has finally and rightly been convicted for the acts he committed.  A prosecution would not have been taken without the courage of Mr. Madden, who effectively outed Fr. Payne.  We have also had a considered and genuine public apology from the Christian Brothers who in a public and correct fashion have confronted what was done by a very small minority of their members.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government took initiative in this area.  If we allow matters to continue as they have we will find that, within 18 months to two years, the number of cases for compensation sought by people who are the victims of abuse at the hands of members of religious orders will exceed 100 to 200 and will go well beyond 1,000 to 2,000.  This issue will not go away.</P>
    <P>There have been indications from some members of the church that they would welcome consideration being given to the formation of a tribunal to deal with these claims.  While the State is not liable for these cases, the Government should discuss the matter with the Catholic Hierarchy with a view to seeing if legislation can establish a form of tribunal to allow the victims of sexual and physical abuse at the hands of members of the clergy seek compensation from those responsible for the hurt they suffered without having to go through the full panoply of the civil court system and without incurring the delays and expense involved in that system.  It is not good enough for Members of this House to sit back and watch what is happening.  It is also <Col N="627" /> insufficient for some of those in authority within the church to wring their hands and say they sympathise and are willing to offer help while they vigorously defend within the courts system the actions being brought and by so doing add to the hurt of those who have suffered.</P>
    <P>Before I am accused of having a vested interest in this tragic problem &mdash; I have said it before in this House &mdash; I know of about five cases in which my law firm represents people who are the victims of abuse in such circumstances.  A very small number of people are represented by my firm. They feel they are entitled to compensation and there are many more in that position.</P>
    <P>It is time an initiative was taken in this area. We are not merely like spectators at a football match watching from the sidelines.  We are observing tragedies that befell children in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s who are now adults coming out into the open.  We must provide a means to ensure that the consequence of what people suffered is addressed in a humane and sensitive way and that it does not necessitate hundreds of people going through the type of pain and difficulty that was inflicted, for example, on the McColgan children by the health board who they sued because of its failure to take appropriate action in circumstances in which they suffered unspeakable horrors within their family.</P>
    <P>The case involving the McColgan children gave rise to a great deal of public concern.  We were told that a report on whether the health board failed in its duties with regard to the family in the late 1970s and 1980s would be furnished and made public.  Has the Minister received the report?  If it is being delayed what has he done to hurry up the health board in producing it?  I always had reservations about a health board arranging for a report on itself.  The report should have been conducted by an independent group appointed by the Minister.  However, he chose not to take that option.  He now has a responsibility to ensure that whatever report is being prepared is rapidly completed and published.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not clear on what he intends to do to ensure that the rights of children, as outlined in the convention, are more widely known and understood.  Nor is he clear on what he intends to do to ensure that those rights are fully and comprehensively reflected in Irish law.  The review committee on the Constitution recommended that Articles 41 and 42 require amendment and that the rights of the child should be given a higher regard than they appear to be given in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The report of the review committee, which deals with a wide variety of issues with different levels of priority, is being considered by a committee of this House.  There is no reason the Minister could not ask the committee to indicate whether it agrees with the recommendations made with regard to children's rights, or, if it has any differences with the review committee, to indicate them to the Department.  There is also <Col N="628" /> no reason he could not bring forward proposals on the constitutional changes which the review committee has recommended.  He might indicate to the House if he is prepared to do so.  Has he any interest in doing so?  If the committee examining the review committee's report recommends to the Minister that the report's recommendations will involve a constitutional amendment, will he implement that recommendation?  We are entitled to know if he has a view on this and the action, if any, he intends to take.</P>
    <P>There are practical problems in dealing with children which, on very limited occasions, are highlighted.  Many disputes relating to children are dealt with in the courts system.  The vast majority of disputes in the marriage breakdown area or between parents who were not married to each other, in relation to the care, custody and upbringing of children take place in the District Court.  Some District Court judges deal with such cases with great insight and sensitivity; some should not be let within ten miles of dealing with them.</P>
    <P>Special training is not provided to the Judiciary to ensure that those adjudicating on disputes over the future welfare and upbringing of children have the necessary background and insight to make decisions in a way that protects their welfare and does not exacerbate family conflict. Some District Court judges seek reports from welfare offices attached to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to facilitate them in determining the outcome of such disputes. I have highlighted in this House on a number of occasions over the past six months that the welfare services are incapable of meeting the demands made on them.  For example, if a District Court judge in Dublin seeks a family assessment to be undertaken to help him or her determine the outcome of a child custody dispute it may take six to nine months for such reports to be prepared.  On occasions, the welfare services have told the courts they are unable to undertake assessments because they are understaffed and overworked.</P>
    <P>As he now has a co-ordinating role in this area the Minister might tell us what initiative, if any, he is taking in that context?  Is anything being done?  Have there been any substantial staff increases in this area and will there be in the future?  Does the Minister know the extent of the problem at present in the courts system in having independent assessments carried out by welfare officers attached to the Department of Justice?  It is not clear if he knows anything about that.  A Law Reform Commission report made recommendations for a radical overhaul of the manner in which the courts deal with all types of family problems, including disputes in relation to adoption, custody of children and childcare applications. Does the Government have any policy to implement that report?  There was no mention of it in what the Minister of State said today.  This is all to do with ensuring a uniformity of approach in the protection of the welfare of children and <Col N="629" /> that those involved in making decisions have the necessary background training and understanding to approach matters properly.</P>
    <P>The United Nations committee expressed the view that insufficient steps have been taken to promote widespread awareness of the convention and it remains concerned at the lack of adequate and systematic training on the principles and provisions of the convention for professional groups working with and for children, such as judges, lawyers and law enforcement personnel including police officers, health professionals, teachers, etc. The Minister said in reply to Dáil questions that money is being put in place in the health boards to provide training for social workers in some of these areas, but he said nothing about what the Government intends to do in relation to members of the Judiciary.  I do not believe that is acceptable.</P>
    <P>In relation to the education of children, what is happening in this State with regard to children who have special needs, who are unruly or who suffer special difficulties is little short of a national disgrace.  Every few weeks on a regular basis parents take cases to court to seek to require the Department of Education and Children to provide educational facilities for children with special needs.  It was only this week such court proceedings were brought by parents seeking financial assistance to provide a special educational structure for an autistic child.  Some health boards in this State send children abroad and spend enormous sums of money providing an educational system for children that should be provided in this State, other health boards are not addressing the issue and end up defendants in court proceedings.  I understand we are spending in the region of £2 million per year &mdash; the Minister might confirm that figure &mdash; providing for the funding of specialist schooling abroad and in defending such court cases.  We are defending the indefensible.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will tell us what initiatives the Government is taking to ensure we have correct educational facilities for children with special needs whose parents are under great pressure and still want the best for their children. We want to ensure children who have been difficult during their childhood can grow and mature into adults who can have a fulfilled life.  To date it has been clear the Government has no coherent policies to address this area.</P>

      <P>I am glad that finally we have an opportunity to comment on the report of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  Ireland appeared before that committee in January and it is regrettable we did not have an early opportunity to debate that important report.  In spite of numerous requests to the Taoiseach to allow Government time for such a debate, nothing happened for three months.  I am grateful to my party Whip, Deputy Stagg, for pushing this matter at the Whips' meeting last week.  Because of that we have a few hours to debate it today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> I am disappointed the senior Minister is not present, given the importance of the subject.  The Minister's title in the Department was changed by the Government to the Minister for Health and Children, but it seems he is Minister for children in name only.  On a number of occasions when he was asked questions on childcare matters or other issues relating to children he invariably passed the buck to his junior Minister.  With all due respect to the Minister of State present, if the Government is serious about dealing with the childcare crisis and in view of the damning report from the UN, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, should at least have taken some time to speak to us today on what he proposes to do in response to that report and to outline if he has any policy in this area.  I am disappointed he has not seen fit to take the time to do that.</P>
    <P>The double act played by the Minister and the Minister of State in this regard is incredible.  The Minister has abdicated all responsibility for children and has passed the buck to the Minister of State and when the Minister of State is pressed on any matter he complains he does not have the necessary resources or the staff and meanwhile the Minister manages to get away scot-free.  His absence today is disappointing and seems to be an indication of the lack of priority he attaches to all matters relating to children.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of point scoring and I do not believe in that type of politics, but this is an opportunity for Members to call the Minister and the Minister of State to account for what they are doing in respect of children's rights.  What we have heard so far from the Minister of State is bitterly disappointing.  It is defensive in the extreme.  He sought to downplay the many serious criticisms contained in the UN report and to highlight the few positive comments on Ireland made by the committee.  This type of defensive approach to childcare issues is unacceptable.  As politicians, we all must recognise we have failed children in many respects because over many years we have not given children's issues the political priority they demand and deserve.  That applies to successive Governments, but we had started to make some progress.  That was largely due to the work of the campaigning efforts of many of the NGOs.  Childcare issues were starting to appear on the political agenda and were receiving greater attention, but unfortunately the Government has rolled back on much of that progress.</P>
    <P>The only way we will make progress on childcare matters is for us to be honest about this.  To do that, we must admit that we failed people in this respect in the past.  We must give the area of children's issues much greater political priority, put it on the agenda and be honest about what is needed in terms of resources, staffing and funding. We must also start to lay out a systematic strategy for tackling the issues and for ensuring all concerns are addressed.  That requires honesty. We need to be upfront about what is required, about the neglect at official level down through <Col N="631" /> the years and the need to adopt a systematic approach to this area.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed the Minister of State was so defensive about what we have been doing, what his Government has been doing and the lack of honesty shown in his approach to this.  Children, especially those at risk and who are most vulnerable in our society, need someone to champion their rights, someone who will fight for them and insist their rights are met in full.  They need someone who will campaign for them.  Unlike adults, children do not have a platform, by and large they do not have their own campaign and lobby groups and for that reason we need someone who will fight their corner for them.  That is the type of Minister we need in charge of children.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, said the approach taken by the UN committee is new and it will take some time to get used to it and to bring our services up to the required standard.  However, I remind the Minister that Ireland signed the UN convention in 1992.  There has been much time to bring services up to standard, to put this matter on the political agenda and to get used to taking the rights-based approach to children's issues.  To say it will take some time is not an acceptable excuse since we have had eight years.</P>
    <P>The Government organised the build up to the previous election campaign and its entry into power particularly well.  It had access to huge resources in terms of marketing, opinion polling, research and public relations.  From where those resources came is another matter, but it put huge resources into getting the campaign right and gauging the mood of the people.  It set up focus groups and brought in lobby groups.  Fair play to the Government; it put in the effort and it gauged the mood of the people.  However, I am surprised that it completely overlooked the area of children and their rights.  It was not a priority area and it did not recognise its importance.</P>
    <P>When the Government came into power there was scant reference in its programme to children and the need to tackle this area in a serious manner. The previous Administration made some progress in trying to overcome the institutional barriers to the provision of good quality child care services through the co-ordinating role of the former Minister of State, Deputy Currie.  His brief straddled the three unwieldy Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Health and Children in an effort to draw together a coherent policy on children. However, there was a complete rowing back by the Government on the small progress made in that regard.  It did not appear to recognise the need for this co-ordinating role.  It did not recognise the major problems which result from the unwieldiness of those three Departments and the fact that child care issues, particularly those relating to vulnerable children and children at risk, have always been the poor relation in the Departments which always had more important matters <Col N="632" /> with which to deal.  The Government appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for children but his brief only extended to the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>When the Government's mind was focused on the need to account for itself before the UN committee and defend some of the practices in Ireland, it realised there was a major problem in relation to co-ordination.  There was a change in policy and arrangements were made to extend the responsibilities of the Minister of State to the other two Departments.  This act alone indicated that there was no appreciation on the Government's part of the problems which exist and how they might be overcome.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the extension of the Minister of State's responsibilities, it is not enough.  Most people involved in child care recognise the need to be much more radical in terms of putting children's issues on the political agenda.  The only way that will ever happen is by the creation of a new Cabinet post of Minister with responsibility for children's affairs.  Children's issues are covered by so many different Departments and they are always bottom of the list.  An example is the issue of juvenile justice in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  There are many high profile issues with which the Minister must deal but little attention, time or resources are given to the area of juvenile crime which involves children who are most at risk.  It is the poor relation and it has received little or no time throughout the years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children and his Department also deal with major high profile issues daily.  Issues relating to children are way down the agenda and matters relating to children at risk rarely get attention.  This also applies in the Department of Education and Science.  Mainstream education in primary schools is the least well funded sector and children with special needs barely get a look in in the Department.  It is not good enough to have a Minister of State with roving responsibilities.  He does not have a place at the Cabinet table.  Lip service is paid to this area.  If we as a society are serious about putting children's issues at the top of the agenda and ensuring there is total accountability in that regard, a senior Minister with sole responsibility for all matters relating to children must be appointed.</P>
    <P>The days of making excuses about interdepartmental rivalry and turf wars are gone.  This problem has been long recognised and there is a need for concrete proposals on how it will be overcome. I am discouraged by contacts I have had in various Departments because of the apparent lack of understanding of the nature of the problems relating to children on the part of senior personnel who have responsibility for policy.  This area will not be driven by people involved in turf wars or old ways of thinking in Departments.  It must be politically driven and given priority by the Government through the establishment of a senior ministry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> In spite of the Minister of State's attempts to downplay it, the UN committee highlighted 17 different areas of serious concern in relation to the way in which our child care services are organised and funded.  The first relates to the fragmented approach to dealing with child care services and the fact that there is no comprehensive policy.  The Government's manifesto had many different policies about many different matters, but it had no policy about child care.  I pressed the Minister on this aspect at Question Time and he mentioned examining different areas and attempting to address issues in a piecemeal fashion.  The problem is that the Government has no considered or comprehensive policy on children.  It is made up as the Government goes along or in response to a crisis which arises. It is policy on the hoof.  A considered approach is not taken.  There are enough reports and people involved in the NGO sector to tell the Government what problems exist.  People are more than willing to sit down with the Minister and work on the development of a policy.</P>
    <P>Services have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner over the years, often in response to crisis issues. There is a need for a policy which has a clear strategy in terms of how it will be implemented. Regrettably, the Government does not appear to have paid any attention to this area.  There has been no debate on a possible strategy and, therefore, there is no concerted approach to tackling the problems.  I appeal to the Minister of State to take on board the UN committee's serious criticism and to develop a strategy and a framework in which we can start to deliver adequate child care services to address the real needs which exist.</P>
    <P>Regarding the drawing up of the strategy, I appeal to the Minister of State to involve the NGOs as much possible.  The expertise lies in this area.  Clearly it is not in other Government Departments where there is departmentalised thinking.  If a matter relates to child poverty we are told it is not the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science and if it relates to educational opportunities we are told it is not the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children.  There has been enough buck passing. NGOs are aware of what is needed, they take a broad rather than a departmental view and they should be fully involved in drawing up the strategy. Will the Minister outline the timescale involved in implementing that recommendation? It is important to do more than pay lip service and vaguely aspire to take on board the criticisms of the UN.  We must be very specific and have a clear timescale.  I would welcome further detail on that matter.</P>
    <P>The UN committee very much regrets we do not take a rights-based approach.  The constitutional review group considered the charter and the constitutional amendments required.  What are the Minister's proposals in that regard?  One of the problems with setting up a review group or a committee is that we are told work is ongoing <Col N="634" /> and questions are not answered.  Given that the committee examined the UN Convention, what are the Minister's intentions with regard to the recommendations?  Will he give a timescale for their implementation?</P>
    <P>Lack of co-ordination is central to this matter. The only satisfactory way of overcoming this problem is by appointing a senior Minister with responsibility for children.  The Government has not given a commitment in that regard.  In the absence of such a policy, what does the Minister intend to do to improve co-ordination?  Has he considered setting up a child care authority on a statutory basis?  Such a request has been made by a number of groups and individuals working in the area of child care.</P>
    <P>A major issue of concern highlighted by the UN committee is the lack of an independent monitoring mechanism.  Promises in that regard were made to the committee before the election and in January by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell.  The impression was given that this matter was ready for hearing by the committee, but there has been no follow through on it.  There is need for an ombudsman for children and a social services inspectorate.  At the UN committee the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, said that priority would be given to the establishment of a social services inspectorate which would concentrate on child care.  Some time later the Government published the programme of legislation, but the social services inspectorate proposal had gone off the list and instead there was a proposal for a child care inspectorate.  I asked the Taoiseach in the House whether a child care inspectorate is to be set up instead of a social services inspectorate, but he did not understand the importance of the two proposed bodies.  Will the Minister clarify whether it is intended to set up two separate inspectorates or, in the event that only one is set up, what it will be called?  Has the Minister abandoned the idea of an ombudsman for children?  What is the follow through on the commitments given in January?</P>
    <P>There are lacunae in statistical and other information relating to children.  In recent months I tabled many questions to the Minister in this regard and invariably received replies stating that the data requested was not readily available. Promises were given that the Department would contact the eight health boards to get the information and would forward it to me, but that takes a long time.  If that basic information is not available in the Department, what work is the Department's planning unit doing?  That unit is supposed to consider statistical data, plan ahead, consider the needs and ensure proper services are put in place to meet them.  There is a complete absence of basic computerisation in the Department and health boards and, therefore, there is lack of information.  That matter needs urgent attention. We must ensure information is provided on all children as defined by the UN, that is all persons up to the age of 18 years.  What steps is the Minister <Col N="635" /> taking to deal with that problem and will funding be made available?</P>
    <P>Attention is drawn in the UN report to a number of shameful areas in regard to children such as the high incidence of teenage suicide, the incidence of alcohol and drug abuse and the large number of early pregnancies.  There seems to be a difficulty in putting those problems into a social context.  When we debated the EU report on substance abuse the Minister was extremely defensive and trotted out what various health boards are doing, but that is not good enough.  Social analysis is necessary to find out why there is a high rate of alcohol and drug abuse, suicide and teenage pregnancies among our young people. Unless there is analysis of that information, we cannot put in place the services required.</P>
    <P>In regard to education, there is concern about high drop-out rates and poor school attendance rates.  The Government said it is taking those concerns seriously.  It is of major concern to me that there are non-attendance rates of up to 30 per cent in many schools in disadvantaged areas of Dublin.  We all know the implications of that for the future welfare of those concerned.  Yet the school attendance Bill, which is urgently needed, has dropped down the agenda and there is a vague promise that it might be introduced later this year.  That is evidence of lip service to this whole area.  School attendance is a key issue.  It is often the earliest indicator that there are serious problems in a child's life.  Yet we are not serious about putting in place a proper service.  That should be given priority if we are to tackle child welfare issues.  When questions about this matter are raised with the Minister for Health and Children we are told it is a matter for the Minister for Education and Science.  Clearly there is lack of co-ordination in this area.</P>
    <P>Many criticisms of services relate not only to lack of co-ordination but to serious under-funding. That is not recognised or understood by the Government.  Some months ago the Minister admitted there is a serious problem of underfunding in his Department.  The Minister of State said that approximately £100 million would be required to put in place the child care services required, and that is probably a conservative figure. Given the research facilities available to the Minister in the lead-up to the election, why did he not recognise that need and, when he came to office, put forward proposals for funding those essential services?  It should have been a priority for the Government in the budget to find the £100 million to put in place those vital services. At a time of plenty, when money was available, there was an opportunity for the Government to introduce creative and effective measures in this area.  It missed that opportunity.  For example, it became a priority for the Government to halve capital gains tax, a measure which will cost the taxpayer more than £40 million in one year.  That would have gone a long way to put in place the type of vital child care services we require.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> Clearly, addressing child care and child welfare issues is not on this Government's political agenda because it has chosen to put substantial amounts of money back into the pockets of people who are already well off.  When it had the opportunity to put a large amount of money into the services needed, the Government resisted it. It was not important to the Government to do so and it gave money back to those who did not need it.  Again, children have to wait for the proper services.</P>
    <P>In spite of the Minister of State's apparently sincere approach to this area, it is hard to take him seriously.  It is also hard to take the Minister and, indeed, the Cabinet seriously.  When the Government had the opportunity to do something radical and significant about improving our child care services, it chose instead to ensure it was pay back time for the wealthy backers of the Government parties.  It has neglected its responsibilities in terms of providing services for children. The performance of the Department of Health and Children, at senior and junior levels, and of the Cabinet over the past ten months has been bitterly disappointing.  They have had several months to consider this report.  Although people were new to the job and the Minister of State did not have responsibility in this area previously, they have had ten months but they have not yet come up with any concrete proposals to tackle these glaring problems.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to answer the questions I asked.  I cannot hope this Government will do anything serious about children's rights and disadvantage.  The Minister for Education and Science was in the Dáil last week debating the Education (No. 2) Bill and I appealed to him to be serious about educational disadvantage.  I appealed to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to look at income support for children.  Progress was made in recent years in that area where we had started to allocate money where it was most needed, but this Government has rowed back on so many fronts.</P>
    <P>I am bitterly disappointed by the Minister of State's performance to date and that of the Government in relation to child welfare.  I intend to continue to press him on this issue.  I will ask the Minister, who is supposed to be responsible for children, to come to the Dáil to speak to us occasionally about the needs of children.  It is not good enough for him to walk away from the issue in the manner in which he has done.  I pay tribute to the work done by so many campaigning NGOs in this area over the years when it was neither fashionable nor profitable for them to be involved in these areas.  They have built up a considerable wealth of knowledge and expertise which the Minister is wasting by not learning from it.  I appeal to him to rethink his approach in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity presented by this report for a considered debate on the rights of children.  While I do not blame <Col N="637" /> anybody for pointing out the deficiencies in the performance of a particular party or Government, it is important we recognise that children come first.  Let us consider their rights and how we can deliver a better service to them.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State had a co-ordinating responsibility in a previous Government in the area of youth work and sport and his record will stand up to the most rigorous scrutiny.  He put youth work on a secure footing and I have no doubt he will champion the rights of children in his present ministry.  This report is welcome but we must do better &mdash; to use a phrased used by teachers.  There is no point pretending recent Governments have blazed a trail of glory in the provision of services to children and young people.  We have a patchy record and reviews dating back to the review initiated by the late Frank Cluskey in the 1970s which examined in detail the deficiencies in the system at that time, through to the most recent reports, all indicate that the resolve of State agencies has been less than satisfactory in many cases.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Shortall, I pay tribute to the magnificent work done by the NGOs, including the ISPCC, the Children's Rights Alliance, Barnardo's, Focus Housing, Tabor House and so on. If the voluntary sector did not underpin much of the provision for child care and youth services, we would have a very poor service.  We should actively engage them and avail of their considerable expertise.</P>
      <P>There is a number of positive notes in the report.  The committee appreciated the high level of the education and health systems.  It also noted the recent efforts undertaken in the field of law reform and welcomed the enactment of the Child Care Act, 1991, its amended version in 1997, the Family Law Act, 1995, the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, and the drafting of the education and adoption Bills.  The committee commends the numerous efforts and concrete measures taken to protect children from sexual exploitation, including sex tourism.  It also notes areas of concern and it is important that we address them.  Let us not be afraid of criticism.  I would prefer to be severely criticised if it resulted in a better service.</P>
      <P>The committee regretted that the State's approach to the rights of the child appeared to be somewhat fragmented.  If we had a tune, we could sing it.  Services for children have been fragmented for years and not only in the areas of education, health, justice and social welfare covered by the Departments but also in those areas at local level.  I commend the efforts of the previous Government and of our Government to bring some form of coherence to delivery of child care services.  However, much more needs to be done and it will involve the co-ordination of resources in terms of professional services and finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee also noted the lack of adequate co-ordination among bodies in promoting and protecting the rights of the child.  We have been <Col N="638" /> weak in this area over the years and have delivered a service without being sure of its focus.</P>
    <P>The committee notes that in certain instances statistics on the problems of children are being collated only in respect of children up to the age of 15.  That is a serious deficiency.  On the one hand the education system is used to collate whatever information is available while on the other the services of the Department of Health and Children and the health boards are used.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he intends to commission a consultancy study on this issue during the current year.  I am surprised that was not done many years ago.</P>
    <P>The committee is also concerned about the disparities with regard to access to education and health services.  While recognising the steps already taken, the committee notes with concern the difficulties that children from vulnerable and disadvantaged groups continue to face, including children belonging to the traveller community, those from poor families and refugee children, with regard to the enjoyment of their fundamental rights including access to education, housing and health services.  That is a serious indictment and I am glad we are now addressing this problem.</P>
    <P>The views of children are not generally taken into account in the family, at school or in society. As a nation, we do not often take into account the views of children, and in the past people used to say that children should be seen and not heard. I welcome the measures being taken in this regard, particularly in the Education Bill, to take account of the views of children.</P>
    <P>When I worked as a teacher we introduced a child centred curriculum which was excellent in that it encouraged children and young people to become actively involved in the development of policy at local level.  That approach does not seem to have continued but I welcome the Minister's comments recently, in the context of the development of school plans, that the views of children and students would be taken into account with those of parents, management and teachers.</P>
    <P>The committee expressed concern about the incidence of teenage suicide.  Concern was also expressed about children who are excluded from schools because of sanctions imposed by teachers and the adverse effect that generates which can sometimes have an impact on drop-out rates and school attendance.  That is a significant and long agenda and I want to address a number of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Education is the key to addressing many of the problems currently experienced in this area.  In the area of pre-school education, we have relied for too long on the goodwill and co-operation of groups like the Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association which operates playgroups often in cold, damp and badly resourced rooms in community centres, the basements of corporation tower blocks and so on.  The Early Start programmes were an important initiative and they are having a dramatic impact not just on the lives <Col N="639" /> of three and four year old children but also on the lives of their parents.  I compliment the previous Minister for Education on introducing that initiative which to a certain extent replicated the headstart programme in the United States in that it intervened not only at an early stage in the child's life but also brought some coherence to bear on the delivery of services to children. Speaking from some first hand knowledge of the initiative, I welcome the fact that children's nurses, social workers, family therapists, teachers and child care assistants are working together in the interests of children.  I am aware that an evaluation of that initiative is currently being undertaken but I have no doubt it will be beneficial in the long-term in addressing issues such as early school leaving and the detection of difficult behaviour.</P>
    <P>The mother and toddler groups set up by the Eastern Health Board throughout its area &mdash; I have seen a number of them in action &mdash; is an important initiative.  It focuses on issues such as breast feeding, the health care of children, the avoidance of abuse, etc., and it is having a major impact in these areas.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Education and Science on his initiative in setting up the forum on early childhood education.  I realise the report has not yet been finalised but I understand there seems to have been an important engagement on the part of the partners in education in the forum. I have no doubt the recommendations of the forum are eagerly awaited and hopefully will be acted upon.</P>
    <P>The initiative whereby children with special needs are integrated into mainstream primary and post-primary schools is beginning to bear fruit.  The Joint Committee on Education and Science discussed the report of the Special Education Review Committee last week.  It is appropriate to suggest at a policy level that we should integrate children into the mainstream education system &mdash; that is long overdue &mdash; but it involves a commitment to the training of teachers and the provision of child care assistants, resource teachers and classroom assistants because every child is unique.  The child with special needs who is integrated into a mainstream primary school needs a great deal more support than the average child.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the level of integration of traveller children in mainstream primary schools.  In many cases, there is a receptive approach taken to the integration of these children into the education system.  I am not entirely convinced there is a willingness in many areas for full integration of traveller children in mainstream schools.  I am aware of the initiatives undertaken, certainly by the Eastern Health Board in the Dublin area, in setting up pre-school playgroups on some of the settled and sheltered housing sites, which are proving to be effective. The sheltered workshops for travellers that are <Col N="640" /> blossoming throughout the Dublin area are doing excellent work.</P>
    <P>We should all be concerned about the drop-out rate from primary education among traveller children.  I am concerned that the number of travellers availing of post-primary education is extremely low.  That problem must be examined in great detail.  Perhaps the home-school liaison service could be expanded with a view to integrating such groups into the mainstream system.</P>
    <P>Approximately 20 years ago, arising out of a report commissioned by the late Mr. Cluskey, two excellent initiatives were brought forward.  The neighbourhood youth project and the youth encounter project were set up as pilot projects and seem to have remained as such.  There has been a reluctance on the part of successive Governments to expand the neighbourhood youth projects &mdash; perhaps they are seen as a challenge to the system.  These initiatives are an attempt at co-ordinating services for young people at risk in disadvantaged areas.  They are expensive, which is to be expected with any worthwhile initiative, but the benefits outweigh any cost that may arise.</P>
    <P>The youth encounter projects have the designation of special national schools.  There is one of these projects in Dublin, one in Cork and another in Limerick, and they cater for approximately 25 children and young people.  These projects should be replicated throughout the country.  Discussions are taking place with the Department of Education with a view to developing models based on the youth encounter projects.  Time has moved on, and a modified version of the youth encounter projects may be what is called for.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative on eight to 15 year olds and early school leavers.  That will help to identify trends and may even identify some of the causes of the problems.  I commend the initiative of some school principals who, in trying to tackle the problem of early school leaving and school dropout have, arising from the demographic dividend, assigned some of their teachers as school counsellors under the Breaking the Cycle Initiative.  It is often assumed that school counsellors are required only at post-primary level.  They are just as necessary at primary level.  They are certainly useful as remedial and resource teachers, and I hope that initiative will be underpinned with resources fairly soon.</P>
    <P>Parents should be more actively involved in initiatives to combat such problems as substance abuse.  Recent programmes which have been piloted and which are now being delivered in some primary schools will have an impact on children, their rights and lives.  The employment this week of an extra 15 psychologists by the Department of Education is a welcome development.  It is not very long since we had a school psychological service which was that in name only.  A committee sitting at the moment is expected to report within the next month on the service, the form it should take and how it should deliver its services.  I have no doubt that school attendance and other issues <Col N="641" /> will be addressed.  I am committed to bringing forward a school attendance Bill at as early a date as possible.</P>
    <P>In the area of special education, the exclusion of difficult children from school is a serious problem. It is being addressed to a certain extent in the Education Bill and elsewhere.  It is unsatisfactory that so many children under the age of 15 are arbitrarily excluded from school.  They inevitably get into trouble.  This is a nettle we have to grasp, and it has been grasped to a certain extent in the Education Bill.  The whole area of special education needs to be looked at again.  I wanted to range over a number of areas relating to young people but, because of time constraints, I will conclude.  I welcome the opportunity of the debate.  We should not be afraid of criticism provided we build upon it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most significant report on the rights of children that this Government is likely to receive in its lifetime, but its response is profoundly disappointing.  A junior Minister came into this House and made a statement, but the senior Minister is nowhere to be seen.  That is the first point that has to be made, and it sets the tone for this whole debate in a most dispiriting fashion.</P>
      <P>The speech by the junior Minister was illuminating in that it showed up the paucity of his thinking about his area of responsibility.  It is clear that he has no strategic approach, even though the report and recommendations from the UN committee have at their core the requirement to produce a strategy on the rights of children.</P>
      <P>It would be no harm to start at the end of the report, at recommendation No. 41, which directs that the presentation made by the Government and the response of the UN committee in the form of this report be made widely available to the public, and that the report be published and disseminated in order to generate debate and awareness of the principles of the UN Convention. I have no doubt that the vast majority of people in Ireland have no knowledge, or very minimalist knowledge of the convention and what it could mean for children here.  Nothing more clearly defines the Government's lack of intention as regards taking real, effective action on this convention than its approach even to the report itself, even to whether it will be disseminated.  If this report was good news, it would have been put between glossy covers, it would have had an introduction from the Minister, there would have been a press conference and children there to satisfy the photographers.  It would have been splashed in the papers as a good news feature to promote this Government and the two Ministers. It is not good news.  This report is real news and, as far as this Government is concerned, that means it has to be buried.  I went to the Oireachtas Library to get a copy of the report and I was amazed to get a sheaf of photocopied pages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a continual basis I asked the Taoiseach to have the debate which was promised at the UN <Col N="642" /> committee.  I was given the brush-off time and time again.  It was promised here before Easter and it is only now we are having this debate.  The fact that the senior Minister does not even bother to come into the House is a disgrace.  The junior Minister disappeared as soon as he made his response.  He does not have to stay here, but it is indicative of how little he is taking on board in relation to this project.  This is a major project affecting thousands of children, but he is not even here to listen.  That this convention and also the committee hearings got any type of platform is thanks to the nongovernmental organisations, particularly the Children's Rights Alliance.  Without them the Government would have succeeded in burying the whole embarrassing business.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated he supported the development of an awareness campaign and that he will be meeting the Children's Rights Alliance shortly.  In view of his inauspicious record, I would like the Minister to spell out the extent, nature and funding of this campaign.  The report itself is extremely comprehensive.  It is not written about services as we would like to see them.  It is written about our services as others see them, in this instance a distinguished expert group looking at the full range.  There is something rather laughable about the Minister trying to diminish the value of this report by stating that the committee makes assumptions about the commitment of any developed country and that its job is to be critical. The job of the UN committee is to assess not what we think we are doing but what we are doing to comply with the convention.  The committee has done its job and has done it well, and we should record our gratitude for that work.</P>
    <P>It is in many ways a damning document.  I accept that, and I do not lay all the blame on any Minister, senior or junior.  However, it is also a true document of grave importance that must not be shelved.  The central point is outlined in recommendations Nos. 6 and 28: &ldquo;This is the suggestion of a national strategy for children incorporating the principles and provisions of the UN Convention in a systematic way in the designing of all its policies and programmes&rdquo;.  It is a theme returned to in the report, the urgent need to bring a coherence and clarity into what has become a ridiculously fragmented and at times chaotic range of services.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of the relationship with NGOs is emphasised.  I have no doubt but that to create such a strategy would be an enormously progressive move but, so far, the Minister has not undertaken to make even that central commitment. That commitment is needed because despite prosperity and economic growth, life for children is in many ways becoming more unequal, more exploitative and sometimes more dangerous. Children comprise a large proportion of our population and they depend on us to protect their rights.  However, we also depend on them to guarantee our future.  Yet, at the end of the 20th century, thousands of Irish children fall far short <Col N="643" /> of having basic equality.  A section of the 1916 Proclamation deserves repeating:</P>
    <P>The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all its parts, cherishing all of the children of the nation equally..</P>
    <P>Some 80 years later, our children live in a republic in which the objective encapsulated in that statement is still beyond their reach.  We do not cherish our children equally and some not at all.</P>
    <P>The lack of planning has impacted at national level but especially on specific service areas.  Children at risk or children taken into care are referred to in the report.  In the Eastern Health Board region, health professionals are slow enough to take children into care and that is not a bad thing.  However, even with that caution there is, in the Eastern Health Board region, a chronic overloading of the system.  It is breaking down because there are too few residential places, the existing ones are invariably full up and foster homes are becoming scarcer.</P>
    <P>We all recall the recent case of a young person with a learning disability who was on heroin and was living on the streets because there was no safe refuge for him.  He was not the only young person in that situation.  Another young person suffering from cerebral palsy was living on the streets for weeks.  A 13 year old girl on heroin was homeless for five weeks.  Teenagers can be difficult to place in foster homes because they may be considered to be too much of an undertaking or a challenge.  However, there was an instance of a new born baby abandoned by its mother, being left in hospital by the health board because it had nowhere to place it in care.  What does that tell us of our commitment to children? The lack of suitable accommodation has become so serious that in certain cases, leaving the child in the abusive situation is almost becoming the preferred option for the health professional. Building a high support unit is all very well but St. Ita's in Portrane is not the right place to locate it.  Much more must be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us if he intends to have an ongoing effective targeted campaign to encourage fostering.  It will become increasingly difficult to obtain foster places as more women go out to work and the pool of foster mothers grows smaller.  The health board must work harder to ensure places are found.  Children as young as 14 or 15 are being told when the health board office closes at 5 p.m. to go to the Garda station and wait until after 8 p.m. for the emergency service to open.  I know of a case where it cost £5,000 a week to keep youths in a guest house.  Where is the sense in that?  Is it not an indication of how chaotic our services are and of the importance of developing a strategy?</P>
    <P>One relatively small item in the report which <Col N="644" /> the Minister could have addressed and from which he could have won some brownie points is breast feeding.  There is a low level of breast feeding in Ireland but there is at the same time a good representative organisation in the La Leche league.  The Department has a strategy in favour of breast feeding.  It is a good thing because it is natural, protects the baby, helps the mother and is, therefore, something to be encouraged.  La Leche is in danger of having to cancel two weekend training courses for 100 leaders because the Department of Health and Children has failed to respond to a request for a modest amount of money.  Will the Minister of State tell the Minister and the Department that we are talking peanuts in financial terms?  The Department of Health and Children refuses to display La Leche leaflets but has no problem referring people who seek them to La Leche which then has to cover the postage costs.  That is miserliness.  La Leche has requested assistance to reprint its excellent leaflets which the Minister of State, who is a doctor would appreciate.  If nothing else comes out of this debate, and I have a horrible feeling that nothing else will, can it be ensured that the level of breast feeding is improved?</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to refer to his intentions for the Ombudsman for Children.  The Taoiseach stated that legislation would be ready and published by the end of the year.  It is a longer time away than any of us would want.  The Minister should tell us precisely what is in his proposal for the Ombudsman for Children.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about education.  While early school leavers have been rightly targeted by the Minister for Education and Science, young people are still suspended or expelled from school without a proper system being in place to ensure they are given the education they are entitled to and are required to be given under law.  There is also still an unacceptably high number of children who have no access to remedial teaching although they need it.  In west Wicklow, for example, six national schools do not have a remedial teacher.  At a time of such prosperity, surely it can be ensured that such a basic educational requirement is quickly met.</P>
    <P>I do not want to heap blame on the Minister for all the ills in the area of child care because that would not be right.  However, any Government must be judged by the effort it puts in and the choices it makes within the confines within which it must live.  I find disturbing the failure of the Government to provide resources and to ensure the Minister for Health and Children does not neglect children.  If anyone is guilty of neglect, it is the Minister, Deputy Cowen, because he is the voice of children at the Cabinet, but I suspect that voice is never heard when it comes to the hard bargaining for resources.</P>
    <P>When the Government was obliged to make a presentation to the UN committee, it should have been seen in a positive light as kickstarting a strategy in the area of the rights of children.  The idea of children's rights is new to us.  It has not <Col N="645" /> been part of our tradition but we are growing towards it and that is a good thing.  The Minister must give effective leadership in this.  I stress again the need for a strategy and ask the Minister to say why he has not stated that he will draw up a strategy based on the UN convention as has been required.  People want the needs of children to be met at a time when there is plenty of money available.  It is a question of setting priorities rather than of resources not being available.</P>
    <P>The public does not want to see children homeless, begging on our streets or addicted to heroin, but that desire must be translated into effective political action.  The Government has not met that core requirement.  The UN convention and the committee hearings offered it an opportunity to live up to that challenge, but it failed to do so.  I hope that as a result of this debate the Minister will realise the problem will not go away.  The health board will not suddenly be in a position to meet the demands of modern urban life which is creating serious problems for families, particularly children.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister refer to the constitutional issue and the co-ordinated actions of the various statutory agencies?  The review group has done its work; it is now a matter of Government direction. The anti-poverty strategy is set in the context of a budget in which the rich were enormously enriched and the poor slipped back a few paces. What does the Government intend to do to seriously tackle poverty and protect children, the largest section of the poor?  It is interesting to note in the report that the UN committee sees us as a developed, economically prosperous and socially advanced country with a strong identity. That is only part of the picture.  The other side is spelt out in the report in a way that we cannot disregard.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister reply to all the questions posed by Deputies and move forward on this issue?  He should not abandon the process and move on to the next business.  This is much too important to put aside in the hope that the problem will go away.  That will not happen unless a strategic approach is adopted to address the underlying problems that prevent children having and expressing rights.</P>

      <P>I too welcome the opportunity to address the House on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It is the role of Opposition spokespeople to be as negative as possible and to point out the shortcomings on all matters. However, it was the nation, not the Government, that was examined by the UN convention and the actions of successive Governments were measured.  We must all contribute to meeting the <Col N="646" /> needs of children and a knee-jerk reaction will not be sufficient.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus outlined her approach when she was in office which tended to involve calling press conferences, gathering people around her and producing flashy reports.  I do not agree with that approach.  Her childish criticism of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, in particular, went down badly.  She referred to his absence from the House.  She knows he is directly responsible for these issues.  He has been in the House since the debate started.  She participated for 20 minutes and left.  The least a Minister is entitled to is to leave the House to have something to eat at some stage during the debate.  I am deeply disappointed at her childish criticism.  She referred to a case where a health board had to place an abandoned baby in a hospital because of a lack of places.  She participated in Government for nearly four years and left office less than 12 months ago?  What does that say about her track record?</P>
      <P>We must adopt an honest approach and continue to work collectively in terms of children's needs.  Successive Governments and society have let down children and we are seeing the proof of it now.  I have spoken on a number of occasions about children's needs.  Our Constitution tended to be used as a hideaway for inactivity.  Mr. Haughey was the first to nominate a Minister with direct responsibility for children's needs.  He tried to co-ordinate the efforts of the Departments of Health, Social Welfare, Education and Justice, all of whom had a finger in the pie, but merely pursued their own roles.  We have moved forward since then, but much more remains to be done.</P>
      <P>A change of mindset is needed in our approach to the rights of children.  The Minister of State made an honest contribution.  He pointed out that one of the problems he faces, particularly in the Department of Health and Children, is the shortage of staff to progress the many initiatives that are under way in the area of child care.  He also pointed out other areas that need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The report contains many welcome recommendations. The Minister of State correctly stated it is not the role of the UN to tell us how well we were doing in meeting the needs of children, but to point out our shortcomings.  It is inevitable, therefore, that the report will highlight many negative aspects about participating countries. We need somebody to point out what needs to be done and I welcome the UN's intervention. I also welcome this debate.  It is a timely reminder of the need for the rights of the child to be incorporated in all aspects of public policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report highlights a number of important aspects.  It is appropriate that we recognise the extraordinary contribution of voluntary agencies and organisations, without whom many child related issues would have gone undetected in local communities.  There is not enough co-operation between agencies with responsibility for the protection of children.  I welcome the UN's <Col N="647" /> recommendation about the appointment of an ombudsman for children and a national child care authority.  I urge the Minister to appoint an ombudsman and set up such an authority as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There are many positive aspects about our child care policies to counter the negative aspects highlighted by the Opposition.  Deputy Carey outlined some of the positive programmes that have been put in place in the past ten years.  The Child Trafficking and Pornography Bill and the decision to establish a social services inspector are two examples of recent initiatives, but there are many more.  The report correctly raises concern about other situations such as the lack of guarantees for the child to maintain contact with both parents after divorce.  In this context it is important that we are aware of the need for further changes and improvements and that programmes are put in place and carried through, regardless of political or other changes.  There will be changes but we need to be continually aware of them and work for the good of children.</P>
    <P>We must put child welfare at the centre of all Government policy.  That implies the need to address a massive range of issues.  I mentioned those arising from the report but there are many others such as adequate child benefit in specific, targeted situations; the provision of low-cost, quality child minding facilities; pupil:teacher ratios; a clean, safe environment in which children can play and learn; a sensible restriction on children's working hours &mdash; I am sure this will be debated during forthcoming legislation on pub opening hours &mdash; proper health and safety regulations to care for young people who have to go to work and measures to tackle school truancy and dropout rates.  Deputy Martin is currently tackling many of these issues and the provision of secure units for young offenders which will not be colleges of crime.  Each of these issues must be addressed if we are to truly care for all our children.</P>
    <P>However, there are many other issues which must be addressed.  As chairman of the Southern Health Board for a number of years I worked on the issue of the right to education for the severely and profoundly mentally handicapped.  Issues such as this cannot be put aside and only reacted to in response to a UN advisory group or anyone else.  We need to work with these people as a birthright to ensure that every possible facility is put in place for them.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas which need to be addressed.  Traveller children were identified in a report.  We also need to address the issue of the children of refugees.  They are covered under the Refugee Act, 1996, so they should be catered for if we fully implement that Act.</P>
    <P>There are other issues such as mandatory reporting of child abuse, which the House will need to discuss in a clear and non-political manner. There are diverse views on whether this should be implemented.  Some professionals have <Col N="648" /> voiced fears yet committed voluntary groups have indicated that we will not get anywhere until we have a proper reporting system.  We need to work with a clear commitment to benefit children.</P>
    <P>I have had the privilege of being involved with the Togher Family and Pre-school Centre, which has produced more benefit in my area than every Minister or departmental secretary who held office.  It started as a voluntary group of citizens which now has programmes in place which, if replicated throughout the country, would greatly assist in redressing problems, particularly those in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Family support centres and other such facilities need support, particularly financial support.  They are capable of securing local input.  There will be times when they need professional support from health boards, psychologists and so on, but they are largely self-supporting in terms of staff. However, they need a national commitment and in looking at child care areas we should copy the best examples.  Deputy Carey mentioned a few examples in education which might be costly but we should seek to copy the best examples.</P>
    <P>I have an interest in this area as I am a trustee of the Togher family centre.  As chairman of the health board on four occasions over the past 12 years I have been worried about facilities for the handicapped.  It was only the combined action of parents which forced successive Ministers and Governments to take action.  I do not want to see that in future.  Facilities should be provided as a right.  I hope we will move forward in a positive way as a result of this debate.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1993 with the decision that there was no incompatibility between the Constitution and the convention. In January 1998 Ireland became the 88th out of 192 signatories to be examined.  It is healthy to have a body which looks at the functioning of a convention when ratified and I hope that such a committee is in operation for all EU conventions.</P>
      <P>Such a procedure provides an opportunity for constructive criticism and I would like to think that is what Ireland received.  As Deputy Dennehy stated, the role of the committee was to find fault as opposed to highlight what we were doing right.  It is only by discovering what we are doing wrong that we can make corrections.  At the same time finding out what we are doing well will have an impact on other countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland's implementation of the provisions of the convention underwent rigorous examination and we were found to be in need of more action in many aspects.  However, it was also privately acknowledged that Ireland was by no means the worst.  The committee received substantial replies to the issues it raised.  We took a serious attitude to the committee and this was appreciated.  The openness of this approach is of great importance if progress is to be made on child care services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> Ireland was complimented for the law reform measures introduced such as the Child Care Act, 1991; the Family Law Act, 1995; the Domestic Violence Act, 1996; the Family Law Act, 1996; the Sexual Offences Jurisdiction Act, 1996, and other measures on education, adoption and the protection of children from sexual exploitation, in which it was recognised that we were almost leading the world.  The committee also welcomed the decision to establish the social services inspectorate which the Minister intends to have in place this year.  It is an important move forward.</P>
    <P>The co-ordination of people and services can be applied to every sphere of life, particularly in relation to child care facilities.  I often come across situations where one is sent from Billy to Jack or from Mary to Joan before one gets the appropriate section of a Department or body. Things are improving but more has to be done. However, the role of Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is very important.  It is a difficult role.  It is one thing to be involved in a specific subject but when issues such as children cross so many divides it is difficult to pull things together and I wish him well on the many different ideas he is trying to pursue.  As mentioned by Deputy Dennehy there was a reference to staffing and I hope that matter will be addressed.  As his role transgresses the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice and Law Reform it involves a multi-departmental team of officials. Multi-disciplinary measures are vital to improving co-ordination.  We need a comprehensive policy on children and we are moving in that direction.</P>
    <P>Many voluntary groups such as the Children's Rights Alliance, the ISPCC, UNICEF, Focus on Children etc., all of whom I compliment, are doing important work in relation to children. Rather than focus exclusively on providing secure units &mdash; I accept there are children who will need that type of assistance &mdash; we should move towards prevention rather than fire brigade measures.  I would hope the idea of prevention being better than cure will persist and gain momentum from support staff.</P>
    <P>It was appreciated by the committee that in the main Ireland has a good health and education system. However, much remains to be done in the fields of education and justice to help prevent children needing some of the child care measures. Education needs to be brought to as many people as possible at an early stage.  I appreciate that for the previous Minister and the present Minister this has become a priority.</P>
    <P>I agree that society is changing, that children are beginning to speak out and are being heard. I hope the child at risk will continue to be identified. School attendance should be monitored.  If children are not at school, why?  What are the background problems?  When children have physical difficulties they need the facilities of a child care assistant.  Those with learning difficulties need help.  I could continue <i>ad nauseam</i> in relation to remedial teaching, as I did last year, and succeeded in getting one extra teacher.  I look <Col N="650" /> forward to substantial improvements in that area and in technology.</P>
    <P>Children at school need a child-centred curriculum. The role of music and arts within the schools will have to be developed.  Children who lag behind, become disinterested, lack discipline, give trouble to the teacher, do not attend school, end up on the streets where they encounter problems with drink and drugs and eventually have a meeting with the gardaí.</P>
    <P>I congratulate all involved in the juvenile liaison programme and with sport.  A great deal of help is available to children who are identified at an early age.  I compliment all those who are doing such good work.  If time permitted there is much more I could say on this topic.  I wish the Minister success in implementing the various ideas.  This is a useful debate.  Perhaps the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child can be looked at again in five years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the report of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child.  It is clear from the presentation to the UN committee at Geneva in January that the Government has no co-ordinated policy on children and child care services. On assuming office the Taoiseach fragmented responsibility for a variety of children's services among a number of Ministers and Ministers of State and re-erected the political and bureaucratic obstacles to reform which had been removed by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>When appointed Minister of State in 1994, Deputy Austin Curry was given full responsibility for child care services and children's legislation across the board.  The proposal to establish a children's ombudsman has been abandoned under the guise of long fingering, although it has been strongly recommended by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and Children's Rights Alliance.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that under pressure at the hearing in Geneva, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, announced the Government would have a single Minister with sole responsibility for children's affairs.  She also stated, under pressure, that the issue of an ombudsman for children is to be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>During the past seven years there has been a plethora of reports recommending the implementation of proposals including the appointment of an ombudsman, yet the Government procrastinates. Our children are the most precious part of our society.  They are the future of society.  They are the future leaders, educators, carers, providers and princes of industry and commerce, yet the State stands indicted in its attitude to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, under the international spotlight, was forced to accept there is a lack of co-ordination between Government Departments and a piecemeal approach to childcare in Ireland. She admitted also that a unique emphasis in the past on the rights of parents, as well as the secrecy which surrounds child abuse, dogged the effective <Col N="651" /> vindication of children's rights.  We must accept that signing the Convention on the Rights of the Child involved obligations.  The Government is reacting to specific situations rather than seeing children as having their own rights, including the right to a safe childhood.  Children are not being consulted in any way whatsoever in Irish society.</P>
    <P>In the committee's report in relation to Article 44 of the convention, it is significant and highly enlightening that of the 41 comments made in the final report only three outlined positive aspects. There were 18 subjects of concern and 18 suggestions and recommendations for improvements. The committee highlighted and regretted that the rights of the child in Ireland appear to be fragmented. It highlighted the fact that there is no comprehensive national policy which fully incorporates the principles and provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, encompassing all areas covered by the convention.</P>
    <P>A member of the committee, Mrs. Palme, a distinguished psychologist and widow of Mr. Olaf Palme, late Prime Minister of Sweden, outlined a difficulty that had not yet been resolved was that of co-ordinating policy and action relating to child abuse and family affairs.  Even if steps were being taken towards improving departmental co-ordination she stated there was a need for a more independent body such as an ombudsman to promote and protect children's rights.  She highlighted the fact that one-third of all children were dependent on support systems in Ireland.  The unequal circumstances which persist must generate a sense of discrimination among children and she asked how the authorities would deal with the problem.  Perhaps the Minister will outline his proposals to deal with this severe criticism.</P>
    <P>Another member of the committee, Mrs. Ouedraogo, endorsed the view that an independent institution such as an ombudsman would be better able to co-ordinate action for the protection of children at all levels and commended the establishment of a national mediation service as part of the Government's policy on the family.  It was also pointed out that the child tended to be viewed within a family context rather than as an individual.</P>
    <P>The committee was also concerned that the welfare policies and practices prevalent here do not adequately reflect the child's rights based on the approach enshrined in the convention.  In addition, there is concern that not enough emphasis was placed on measures of a preventive nature.  The Minister of State outlined that data on homeless children was being collated and a consultancy study initiated to harmonise the various health boards' interpretations of what constituted abuse.  Has this work been completed and what was the outcome of the deliberations?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also announced that the Government would establish an independent social services inspectorate in early 1998 with a view to monitoring and evaluating the quality of <Col N="652" /> service delivery as experienced by users and carers, which would consist of a multi-disciplinary team of social services professionals.  The inspectorate is supposed to promote the development of national quality standards to be used as benchmarks. It would also initiate research work, contribute to training programmes, implement recommendations of review reports and provide policy development information.  I would appreciate if the Minister would inform the House about the progress made in this area.</P>
    <P>The committee's report is extremely critical of the lack of adequate co-ordination among bodies in promoting and protecting the rights of the child.  It has noted the establishment of various Government bodies responsible at national level for the welfare of children but regrets the lack of co-ordination among them.  Mr. Fulci, a member of the committee, said he had the impression that despite a wealth of legislation and regulations, Ireland lacked a national strategy for children in the framework of the convention, and national, regional and local mechanisms for ensuring its implementation.  Co-ordination is urgently needed, which was the message the Irish delegation said it would bring back to the authorities.</P>
    <P>While the committee welcomed the decision to establish a social services inspectorate as a supervisory mechanism, it remained concerned about the lack of an independent monitoring mechanism such as an ombudsman or child's rights commissioner who was accessible to children, would deal with complaints or violations of their rights and provide remedies for such violations.  I asked the Minister to outline when legislation would be introduced to establish a children's ombudsman. Fianna Fáil was committed to this in its Programme for Government and the issue must be handled as a matter of urgency to ensure and provide legal safeguards for children.</P>
    <P>The principal themes of such an ombudsman should be: first, to introduce fully to Ireland the spirit and detail of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which we have signed; second, to cater for children and young persons in difficulty; and third, to give young people rights of participation in society.  The UN Convention should be an important ideological instrument for asserting children's perspective.  The ombudsman should systematically review legislation affecting children and propose amendments to make Irish law reflect the State's commitments under the convention.  Children's perspective must be made a natural ingredient of all relevant new legislation. Consultation procedures on new legislation must be created and the Ombudsman should make recommendations to Government bodies and be involved in drafting legislation.  The children's ombudsman should also have the task of disseminating information and knowledge on the convention to the public, professionals working with children and decision makers.</P>
    <P>The convention is something which has to be lived, this means adults behaving towards children <Col N="653" /> in such a way as to respect and sustain their full human dignity.  It also means shaping society so that children and young persons receive the protection and support they need in order for childhood and adolescents to have an intrinsic value.  The children's ombudsman should be involved in trying to implement the convention in local government.  He or she should devote special attention to the question of children at risk of victimisation and sexual abuse &mdash; these should be matters of prime concern to the ombudsman.</P>
    <P>He or she should also act as a spokesman for children and young persons.  One of the tasks should be to represent children and young persons and to assert their interests in the community. He or she should represent young people by trying to secure for them the opportunity of speaking for themselves and gaining respect for their opinions.  This should apply both in personal matters and in the community as a whole.  The ombudsman should also deal with suggesting ways in which co-determination for children and young persons can be developed &mdash; for example, in custody disputes.</P>
    <P>Children and young persons should be allowed say their piece and be heard on issues of concern to them.  Allowing children and young persons to have their say should be the core of the ombudsman's perspective, otherwise he or she is likely to lose sight of what they want.  In the eager pursuit of change, one deceives oneself into thinking one knows what is best for children.  At best, this is an adult perspective of children.  In many cases it is also good for children and young persons but this is not to be taken for granted.  In Ireland children and young people have no channel for conveying their opinions to the people who make the decision.  Politicians often speak about children and young persons; at best we may speak of them but it is seldom we speak to them.</P>
    <P>The children's perspective needs to be promoted in a more systematic and efficient way.  In order for children's and young people's rights, needs and interests to attract sufficient attention, someone must speak up for them and defend their cause.  A special advocate, who would give children and young persons a voice and would be capable of viewing social developments from their perspective, is needed.  That is what the role of a children's ombudsman should be.</P>
    <P>The UN committee's report draws attention to certain lacunae in the statistical and other information collected by the Government, including with respect to the selection and development of indicators to monitor implementation of the principles and provisions of the Convention.  The committee notes that in certain instances statistics on the situation of children are, amazingly, only collected for children up to the age of 15.  This is a severe indictment of the Government's approach to children.  Facts are vital to ensure proper decisions are made and correct conclusions reached.  Professor Kolosov, a member of the Committee and a professor of international <Col N="654" /> law in Moscow, pointed out that the statistical data provided did not correspond to the Convention's definition of the child as a person under the age of 18 and thus did not enable the committee to carry out a meaningful evaluation of the real position of children in Ireland.  In contravention of Article 4 of the Convention, the State thus has not undertaken to take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures to implement the Convention.  Although no doubt the Government has comprehensive census figures at its disposal, it provided figures relating to children under 15 and persons aged 15-24.  I do not understand why it could not have submitted information on those under 18 or, if it wished to give figures for those under 15, also to provide figures for those aged between 15 and 18.</P>
    <P>The committee was critical of the Government's decisions in its approach to creating an awareness of the convention in Ireland.  It was its view that insufficient steps were being taken to create a high level of awareness of the principles and provisions of the convention.  It was concerned at the lack of adequate and systematic training provided for professionals and others involved with children.  How does the Minister of State propose to create a high level of awareness of the details and objectives of the convention across the broad mass of society?</P>
    <P>The committee was concerned that non-governmental organisations would not be fully utilised in the development of policies on children. I pay tribute to the Children's Rights Alliance, ISPCC, UNICEF and Focus on Children on the significant role that they play.</P>
    <P>On the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo;, the committee was concerned about the low age limits set in domestic legislation.  The case was made that it was impossible to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12 because of cost factors.  This is unacceptable.  My colleague, Deputy Currie, will deal with this matter at length.  He did extensive work in this and other areas when Minister of State with responsibility for children.  It is unacceptable that children as young as seven or eight are dealt with in a criminal rather than social context.  They are victims of circumstance rather than deviants.  The State has not provided the necessary funding to provide proper care for children at risk and the children of dysfunctional families.  A national child care agency should be established so that the Government will never again find itself embarrassed at the committee in Geneva.</P>
    <P>On the principle of non-discrimination, concern was expressed at the disparities in terms of access to education, housing and health services. While recognising the steps which had been taken, the committee noted with concern the difficulties faced by children from vulnerable and disadvantaged backgrounds, including children of travelling families, poorer families and refugees, with regard to the enjoyment of their fundamental rights.  This was a severe indictment of the Government's approach to those from vulnerable <Col N="655" /> and disadvantaged backgrounds.  Are there plans to ensure this issue is dealt with comprehensively?</P>
    <P>On the implementation of article 12 of the convention, the committee was concerned that within the family, schools and society generally the views of children were not being taken into account.  It described pre-school education as a vital phase in a child's development.  Although the recommended age for enrolment at primary level is six, the report indicates that 54 per cent of four year olds and 99 per cent of five year olds attend primary school.  The committee maintained that early school enrolment had been shown to cause intellectual fatigue.  There was speculation on whether there was a link between this practice and the high drop out and absenteeism rates.  The committee recommended that the Government should consider providing pre-school services for all children between the ages of two and five and abide by the recommended age for enrolment at primary level.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on adopting such an honest and open approach to this report.  In the short time I have been a Member of this House and in the time I was a Member of the other House I do not recall any Minister showing the same degree of honesty and openness.  It establishes a precedent which I would like to see followed.  The Minister of State said: &ldquo;Before summarising these recommendations, I would like firstly to identify the strengths and weaknesses of our performance&rdquo;.  For far too long there has been a tendency to ignore criticisms levelled against this State on any issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville, with whom I soldiered in the other House, said the Government should feel embarrassed.  If Members approached the report in an honest way, then everyone should feel embarrassed as all parties, bar one, have been in Government since 1996.  The problems did not start in the past six months.  It is unfortunate that Members opposite have engaged in point scoring. They should have approached the debate in a constructive way and acknowledged both our shortcomings and the good work which has been done.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Children's Rights Alliance and its constituent bodies on the work they did with the Minister of State and NGOs in preparing our response to the United Nations committee. While there were differences, everyone was in agreement on the final report presented.  That demonstrates the commitment of the Minister of State to this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many have suggested that the Minister of State has been inactive and have commented on the fact that the matter is being dealt with at Minister of State level.  I crossed swords on numerous occasions in the other House with Deputy Currie when he was Minister of State with responsibility for children.  What specifically was done during his period of office?  In dealing with issues about <Col N="656" /> which I felt passionately and which are addressed in the report, I recall saying to him that no action was being taken apart from the establishment of task forces, discussion and consultation groups. The matter of truancy and school attendance was referred to a committee three years before the election and nothing was done.</P>

      <P>On mandatory reporting, the Deputy rightly engaged in consultation and discussion. On adoptions, an area in which we clashed bitterly, no decisions were taken.</P>
      <P>It is unfair and wrong to suggest brave new initiatives taken by the previous Minister have since fallen by the wayside.  That is not my understanding of what happened in the past eight to nine months.  My understanding is that even in Adjournment matters which were referred to the Minister of State with responsibility for children, the lack of co-operation and accountability by other Departments was quite obvious.  That is highlighted in this report.  The Minister referred to the work of the ISPCC.  The ISPCC is not totally beloved but I congratulate it on the role it has played with great gusto in promoting and provoking debate in this area.</P>
      <P>The area of corporal punishment is identified in the committee's report.  The debate provoked by the ISPCC on the right of parents to use corporal punishment or to correct their children in a manner which the ISPCC would find unacceptable is very worthwhile.  The ISPCC is saying things which have not been said by politicians or others in the public arena.  Regardless of whether people agree with its proposals, it has managed to open up the area of children's rights.</P>
      <P>I spoke in the Seanad on a number of occasions on areas of family law and on the divorce Bill.  I stated repeatedly that if Governments &mdash; and I hope this Government will take this on board &mdash; when drafting legislation started from the premise of what is best for the child, we would have a much better and healthier society which valued children.  I welcome the fact that this is also the view of the committee and that the Minister has referred to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated we did not expect to get a school report giving &ldquo;As&rdquo; in all subjects.  The duty and task of the committee was to identify our shortcomings rather than what we had done right.  While the committee commented on the improvements which had occurred, its task was to identify and convey to the State where it had still not reached the level of responsibility demanded under the convention.  The Minister made that point very clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that prior to and during this <Col N="657" /> debate people singled out the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and spoke of her being grilled for hours and castigated by the committee.  That would have been the situation regardless of who had to bring the report to the committee.  As the Minister said, the job of the committee is to identify what we are doing wrong and ensure we correct it.  Both sides of the House must acknowledge this area is a priority and the Government will have to provide the necessary funding &mdash; the Minister openly acknowledges his Department needs additional staff.</P>
    <P>The Constitution Review Group, of which I am a member, is considering specific rights of children and I will support any recommendations it makes for changes to the Constitution to recognise children's rights.  The problems posed by the Constitution for health workers came to the fore in the reports on the Kelly Fitzgerald case and the Kilkenny incest case.  It was stated several times in the report on the Kelly Fitzgerald case that the refusal of the father to allow health board officials and social workers access to the child contributed to the problems in that family. None of us can stand over a situation where the parental rights enshrined in the Constitution could put young children at risk.  If it is necessary to alter the Constitution to rectify such matters we should undertake to do so as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the positive aspects of the committee's findings.  I welcome its appreciation at our high level of education and our advanced health system.  It also welcomed the enactment of the Child Care Act, 1991, the Family Law Act, 1995, the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, to which I referred and the proposed education and adoption Bills.  I will refer to the adoption Bill later.  The Minister knows my feelings on this matter, which is due for discussion by our parliamentary party soon.</P>
    <P>Everyone is very interested in the proposed education Bill.  When I spoke on Second Stage of the Education (No. 2) Bill I referred to the fact that children as young as ten years of age are dropping out of the school system.  There is an urgent need to put mechanisms in place to address this.  It is unacceptable that gardaí are expected to act as school attendance officers.  I have this mentioned to the Minister for Education and Science.  Very young children who drop out of school will obviously get into difficulties and this area must be addressed.  I urge the Minister not to embark upon consultation, discussion or debate but to put in place the necessary procedures, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The home-school liaison scheme works to a certain degree but it must be strengthened or expanded.  Barnardo's is engaging in this work in projects in Mulhuddart and Tallaght and the Minister has sanctioned funding for a Barnardo's child care project in Cherry Orchard in my constituency, which I welcome.  I know what such <Col N="658" /> agencies can do on what might be considered a shoestring budget.  They are liaising with school authorities and law enforcement agencies to identify children whose brothers and sisters have got into trouble.  They invite parents, usually mothers, to avail of parenting skills training and second chance education.  I appreciate Barnardo's work in that area and the Minister's sanctioning of a child care project in the Cherry Orchard area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the £50 million which has been made available since 1993 &mdash; I recognise that part of that funding was provided during the term of the previous Government &mdash; to enable health boards to fulfil their responsibilities under the Child Care Act.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Family, established by the previous Government, invited Fr. McVerry and various other providers of hostel accommodation and places of refuge for young homeless children to make a presentation.  Health board officials were also in attendance.  Some NGO providers were critical because they found it very difficult to identify where this money had gone.  The large sums which had been allocated at the bottom end of the scale to enable the health boards fulfil their responsibilities did not appear to have filtered through in terms of beds, accommodation and places of safety for children. I recall a suggestion that much of the money had been taken up with the bureaucratic implementation of the scheme.  Will the Minister respond to this and to the suggestion that it is necessary to identify, monitor and evaluate what the health boards are doing with the large amount of funding that was made available, a substantial amount of which was provided by the previous Government?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minster's commitment to the establishment of a social services inspectorate for children this year.  It should be established as a matter of urgency.  The need for an Ombudsman for children was mentioned by the committee, but I welcome the Minister's honesty in acknowledging that while he intends to proceed with the recommendation it is not a priority.  If a timetable of work is produced detailing the changes to be made during the life of the Government to acknowledge the deficiencies recognised in the committee's report, it will have more than benefited our children.</P>
    <P>The need for additional resources in disadvantaged areas was raised by the Minister and by Deputy Neville.  Nobody in this House could argue that sufficient finance is being made available in all areas.  The health boards have committed themselves to providing a family centre in Cherry Orchard, presumably with support from the Minister.  There are probably many other areas in Dublin and other urban constituencies where they are undertaking this kind of work.  It is a tangible recognition by the health boards of the need not only to work in areas of crisis but to intervene before a crisis arises.  The provision of a family centre in a disadvantaged area like Cherry <Col N="659" /> Orchard is an attempt to prevent crises arising. The committee recognised that we have put insufficient resources into problem prevention.</P>
    <P>I will speak at length on the adoption legislation when it is introduced.  Given the Supreme Court decision, I do not expect further prevarication; I know outside groups will not accept it. There was much concern that nothing was happening. The decision castigated all politicians for doing nothing in this area from 1952.</P>
    <P>The committee also rightly recognised our shortcomings in relation to minority groups and travellers.  While previous Governments and the State have been criticised for lack of action, society should be reminded that it has a huge responsibility.  There is no point in Governments introducing legislation, such as the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill, if society does not become more concerned with areas relating to children, disadvantage and minority groups. When politicians seek support from all communities for places of safety for battered wives, children at risk and travellers communities must respond positively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I looked forward to a constructive debate, but it is regrettable that some of the comments have been negative.  Surprisingly, most of the negative comments have come from the Government benches.  For example, Deputy Dennehy said the job of Opposition is to be as negative as possible.  While that is the attitude often adopted by Fianna Fáil in Opposition, I do not accept it.  I am surprised that some speakers on the Government benches appear to have adopted it.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy McGennis is as negative as she was.  She was critical of me in the past, which is her right, but she should be consistent.  She referred to the adoption legislation.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of Justice with responsibility for children she criticised me for saying there were constitutional implications with the legislation and that nothing could be done before a decision of the Supreme Court was made.  A year later the decision has been made.</P>

      <P>Political leadership is not being provided and child care issues are not being politically driven.  From my experience as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, with responsibly for children, I know of the hard work of the officials in the three Departments over which I had responsibility.  I also know of the commitment, beyond the call of duty, of many of them. I do not point the finger at them and I support the Minister's comments on extra staff and more money.  I tried to get this and would have eventually succeeded.  However, the finger points at the political masters who are not driving this issue in the way it should be driven.</P>
      <P>I paid special attention to reporting of the Geneva meetings.  One of the headlines declared: &ldquo;O'Donnell grilled for six hours&rdquo;.  The Minister of State had an uncomfortable time, which, to an extent, was predictable.  Anybody else would also have had an uncomfortable time.  However, it was made more uncomfortable because her co-ordinating role had been dropped and the Government was welching on its commitment to establish an ombudsman for children.  Those are two of the factors that made the criticism in Geneva greater than it ought to have been.  The Minister of State referred to the exceptional nature of what happened in Geneva, but it should not have been any surprise to the Government.  We had the example of what happened to the British when they went to Geneva sometime previously.  The Minister should have been aware of that because his officials and the NGOs were aware of it.  He should have been properly prepared for what happened at Geneva, but for the reasons I outlined in relation to the lack of co-ordination and in terms of an ombudsman our representatives got a harder time than they deserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed that when the Minister of State was appointed he was not given a co-ordinating role between the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which I had previously. That was one of the first weaknesses I recognised.  When I was appointed Minister of State I was given specific instructions to make progress on the full implementation of the Child Care Act, the children's juvenile justice Bill and the school attendance Bill.  I and the Government that appointed me Minister of State with those <Col N="661" /> co-ordinating functions recognised weaknesses arising from such a lack of co-ordination.</P>
    <P>One of the first things I did was to set up a co-ordinating committee between those three Departments which met every Wednesday morning. The Minister indicated in reply to a question I tabled recently that the co-ordinating committee for children's affairs met 103 times between 20 December 1994, the year our party entered Government, to 26 June 1997.  Why was that co-ordinating role dropped?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>It was dropped and had to be reinstated later as a result of a direction from Geneva.  The children's co-ordinating committee was also dropped.  Why was that done, particularly when the Taoiseach praised me in this House for what I had done as Minister of State for children with responsibility for co-ordination? I direct Deputy McGennis's attention to the Official Report which states the Taoiseach praised me for my co-ordinating role.  What is the co-ordinating structure now?  Is there any such structure between the Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same as it was.  It has not changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not comparable to one I had which was very successful.</P>
      <P>There was also a Cabinet committee on children's affairs which I chaired.  It carried considerable clout at the Cabinet table because the Ministers from the three Departments, for which I have responsibility, and the then Ministers for Social Welfare and Equality and Law Reform were represented on it.  That added to my co-ordinating role to provide the necessary clout at the Cabinet table to implement decisions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shortall raised the question as to whether the solution in this area ought to be the appointment of a separate Cabinet Minister and the establishment of a Department for children's affairs.  In the absence of proper co-ordination that must be the way forward.  If there is not proper co-ordination, there is not a case for not having a separate Department to look after the interests of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding an ombudsman for children, I gave money to the Children's Rights Alliance to part-fund its proposal for an ombudsman for children and I received its good report recommending an ombudsman in some context.  We have seen the vacillation of this Government on the appointment of an ombudsman for children.  I had a consultation process on mandatory reporting and arising out of that I made certain proposals.  I did not and still would not recommend mandatory reporting, but I took the view, like many voluntary organisations working with children, that an independent mechanism for the protection and promotion of children's rights is required, in other words, an ombudsman or a commission for <Col N="662" /> children such as has operated successfully in countries like New Zealand, Norway and Sweden for many years.  That was the reason I part-funded Children's Rights Alliance to undertake a joint research project into the feasibility of such an initiative and its report, seen and heard &mdash; promoting and protecting children's rights in Ireland, was published in September 1996.  With minimum delay I announced the Government's response to the consultation process on mandatory reporting in December l996, the central feature of which was agreement, in principle, to the establishment of an ombudsman for children, but much preparatory work remained to be done.  In April 1997 I established an interdepartmental working party to work out the necessary practical details. The first warning signal after the general election came with the failure of the Fianna Fáil-PDs programme for Government to obtain a commitment to an ombudsman for children, even though such a commitment appeared in those two parties' election manifestos.  On formation of the Government there was a dismantling of the co-ordinating arrangement I established.  It was clear to me then and it is clear to me now that children's issues had slipped down the agenda of the new Government. This is shown by the confusion and double speak on the official position on an ombudsman for children.</P>
    <P>In October 1977, shortly after Deputy Fahey was appointed to office, he told me in response to a Dáil Question that he was not convinced that this is the most effective mechanism for vindicating the rights of children.  On 17 December last, in response to a question I raised on the Order of Business, the Taoiseach said the commitment in the programme for Government will be met and the proposal for an ombudsman, which is well thought out, will be implemented in due course.  When I asked the Taoiseach to confirm it is a commitment of Government, he replied, &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  There was no such commitment in the programme for Government and the Taoiseach was factually incorrect in that regard, but he gave a commitment on record to appoint an ombudsman. I again raised the matter on yesterday's Order of Business and asked about the current position on an ombudsman for children to which the Government is committed and the Taoiseach replied it is hoped to have proposals on that later in the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said today that the social services inspectorate will be put in place this year and in regard to the establishment of an ombudsman for children he said, as he has said previously, that is not his priority for 1998.  However, he noted the committee's criticism and recognised the issue will have to be addressed.  The Minister of State said this was not his priority in 1998 yet the Taoiseach said yesterday it is hoped to have proposals on this later this year.  There is a conflict between what the Taoiseach and the Minister of State with responsibility for children said.  I tend to believe the Taoiseach is correct and I honestly hope he is.  The Government should get <Col N="663" /> its act together on this extremely important matter. Who are we to believe?  There is one way to find out.  The interdepartmental committee I set up involved representatives of all the Departments, the former Ombudsman and a representative of the Children's Rights Alliance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in 1997.  What is the reason for the delay in setting up the inspectorate? Another reason I initiated the establishment of the inspectorate was that I was appalled to discover in relation to the Madonna House inquiry that I was unable to publish the full version of the report.  For legal reasons, it was only possible to <Col N="664" /> publish an abridged version.  One of the reasons I wanted to establish the inspectorate was to ensure that if any cases arose in the future, and inevitably such cases will arise, it would be possible to publish a full report.</P>
      <P>It took 20 years, mainly due to differences between the Departments, to put together a Children's Bill.  It was possible to formulate this Bill as a result of the success of my co-ordinating role and it received a Second Reading in February 1997.  I attempted to have it taken by the select committee on a number of occasions before my Government left office, but the Opposition spokesperson at the time would not co-operate. Over a year has elapsed since the Second Reading of that important Bill.  What is holding it up? What possible excuse can the Government have for the delay in taking Committee Stage of a Bill which passed Second Stage in February 1997?</P>
      <P>Some of the issues raised in Geneva which caused the greatest problems are covered by the Bill, for example, raising the age of criminal responsibility to ten years of age and then to 11 and 12 years of age.  The Bill also covers provision for out of control children.  Nothing was done for 20 years.  This was followed by two years of achievement, but now another year has been lost. How many more years will it take?  This is a serious indictment not only of the Minister of the State but also of the Minister for Health and Children and the Government.  There is no excuse for the delay.</P>
      <P>There was a reference to the school attendance Bill.  When I left office this Bill, which updates 1926 school attendance legislation, was ready.  It is disgraceful that nothing had been done by any previous Administrations about this matter.  The Bill was ready when I left office.  What happened to it?  I understand there was a problem in relation to the regional education boards because the new inspectorate system I proposed was linked to them.  However, that was a year ago. There is also a lack of co-ordination and progress in this area.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to involve the NGOs and the Children's Rights Alliance.  On the basis of experience, they are sincerely committed to the welfare and protection of children and we will need their help in future.  I make the point, more in sorrow than in anger, that in relation to the welfare and promotion of children's interests, the past year has been a colossal disappointment in many respects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>A grilling by a United Nations committee for six hours, which was the experience of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, appears to indicate that at best Ireland has been seriously deficient in meeting its declared international intentions in advancing and protecting the rights of children.  At worst, a strong case can be made for the existence of a degree of governmental negligence that has been totally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations committee was extremely <Col N="665" /> well informed in knowing about and inquiring further on the plethora of incidents, events, crises and scandals which have involved and enveloped children in Ireland in recent years.  The questioning of the UN committee was a mirror image of Irish attitudes to children which was not apparent in political debate previously despite the efforts of non-governmental organisations such as the ISPCC and the Children's Rights Alliance.  For too long, and much too often, children in Ireland have been hidden and when seen, they have not been heard.  Irish children have been subjected to collective indifference and unspeakable cruelty and horror.</P>
    <P>To conform with accepted international standards, it requires not only a change of policy and legislation but ultimately a change of mindset. The words of the UN committee give us cause for concern.  A Russian member of the committee complained that Ireland has a &ldquo;patronising approach to children&rdquo;.  He continued: &ldquo;The child does not feel himself a full member of society.&rdquo; The chairwoman of the committee, who is from Barbados, said that the submissions by the Irish &ldquo;lacked the sense of the children as people&rdquo;.  She said there was much talk about the protection of children, but not enough talk about their empowerment.  She felt in terms of Irish policy that children were invisible.</P>
    <P>The Swedish representative, Ms Palme, who is the widow of the former Prime Minister of Sweden, strongly criticised the current policy of the Government to establish a social services inspectorate ahead of the creation of an office of ombudsman for children.  The case to establish a position of children's ombudsman is unanswerable and the Government should have its policy informed by views expressed in the House rather than respond to the international embarrassment provoked by the UN committee.  The Government's defence to date of its deficiencies in these areas has been one of watery self-justification. For the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, to argue that welfare issues must be prioritised before the issue of children's rights is to ignore that a properly codified system of rights, if implemented, will avoid a repeat of the band aid approach to children's policies.</P>
    <P>In Geneva, Israel's representative on the UN committee asked the obvious question that the Government appears unwilling to confront.  How can Ireland have the second highest level of child poverty in Europe while boasting of its status as the Celtic tiger?  This inconvenient statistic shatters the myth that a successful economy equals a successful society.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, must have, and should have, felt severe embarrassment as the UN committee proceeded through a litany of inconsistencies in Irish law as it relates to children from the absurdly low age of criminal responsibility to the failure, despite legislation, to stop children being referred to as illegitimate.</P>
    <P>Our mindset in relation to children can only be changed when we have or can achieve a more <Col N="666" /> open and honest society.  When we examine the publicly highlighted incidents of child abuse in recent times, it is surprising to discover how little we know about these events.  Many reports, including those on Madonna House, the Kelly Fitzgerald case and the X case, have been conducted but few have been made fully public. Without open honest debate we cannot hope to bring about the changes in standards that are required.  Honesty is needed in regard to mandatory reporting.  It is uncertain whether the Government supports this concept.  Its position on Deputy Shatter's Bill indicates it is less than honest on the issue.</P>
    <P>Respective Governments have failed to recognise and respond to the cross-departmental nature of children's issues.  The previous Government attempted to address this issue, but that attempt was somewhat lessened by this Government. A dramatic change of approach is needed. An example of where cross-departmental co-operation is lacking is that where there are declared policy positions on children's rights, the practice varies widely from policy.  Distinctions are made in creating different classes of rights for different groupings of children.  An example is the failure of the Minister for Education and Science to implement the findings of the High Court O'Donoghue case regarding the educational rights of mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by quoting the words of the Lebanese poet, Kahlil Gibran: &ldquo;Our children are not our children but are part of life's longing for itself&rdquo;.  If we remember these words, as legislators we may begin to produce laws for children rather than laws for adults to apply to children in an adults only world.</P>

      <Quest>whether he will sanction additional funding for Tallaght hospital, Dublin 24, to ensure essential works are carried out to facilitate the opening of the hospital on 21 June 1998; if the operating theatres in the hospital will be fully and adequately equipped and the computer facilities properly functioning at the date of opening; and if he will give a guarantee that the hospital upon opening will fully meet the needs of the patients for whom it was constructed.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10388/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new hospital at Tallaght is the largest project in the history of our health services.  It has been built to a standard on a par with the finest acute teaching hospitals in western Europe.  A process of continuous consultation with the user groups who will be providing the services at the new <Col N="667" /> hospital has informed the planning and commissioning of the hospital.</P>
      <P>At the start of the commissioning phase of the hospital earlier this year a range of adjustments and some additional works were identified by users.  This is not unusual in a project of this size. These works were confirmed by senior management as necessary for a variety of reasons, including adjustments necessitated by improved health and safety standards.  The funding required for the completion of these essential additional works, which have been agreed as necessary to facilitate the opening of the hospital on 21 June, is being made available and the hospital is agreed on the arrangements to do this.</P>
      <P>It has been agreed with the hospital management for some time that the first task in commissioning the new hospital is to transfer existing services, including the psychiatric services from St. Loman's hospital, to Tallaght and to immediately bring on stream at the new hospital those enhanced facilities which are necessary for the functioning of a major acute hospital.  These new facilities include on-site laboratory services, more sophisticated theatres, state of the art sterile services, a &ldquo;best of breed&rdquo; information system-information technology system and an ultra modern filmless radiology system known as PACS &mdash; Picture Archiving Communication System.</P>
      <P>The hospital management is confident that on 21 June all these facilities will be available to the degree necessary to open the hospital and to provide the projected required services similar to those currently being provided at the base hospitals and at St. Loman's.  Enormous efforts have been and are being made by very committed people including the staff of the transferring hospitals, construction staff and suppliers to ensure this excellent health facility is made available as soon as possible to the people it is designed to serve.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the dedication and commitment to the project by all concerned but particularly the dedication of the chairman of the Tallaght hospital board, Professor Richard Conroy, and the members of that board who have given so generously of their time and expertise in a voluntary capacity to bring this complex project to fruition. The work of the Tallaght hospital board is now in its final stages and its functions will be continued by the board of the Adelaide and Meath hospitals, Dublin, incorporating the board of the National Children's Hospital, currently chaired by Mrs. Rosemary French.  I equally appreciate the tremendous achievements of this board since its inception less than two years ago. Not only has the task of integrating and preparing the base hospitals for the move been addressed but it has been done in a spirit of partnership and dedication in the interests of patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern that the hospital upon opening should fully meet the needs of the patients for whom it was constructed.  While I would be amenable to very temporary and short-term <Col N="668" /> alternative use of a small number of facilities, I and my Department will insist that the hospital will be utilised to meet the needs of the patients for whom it was constructed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister visit the hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Not yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying what he knows about the hospital is based on briefings he received, that despite the fact that this is the largest hospital project in the history of the State, which has cost the State £130 million to date, he has not yet taken the initiative, after ten months in office, to visit the hospital to assess the needs to enable it to operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I met the boards of the hospitals involved.  An official in the Department is involved on an ongoing basis and briefs me regularly. I agreed with the board to visit the hospital at an opportune time.  I do not wish to interfere with the very important and urgent work that is proceeding to ensure the date for opening is met. Regardless of when I visit the hospital, it will not change the challenges that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware the hospital has been available for some months to be visited by groups and individuals with interests in it?  Will he acknowledge the hospital, which is less than 30 minutes drive from his office, is easily accessible to him and it will be regarded as extraordinary by the public that the Minister for Health and Children did not visit the largest, most expensive hospital development in the history of the State prior to its opening?  Is the Minister aware there is substantial concern that the hospital is under-funded and will be understaffed, and that because of his failure to allocate the necessary expenditure required, on the day the hospital opens a substantial portion of it will not be used?  Will the Minister clarify the current budget allocation for the hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall cost of the hospital will be probably in the region of £140 million.  I visited many hospitals during my term in office and they would like to have access to the resources this hospital has obtained.  To suggest that problems pertaining to the opening of a hospital, such as those experienced in Beaumont and other hospitals, will not be experienced here would be to simplify the position to too great an extent. Increased allocations to the hospital will be made on the basis of ensuring that health and safety regulations are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding for the schedule of alterations and additional works essential for the opening of the hospital amounts to £1.746 million.  That funding is being provided as a result of additional capital funding of £664,000, revenue funding transfer of £135,000, transfer from the equipping budget to the main capital budget of £700,000 and a contribution <Col N="669" /> from the National Children's Hospital of £247,000, totalling £1.746 million required.  Funding is being made available to provide for issues raised by people involved in the opening of the hospital.</P>
    <P>We are involved in transferring to Tallaght existing services from the four hospitals, including St. Loman's, enhancing some of those services and in time providing additional facilities which will come on stream in 1999.  That always has been the plan for the hospital.  There is an indication that because construction has not yet started on the private block, the opening date will be put back, but that is not the case.  The extra beds required will be provided in either the Meath hospital or the Adelaide hospital on a short-term basis.  We hope the Eastern Health Board will acquire the Meath hospital for the purpose of providing day care facilities for that part of the south inner city.  The public-private mix can be accommodated.  I am not prepared to allow, for example, vulnerable patients like those in St. Loman's Acute Psychiatric Hospital, not to be transferred to the hospital, as required and which is ministerial policy.  That will happen.</P>

How many operating theatres have been constructed in the hospital and how many will come on stream, start operating and be available to function when this hospital opens on 21 June? Will the Minister clarify whether the nursing services planning study, which indicated that this hospital requires an allocation of 300 additional nursing staff, will be implemented by him and the steps he intends to take in that regard?</P>

      <P>We will leave the bluster to that side of the House.  Deputy Shatter asked whether I would sanction additional funding for Tallaght Hospital to ensure essential works are carried out to facilitate its opening on 21 June.  I answered that question in the body of my main reply and £1.746 million will be provided to facilitate that. The Deputy asked if the operation theatres in the hospital will be fully and adequately equipped. The answer to that question is yes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked questions which are being answered.  He asked if the computer facilities will be properly functioning at the date of opening.  The answer is yes.  Deputy Shatter also asked if I will guarantee that the hospital, on opening, will fully meet the needs of the patients for whom it was constructed.  As in line with the original plans, the existing services in the four hospitals will be transferred.  It will include enhanced services in those existing services in the four hospitals being merged and transferred to Tallaght and there will be further increased services which will come on stream in 1999, as <Col N="671" /> planned.  That is a full and comprehensive answer to the question the Deputy asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>What services will not come on stream on 21 June?  Will the Minister indicate when he will make arrangements for the transfer of responsibility for the hospital from the planning board to the trustees, who will ultimately run the hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On meeting the needs of patients for whom the hospital was constructed, it is reasonable to assume the Deputy is referring to those additional facilities provided in the construction of the hospital which will not be brought on stream from day one but which will come on stream in 1999.  These will include one theatre and theatre reception area, observation wards, adult accident and emergency, a segregated resuscitation unit, seven dialysis stations, four high dependency beds, three beds in the recovery area, an age related day hospital, any extension of the autopsy service, radiology and two ultrasound rooms.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the hospital was allocated additional funds of £4 million to commission and open the hospital with the additional £1.746 million I mentioned, which was on last year's base to facilitate the commissioning process.  These additional funds do not allow the hospital to open the above facilities, but it is hoped to bring them on stream next year.  Another possible interpretation is that the hospital may be too small for some of the planned services to be provided, for example, the age related health care unit or the children's unit. My response is that the hospital, as constructed, has significant provision for expansion factors should the need arise.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may refer to short-term inappropriate use of some sections of the hospital, for example, that the psychiatric or children's unit would be deferred to provide acute adult in patient facilities until the 76 bed private wing is completed late next year.  I replied to the Deputy by saying that anything other than attaining 55 to 76 beds at either the Meath or the Adelaide Hospitals would be unacceptable to my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the latest provisional information available, the total in-patient bed stock in 1997 was 11,861 beds.  This is based on the average number of in-patient beds available for use over the full year, taking into account beds temporarily opened or closed.  I am satisfied that this is adequate to meet national acute hospital needs.</P>
      <P>In this context, I emphasise that in looking at acute hospital service delivery it is appropriate to consider overall levels of service rather than focus solely on bed numbers.  This is reflective of major changes in medical practice which have resulted in shorter average in-patient lengths of stay, a marked shift from in-patient to day case surgery and increased treatment at outpatient level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In developing service plans, the implementation of an appropriate mix between in-patient, day case and out patient care would be a major consideration for local management in seeking to maximise overall activity.  The conclusions of a recent OECD comparative study which reviewed health expenditure here provide an instructive assessment of the impact of this approach on the delivery of acute hospital care in Ireland.  This 1997 report found that there have been significant improvements in hospital productivity over the past 15 years, pointing to the fact that the average in-patient length of stay has been reduced by 29 per cent and that better management of resources has allowed the average bed occupancy rate to <Col N="673" /> rise to nearly 85 per cent, one of the highest in the OECD area.  The report also points out that the level of day care treatment has almost quadrupled here since 1986.</P>
    <P>The report found that as a result of this combination of factors, the total number of cases treated annually in the acute hospital sector in Ireland has been rising by 3 per cent each year since 1987.  In view of the fact that this increase is set against a background of a reduction in bed numbers in the late 1980s, the relevance of focusing on overall activity rather than availability of bed numbers as a measure of the hospital system's output becomes evident.</P>
    <P>While the OECD report makes it clear that the acute hospital sector is managing well, my policy is to ensure that the productivity of the hospital system is optimised, that the hospital system continues to respond efficiently, effectively and equitably to the needs of the population and that it is resourced appropriately to provide high quality hospital services, in meeting those objectives. Towards this end, in the current year, I have made a total additional investment of £44 million in acute hospital services to provide for ongoing developments, including improvements in accident and emergency services, to commission new units completed under the capital programme and to tackle waiting lists and waiting times for access to in-patient services.</P>
    <P>I am committed to addressing unacceptably lengthy waiting times for certain procedures in acute hospitals.  As part of a continuing strategy to reduce waiting lists and waiting times, I recently announced a review of the waiting list initiative.  The review will be completed by the end of June so that its recommendations can be taken into account in the Estimates process for 1999 and subsequent years.  It is my intention to sustain and enhance this process of investment in the acute hospital sector and, through my Department, to work with management in hospitals and health boards in continuing to seek improvements in the delivery of services.</P>

      <P>The question related to the immediate steps the Minister might be taking to deal with the current crisis.  Reading between the lines in his reply, it seems that currently he is not taking any action.  Is the Minister aware there is considerable concern, particularly in the Dublin area, that significant numbers of quite ill people are being sent home from accident and emergency departments simply because there are insufficient hospital beds available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area of concern to most people working in the health services and also to the general public is the fact that up to 25 per cent of operations are being cancelled in some of our major hospitals because there are insufficient hospital beds available.  What information is the Minister getting from his officials because most people working in the hospitals and the health boards are aware of the underlying cause of this problem, namely, the significant numbers of bed blockages? <Col N="674" /> It is estimated that in the Eastern Health Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy ask a supplementary question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply asking the Minister if he is aware of this problem because most other people seem to be aware of it.  In the Eastern Health Board region alone approximately 300 people are inappropriately placed in acute hospitals, in other words, people who need nursing home care or other step-down facilities.  If nursing home places were provided for those people it would free up beds and there would not be any need to cancel operations.  It would then be possible to keep sick people in hospital when they present themselves at emergency departments.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the figure of 300?  I have requested the countrywide figure but, not surprisingly, the Department does not seem to have it.  Given that the figure for the Eastern Health Board region is estimated to be in excess of 300, we can assume it is probably close to 1,000 countrywide.  Is the Minister aware of that and what steps is he taking to provide appropriate services to those people currently blocking beds in acute hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  The whole purpose of the review of the waiting list initiative is to see if we can provide dedicated money and beds to deal with the problem of waiting lists and to determine the reason we are not making the desired impact on waiting lists.  My predecessor provided £8 million to the waiting list initiative which was not allocated to the health boards until almost the fourth quarter of that financial year.  I increased the allocation for the waiting list initiative by 50 per cent, raising it to £12 million, and I gave that money to the health boards from the start of the financial year in January. Obviously we will have to wait and see what the impact of that will be.  It should suggest a greater ability to plan and to deal with the bed blockage issue.  There seems to have been an ad hoc approach adopted in terms of allocating money for waiting list initiatives halfway through the year.  There may have been many opportunities to deal with the problem of waiting lists more effectively had the money been made available to the health boards and the hospitals in time.  I am currently seeking to address that issue by having a review of the waiting list initiative to determine the reason for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much anecdotal evidence in terms of the various problems but they need to be addressed.  That is the reason I have brought together a group of people, who have hands-on experience in this area, to come up with some answers.  In terms of providing resources to hospitals in the future, the review will be completed by the end of June and that will enable me <Col N="675" /> to make the arguments in respect of the Estimates for l999.</P>
    <P>The Deputy seems to suggest that increasing bed numbers alone will solve the waiting list problem.  That is not the case because if one examines how the health service has developed over the past ten years one can see that there has been an increase in productivity in our hospitals. When that was subjected to an OECD test it came out in a favourable light.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say the hospital system is under pressure at any given time.  We cannot plan for the peaks in every circumstance.  We must plan across the board and try to provide a basic level of service.  I agree waiting times for certain procedures are too long.  We must get the information system in place to find out how we can resolve that problem rather than approaching it in a haphazard way which will not result in waiting lists being reduced.</P>
    <P>The designated waiting list initiative was introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin. Since that time, 70,000 people have come through the system.  Rather than criticise this initiative we should realise it is being masked by the figures which show that more than 30,000 people are on the waiting list.  As a result of this initiative, 70,000 procedures have taken place which may not have been carried out if money had not been designated for those specific items.</P>
    <P>In every advanced health care system, activity levels have to be commensurate with budgets. While budgets in this year have increased by 12 per cent in gross terms compared to an overall Government policy to increase public expenditure by 4 per cent, clearly issues remain to be resolved.  We must determine, in a planned way, how we can improve the efficiency of the waiting list initiative.  Perhaps the review, rather than being anecdotal, will provide answers to that question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept there has been little or no forward planning to deal with the increasing age profile of our population?  The Minister referred to allocating money to the waiting list initiative.  The nature of the problem has been recognised by people working in the field, that is, the bed blockages.  For example, a new 50 bed unit has just been completed in the Glasnevin area of my constituency.  That unit was built with health board money, yet the Minister has not given a commitment to equip or staff it.  That unit could have a major impact on hospital services in the north side of Dublin city, particularly Beaumont Hospital.  Progress could be made on the waiting lists and in treating very ill people in casualty departments but the Minister does not seem to accept that is the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well setting up a review group but a serious crisis arose during the winter months and we are likely to face an even worse crisis next winter.  Obtaining the report of a review group during the summer, which will be examined but <Col N="676" /> probably put on the long finger, will not help matters next year.  The Minister has an opportunity to address this problem by putting in place measures which will prevent us facing another crisis next winter.  The health boards are ready to proceed with plans for nursing home units if the Minister will give the commitment to fund them.  That can happen quickly.  If 1,000 acute beds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As Chairman of the Eastern Health Board, the Deputy will be aware &mdash; I made this clear during my meetings with representatives of the health board in December &mdash; that I am committed to trying to increase capital expenditure, for the reasons outlined by the Deputy, on the basis that we must control the current position.  It is up to the health board to ensure it plans properly so that when the capital projects come on stream, the funding is made available.  That involves prioritising and decision making at health board level.</P>
      <P>People have claimed that we need to devolve functions and powers.  We are doing that.  As the Deputy is aware, under the new financial mechanisms, which admittedly are inflexible but clear, I gave the allocations to the health boards from 1 January and it is their job to prioritise.  All the health boards claim that care for the elderly is a major issue for them so I told them they should prioritise care for the elderly in their budgets.  That is the responsibility of the health boards.  As Minister, I have obtained a greater amount of money from the Minister for Finance than any other Minister.  One would expect so, as it is the largest Department of State and given the high priority the Government attaches to health expenditure. I have given the allocations to the health boards and they must make the decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not passing the buck.  The Deputy, having been supportive of the previous Administration, regards their commitment to the elderly as being what one could expect in terms of the finite resources available to any Minister for Health.  I assure the Deputy that my spending on care for the elderly will reflect an increase of over 50 per cent in the capital budget over what was provided by the last Administration.  Furthermore, I was successful in negotiating with the Minister for Finance a section of the Finance Bill which provides for tax relief for building more nursing homes to try to deal specifically with the issue being raised by the Deputy.  In terms of taxation policy and overall health expenditure policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Even taking into account the GMS sector, in terms of health board expenditure, I assure the Deputy that the capital budgets for care for the elderly, which rated only £6 million or £7 million per annum under the Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left Government will be increased substantially under the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who has made clear our priorities in regard to the elderly.  I agree that perhaps we do not take sufficient account in our planning of the demographic profile of our population. That argument will always go on between successive Ministers for Health and Ministers for Finance of whatever political colour, because there are conflicting objectives between a high spending Minister and a Minister who is trying to run an economic and social policy with sustainable levels of expenditure which are consistent with the overall economic policy.  On all objective criteria, while the Deputy highlights problems which she accepts are not of recent origin, the performance of this Government in terms of capital and current expenditure on those areas she regards as important in eliminating bed blockages will be improved upon by this Administration compared to any previous one.  I have given that commitment.</P>

      <P>That is part of the problem.  Rather than being anecdotal, we must consider the matter, and that is what the review of the waiting list issue is about.  Regardless of its outcome, the Deputy suggested it would be put on the long finger.  It will not.  The whole purpose of the review is to arm me with arguments to deal with the Department of Finance when it comes to the Estimates.  I have been far more successful in getting increased expenditure than any of my predecessors. That might sound self-serving, but is an objective criteria of fact.</P>
      <P>On the question of care for the elderly, I agree with the Deputy.  Every health board I met last December suggested that this was an area requiring attention.  I told the health boards &mdash; as a chairperson of a health board the Deputy can validate this &mdash; that if it was a priority of the health boards they should make it a priority in their spending, and if that involved trimming expenditure somewhere else, let them be transparent and say their priority is care of the elderly. We cannot have it every way.</P>

Life is not made any easier for them because there will always be gaps in service.  They have to <Col N="678" /> prioritise.  We have agreed on an all-party basis, in terms of passing legislation in the Dáil and Seanad, that the health boards will be the arbiters of that prioritisation.  That is a function of health boards.  It is not passing the buck.  It is simply setting out the legislative framework for health expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The post of chief executive of the VHI is currently being filled, on an acting basis, under a consultancy agreement between the VHI Board and Price Waterhouse.  This arrangement dates back to late January 1997 and was implemented in the absence of the board finding a replacement for the chief executive who resigned with effect from 18 October 1996.  My predecessor was informed by the previous board chairman of the arrangements made to fill the post on an acting basis.  Therefore, this was the situation when I took office.  That arrangement was extended to January 1997 by the current board chairman, in tandem with efforts made by the board to fill the post on a substantive basis.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that at the end of last year the board endeavoured to fill the post on a substantive basis.  However, the Government was unable to accede to the level of remuneration the board proposed to attach to the position in view of wider implications relating to the remuneration of chief executives of commercial State bodies.  It was the Government's view, in the interests of the orderly assessment and setting of remuneration rates for chief executives of State bodies, that the VHI post should be dealt with in the context of its response to the Report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, known as the Buckley report. In the circumstances the board continued with arrangement to fill the position on an acting basis for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Buckley report, the Government <Col N="679" /> has decided that the basic salary of chief executives of commercial State bodies, including the VHI, will be determined on a co-ordinated basis and taking account of rates applicable across the private sector for jobs of comparable size.  Hay Management Consultants have been appointed by the Minister for Finance as the pay consultants for this purpose.  Their analysis will result in proposals being submitted by the Minister for Finance to the Government as to the rate to be approved for each commercial body.</P>
    <P>The review body's recommendations in relation to commercial State bodies also addressed the issue of performance-related pay and the nature of contracts.  These issues will be dealt with by the Government when they are considering the proposals of the Minister for Finance in relation to rates of remuneration.</P>
    <P>The revised arrangements being put in place will provide considered parameters as regards remuneration of the chief executive within which the VHI Board can implement its wish to fill the post on a substantive basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is bizarre that the Government turned down the appointment of a chief executive at a salary of £150,000 a year and that it supports the continuation of a consultant acting as chief executive at a cost of £250,000 a year, which does not seem to remotely accord with the Government's pay approach to State bodies?  Will the Minister indicate when he expects the Government will be in a position to allow for the putting in place by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board of a permanent chief executive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is unfortunate that we have been unable, at a time when the board sought to get a person they believed would be capable of doing the job, to provide the level of remuneration that would have enabled him to accept it, given the Government guidelines which have been in existence under successive Administrations. As a former Minister in another Department I was in a position to appoint people to chief executive positions in different circumstances, for example, to Telecom Éireann and Aer Lingus.  The Government has made a decision in relation to this matter under which I abide by and operate.  It is important to try to sort the matter out as soon as possible.  The Minister for Finance will be producing a detailed review of the parameters set out in the initial reply in the next few months, given that the modified Buckley report was adopted by the Government about a month ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the consultancy arrangements have not in any way impeded the working of the VHI.  Its position has improved during the period of the consultancies.  I accept it is not satisfactory in the long-term and that it is important to try to get a chief executive <i>in situ</i> as soon as possible.  I assure the Deputy that the board continues to try <Col N="680" /> to obtain a post which will meet the current guidelines of the Department of Finance. Recently we were unfortunate in not obtaining such a person who, for various reasons, was not available despite the fact that the subcommittee of the board of the VHI dealing with this matter would like to have recruited such a person.  I accept it is necessary to resolve the situation as soon as possible as Government policy issues are involved.  I assure the Deputy we are not awaiting the outcome and that we are pursuing possibilities to see if it can be resolved as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister receive the Government guidelines by the end of June or will it be autumn or 1999?  Does he accept that what is happening is making a nonsense of the Government's rejection in December of the nomination of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board because of the pay issue?  Does he also accept that, if the consultant is retained for another 12 months at the current level of pay, it is driving a coach and four through any pay restraint approach?  Finally, does he accept that it is in the interests of the VHI to have a permanent, full-time executive available to it as opposed to a consultant working part-time on a salary of £100,000, which is in excess of the suggested salary for the original appointee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Government's considered view that the sanctioning of the appointment based on the remuneration rates suggested, which were in excess of existing Government guidelines, would have long-term ramifications, not only for the company but for the semi-State sector.  For that reason, it was not open to the Government to accept the proposed appointment. The current situation is not running a coach and four through the guidelines as it is a temporary position, although it is lasting longer than I or my predecessor would have liked to have contemplated in the beginning.  However, there are difficulties in this area; we need to employ the right person.  The hiring of the consultant has worked in management terms, but I agree that it is in the long-term interests of the VHI to employ a person in a permanent capacity.  I expect an appointment will be made this year and the Minister for Finance is aware of my views on this matter in terms of its urgency.</P>

      <Quest>the instances that have occurred involving patients undergoing blood transfusions during 1997 receiving transfusions of a different blood type from their own or being given the wrong blood product due to a failure of proper practices and procedures by either the Blood Transfusion Service Board or any hospital in the State; the reason the recommendation made by the Finlay report to ensure a proper reporting system of such incidents has not been implemented; and the steps, if any, taken to avoid the recurrence of similar incidents in future.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the recent newspaper article concerning ten reports of adverse transfusion events in Irish hospitals.  The data referred to is contained in an annual report which was published recently under the Serious Hazards of Transfusion scheme, also known as the SHOT scheme, which is a UK based system established in September 1996 to report on adverse events associated with the transfusion of blood and blood components.  Adverse events include both expected and unexpected reactions by recipients to blood components, as well as failures in best transfusion practice at hospital level.</P>
      <P>Ten such incidents in Irish hospitals were reported in the period September 1996 to October 1997.  Five patients who required transfusion received blood components which were not intended for them.  Four patients reacted to the use of filters which were necessary as the patients required filtered blood components.  One patient had a delayed reaction to a whole blood transfusion which was not unexpected.  None of the incidents involved patients having unexpected reactions to blood products, nor did they involve procedures and processes at the Blood Transfusion Service Board, nor did they involve suspected bacterial contamination or viral transmission.</P>
      <P>The Deputy refers to the implementation of the Finlay recommendation in relation to reporting abnormal reactions.  There is a well established reporting arrangement by hospitals to the BTSB of any suspected bacterial contamination or viral transmission associated with blood components made available by the BTSB.  Such reports would be available to the Irish Medicines Board as part of its routine inspections of the BTSB.  No reports were received by the BTSB during 1997.</P>
      <P>The reporting to the IMB of adverse reactions to medicinal blood products is already in place. Under section 4 of the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, one of the principal functions of the IMB is to establish and administer a service for obtaining and assessing reports on any adverse effects of medicinal products in use in the State. Medicinal products are defined under EU Council directives and include blood products, such as clotting factor concentrates, and immunoglobulins, such as anti-D and albumin.  Human blood components such as red cells, platelets or plasma are not currently defined as medicinal products. The statutory reporting system in place for medicinal products is provided for under the Medical Preparations (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1996, which require the holders of medicinal product authorisations, usually pharmaceutical companies, to:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>keep a record of reports of adverse effects associated with the use of the product to which <Col N="682" /> the authorisation relates.  The record shall be available for inspection by a person authorised by the Board who may take copies thereof.  The authorisation holder shall furnish to the Board a copy of any such report of which he has a record or of which he is aware.</P>
    <P>The first annual report of the IMB relating to its inspections of the BTSB, which was submitted to me on 8 April, notes that the IMB received three reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of blood-derived medicinal products. In each of the cases notified, the symptoms described &mdash; fever, headache and allergy-like symptoms &mdash; are known to occur and were resolved with symptomatic treatment.</P>
    <P>My Department, in consultation with the IMB and the BTSB, is developing a number of proposals which will improve the reporting of adverse reactions and transfusion practice generally. A statutory reporting procedure for the reporting of abnormal reactions to blood components will be established which will strengthen the existing reporting system.  The details of the scheme are being discussed with the IMB whose regulatory authority would require extension to include blood components.</P>
    <P>As well as extending the regulatory role of the IMB in relation to haemovigilance, I consider it important that a national haemovigilance office be established.  The main function of this office would be to receive, analyse and report on adverse reaction data provided by hospitals and generally support the improvement of haemovigilance and transfusion practice nationally. Resources for the establishment of this office, which will be located initially within the BTSB, have been made available by my Department. The delineation of the respective roles of the proposed haemovigilance office and the IMB is currently being discussed.</P>
    <P>The success of a haemovigilance programme will rely to a large extent on the active involvement of hospitals and the timely and accurate return of data on adverse reactions.  In a number of hospitals specific responsibility in this area has been assigned to transfusion surveillance officers. It will be necessary to increase the number of hospitals currently employing such officers and my Department is currently examining how best to achieve this objective.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is a serious matter for patients to receive the wrong blood type?  Does he acknowledge it is a matter of great urgency that each hospital is encouraged to have a transfusion surveillance officer, that it is made clear it is not an optional extra and that someone should be appointed to so act?  Can the Minister confirm that, in one instance, a patient who received the wrong blood type was a blood donor who requested his own blood be made available in the event of requiring a blood transfusion and that that did not occur?  What safeguards are being put in place to ensure that does not happen in future?</P>

      <P>I have already indicated it will be necessary to increase the number of transfusion surveillance officers and that they will not be optional extras.  It is because of human error and failure of procedures that I am insisting on a national haemovigilance office and the extension of the regulatory function of the IMB, which in 99 per cent of circumstances informs me quickly, to include blood components.  That should deal with the situation.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if he will report on the incidence of asthma, recent trends in this regard, comparison with EU rates, and his views on the underlying causes of these levels among Irish people.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past, precise medical diagnosis of asthma was problematic as the term was frequently used to cover a range of respiratory conditions, including bronchitis.  In addition, asthma is not a notifiable disease as it is not an infectious disease within the meaning of the Health Act, 1947.  For these reasons comparative epidemiological data on asthma have not been available to date.  However, studies have commenced on Irish prevalence using internationally agreed protocols which will allow for further comparisons of Irish figures with other countries worldwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study by the European Community Respiratory Health Survey was published in the European Respiratory Journal 1996 on the variations in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms, self-reported asthma attacks and use of asthma medication in 48 centres, predominantly in western Europe.  This study showed that the prevalence of all symptoms varied widely.  Although generally lower in northern, central and southern Europe and higher in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and the United States, there were wide variations even within some countries.  A 1995 study, employing the ISAAC protocol &mdash; the international study on asthma and allergies in children &mdash; found a prevalence of asthma of 15.2 <Col N="684" /> per cent in children aged between 13 and 14 years in this country.</P>
    <P>Further research, carried out under the auspices of the Department of Respiratory Medicine in James Connolly Memorial Hospital, obtained an estimate of 5 per cent prevalence among Irish adults who had physician diagnosed asthma &mdash; PDA &mdash; and 2.2 per cent receiving active treatment for PDA.  However, the relatively low response rate of 43 per cent obtained for this survey makes it difficult to interpret these results with a high degree of confidence.  A prevalence rate of 11.9 per cent is reported in a study of asthma in the four to 19 year old age group, published in the January-February 1996 issue of the Irish Medical Journal.</P>
    <P>There is evidence to suggest that the prevalence of asthma is increasing internationally. Some of this increase reflects a change in diagnostic practice while some represents a real increase in the condition.  The reasons for the increase are unclear, as asthma is caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors.  The environmental factors include motor vehicle pollution, the house dust mite, dietary changes and cigarette smoke.</P>
    <P>Worldwide research into the causes of asthma is ongoing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet again the Department of Health and Children does not have adequate information or data on serious issues.  Is the Minister aware of a recent study published in <i>The Lancet</i> which found that children in Ireland and Great Britain are more likely to suffer from asthma than children in almost any other part of the world?  He quoted the 15 per cent prevalence figure found by an international study carried out in 1995.  Many doctors have recently expressed concern about the increasing high incidence of asthma and teachers claim it is commonplace for children to have inhalers in school on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister does not have data on this matter.  The anecdotal evidence and research data to which I referred point to a high incidence, but I want to know if this is the case. We must examine the reasons for the high incidence. The Minister trotted off the usual textbook reasons for the causes of asthma.  My question asked for his views on the high prevalence of asthma among Irish people.  Does he intend to undertake research on the underlying causes? Asthma is a very debilitating and disabling condition. It is also extremely costly for families and for the State.  What is the Minister doing about this?</P>

      <P>I am sorry if the Deputy finds the results disappointing, but she asked me to report <Col N="685" /> the incidence of asthma.  I gave four examples. The recent trends are incorporated in my reply. I have made comparisons with rates in the US, Australia and New Zealand as well as the UK. As to the underlying causes, I do not claim to have medical expertise in this area.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, told me that all cases of wheezing do not necessarily mean a diagnosis of asthma.</P>

      <P>I am not trotting off textbook data, I am explaining, on a scientific rather than anecdotal basis, the position regarding the prevalence of asthma among a number of age groups found in scientific studies which involved international comparisons.  That answered the Deputy's question. The Deputy wants to know what I intend to do about this issue I do not intend to do anything more, but that does not mean I do not regard it as a serious issue.  I am not aware of the work being done in this area, but the results may be published shortly.  To alleviate the Deputy's concerns, I will endeavour to find out the research that is currently taking place, which may indicate the matter is being scientifically examined nationally and internationally.  I cannot give the Deputy any more information at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am.  Many of the constituents who contact me about medical cards have asthma.  I have been a Member of the House for the past 15 years and I am well aware of these issues.  The Deputy asked about the objective scientific assessments being done in my Department on the prevalence of asthma.  I have outlined them as well as giving international comparisons. I am not suitably qualified to go beyond that remit.  If the Deputy wishes to raise other issues, she should table another parliamentary question and I will get the relevant information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it a matter of concern that the studies highlight a greater prevalence of asthma in Ireland and on the British Isles than in many other countries?  Australia and New Zealand are the only other countries that appear to have similar levels, but we do not know the reasons for this.  Is that not worthy of specific research &mdash; if it is not already being done &mdash; by this country in conjunction with a group from Great Britain or even a broader group comprising representatives from New Zealand, Australia, <Col N="686" /> Great Britain and Ireland, the countries with the greatest prevalence of asthma?</P>

      <P>The report of the Constitution Review Group is being considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to comment on individual recommendations in the report.</P>
      <P>I will comment on the current position with regard to statute law and the right of access of adopted persons to their birth records.  There is a clear need for legislation to provide a structured, coherent and equitable post-adoption contact system. However, I did not think it prudent to proceed in this prior to the clarification of a number of constitutional and other legal issues surrounding the question of access to birth records, heard by the Supreme Court in July last year.  The issues heard by the Supreme Court go to the very heart of post-adoption contact as they deal with the right of a child to know the identity of his or her birth mother and the right of the birth mother to confidentiality.  The Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the case on 13 March last and the way is now clear to legislate in the area.  However, before putting forward my proposals, I will consider the judgment of the Supreme Court carefully, consult the various interests involved and those with expertise in this field as Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has already outlined.  It must be remembered that what is at issue is not only the rights of persons adopted under the adoption Acts and their birth parents, but also the rights of persons separated from their birth parents in other circumstances, including persons informally adopted prior to the enactment of the Adoption Act, 1952.  It was the persons in this category who were dealt with in the Supreme Court case, to which I referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing this debate to take place.  It is a measure of the seriousness of the situation that my request for leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 was accepted. While not quite unprecedented, the decision to allow this debate is only made in the most extraordinary circumstances.</P>
      <P>I hoped your good sense and concern, a Cheann Comhairle, would have been matched by the Government.  However, instead of having a grasp on reality, the Government appears to be losing its grip altogether.  What promised to be a serious situation has now turned into a crisis.</P>
      <P>I will detail the origin of this crisis.  It lies firmly at the feet of the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In Opposition, the Minister was guilty of outrageous conduct.  He deliberately exaggerated the extent of crime in order to paint himself as the champion who would bring in zero tolerance.  He led the Opposition Front Bench out to meet the Garda when they protested outside the gates of this House over a year ago.  He encouraged the GRA to believe that, when in Government, he would deliver on its demands. He may deny this now and no doubt will do so again.  However, it was common knowledge among the gardaí that, in the Minister's case, they were pushing an open door.  That message came back to us during the last election campaign when we talked to gardaí on the doorsteps.  More importantly, this was accepted by the GRA.  As late as today, PJ Stone is on public record as stating that he was led to believe by the Minister that this was the case.  Whatever opinions one has about PJ Stone, and there are many different opinions of him, nobody could call him a stupid man or underestimate his ability.  He is a man who sees a flag when it is waved under his nose and he is not afraid to talk about it afterwards.</P>
      <P>Since this situation emerged, Government Ministers have come into the House and performed like ostriches hiding their heads in the sands to escape danger.  First, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform answered questions at length on Tuesday without imparting any information of substance.  On the same day, Deputy McCreevy showed an obduracy which is only fanning the flames and creating more obstacles to finding a resolution to the dispute.  On yesterday's Order of Business the Taoiseach repeated the same mantra of his Ministers &mdash; there would be no breach of public sector pay and would the gardaí please turn up for work tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> This is pie in the sky stuff.  Tomorrow, unless this Government stops acting like the chorus of a Greek tragedy and starts performing like a Government capable of running the country, our society will be put in danger the extent of which is unimaginable.  Thousands of gardaí have made it clear they will not turn up for work.  They have indicated that they will call in sick as a ruse to subvert the bar which exists against their right to strike.</P>
    <P>This is not a palatable tactic and raises ethical questions for such key service providers. However, be that as it may, the reality is that no one can force the gardaí to turn up for work if they choose not to and yet no one can do without them going into work.  If we cannot depend on the gardaí to carry out all the routine work relating to road safety, crime prevention and detection, court work and the other functions they provide, how does the Government intend to replace the irreplaceable?</P>
    <P>We are facing into the prospect that the most basic protection and security will be denied to citizens across this State.  This is a terrifying prospect, particularly for the elderly and the vulnerable who are alarmed and frightened by the possibilities that such a scenario conjures up.  I have asked the Taoiseach to stop being a spectator of this dispute and start being a leader who is not afraid of taking responsibility and I am asking him again.  No one would take any credit away from him in relation to his negotiating skills that led to the Northern Ireland Agreement.  He has proved himself to be effective in the reconciliation of conflicting forces.  However, it will totally undermine the credibility of the Taoiseach if he persists in refusing to take a hands-on approach to this dispute.  There is the imminent possibility of a breakdown of law and order.  That is how serious the position is.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not only proved himself incapable of resolving the crisis but has been the cause of the crisis.  That is how serious the position is.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time that the brief has proved to be beyond the capability of the Minister. It is the latest in a series of debacles over which he has presided.  This, unlike the others, casts a doubt over the competence of the Minister to fulfil his ministerial role.  When asked in the Dáil on Tuesday to outline the meetings he had in the face of this crisis the Minister fudged his answers. It was clear he had not had meetings with the Garda Commissioner or with the Garda Representative Association.  Yesterday it is reported he met both.</P>
    <P>Will he tell us in a clear coherent comprehensive reply what happened at those meetings? What preparations were put in place to protect the public good?  The Minister has a duty not just to inform the House but to reassure the public he has a coherent and worked-out plan of action that will ensure security for the citizens of the State, to which they are entitled and for which they have paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> Let us be under no illusions.  There are many criminals who want to take advantage of this situation. We cannot afford any further hand-wringing, pleadings or wishful thinking to avert this dispute. It is reported in the newspapers that there is strong support for this industrial action and that in some stations it is 100 per cent.  This issue will not go away because the Taoiseach yesterday pleaded to gardaí to turn up for work tomorrow. There will have to be some clear indication today that the Government will take a new initiative to resolve this dispute.  We all appreciate there are implications for public sector pay and nobody underestimates the difficulties of teasing out a solution.  One thing is certain, a solution will have to be found as the alternative is unthinkable.  We need to hear how the Government intends to reach that solution without destroying the very fabric of the relationship between the Garda and the public and without putting our citizens in serious danger.</P>
    <P>If there is a clear direction and commitment from the Government it would be fair to ask the Garda in those circumstances to defer their action for a week and allow the new initiative to be given a chance.  Everybody understands the position of the gardaí.  The Garda do an extremely difficult and often dangerous job throughout the country.  They are the last resort when all civilisation fails, and have to pick up the pieces and ensure the security we all enjoy is maintained. They deserve to be well paid, nobody would dispute that.  They deserve to be recognised for the difficult and challenging work they do.</P>
    <P>This dispute should not have got to this point and should not have been allowed to be encouraged by a Minister, when in Opposition.  He was opportunist in his approach to an issue which he knew had implications for public sector pay.  Yet he still went ahead and created an expectation which he now has to deal with.  He is reaping the whirlwind, the chickens are coming home to roost.  He will have to sort out the problem, the genesis for which he bears responsibility.</P>
    <P>The ordinary citizen, the elderly person locking up tonight, the sick and the vulnerable should not be expected to pay for the Minister's track record and the failure of the Government and the Minister for Finance who has a central role, with the Taoiseach, to face up to responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing this debate, that it is unusual and exceptional reflects the seriousness of the situation.  I ask the Garda Representative Association to appreciate it has brought this dispute to the heart of Government. That is an acknowledgement of how seriously its demands are being treated.  If that seriousness can be reflected in the Government response, generosity on its part should be forthcoming. I hope it will be forthcoming but ultimately the Government, which is responsible for ensuring security in the State, will be required to provide a vehicle for resolving this dispute sooner or later.  Let us see the beginning of the end now.</P>

The reason there is anger, frustration and bitterness on an unprecedented scale is because of the manner in which the Minister has handled this issue.  Each Member will have received a letter from the Garda Representative Association which states:</P>
      <P>We are bitterly disappointed that the Garda Síochána have been treated so shabbily in the present pay talks.  Promises in relation to our pay increase have not been met and I request your assistance in this regard.</P>
      <P>The issue has been treated shabbily.  The promises, to which the GRA refer, were given by the Minister when in Opposition.  These were the only promises made, as far as I am aware.  When the Garda marched on Leinster House during the term of office of the previous Government, he met them, listened to their case and sympathised with them.  He left them with a certain understanding, created an atmosphere of empathy and the result was a definite expectation that Fianna Fáil and particularly the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, would deliver on the Garda pay issue when elected to Government.</P>
      <P>It is the betrayal of that clear understanding that has led to the present impasse and the chaos which seems set to ensue tomorrow.  It is only one of a series of exaggerated promises which the Minister gave when in Opposition and which have been disowned or discarded and certainly not delivered on in Government.</P>
      <P>In relation to his understandings with the Garda when in Opposition did the Minister promise to favourably consider a pay increase of 15 per cent when in office?  What exactly did he say to them?  What commitments did he give them on this and other issues?  It is obvious there were specific areas of agreement in relation to the pay issue.  The House is entitled to know what these are because this issue and his failure to deliver have thrown petrol on the flames since he assumed office in June 1997.</P>
      <P>I am extremely worried about the consequences of tomorrow's action.  My understanding is that up to 80 per cent of the rank and file members of the force will not report for duty. When 6,500 ordinary gardaí out of 8,500 stay away it places an impossible burden on the 2,000 who report for duty.  It is physically impossible for 2,000 rank and file members to provide even a minimalist but adequate police service albeit backed up by sergeants, inspectors, superintendents, etc.  Has the Minister a guarantee that all sergeants will report for duty tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like some specific details on the Minister's <Col N="692" /> meeting with the Garda Representative Association yesterday afternoon.  Did any further offer come from his side in relation to the pay issue?  In his discussions with Garda representatives and the Commissioner did he receive an indication of what level of absenteeism could be expected or how many gardaí were likely to turn up tomorrow?  How co-ordinated is the withdrawal of service?  Is there a guarantee of a physical presence or skeleton staff in all Garda stations?  Is there a danger that some communities will be left with no Garda presence &mdash; in other words, no protection &mdash; tomorrow?  Will escorts for cash movements be affected?  Will Operation Lifesaver be suspended for the day?  Is it anticipated that the Garda drugs task force will be depleted?  There is huge public concern.  As well as tangible protection people need psychological reassurance, which is why whatever contingency plans exist should be spelt out in detail to the public.  The Commissioner should go on television and radio to indicate the emergency plans which have been put in place.</P>
    <P>From the manpower viewpoint, it is crucial that there be enough personnel on the ground.  The bulk of gardaí will not turn up but to augment those who do, has the Army been requested to make itself available?  Has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform met the Minister for Defence?  Has the Garda Commissioner met the Army Chief of Staff?  What functions, if any, have been agreed with the Army?  As Deputy McManus said, the danger is that this may not be the end but the beginning.  This is a national emergency and we do not know where it will end but the power to end it rests in the Minister's hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The unresolved dispute between members of the Garda Representative Association and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a matter of enormous public concern. That this dispute has led to the proposed action by gardaí tomorrow is disturbing to the public.  The full extent of this concern can be gauged from the fact that you, a Cheann Comhairle, have taken the most unusual step of acceding to requests by Opposition spokespersons on Justice, Equality and Law Reform to adjourn the Dáil to debate this important question.</P>
      <P>The proposed action, scheduled for tomorrow, may pose a serious threat to the safety and security of the public.  It undermines an important pillar of public confidence in the State.  The action is unprecedented in the history of industrial relations between the Government of the day and the gardaí.  It has the potential to erode the public's confidence in the Government's capacity to ensure law and order is maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister finds himself in a paradox. Deputy O'Donoghue has risen to power through his relentless and opportunistic pursuit of the last Minister for Justice.  He may now be remembered for presiding over one of the most disturbing events in the history of the State, where the maintenance <Col N="693" /> of law and order cannot be guaranteed and could potentially fall asunder.</P>
    <P>The genesis of this conflict is complex.  To a significant degree it is due to the fact that gardaí are not allowed become members of a trade union.  This in turn means they cannot engage in negotiations which lead to wage agreements such as those reached in other parts of the public sector. It is a pity this has been allowed to develop and there can be no doubt that gardaí have a valid cause for complaint.  It must seem unreasonable to fair-minded people that in effect the gardaí are forced to accept an agreement in which they have no voice.  If they were allowed to be part of negotiations leading to pay agreements, the outcome might well be different and much more favourable to them.  The Government should address this as a priority and it is now time to reconsider the restriction.  Members of police forces in other countries are allowed to join trade unions without deleterious effects.  The prohibition on trade union membership for gardaí dates to the foundation of the State, when it was more fragile than it is now.  The reasons which led to that position being adopted have ceased to exist and I see no good reason to persist with the present regulations.  The gardaí provide a vital service but other vital public sector services are provided by trade union members without any problems.  Membership of a trade union with full participation in Congress and in the negotiation of agreements might go a long way to avoiding the disturbing vista opening before us tomorrow.</P>
    <P>If there is still immutable resistance to the gardaí becoming trade union members, it is still vital that their concerns about exclusion from agreements be met.  I suggest that the range of those allowed to be part of negotiations should be extended to include another category of participants, to cover groups such as the gardaí who have a legitimate case for being part of the discussions which lead to social partnership agreements.</P>
    <P>In Opposition, Deputy O'Donoghue painted a picture in which all problems faced by his predecessors would vanish when he received his seal of office but, as Minister, he has stumbled from crisis to debacle.  He is now learning the hard way that what one does in Opposition comes to visit one on becoming part of Government.  This is especially true when an Opposition spokesperson is as gung-ho as the present Minister was.</P>
    <P>Despite his ineptitude and recklessness in allowing this problem to develop and fester into a disturbing crisis, it is important to look for solutions. He and the Government should seek the help of an experienced industrial relations troubleshooter, someone who would be acceptable to both sides and who has experience of public sector matters.  I am sure there are people of this calibre who, if approached, would be prepared to make their services available.</P>
    <P>I understand the frustration of the gardaí at the manner in which their pay and conditions have not kept pace with various similar categories of <Col N="694" /> workers.  The job of a garda has become much more complex and taxing in the last 25 years, when Garda pay was similar to other groups such as teachers.  The extent of this change can be gauged by the expansion and evolution in the education and training of gardaí, from a relatively low technology, six months training programme to a fully-fledged third level degree course covering a range of skills and technologies.  The State has rightly been prepared to invest substantial sums into developing this course.  It must now face up to the logic of producing highly qualified people who, whether they are gardaí or otherwise, must be paid the going rate they can command. If this does not happen, inevitably morale falls and standards drop.  In the longer term, those who are talented and capable, the life blood of any organisation, move to jobs with better pay and conditions.  While the gardaí are at the forefront of law and order problems, and face a series of associated risks, their job is much wider than that.  The gardaí I consulted have assured me of the high standards and excellence of the service provided by our police force.  They face difficult problems in tackling the drugs crisis and even in dealing with communities which, as many of us know, can from time to time be wearing.</P>
    <P>To a large extent the present impasse is because there has been no review of Garda pay since 1981.  Gardaí have benefited from wage agreements but the type of work they do has changed and these changes should be reflected in rates of pay. It is also important that the nature of Garda work, which is destined to continue to change, should be reviewed regularly and gardaí rewarded accordingly.</P>
    <P>The basis for compromise and progress in this dispute lies in dealing with the questions of pay in phase one, followed by detailed negotiations on questions relating to the SMI at a later stage. The continuation of the dispute is in no one's interest.  I appeal to both sides to again look at every aspect of their position with a view to finding a way out of the impasse.  If tomorrow's protest goes ahead attitudes will inevitably harden and entrenched positions become more difficult to reverse.  All disputes must be settled and inevitably are.  The primary responsibility in this regard rests with the Minister.  It is time he sought solutions and used his imagination to facilitate compromise.</P>
    <P>The public should be considered in this dispute. I ask both sides to think of the needs of the general public and the common good.  This may lead to a compromise and help avoid what would be a disturbing event tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an exceptional debate.  In performing their duties gardaí are seen but not heard.  They are reluctant to enter into a debate in which they might be seen to compromise their position as impartial upholders of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business the Taoiseach led us to believe that an increase of 39 per <Col N="695" /> cent was being demanded and that this was the bottom line.  Today I heard the other side of the story from garda representatives outside Leinster House.  The figure of 39 per cent was mentioned in light of the fact that no progress had been made on their pay demands since l981.  They are trying to reach a satisfactory compromise.  A figure of 15 per cent would be closer to the mark and one on which they would take a stand.  There is a need to set the record straight and we should not be misled into thinking that an increase of 39 per cent is being demanded.  I am shocked that the Taoiseach would peddle such a figure.</P>
    <P>There is a need to maintain public confidence and we should not do anything that would give rise to unnecessary anxiety and fear.  Whenever anyone attempts to oppose Government policy, for example on EMU, one is quickly told not to rock the boat as the people watching will be upset that there is a lack of harmony.  In this instance, the Government is in the eye of a storm of its own making.</P>
    <P>In frank discussions the Minister informed Garda representatives that he could not countenance a pay increase unless certain guarantees and assurances were given.  They informed him, in turn, having discussed the matter with their members, that they could deliver, that there would not be a knock on effect in terms of the agreements already in place.  That is a civilised and an amicable way of approaching negotiations but the Minister is now giving the impression that no such guarantees and assurances were given. Many gardaí are of the view that he has changed his tune radically, that he has not been consistent and should enter into negotiations to break the impasse.</P>
    <P>Gardaí were in no doubt that the Minister in Opposition when he espoused the concept of zero tolerance was very much on their side and that in Government would stop at nothing to ensure they had everything they needed to perform the tasks they were charged to do.  They regarded him as their friend.  That makes it all the more disappointing that he is now the one telling them that they will have to bite the bullet and that he has given his final word.</P>
    <P>A sum of £27.9 million is provided in the Estimates for Garda overtime &mdash; often cited by gardaí as their lifeline &mdash; down from £43.899 million. The Minister could reduce his overtime bill further by entering into negotiations and arriving at a settlement.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a two tier pay scale in the Garda Síochána.  Gardaí based in our cities and along the Border have the option of working overtime whereas their colleagues in rural areas have few options to do so.  One garda informed me that the payment of a gratuity was his last option to pay off a credit union loan.  This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>On Friday many undesirable criminal elements will relish the prospect of making a quick killing. I hope the Army are on standby and will be able <Col N="696" /> to deal with any crisis that may arise.  The Celtic tiger has often been mentioned in this House and elsewhere.  Government policy appears to be to overlook the losers &mdash; the voiceless and the marginalised. In this instance, the losers are members of the Garda Síochána on whom we depend and whom we often take for granted.  We have much to lose in not negotiating and arriving at a settlement. I would support a change whereby gardaí would be represented by a trade union and, as happens in other countries, allowed to stand for elected office.</P>
    <P>The considerable skills of members of the Garda Síochána are often taken for granted.  In street demonstrations, for instance, they seek to avoid confrontation.  If we continue to take that for granted we will have the mother of all confrontations because we all depend on the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The people know we are facing a deep crisis, which the Ceann Comhairle recognised by allowing this debate.  I have pleaded with the Minister to be open and realistic in his negotiations. Industrial relations negotiations are quite dynamic.  I have been involved in industrial relations for over 20 years in which people make claims with a view to arriving at a settlement much lower than their claim.  It is totally unrealistic of the Minister to say the settlement area is 39 per cent.  We all know the settlement area in a negotiation is much less than the claim but much higher than the Minister's offer.  To get to that position one must have meaningful negotiations. The Minister recognises that Garda pay has fallen behind relative to its position with other groups ten years ago.  That should be addressed.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulties in regard to managing the economy.  However, people will recognise these are special circumstances which must be tackled and that the crisis we are facing tomorrow must be overcome.  With only hours left, strong intervention must be made by the Minister.  The beginning of meaningful negotiations would prevent the difficulties which might be experienced tomorrow.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of concern about this. When the Minister was in Opposition he was very good at heightening public concern about the level of crime, the lack of gardaí on the street and Garda numbers of only 10,000 or 11,000.  The public and the Garda are concerned that only 25 per cent of that number will be at work tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda has the same right to negotiate as other groups in national negotiations such as the PCW.  I raised that issue on a number of occasions in the Seanad.  The Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations should be party to all negotiations, which would cover the Army, the Garda and other smaller groups.  That body should be allowed to represent those who are currently not represented at the negotiations and who rightly feel they do not have ownership of agreements.  I appeal to the Minister to examine <Col N="697" /> that for future negotiations.  The ICPSA should be present at the negotiating table rather than handing people a decision in which they had no involvement.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to immediately intervene in the situation.  He should call PJ Stone and John Healy, whom I know very well, for meaningful negotiations and discussions this evening to ensure this crisis, which the Ceann Comhairle has recognised by allowing this debate, is headed off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt we are facing a crisis tomorrow which has its origins in two factors.  The first is the continued exclusion of the Garda from the negotiation of pay agreements over two decades.  The second is the irresponsible and opportunistic promises by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he was in Opposition.  There is no doubt about that.  I do not accept that, as the Minister and Taoiseach have implied, the gardaí outside the gates of this House are in some way lying about the promises made to them by the Minister when he was in Opposition.  That is simply not the case.</P>
      <P>The Minister should either indicate how he plans to resolve this crisis before tomorrow morning or offer his resignation to the House.  He is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and he has a responsibility to this House and the people to ensure there is adequate policing available to our citizens.  It is not good enough to ramble on about nonsensical claims that gardaí are looking for an impossible increase of 39 per cent.  That is not the case and continuing with such waffle is misleading and an excuse for inaction.</P>
      <P>The Garda has achieved unprecedented public recognition of the situation in which it finds itself. Every Member knows how difficult it is to get this kind of debate on an issue of major importance. As far as I am aware, the last time the House was adjourned for such a debate was when the junior doctors were on the verge of withdrawing their services from hospitals and that crisis had to be resolved overnight.</P>
      <P>This situation must be resolved by negotiation, which should be done tonight rather than tomorrow night after the country has been plunged into chaos.  It is completely undignified for the Minister to have engineered a situation whereby gardaí must stand outside this House with placards. It is not appropriate for our gardaí to have to do that to get a just claim considered adequately by the Government and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Gardaí have a very difficult and dangerous job. They are expected on one hand to be social workers and on the other to be heroes.  Every garda on the beat puts his or her life at risk. Unfortunately, some gardaí have lost their lives at the hands of criminals or paramilitary gangsters. It is inappropriate that men and women of that calibre should have to stand outside the gates of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have any inside information on the <Col N="698" /> matter but I have no doubt that if an effort were made by the Government and the Minister to negotiate reasonably with the Garda, tomorrow's threatened action would not go ahead.  As Deputy McManus said, if the Minister found it possible to make a reasonable offer, the Garda should suspend its action for a week or so to consider it.  However, that requires a serious effort by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>It is way past time for the Garda to be allowed form a trade union.  The idea that gardaí should be denied the right to join a trade union dates from a time in this century when trade unions and trade unionists were regarded as subversive, which is clearly not the case.  The trade unions have participated in a responsible way over many years in partnership agreements with the Government and employers to assist the enormous economic development in this State.  The Garda has co-operated in that process, albeit outside the actual negotiating process.  It is way past time that they should be enabled to participate in the partnership negotiations and to form and register as a trade union.</P>
    <P>The idea that the Garda or anybody else can be forced to work against their wishes is a nonsense in this day and age.  While they can have regulations that they may not strike, it is clear from the action proposed tomorrow that once a workforce decides, regardless of the law, that it does not wish to make its services available there is no way to guarantee it will do so.  Some device will be found to ensure its voice is heard.  The gardaí have achieved that.</P>
    <P>The Minister should recognise that this is not 1913 and that workers, whether they be gardaí, soldiers, doctors, nurses, teachers or road workers, cannot be starved into submission as employers attempted to do in 1913.  This dispute must be resolved by negotiation.  I expect that the Minster will make proposals regarding the resolution of the dispute and not give us the same kind of inane waffle which we have heard over the past two days.</P>

      <P>It is the solemn duty of all in <Col N="699" /> this House to avoid making comments that would exaggerate the situation.  If one message goes out from the House on foot of this debate it should be that no Government can yield to the demands of any group of public service employees in the face of action which can only have the effect of threatening the safety of the community.  That is the position of this Government, as it has been of many previous Governments.</P>
      <P>In this context, it is important that I repeat there is a substantial and generous offer on the table which is open to further negotiations.  There is no refusal to talk and no doors are closed to the GRA.  I respectfully suggest that the action contemplated by members of the force is unjustified, unwarranted and out of all proportion to the reality of the current situation.  When regard is had to the potential harm to the force and the community it serves which this action could have, it is all the more disappointing that it is being contemplated.</P>
      <P>This dispute will be resolved, as has every other dispute over pay.  The Government is not in the business of trying to get one over on the GRA or any other representative association.  The door to the negotiation table is open and tomorrow's planned action serves no useful purpose.  Neither I nor the Government need any convincing that the pay issue in the Garda Síochána needs to be addressed.  We are well aware that the force's pay has fallen behind and that is why a mechanism is in place to redress that.</P>
      <P>Neither should we lose sight of the fact that we are not in a negotiating situation where each side has run out of road.  I have made it clear that the 7 per cent offer remains on the table and this is subject to further negotiation within the overall parameters of public pay policy generally. Clearly, therefore, there is still some distance which can be travelled before either side adopts its final position.  In those circumstances, it seems to me that tomorrow's action is all the more pointless.</P>
      <P>When I came into office I was faced with two problems on the Garda representative front &mdash; that of pay and of the split in the GRA.  The House will be aware that the long standing split was finally settled before Christmas.  This pay dispute did not start today or yesterday or on the day the Government took office; it started before then.  The Garda Association approached the previous Government seeking a pay commission, which was rejected.  Indeed, the last Government made no arrangements to address Garda pay.</P>

      <P>Not only did I find a mechanism to start negotiations on pay, I also helped to resolve the problems which led to a split in the association.</P>
      <P>In 1994, both the GRA and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors concluded an agreement under the local bargaining clause of the PESP-PCW pay agreement at the Garda Conciliation Council.  The agreement provided for the pensionability of unsocial hours allowances, including night duty, Saturday, Sunday and public holiday allowances.  The net effect of this agreement was to increase the superannuation benefits to the members who are in receipt of unsocial hours allowances by up to 20 per cent.  The agreement also provided for a significant increase in the rate of designated post allowance paid to members in the relevant posts and a pensionable allowance, in lieu of non-pensionable overtime, was introduced for ministerial drivers.  In return, the associations agreed to a number of measures, the principal one being to give discretion to the Garda Commissioner in relation to rostering.  At that time, both the associations accepted that the agreement was in full and final settlement of the local bargaining clause of the PESP.</P>
      <P>The GRA lodged a pay claim at the Garda Conciliation Council in September 1996 and in November 1996 wrote to the Minister of the day demanding a commission to review Garda pay. Other Garda associations joined them in their campaign for a commission.  In February and March 1997, the GRA, together with the AGSI and the Association of Garda Superintendents, organised joint open meetings in Cork, Portlaoise, Sligo and Dublin.  On 16 April 1997 the GRA held a protest march in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demand for a special commission on Garda pay was not enthusiastically accepted by the previous Government.  An issue was raised here again as to whether I was the cause of this dispute.  Aside altogether from the fact that the dispute had been festering long before 1996 or 1997, I set out my party's position in various correspondences with colleagues and others.  I said we would discuss the question of a commission on pay on our return to office but it would be in the context of the strategic management initiative and the implementation of our crime policy.  If required I can open that correspondence.  That correspondence was written in the face of an imminent general election.  The politically expedient thing to do would have been to say we would have a commission on pay and we would give members an increase but I did neither.  If need be, I can produce the evidence.  I am disappointed Opposition Members ascribe to me offers I allegedly <Col N="701" /> made to the Garda Síochána at that time without producing any evidence to substantiate them.</P>
    <P>I met the various Garda associations on a number of occasions and explained the Report of the Steering Group on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Garda Síochána held out the best prospect of furthering the association's claims for an increase in pay.  In face of correspondence I have before me, I vehemently reject the accusation that I created high expectations or was in any way the cause of this dispute.</P>
    <P>On 26 November 1997 the Government published the Report of the Steering Group on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Garda Síochána and decided to implement the programme of change recommended in the report by establishing a steering group to develop and implement the overall programme of change.</P>
    <P>One of the tasks of that steering group was to oversee the bottom-up review of the force.  That involves the establishment of an in-depth examination to reach conclusions on the optimum number, structure and deployment of the gardaí and the appropriate mix between gardaí and civilians. Top priority was afforded to this task and a subcommittee of that steering group was established immediately to deal with it.  The chairman of that subcommittee, Mr. Declan Brennan, is a member of that steering group.  The chairman of the bottom-up review, Mr. Brennan, was appointed to chair the discussions between the official and staff representatives on the issue of pay.</P>
    <P>On 23 December l997 Mr. Brennan convened a joint introductory meeting of the four Garda Associations and the official side.  Commencing in January l998 each of the four associations held a number of meetings with the official side to set out their case for a pay increase and backed this up with written submissions to Mr. Brennan.</P>
    <P>The official side gave its response on 1 April l998 at separate meetings with the GRA and AGSI.  The response was that an increase of 5.5 per cent could be offered and that there might be the prospect of further increases which would be conditional on obtaining some productivities and savings.  Both associations rejected this offer. They withdrew from the pay discussion process and embarked on campaigns of protest action.</P>
    <P>The chairperson of the pay discussions subsequently invited the GRA and the AGSI to a meeting to consider the suspension of the industrial action and the resumption of the pay discussions. The meeting with the GRA was held on 16 April and the GRA indicated it was unable to resume the pay discussions until the official side's offer was increased.  It suggested that an increased offer of 7 per cent would be expected.  The AGSI, at a meeting on 17 April, also indicated that an increased offer was necessary for its resumption of the pay discussions and the deferral of protest action.</P>
    <P>Mr. Brennan made a recommendation that the offer to the associations be increased to 7 per cent indicating he was satisfied, based on the discussions <Col N="702" /> to date, that productivity discussions due to take place would yield savings that would justify an increase of 7 per cent at that stage.  He was satisfied an offer of this amount would form a basis for the resumption of the pay discussions. This recommendation was accepted by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and myself on 18 April and conveyed immediately to the general secretaries of both associations.  On 23 April 1998 the AGSI returned to the negotiation table and discussions on its pay claim have resumed.  The GRA rejected the new offer and decided to continue on a campaign of protest action.  The threatened abstention from duty tomorrow appears to be part of that campaign.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress what is at issue here. The GRA has sought a pay increase of 39 per cent.  By any standards that is excessive.  The official side made an offer of 5.5 per cent, which is within the general PCW range of settlements, and offered to participate in ongoing discussions to identify if further progress could be achieved in the context of productivity and savings.  The official side's good intent has been signalised by the enhanced offer of 7 per cent based on productivity expectations.  It is unfortunate that the GRA cannot appreciate the progress which was made.</P>
    <P>My Government colleagues and I have appealed on several occasions to the GRA to desist from the protest action and to return to the pay discussions.  Yesterday evening I met the officer board of the association and renewed the appeal.  I stressed once again that the opportunity for further discussions on pay remains open.  I also stressed that no progress could be made on the issue of pay until the protest action was suspended and the association agreed to return to the negotiating table.</P>
    <P>The real problem is that the GRA wishes to have its pay dealt with outside the confines of national pay policy as set out in the PCW and Partnership 2000.  The last Government did not agree to this and this Government cannot agree to it either.  I cannot see any future Government agreeing to deal with the pay of any group of public employees outside the parameters of the national pay policy.</P>
    <P>The Government fully recognises the legitimate pay aspirations of the gardaí have to be addressed and I have been entirely consistent on that, but it is firm in its resolve that it must be in the context of public service pay policy.  Any settlement above the general norm would inevitably lead to catch up claims by other workers with consequent undermining of the national economy.  I would be pleased to clarify any issue if it would help to bring the association back to the table.  My officials and I will remain ready at all times to consider any issue.</P>
    <P>As I explained, I am making every effort to encourage the Garda Representative Association to return to negotiations rather than to pursue industrial action.  I call on everyone in this House to join with me in urging the Garda associations <Col N="703" /> to pursue the avenue of negotiation rather than confrontation.  I repeat my request to the GRA to call off the protest action and return to the negotiations table &mdash; the only place where the pay issue can be settled.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána is a particularly dedicated and committed police force with a high international reputation.  While I know many members feel they have a legitimate grievance regarding their pay, I also know they will be very reluctant to resort to such industrial action which could endanger the vulnerable members of the community, when the door to negotiations is still open.  Nobody will gain if gardaí stay away from work tomorrow.  The public will be put at risk, their confidence and trust in the gardaí will be totally undermined, the reputation of the force will suffer and the members will not gain anything. In so far as contingency planning is concerned, we must prepare for the worse.</P>
    <P>I discussed the matter with the Garda Commissioner yesterday and he was confident he could provide an adequate police service with the resources he expected to be available.  The Garda Representative Association when questioned by the media on this issue has given assurances about the provisions of emergency services.</P>
    <P>There have been demands from some Opposition speakers for a detailed account of the arrangements for Friday.  Those Deputies know full well that such detailed information is never given for security reasons.  We cannot expect the gardaí to broadcast their plans to criminals.  That applies on Friday as much as any other day.  I can assure Deputies that the Garda Commissioner has drawn up plans to deal with the situation. Obviously, he has to be flexible.  Deputy Higgins can be assured that neither the Garda Commissioner nor the Garda Representative Association know how many gardaí will report for duty tomorrow.  While I cannot give full details, I can say that the Garda authorities have drawn up plans to address specific issues, such as general patrolling, response to calls, general and specific security, banks, airports, communications centres, court attendances and prisoner escorts.  Deputies will have read in today's newspapers that, as a precautionary measure, arrangements were made to bring forward to today cash deliveries that might normally take place on a Friday.</P>
    <P>I also remind Deputies that in addition to ordinary gardaí who will report for duty tomorrow, the Garda Commissioner has over 850 gardaí who are still on probation but have full powers as well as over 200 trainee gardaí.  The Garda Representative Association stated that these gardaí will not be taking part in any action.  There are also 2,300 gardaí at sergeant rank and above.  I understand the Garda Commissioner has arranged for the Defence Forces to be on stand by to be called out in aid of the civil power if necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins said the Garda Commissioner should appear on television and radio.  The commissioner is holding a press conference this afternoon <Col N="704" /> on policing arrangements and to answer questions about his plans.  No one can guarantee the provision of a fully normal police service tomorrow and obviously there may be some disruption to non-essential services.  This matter can only be resolved at the negotiating table.  It cannot be resolved on the streets or by staying away from work.</P>
    <P>Two constructive suggestions were made by Deputy Neville and Deputy De Rossa who raised the issue of involving the Garda in national pay negotiations.  Gardaí have benefited in the past from all national pay agreements.  However, I am willing to consider the Deputies' suggestion in conjunction with my Cabinet colleagues and the Garda associations if they return to the negotiating table.  The associations have been told already that the Government is willing to explore this matter in advance of any future national pay discussions.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were made to the effect that there were insufficient meetings with the GRA about this matter.  However, the door of no other Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been as open to the GRA as mine since I commenced my tenure of office.  I met the association on more occasions in a short time than any other Minister.  The GRA is aware that the door is not only open to its officer board but also to its central executive whom I met collectively on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>I reissue my appeal to the Garda Representative Association to understand that only dialogue and industrial negotiation can resolve this matter. Ultimately, that is precisely what will happen and it may as well happen sooner rather than later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter.  I hope the Minister will use this opportunity to give good news to the many parents affected by this difficulty.</P>
      <P>Everybody readily accepts that a couple's decision to adopt a child is major and nothing should cause them any further frustration or heartache.  Following representations I checked with health boards and I discovered that, in general, the delay from the date of application until the assessment procedure begins is between 12 and 18 months.  This is totally unacceptable.  I understand assessment necessarily takes time and it is most important that parents are fully briefed on and prepared in advance for any problems which may arise.  However, I cannot accept under any circumstances a period ranging from 12 to 18 months from the date of application until the assessment process begins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From discussions, I am aware that social workers are being asked to do too much.  They deal with all types of problems.  This may have <Col N="705" /> been fine in the past when fewer adoptions took place.  However, there has been an upsurge in the number of people adopting children and it is vital that the Minister provides adequate staff to reduce the delays.  It is unnecessary to explain how frustrating the situation is for parents.  Every sensible concerned person realises that 12 to 18 months is an absurd waiting period for the start of an assessment.  There is a further legitimate delay involved in the assessment and then parents must travel abroad, etc.  All this takes time.  As couples, in general, decide to adopt in later life, a two year gap is serious for them.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to point out that this matter has been raised previously and that there are problems because the staff must deal with many other areas.  I hope he will have good news for frustrated parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this matter.  I am pleased to reply on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey.</P>
      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, imposed a statutory duty on health boards to carry out as soon as practicable assessments for foreign adoptions.  In carrying out this function, the boards must have regard to the competing demands in other areas of the child care services, particularly in relation to the protection of children from abuse and neglect which takes priority over all other work. Under the Act, it is also open to an applicant to request a registered adoption society to carry out an assessment.  However, there is no obligation on a registered adoption society to carry out such an assessment.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are different timescales for the completion of the assessment process in the different health board areas and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has received a number of representations on the issue.  The difference arises principally from the greater volume of applications in some areas, particularly in the Eastern Health Board area. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, met senior management of the Eastern Health Board last year to discuss delays in carrying out assessments of couples who wished to adopt children from abroad.  I am pleased to inform the House that arising from additional funding approved to the Eastern Health Board for child care services in 1998, the board has proposed in its 1998 service plan the appointment of three new social workers to its adoption service.  This will facilitate a speedier assessment of couples who wish to adopt children abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the current waiting time prior to assessment in the Eastern Health Board area is 12 months, a reduction of two months on 1997. This reduction can be accounted for by the allocation of additional resources and to greater efficiencies in the overall process of application. It is the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey's intention <Col N="706" /> to meet the Eastern Health Board again in the near future to discuss the further measures, if any, which could be taken to shorten the waiting time for an adoption assessment.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, recently travelled to Romania and China to put in place arrangements to facilitate prospective Irish adopters who wish to adopt children from these countries. Ireland signed The Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption in 1996.  Major amendment of our foreign adoption legislation will be required prior to ratification of the convention. Implementation of the convention will mean bilateral state to state processing of adoption applications from prospective Irish adopters to other countries which have ratified the convention. Arising from these developments and other trends in Irish society, such as increasing prosperity and multi-culturalism, I expect the number of applications for adoption assessments to increase further.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, and I are not convinced that simply assigning more social workers to deal with an ever expanding caseload is the most efficient way of dealing with this matter, particularly when one considers the other areas of pressing need in our child care services.  It is necessary to consider how health boards can best utilise existing resources to manage cases and whether legislative change is required to assist them in this regard.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has had discussions on the issue of foreign adoption assessments not only with the Eastern Health Board but also with the health board programme managers group, the Irish foreign adoption group and the Council of Irish Adoption Agencies, and will have further discussions on the issue.  If, as a result of these discussions, it becomes obvious to him that legislative change is required, he will consider that the most appropriate form to implement such change is the Bill to ratify The Hague Convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá me buíoch an seans a thabhairt dom an cheist thábhachtach seo a ardú anseo.  This school serves one of the most disadvantaged urban communities in the State.  Most of the children are from the Sheriff Street-Seville Place district where there is high unemployment and an appalling drug problem.  The only chance these children have to escape the cycle of deprivation <Col N="707" /> is through education through their local school.  The dedicated teachers, principal and local parents combine to do the best they can. They have a very strong commitment to the welfare and educational needs of the children.  They attempt to ensure the children get equality of opportunity in life, but that objective is almost impossible given the conditions of the school and the total lack of funding resources supporting the school.</P>
      <P>I cannot adequately describe the conditions within the school premises.  They are a disgrace to successive Governments and to this House.  The toilets can only be described as Dickensian; they have to be seen to be believed.  The windows of the school are held together with wire and tape. The capitation grant referred to by the Minister in a recent reply to a parliamentary question which I tabled is totally insufficient to do basic plastering, painting and redecoration work which is extensively needed in the school such is the neglect.  The school building desperately needs major refurbishment and new windows and toilets.  The principal needs an office.  There is need for complete internal and external redecoration.</P>
      <P>Security is a major problem because of the dilapidated condition of the windows.  The school has been broken into several times recently and attempts were made to burn it down.  Beautifully decorated classrooms, work done by the children and local mothers, were destroyed in the arson attack.  A small minority of vandals were responsible for that.  The vast majority of the local community is most supportive.  Following the recent attacks on the school, public meetings were called and door to door collections organised to pay for repairs, but an impoverished local community cannot realistically fund the necessary work.</P>
      <P>A security alarm system and secure boundary fencing are necessary.  The position is so bad that each morning the school staff must clear the yard of needles and other materials left by addicts overnight.  The school authorities were told verbally by Department officials that there is no funding available for the necessary work.  Despite that, the school management again recently applied for funds to the Department of Education and Science.  I mention this predicament to ask the Minister to expedite a decision.  If that is not done the school will simply die.  Maybe that is what the Department wants.  The experience of the school over the years is that it has been allowed to decline with a view to removing it altogether from the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that St. Laurence O'Toole's CBS, where my father went to school, is in the heart of the docklands redevelopment area.  We are constantly told that the necessary training and education up to third level will be provided for local children as part of the docklands initiative.  I recently raised this matter with the chief executive of the docklands authority and asked him how this school and the children who attend it fit into the grandiose vision of the future docklands community.  Has a school so disgracefully neglected <Col N="708" /> any chance of preparing these children to give them equality of opportunity in the docklands area?  Is it any wonder heroin abuse is widespread and drug dealing out of control a few hundred yards from the school playground?  The buck stops at the Minister's desk and I will be interested in what he has to say.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the several infant schools, junior schools and this national school in the Sheriff Street area where the staff, despite the conditions I mentioned, do fantastic work for the local children. They are, however, fighting an uphill battle because they do not get the support they deserve from Government.</P>

      <P>We are glad the Deputy has given us the opportunity to outline our Department's position in respect of the situation at St. Laurence O'Toole CBS, Seville Place, Dublin 1.  As the Deputy is aware, the school has a staffing of a principal, three assistant teachers &mdash; of whom one is as a result of the schools inclusion in the Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage scheme &mdash; one remedial teacher, one concessionary, one shared counsellor and one shared home school liaison. The enrolment at the school is 62.</P>
      <P>It is open to the school management to apply to the Department for grant aid towards capital improvements to its facilities.  The process of dealing with applications is set out in the publication &ldquo;National School Capital Programme&rdquo;, which issued to all schools in 1994.  Since then, a devolved grant scheme has commenced under which each national school is paid a basic annual capital grant of £2,000 plus £9 per pupil which may be spent by the school on improvement works to buildings, services, grounds and furnishings.</P>
      <P>On 30 March 1998 an application was submitted by the school management requesting grant assistance towards the cost of carrying out capital improvements at the school.  The Department's architectural staff will visit the school shortly to report on the works sought.  On receipt of this report, the Department will be in contact with the school management.  The Minister wishes to assure the Deputy that our Department appreciates the concerns expressed by the school management. The Deputy can be assured of our desire to see an improvement in conditions at the school.  We thank him sincerely for the opportunity to outline the position pertaining to this school.</P>

      <P>: The provision of formal postgraduate training and education programmes up to recently was a matter for dental schools in conjunction with the joint Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry <Col N="710" /> and the Royal Colleges of the United Kingdom and Ireland.  On 14 April 1998 the European Primary and Specialist Dental Qualification Regulations came into force in the United Kingdom.  These regulations give recognition to the European specialties for oral surgery and othodontics and also give power to the General Dental Council to make regulations creating other domestic specialties.  In Ireland similar powers were given in the Dentists Act, 1985, to the Dental Council.</P>
      <P>Because of the traditionally close links between the Irish and British postgraduate dental education systems, the Dental Council has written to me requesting consent to establish a register of dental specialists with a division of ten different specialities including orthodontics and oral surgery which are the two specialties recognised in EU directives.</P>
      <P>The council propose to recognise, for the purposes of specialist registration, courses of training and qualifications in specialised dentistry provided by the National University of Ireland, Cork, the University of Dublin and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  Section 37 of the Dentists Act requires the council to determine from time to time the body or bodies within the State which it will recognise for the purpose of granting evidence of satisfactory completion of specialist training.  The Dental Council has invited the Committee for Higher Training in Dentistry to undertake this function.</P>
      <P>I have written to the council seeking further information regarding the implications of the specialist register and the proposed structures for granting evidence of satisfactory completion of specialist training.  When I am satisfied that the proposed arrangements meet necessary legal and accountability requirements I will give my consent to the Dental Council to establish a register of dental specialists and approve training programmes.</P>
      <P>The orthodontic review group, a group set up by the health boards at the suggestion of my Department, has examined issues in relation to training in orthodontics and will include recommendations in its report.  This group, which includes health board consultant orthodontists, is due to report to the chief executive officers of the health boards in the near future.  A number of health board dentists are currently undergoing postgraduate training in orthodontics through UK based dental schools.  However, it is important that the postgraduate needs of our public dental services in orthodontics and other disciplines under the health strategy and the dental health action plan should, as far as possible, be met from our own dental schools in Dublin and in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore I have requested the chief dental officer to have discussions with the dental schools in Dublin and Cork and the Joint Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry and agree a training <Col N="711" /> programme for health board dentists working in the regional orthodontic units.</P>

    <P>These figures indicate that Ireland has a significant burden of morbidity and mortality from meningococcal infection when compared to a number of our EU partners.  A number of factors may be considered in attempting to explain this. The establishment of the Departments of Public Health and the appointment of specialists with responsibility for infectious disease control has resulted in more effective reporting of the disease which may account for some of the reported increases over the past few years.  Furthermore it has been shown in countries where this disease has been efficiently reported and closely monitored over the years that the occurrence of meningococcal infection is cyclical in nature. Increases in incidence may occur periodically without apparent reason, persist for a number of <Col N="712" /> years and then begin to fall again towards previous lower levels.</P>
    <P>The protocols which are followed in Ireland in the management of this disease are no different from those used in other countries.  The disease will continue to be monitored closely in the future to confirm any trends in its occurrence.  The establishment of the Meningococcal Reference Laboratory in Temple Street Children's Hospital will assist in the detailed surveillance of the disease with particular reference to the typing of the organisms.  In addition, the working group on bacterial meningitis and related conditions has continued to meet and advise my Department on developments in relation to this condition and has agreed to remain in existence for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy to be referring to situations where procedures rendered on an outpatient basis are subject to an annual excess amount and may not therefore qualify for full reimbursement, as against inpatient procedures in respect of which excess amounts are not applied.</P>
      <P>The VHI has informed me that it is not correct to say that members have to unnecessarily occupy hospital beds to obtain reimbursement of costs.  It has pointed out that its members are reimbursed for care provided on an inpatient, day care and side room basis.  Neither of the latter two categories require overnight admission to obtain reimbursement. The Deputy may be interested to note that according to published operational statistics for VHI in respect of 1996-97, the number of day care claims assessed was 145,000 approximately as against 181,000 in-patient claims assessed.  The corresponding figures for l995-96 were 120,000 and 173,000.  These illustrate that day case activity is widely availed of in the provision of care to VHI members.</P>
      <P>I am informed that VHI anticipate that further developments will continue to occur to ensure that appropriate levels of care are utilised by its members for medically necessary procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, the Deputy's question concerns the manner in which health insurers products are designed and the rules applicable to those products. This is a matter for which the insurer is answerable to the customer in a competitive market and, providing existing regulations relating to the minimum level of benefits which insurers must provide are not contravened, it is not a matter <Col N="713" /> in which the Minister as the regulatory authority for the market should intervene.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that the VHI is a statutory corporate body established for the purpose of making and carrying out schemes of voluntary health insurance on a not-for-profit basis.  VHI's financial results for the years 1995-96 and 1996-97 show that it has been trading at just above break-even level with surpluses of £1 million and £1.7 million respectively.  It is understood that the out-run for the year 1997-98 will show a similar surplus.</P>
      <P>Although the VHI is exempt under EU directives from meetings the prudential requirements applicable to commercial insurers in the Irish market, it minimises reserves above the minimum solvency level.  However, a change in VHI's corporate status, or the removal of the exemption, would require an injection of capital to increase its reserves to 2 level commensurate with a commercial insurer in order for it to qualify for authorisation by the State's insurance regulatory authority the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>Up to 1997 VHI had been trading as a monopoly in the private health insurance market, due to the evolution of private health insurance in Ireland.  However, following the enactment of legislation to facilitate the operation of a competitive market on foot of the EU's Third Non-Life Insurance Directive, VHI is now operating in a changed market.  In light of the competitive market environment, it was considered necessary to examine the corporate structure which would best serve VHI into the future and I asked the VIII board to submit its views to me on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report submitted to me by the board has been the subject of discussions between officials of my Department and VHI senior management. The report explores the options available to VHI as regards corporate status and capitalisation in the context of its continued successful operation into the future.  The issues addressed include solvency requirements options for raising capital &mdash;<Col N="714" /> including a Government injection of capital &mdash; and strategic alliance.</P>
    <P>The process of examining the options presented by the board, with a view to identifying the most appropriate and effective among them, is ongoing.  Furthermore, my Department has initiated a process of consultations preparatory to a White Paper on private health insurance.  In this connection it is open to interested parties to submit views on the future corporate status and functioning of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. It is my intention, following completion of this comprehensive consideration process, to prepare proposals for Government regarding the optimum course of action to be pursued in relation to the future corporate status and capitalisation of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>

      <P>Individual prescriptions are a matter for the judgment of the clinician concerned.  However, the medical profession is fully aware of the problems associated with the over prescribing of antibiotics and a number of steps have been taken to promote good practices in regard to the prescribing of antibiotics and their use.  Measures in place include licensing requirements and education and information initiatives.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, firstly, antibiotics must be licensed by the Irish Medicines Board for specific indications in both humans and animals.</P>
      <P>A range of methods are used in drawing attention to the benefits of appropriate prescribing of antibiotics.  The National Medicines Information Centre has issued guidelines on the use of antibiotics in respiratory and urinary tract infections to doctors and pharmacists.  Specialist advice is available to individual doctors from the centre on request.  Antibiotic prescribing is also often dealt with in general practitioner postgraduate seminars. At health board level, discussion with general practitioners on prescribing, including the use of antibiotics, is part of the remit of health board GP units.  General practitioners in the GMS receive details of the medicines they prescribe and can review their overall use of antibiotics. The Deputy will also be interested to learn that two of the functions of the new National Infectious Disease Surveillance Centre will be the monitoring and surveillance of antibiotic resistance and the ongoing promotion of appropriate prescribing.</P>
      <P>With regard to hospitals, guidelines were issued by my Department in 1995 for the control and prevention of methicillin resistant staphyloccus aureas (MRSA).  My Department has also encouraged the setting up of drugs and therapeutics committees in hospitals to advise on the rational use of antibiotics, a number of which have established links with local general practitioners to co-ordinate antibiotic use.  Some hospital laboratories also regularly list specimens from hospital and community patients for the development of resistance to common antibiotics and advise prescribers accordingly.</P>
      <P>Information is available to the public on the proper use of antibiotics through doctors and community pharmacists.  The new contract between health boards and community pharmacists encompasses discussion with patients on the correct preparation, administration and use of medicines and on the importance of compliance with the directions for use.  In this regard also, the Health Promotion Unit of my Department in association with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association has produced a public information leaflet aimed at encouraging the proper use of medicines.</P>
      <P>Finally, the new Food Safety Authority will be working with the Department of Agriculture and Food with regard to animal health where it may impact on human foodstuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> I am satisfied that the range of measures presently in place are working to address the question of antibiotic resistance and will, however, continue to keep this matter under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 24, 37 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>Regulation (EC) 258/97 came into effect in all member states of the European Union in mid-May 1997 and the Department of Health and Children is the competent authority for its implementation in Ireland.  The regulation applies to the placing on the market of novel foods and novel food ingredients.  Food and food ingredients which have not hitherto been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community and which contain or are produced from a genetically modified organism fall, <i>inter alia,</i> within its scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of regulation are intended to provide protection to consumers.  The regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients, if not substantially equivalent to their non-novel counterparts, must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved-authorised <Col N="719" /> before being placed on the European market. The regulation also contains provisions for the labelling of novel food and food ingredients.  My Department has asked the Food Safety Authority of Ireland for its advice on novel foods including the question of the perceived lack of consumer confidence in genetically modified foods and the matter is being dealt with by a special subcommittee.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for different aspects of genetic engineering spans several Government Departments. My Department is responsible for the safety assessment of genetically modified foods which fall within the scope of the novel foods regulation; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has responsibility for developments in the biotechnology industry and the Department of the Environment and Local Government is responsible for the wider issue of the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms.  I am aware that that Department is at present preparing a national position paper on the issue of genetic modification.  My Department is happy to contribute to those aspects of this exercise which fall within its competence and indeed preliminary discussions have already taken place between officials.  In advance of publication of this position paper, I am keeping an open mind on the issue of genetic modification including that of genetically modified foodstuffs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20.  29 and 102 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> The new hospital at Tallaght will incorporate the services currently being provided at the Adelaide Hospital, the Meath Hospital and the National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street.  In addition, acute psychiatric services currently being provided at St. Loman's hospital will also transfer to Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns felt by many people in the south inner city at the closure of the Meath Hospital.  However, since agreement was reached on the development of the new hospital in Tallaght, it has always been understood that the three constituent hospitals would close once the new hospital is opened.  The new hospital will serve the large population of Tallaght and its surroundings which up to now has had, in many instances, to travel considerable distances for hospital care.</P>
    <P>More than 20,000 of the accident and emergency attendances at St. James's Hospital come from areas which will be served by the new hospital at Tallaght.  This is greater than the existing accident and emergency attendances from the inner city areas at the Meath Hospital.  A similar situation exists with regard to out patient attendances. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that St. James's Hospital will be able to meet the acute needs of the adult population in the south inner city while paediatric services will be provided by both Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin and The Children's Hospital, Temple Street.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Eastern Health Board is providing a range of services for older people in the south inner city.  A 25 bed community nursing unit which has respite, extended care and day care facilities, is operating at Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital.  A 50 bed community nursing unit which provides similar services is located at the South Circular Road.  In addition, St. Monica's, a 40 bed long stay unit at Belvedere Place in the North Inner City, has now come on stream.  The Eastern Health Board is also developing proposals to provide secondary rehabilitation, extended care and day hospital facilities for older people living in the area.  It is intended to enhance the primary care services in the area in conjunction with the local GPs and other health care professionals. This will include the establishment of additional community ward teams.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is also involved in a major exercise mapping the geographical patterns of patient flows into accident and emergency departments, the purpose of which is to provide information and make recommendations on the requirements of the south inner city area for accident and emergency ambulance purposes.  The factors which determine levels of attendances at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict and it is likely that clearer patterns will emerge in the six to nine months following the new hospital's opening.  The shift in the pattern of accident and emergency attendances, including paediatric attendances, will be carefully monitored by the Eastern Health <Col N="721" /> Board and any subsequent recommendations will be fully considered in this Department.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I am satisfied that St. James's Hospital, in association with the other acute care providers in the city, will continue to meet the needs of the south inner city population following the opening of the hospital in Tallaght.</P>

      <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group has been set up by the health boards to examine a range of issues on orthodontic services including the 1985 guidelines.  This group, which includes health board consultant orthodontists, is due to report to the chief executive officers of the health boards in the near future.</P>
      <P>The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan for developments in orthodontic services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general ethical guidelines which apply to health care workers are drawn up by the appropriate regulatory bodies for each clinical discipline. In general they place an ethical and professional obligation on each health care worker not to engage in any behaviour which would put patients at risk.  In the case of clinical staff who are, or who have reason to believe that they may be HIV positive, there is an ethical obligation on them to seek appropriate professional advice and adhere to any advice given by their doctor as to the nature and extent of any clinical work they may undertake, i.e. not to undertake exposure prone procedures which might pose a risk of infecting a patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate this is a complex issue requiring a careful balance to be struck between the interests of patients and of the staff who treat them.  In 1997 the then Minister for Health established an Advisory Group on the Prevention of Transmission of Blood Borne Diseases <Col N="724" /> in the Health Care Setting to examine the scientific and medical evidence applicable to this problem.  A draft report completed by the group has be circulated for observations to interested parties.  When these submissions have been collated and studied I expect the final report of the group to be published.  I feel it would be more useful to avoid making any further comment in advance of publication of the report.</P>

      <P>I recently announced an initiative on cardiovascular health and cardiac services.  Included in this initiative is a provision for additional paediatric cardiac surgery capacity to be developed at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in association with the National Cardiac Unit at the Mater Hospital.  Up to 100 additional procedures for children will be provided.  This additional capacity will mean an increase of 40 per cent in this area.  The estimated revenue cost of this development is £2 million.</P>
      <P>The hospital authorities at Crumlin have welcomed this initiative and have stated they will continue to work with the Department of Health and Children to design and implement the details of the proposed package for paediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery.  These details will be the subject of discussion between my Department and the hospital's representatives during the coming weeks, to ensure the development of services will proceed as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of its approach to improving services for cardiac patients, the hospital has completed its brief to develop a plan for the provision of additional operating theatres.  This extra operating capacity will contribute significantly to the enhancement of cardiac services and the reduction of waiting times for surgery.  Following the examination of this brief by my Department's technical officers, it is my intention that the planning and construction process should be completed without delay.  The timescale for this process will be a matter for discussion between my Department and the hospital authorities. <Col N="730" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The strategy to provide acute hospital services is based on the principles of regional self-sufficiency; equity of access and the redressing of regional imbalances.  Towards implementing this strategy, a network of general and local hospitals is being developed throughout the country, which will enable the continuation of the provision of high quality hospital services for general medical and surgical facilities.  Part of this development is the establishment of improved, co-ordinated working arrangements between hospitals in individual health board areas, as a result of the rationalisation of the services, primarily through the establishment of joint departments and joint appointments, designed to respond to the acute hospital needs of local populations and to optimise the effectiveness of the resources allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The network of general and local hospitals is supplemented by larger regional hospitals and by a small number of highly specialised tertiary on <Col N="731" /> supra-regional units, serving much wider catchment areas.</P>
    <P>Significant investment has been made in recent years in the development of the acute hospital infrastructure and in the provision of specialities to meet local needs and I intend to continue with this development, with particular reference to regional self-sufficiency and equity of access. Toward this end, I will be investing an increased level of funding in capital developments in the health services over the next three years, a large proportion of which will go towards the development of acute hospitals.  I will also continue to implement the cancer strategy and will commence the implementation of the cardio-vascular strategy, both of which will result in the provision of critical services at local level, thus obviating the need for persons to travel long distances to receive treatment outside their regions.</P>
    <P>A recent OECD comparative study on health expenditure in Ireland found that hospital productivity here has increased significantly over the past 15 years and, in this context, average in-patient length of stay had reduced by 29 per cent, better management of resources has allowed the average bed occupancy rate to rise to 85 per cent and that the level of day-care treatment had almost quadrupled here since 1986.  As a result of the combination of these factors, the total number of cases treated in acute hospitals in Ireland has been rising by 3 per cent each year since 1987, emphasising the appropriateness of increasing overall levels of services in the sector, rather than focusing solely on bed numbers or number of hospitals.</P>
    <P>While the OECD report confirms that the acute hospital sector is managing well, I will continue to ensure that this productivity of the sector is optimised, that it continues to respond efficiently, effectively and equitably to the needs of the population and that it is resourced appropriately to provide high-quality hospital services, in meeting these objectives.</P>

      <P>Student nurses participating in the nursing registration-diploma programmes are not employees of the relevant health agency, and have student status only.  They are not paid a salary, but receive a package of financial supports including an annual maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>I recently approved a package of enhanced financial supports for student nurses participating in the nursing registration-diploma programmes, including a 20 per cent increase in their annual maintenance grant.  The total extra cost of these improved supports in 1998 alone is in the region of £1 million.</P>
      <P>Student nurses participating in the nursing diploma programmes receive a far higher level of financial support than other third level students. Each student nurse receives an annual maintenance grant of £3,000.  This grant is not subject to a means test.  In contrast, other third level students are required to satisfy a means test in order to qualify for a maintenance grant, the maximum rate of which is £1,624 per annum.</P>
      <P>Since the abolition of third level fees does not extend to the nursing diploma programmes, the student nurses' fees continue to be paid by the relevant health agency on their behalf The average annual fee is about £1,300.</P>
      <P>A book allowance of £200 and a uniform allowance of £120 is also provided for each student nurse commencing the diploma programme.  They are also entitled to receive free meals on a seven-day per week basis in designated restaurants in health institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new allowance of £20 per week was recently introduced to assist students undertaking external placements.  This is payable where it is necessary for the student to find accommodation for the duration of the placement.  Students undertaking <Col N="733" /> such placements who do not require accommodation receive a free weekly travel pass.  The average annual total value of these supports is some £6,000 per student nurse, which compares most favourably with the level of funding available to other third level students.</P>
    <P>The whole area of pre-registration nursing education and training, including the procedures for the recruitment of student nurses, is being examined by the Commission on Nursing.  It would be my firm intention to review the present arrangements in the light of the recommendations made by the commission in its final report, which is expected later this year.  The question of changing the criteria for entry to student nurse training will fall to be considered in the context of such a review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The hospital service has encountered problems in the provision of accident and emergency services over the past number of years.  This is not a phenomenon confined to Ireland but is a feature in other developed countries also.</P>
      <P>My Department has been funding a national public education campaign aimed at persuading people with minor ailments to go to their family doctor rather than a hospital accident and emergency department.  A considerable element of the overcrowding in accident and emergency departments could be relieved by diverting those cases which are neither accidents nor emergencies and which could be appropriately dealt with by a general practitioner.</P>
      <P>For patients who require admission to hospital, the shortage of sub-acute beds has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough, to cater for new patients seeking the services of the hospital.  This problem is linked to the ageing of our population.  Many elderly patients require acute hospital care initially but much of their recovery period could be spent in step down or sub-acute accommodation.</P>
      <P>Figures indicate that in the six Dublin accident and emergency hospitals a total of about 160 acute beds are occupied by elderly patients who have been medically assessed as being in need of long-term care and awaiting placement.</P>
      <P>In addition, about 90 beds are occupied by patients who have completed the acute phase of their hospital care and are awaiting placement at a level of care more appropriate to their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently approved an additional allocation of £2,250,000 to fund a wide range of measures aimed at tackling the problem on a number of <Col N="734" /> fronts.  There is the continuing need for public education regarding the appropriateness of attending the accident and emergency department. The advent of extra long-stay places should provide some relief to the bed situation in acute hospitals.  In this regard funding was specifically allocated for the following initiatives: 20 additional acute beds for three months at James Connolly Memorial Hospital at a cost of £300,000; 40 elderly places at St. Monica's Home at a cost of £600,000 and 20 day care-step-down places at Crinken Lane and Crooksling at a cost of £200,000.</P>
    <P>In addition, various staffing and organisational initiatives in the accident and emergency departments themselves are expected to contribute to a better service for patients requiring the services. These initiatives include the provision of triage nurses, new nurse practitioners and additional medical support.  The Eastern Health Board's steering group for Dublin accident and emergency services provides my Department with a weekly activity report.  Each of the Dublin hospitals provides the steering group with a weekly return of its accident and emergency activity.  This gives the group an overview of the situation throughout the city on a week to week basis, so that appropriate action can be agreed between the hospitals in order to relieve areas of particular pressure.</P>
    <P>My Department will keep the services under review, in consultation with the Eastern Health Board and the hospitals concerned, in order to assess the outcome of the various initiatives taken.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the restructuring of the Eastern Health Board will contribute further to the effectiveness of the approach to the &ldquo;continuity of care&rdquo; issues which affect the provision of acute hospital services at present.</P>

The Southern Health Board provided a section 65 grant of £10,000 to the Cork Marriage Counselling and Domestic Violence Project in 1997.  The Western Health Board provides nominal funding to Men Overcoming Violent Emotions (MOVE) for the publication of leaflets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board, which was published in March 1997, made six key recommendations and the following is the current position in relation to their implementation.</P>
      <P>Recommendation No. 1.  &mdash; BTSB Development Plan</P>
      <P>The BTSB's development plan details a major renewal, reorganisation and investment programme over the coming years.  Implementation of the key elements of the plan are progressing as a matter of priority.  As regards the construction of new national headquarters at St James's Hospital Dublin, detailed design plans were submitted to Dublin Corporation for planning permission which has now been granted.  Arrangements are now being made to commence site clearance and construction work.  In respect of the Cork centre, a capital investment programme is also being implemented.  A new information technology department has been established at the BTSB and a new software system is currently being implemented.  The Department is making approximately £2 million available to support the accelerated implementation of this new IT system. Significant new appointments have been made recently in the medical, scientific and technical, and quality assurance areas, and a quality assurance plan, together with an IT plan, have recently been submitted to the Department.</P>
      <P>Recommendation Nos. 2 and 3 &mdash; Monitoring of the BTSB by the Irish Medicines Board and the Reporting of Abnormal Reactions</P>
      <P>The Finlay tribunal report recommended that the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, should carry out more regular inspections of the BTSB and these arrangements have been put in place.  The report also recommended that the IMB would prepare an annual report for submission to me in relation to its inspections of the BTSB.  I received the first annual report on 8 April 1998.  A number of operational deficiencies were identified by the IMB during its inspections and these either have been or are currently being addressed by the BTSB as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>In addition, proposals to establish a national haemovigilance programme to build on the current reporting of serious adverse reports by effective, timely and reliable co-ordination and evaluation of reports from hospitals are almost completed.  I will shortly be establishing the National Blood User's Group, comprising a number of specialists with a particular interest in blood utilisation, to support the development of best transfusion practice in hospitals.</P>
      <P>Recommendation No. 4 &mdash; Blood Service Consumers' Council</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tribunal report recommended that a major contribution to the maintenance of public confidence <Col N="739" /> in the supply of blood and blood products could be made by the establishment of a blood service consumers' council.  My Department is currently finalising proposals on the role and function of this council having regard to the separate roles and functions of the Irish Medicines Board, the consultative council on hepatitis C and the proposed blood users' group.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 5 &mdash; Product Recall</P>
    <P>In relation to the recommendation concerning procedures for the recall of products, the BTSB has recently issued revised operating procedures to all hospitals covering the receipting, recall and tracing procedures for blood and blood products. The revised procedures were developed in consultation with the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    <P>The revised procedures are necessary to ensure that, should an occasion arise where the immediate withdrawal of a product is indicated, the hospitals concerned are in a position to locate all existing supplies of the product, and to establish which patients, if any, have received the products. The procedures require, <i>inter alia,</i> that each hospital designates one person and a nominated deputy to be responsible for the recall of blood components and blood products within his or her particular hospital.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 6 &mdash; Replacement of Blood or Blood Products</P>
    <P>The BTSB has arrangements in place, should the need arise, for the immediate replacement of blood components such as red cells, platelets and plasma.  As regards other blood products, the BTSB and the IMB are finalising arrangements for alternative supplies of licensed blood products. In addition, my Department is currently preparing legislation to provide a statutory framework for the supply and use of unlicensed products where such use is considered necessary by clinicians to meet the particular needs of individual patients in special circumstances.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he will take to reduce the long delays for people seeking birth, marriage and death certificates from the General Register Office at Joyce House, Dublin 2, as a result of which members of the public have to queue in the street for long periods; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the queues for services outside Joyce House have been considerable in recent times and I regret the inconvenience to the persons concerned.  As was indicated in the Adjournment Debate on Tuesday night, the administration of the registration system, including the services and facilities provided at Joyce House is statutorily a matter for an t-ard-chláraitheoir or registrar-general of births, deaths and marriages and for the superintendent registrar, Dublin and registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>There are two separate offices located at Joyce House, Lombard Street, Dublin 2 issuing certificates of births, deaths and marriages; the General Register Office and the above-mentioned superintendent registrar's office on the ground floor, which provides certificates for all births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages occurring within the Dublin city and county area.  This latter office in particular is currently experiencing a high level of demand for certificates which is the primary cause of the long queues outside the building and is also giving rise to delays in processing postal applications for certificates by that office.</P>
      <P>While the General Register Office is operating a normal service to personal callers, there is approximately a four week delay in responding to postal applications for certificates in relation to current events with a longer delay in respect of applications for entries in the registers prior to 1900.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures are being taken to improve the situation. The Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the superintendent registrar's office, has secured a lease on a premises adjoining the offices in Lombard Street. However, I understand that it will take some weeks to occupy and commission the new offices. Consultations are taking place between officials of my Department and health board management regarding additional staff required to develop an efficient customer oriented service, which will include facilities necessary to ensure the appropriate level of privacy to the public attending for the registration of events.  I understand that in the interim the board is taking immediate steps to improve staffing levels in the superintendent registrar's office within the constraints of the existing accommodation in order to redress the problem and to minimise delays.  These measures will considerably improve matters for the public attending at Joyce House. <Col N="741" /></P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the current average weekly charge in nursing homes in the Dublin region is £350; his views on the adequacy of the maximum subvention of £120 payable by health boards; the proposals, if any, he has to increase subventions to a more realistic level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 gives powers to the health boards to enforce high standards of accommodation and care in nursing homes.  The Act also introduced a new system of nursing home subventions so that dependent people most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.  The scheme is intended to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care but is not intended to meet the full costs involved.  The Act respects in full the private or voluntary ownership of nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Additional funding was made available by my Department in late 1997 to facilitate health boards in the implementation of nursing homes legislation, including the Nursing Homes (Subvention)(Amendment) Regulations, 1996. These regulations allow boards, <i>inter alia</i>, to pay an enhanced subvention in certain circumstances. I understand that as a result of this additional funding, the Eastern Health Board made available enhanced subventions to over 200 older people in private nursing home care whose financial resources had become depleted.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the recent improvements in the financing of the scheme be used for the optimum benefit of older people availing of private nursing home care and I have asked my Department to monitor the situation in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to increase the levels of subvention and this will be considered within the context of resources available to the health services.</P>

      <P>Last November, the Government approved, in principle, the establishment on a statutory basis of a national disability authority and a disability support service.  The Government also agreed to the formation by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, of an establishment group to prepare detailed proposals to be brought to Government within six months.</P>
      <P>The approval for the establishment of a disability support service is in line with the findings of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  The commission recommended the establishment of a disability support service, with a regional network to co-ordinate regional services and provide information, advice, support and advocacy to people with disabilities at local level in paragraph 4.3. It is envisaged that the role of the disability support service will include the provision of the type of support and information outlined by the Deputy for persons with disabilities, including those with a mental handicap.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental establishment group, which is chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is scheduled to report to Government during May 1998.

The association is currently fundraising for this clinic.  Beaumont Hospital's management has confirmed that it supports the establishment of this clinic.  However, it must fall to be considered within the context of the hospital's overall priorities, and the many competing development demands for its acute services. In this regard, the hospital's management <Col N="743" /> has indicated that such a clinic is not included in its priorities for development in 1998.</P>

      <P>The provision of services for persons with a mental handicap in the Dublin region is a matter, in the first instance, for the Eastern Health Board. The Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001 was published by my Department last year.  The assessment is based on information from the national intellectual disability database and sets out the level of unmet need and the changing pattern of need over the next few years.  As outlined in both Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness and An Action Plan for the Millennium, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services for persons with a mental handicap in line with the needs outlined in that assessment.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue and capital funding of £16 million was made available for services for persons with a mental handicap in 1998.  Revenue funding of £3 million was allocated to the Eastern Health Board region.  The precise services put in place with this funding are based on the priorities for service development identified by the Mental Handicap Central Planning Committee for the eastern region.  This committee includes representation from St Michael's House.</P>
      <P>Last December, I also announced the formation of a £30 million capital programme for mental handicap services which will run over four years in tandem with the Assessment of Need. This programme is essential to ensure the necessary physical infrastructure is in place to enable the new residential and day services to be provided.</P>

      <P>Since 1993 the child <Col N="745" /> care policy unit, in consultation with the eight health boards, has launched a major programme of developments in child care services.  An additional £50 million approximately in ongoing funding has been provided during this period and over 900 new posts for child care services have been created.  In 1998 the additional allocation to the Eastern Health Board was £5.129 million.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has experienced a 78 per cent increase in referrals of suspected child abuse between 1992 and 1996.  However, I wish to advise the Deputy that waiting lists are not an accurate measure of need.  They do not provide any systematic objective information about the nature of the cases.  Providing extra resources solely to reduce waiting lists, without any systematic reviews or system of prioritisation, does not achieve a more efficient management of resources.</P>

      <P>The Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1996, include provisions for the entry of paternity details in the register of births in respect of children born to parents not married to each other. As the Deputy may be aware, the Status of Children Act, 1987, amended section 7 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland), 1880, by the substitution of sections 7 and 7A.  These sections set out the procedures allowing for the registration of paternity details in such cases and included a provision for the registration of the father's details in the register of births on the joint application for registration by the parents or on the application by one or other parents with co-operation of the other parent.  They also provided for the registration of paternity details on the sole application of either the father or the mother of the child on the production of a certified copy of a court order naming the father of the child.</P>

      <P>Appropriate training for those working with drug misusers in their local communities is an essential component for the successful implementation of drug demand reduction policy.</P>
      <P>My Department has, for the past number of years, funded the diploma in addiction studies course in Trinity College, where both voluntary and statutory workers are provided with accredited training and skills in dealing with addiction.  Because of the demand for this course the number of people taken into it per annum has increased from 12 to 24 in the 1997-8 academic year.  The director of the course has also had discussions with the Eastern Health Board on how specialised training modules could be provided to drug workers employed by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> In the Eastern Health Board area direct funding has been provided by the board to a number of organisations, including Community Awareness of Drugs, EURAD, Urrús, Cáirde and Mater Dei which provide education and training modules on drug misuse, addiction and community responses.</P>
    <P>The national drugs strategy team, which is chaired by an official from my Department, is conscious of the need to provide training for drug workers in the community generally, and, in particular, to implement the various strategies which have been developed by the local drugs task forces to tackle the drugs problem in their areas.  The Government, on the recommendation of the national drugs strategy team, has allocated funding to allow a number of local task forces engage groups such as Urrús to provide addiction studies courses to community drug workers in their areas.</P>
    <P>Because of the priority attached towards providing adequate and appropriate training to drug workers, the national drugs strategy team has set up a subgroup to examine this issue as a matter of urgency.  The subgroup is examining a number of areas in relation to this matter, including funding and support for community based training bodies.  The team is hopeful that an early resolution to the matter will be found and that all groups providing appropriate training will continue to play a key role in providing local based training at community level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently established a review group on the waiting list initiative with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>To examine the underlying factors giving rise to waiting lists and waiting times and to make recommendations on the most appropriate means of addressing the underlying causes of substantial waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
      <P>The review should have particular regard to:</P>
      <P>&mdash; The net effect of the current waiting list initiative on waiting lists and waiting times;</P>
      <P>&mdash; Any incentive effects of the WLI on participating hospitals in relation to their activity and treatment schedules;</P>
      <P>&mdash; The extent to which hospitals can consistently and accurately validate their waiting lists; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" />&mdash; The adequacy of existing information systems to permit routine evaluation of the WLI.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the review is to identify the most appropriate means of building upon the present waiting list initiative so to meet the needs of public patients.  I have asked the review group to report to me by the end of June so that its recommendations can be taken into account for the Estimates process in 1999 and subsequent years.  The review group is holding its first meeting today.</P>
    <P>I have already taken a number of important steps to deal with waiting lists and waiting times pending completion of the review.  These steps include, first, much earlier notification to hospitals of the level of funding available to them. They received details of the funding in December, whereas in previous years the funding for waiting lists tended not to be allocated until around July.  Second, a requirement on hospitals to specify targets for waiting list activity during the year.  Third, an increased focus on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialities targeted for attention. Fourth, designation of an individual in each hospital to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work and as a contact point with the funding agency.</P>
    <P>In addition I increased the funding for waiting list work by 50 per cent this year, from £8 million in 1997 to £12 million in l998.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the increasing demands being placed upon hospitals.  One of the key issues that I expect the new review group to examine will be the capacity of existing hospital facilities around the country to meet the needs of patients, including those awaiting treatment under the waiting list initiative.</P>
    <P>St. James's Hospital, Dublin is currently running a pilot project under which the post of emergency nurse practitioner, ENP, has been introduced in the accident and emergency department. The project involves an appropriately trained nurse providing definitive care to a defined group of patients who attend the department.  The ENP can assess, diagnose, treat and refer or discharge patients, within strict pre-determined protocols, without reference to a medical practitioner.  The benefits of the pilot project include a reduction in waiting times for patients with a minor injury and the freeing up of medical staff for more serious cases.</P>

      <P>The system of pricing of medicines has been determined by means of successive agreements between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Irish Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.</P>
      <P>The current agreement which covers the period 1 August 1997 to 31 July 2002 includes the following elements.  It provides that the price to the wholesaler of any new item of medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted United Kingdom wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower.  It also provides for a price freeze for drugs and medicines for the duration of the agreement.</P>
      <P>Although anomalies in the price of some individual medicines may occur from time to time, I am satisfied the agreement in place with the industry ensures that the most modern medicine therapies are available to patients at reasonable prices.</P>

      <Quest>the reason no further action has been taken to stop the continuing unauthorised construction works at Fahan Creek, Lough Swilly, County Donegal, since the issue of a prohibitory notice on 8 April 1998.</Quest>

      <P>Figary Watersports Development Co.  Ltd (FWD) were granted a foreshore lease in April 1993.  The company proposed to construct a marina at the site but did not progress the project.</P>
      <P>Following a request from the company for a meeting, I met with the promoters on 26 February 1998, to discuss their problems.</P>
      <P>Following this meeting, the company commenced work on the project and were immediately requested to stop.  The company did not accede to this request or to a further request that work should stop so that a report could be prepared by a consultant structural engineer on the stability of the structures already erected. Accordingly, on 15/16 April 1998, Prohibitory Notices were served on the chief executive officer of FWD and on the contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> My principal concern relates to the break-waters the company have erected on the site which, according to the advice of the Department's engineers who have inspected the work, are structurally unsound and vulnerable to subsidence or collapse.</P>
    <P>While my approach throughout has been to seek to resolve this matter through dialogue, in light of the non-compliance with the prohibitory notices served on the developers on 15 and 16 April 1998, I commenced the necessary steps to initiate High Court proceedings to stop the unauthorised works.  However, earlier today at a meeting with officials of my Department, the company confirmed that all physical works on the marina have ceased.  Further discussions are planned for next week with company representatives on the question of making safe those physical works that have already been undertaken and on how the marina development should proceed.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy there is no basis to support nor evidence to suggest that livestock are affected by exposure to telephone masts.</P>
      <P>Considerable research has been carried out on the response of laboratory animals to radiofrequency emissions.  Exposure of farm animals &mdash; cattle, sheep and pigs &mdash; to electromagnetic fields has been the subject of major outdoor experiments carried out in the United States, Canada, and Sweden.  In Switzerland the health of cattle in the vicinity of a powerful short-wave radio transmitter was also studied.</P>
      <P>Except for a single unreplicated study, where mice genetically bred to develop cancer were exposed to fields several thousand times greater than the normal field level from a telephone mast, none of this work has shown that livestock or any other animals are affected by environmental exposures to telephone masts, radio or TV transmitters, radar or high-voltage powerlines.</P>

The vesting order dated 20 May 1969, a copy of which was sent to the allottee, specified that title to only one moiety was being transferred.  The allottee in accordance with the Land Acts was afforded an opportunity to query the vesting order, and as no objection was received within the statutory time period allowed, the vesting order was lodged in Land Registry to complete registration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>By re-instatement, I take it that the Deputy means special re-admission to employment outside of the normal open recruitment route.  No such special re-admission to the Civil Service is available to former civil servants, whether they resigned because of the marriage bar or for other reasons.  A scheme which had allowed for the re-admission in certain circumstances of former women civil servants who resigned on marriage was repealed in 1996.  The repeal was promoted by a Labour Court determination and legal advice that the scheme was in conflict with the equal treatment directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the scheme's repeal, the Government recognised the desirability of mitigating the effects of the repeal on those former civil servants who might have availed of the scheme had it continued to operate.  In this context it was decided to make special provision in the next two series of open clerical assistant and executive officer competitions for the creation of subpanels to be constituted entirely of former civil servants, without distinction as to gender or marital status.  One of these executive officer competitions is currently being held. <Col N="757" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the primary onus for dealing with year 2000 problems resides with the health agency concerned, my Department has taken a range of measures to address the year 2000 issue within the health services.  My Department's initial response to the problem was to make chief executive officers and management of all health agencies fully aware of the year 2000 issue.  My Department has organised information seminars in relation to the year 2000 issue generally, including the implications for medical devices. Further information seminars will also be held. My Department is producing guidelines for health agencies setting out a recommended approach to dealing with the year 2000 issue.  It is envisaged that these guidelines will be updated on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The first step for any agency in addressing the problem is to develop an in-depth inventory of services and equipment.  Agencies are required to identify each and every item of equipment in use and assess whether there are any year 2000 implications. Each item on the inventory is also assessed for its potential impact on patients or on service, thus producing a prioritised list.  Then any necessary remedial action is initiated.  This work is ongoing throughout the health service.  Senior managers in the health agencies are fully aware of the problem and will be working towards compliance well in advance of the due dates.  My Department is monitoring progress in the health agencies on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>As this is a unique situation, there are no fully tried and tested approaches to the problem. Health agencies are heavily dependent on suppliers of systems and equipment in relation to the year 2000 issue generally and particularly in the area of medical devices and equipment.  My Department's policy is to encourage a co-operative effort between health agencies wherever possible. In order to assist in minimising the duplication of effort on the part of health agencies, my Department is taking a lead role in identifying the most common suppliers of medical devices and equipment and approaching these suppliers regarding year 2000 compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> Government policy on this area is quite clear. The year 2000 issue should not have any adverse effects for clients or cause interruption to services which are provided to clients over the period of the coming of the new millennium.</P>

      <P>Policy on the development of services for older people is based on the report The Years Ahead which was published in 1988.  The report recommended that older people be maintained in dignity and independence at home with the support of the community care services where necessary and when this is no longer possible, that they have access to the best possible medical or long-term care.  I am continuing with the development of services for older people along the lines recommended in The Years Ahead report taking into account the recent review of the implementation of the recommendations of this report carried out by the National Council on Ageing and Older People. Additional resources have been made available both in 1997 and 1998 to provide new services for older people or to improve existing services such as specialist departments of medicine of old age attached to general hospitals; community nursing units which provide a wide range of services for older people including respite and day care; day hospitals and day centres, together with better staffing in existing extended care hospitals and in the community services in order to improve support for older people in their homes.</P>
      <P>Resources have also been provided this year to develop a specialist mental health service for older people, particularly in a number of health board areas where no such service existed up to now.  The National Council on Ageing and Older People has identified the need to develop better community support services for older people and I intend to give priority to the enhancement of these services as resources permit.</P>

      <P>To achieve equality regarding services for persons <Col N="759" /> with a mental handicap, it is necessary that service needs are identified, and plans for meeting those needs put in place.  Services must also be flexible enough to change as their clients' needs change.  To do this effectively accurate information is necessary on the numbers, locations and needs of those who require services.  Effective planning structures are also essential.  The national intellectual disability database is now providing the information required to plan for these service needs.  The regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee structure works at local level to co-ordinate service developments and identify priority needs.</P>
      <P>The Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, which was published by my Department last year based on information from the database, sets out the level of unmet need and the changing pattern of need over the next few years.  The assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential-respite places and 1,036 new day places over the period in question, at a revenue cost of £63.5 million.  There are also associated capital costs.  As outlined in both Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness and An Action Plan for the Millennium, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services to persons with a mental handicap in line with the needs outlined in that assessment.  A total of £16 million additional revenue and capital funding was made available in 1998.  Last December, I announced the formation of a £30 million capital programme for mental handicap services which will run over four years in tandem with the assessment of need.  This programme is essential to ensure that the necessary physical infrastructure is in place to enable the new residential and day services to be provided.</P>

      <P>Some limited research has been undertaken on the issue of child prostitution in Ireland.  The following are details of studies on the issue of which I am aware: &ldquo;Report of the Working Party on Children in Prostitution&rdquo;, Eastern Health Board 1997; Mid Western Health Board research study 1997-98; North Eastern Health Board study; &ldquo;Towards an investigation of prostitution among homeless boys in Ireland&rdquo;, John Leinster, Trinity College, Dublin, 1991; &ldquo;Street Children Report&rdquo;, Barnardo's, Dublin, 8 December 1996; &ldquo;Children on Inner City Streets in Dublin&rdquo;, Barnardo's Research 1997, and &ldquo; Prostitution in Waterford City &mdash; A <Col N="760" /> Contemporary Analysis&rdquo; (Niall McElwee and Kevin Lalor), 1997.</P>
      <P>Findings of the health board surveys are summarised as follows.  A survey published by the Eastern Health Board in September 1997 identified 47 children and ten young people aged 18 or over who were, or who had been, engaged in prostitution.  A strong link was found between homelessness and children who were engaged in prostitution.  The report also highlights the fact that the children who are engaged in prostitution are victims of child abuse and should be responded to as such.  The recommendations in the report form the basis of a programme of work on this issue for the Eastern Health Board for 1998.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1997 and in early 1998, a research study was undertaken by the Mid-Western Health Board investigating the nature and extent of prostitution in the region.  Specific attention was given to juveniles involved or vulnerable to becoming involved in prostitution or situations of exploitative sexual activity.  Up to 20 young people were identified as being involved or suspected of being involved.  Difficulties were experienced in collecting information because of the covert nature of this activity.  The report emphasises that in most cases it is unclear whether the activities can be termed &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; and within the confines of prostitution and sexual exploitation or whether they fall within the realms of consensual underage sexual activity.  The research suggests that involvement in prostitution adversely affects the young persons long-term social, psychological, sexual and emotional development.  The report will be presented to the next meeting of the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>An informal study carried out by community workers in the North Eastern Health Board area identified a problem in relation to the sexual exploitation of children in the Dundalk area.  The initial informal study identified a group of 12 young people as being at risk.  The board's staff are offering individual care services to the young people already identified and together with its voluntary partners are developing an early intervention and outreach project for young people who may be at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the need to provide outreach services including counselling, advice and practical assistance for children and young people who are identified as being involved in prostitution. As outlined above and in my reply to the Deputy on 4 March 1998, where problems are identified health boards have initiated a response.  I am also concerned that young people at risk are prevented from drifting into prostitution in the first place.  Existing neighbourhood youth projects, day projects for out of home young people, after school projects, after care services and child care and family support services all serve to reduce this risk. <Col N="761" /></P>

      <P>The issue of staffing levels is a matter for each individual health agency, subject to their approved staffing ceiling and financial allocation.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The nature and extent of the problem of homeless young people varies between health boards and between community care areas.  Due to the transient nature of the problem and the transient lifestyle of some young people it is difficult to estimate the number of homeless young people throughout Ireland. However, it is recognised that the problem is most acute in the Eastern Health board region. On average 12 young people per night present to the social work service operating outside normal office hours and the Eastern Health Board estimates that 400 young people are out of home in the region each year.  While on the streets these young people, who often have low self-esteem, <Col N="764" /> suffer social isolation and are at risk of involvement in petty crime, sexual exploitation, use/intimidation by criminals, child, drug and alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, and up to the end of 1997, an additional allocation of £43.5 million on an annualised basis has been invested in the development of child care and family support services including services for the young homeless.  A further £8 million has been made available for this purpose in 1998.</P>

      <P>Statistics on children in care are collected by means of a census survey. The latest date for which figures have been collated is 31 December 1996.  On this date, there were 3,668 children in care; 2,798 were in foster care or foster care with relatives, 587 were in residential care and 283 were in other forms of care. These other forms of care include children at home under supervision orders and children in boarding schools, supported lodgings, etc.</P>
      <P>Children in residential care can be placed either in centres run by a health board or centres run by other organisations.  Centres run by other organisations must be registered with the local health board and are subject to inspection by the health board under Part VIII of the Child Care Act, 1991, and accompanying regulations.  Statistics collated by the Department do not record whether children in residential care are placed in health board run centres or centres run by other organisations.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 104 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the particular research and studies referred to by the Deputy are not given.  However from a public health viewpoint I am aware of the importance of a clean environment and that environmental factors can be a contributory factor in ill health.</P>
      <P>A National Cancer Strategy was launched in 1996 and one of its objectives is to take all measures possible to reduce the incidence of cancer. The National Cancer Registry monitors the incidence and types of cancer occurring in the community and publishes detailed national data.</P>
      <P>Collection and analysis of cancer data is vital for epidemiological and research purposes and in trying to identify possible environmental factors that may contribute to causing cancer.  The National Cancer Registry has close working links with the European Network of Cancer Registries and with the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry.  There is some scope for development of cross-Border epidemiological studies.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, my Department in conjunction with other Departments and agencies is formulating a national environmental health action plan which will provide a strategic overview of environmental health.</P>

      <P>As details of the particular pesticides referred to by the Deputy are not given it is not possible to comment specifically on the matter raised.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the marketing and use of certain pesticides are prohibited because of the risks to human health and the environment associated with their use.  The Department of Agriculture and Food through its pesticide control service implement controls here under EU directives. The controls in place are designed to ensure that consumers are not exposed to harmful residues.</P>

      <P>Data on mortality are routinely published in the Annual and Quarterly Reports on Vital Statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office.  The most recent year for which complete figures are available is 1994 and a breakdown of the number of deaths from cancer in that year by type of cancer is set out in Table l. Table 2 provides details of deaths from selected cancers for 1996.  These figures are provisional as they are based on year of registration rather than year of occurrence.</P>

      <P>Road transport, due to fossil fuel consumption, is a significant source of air pollution.  In recent years increased vehicular traffic and fuel emissions are affecting ambient air quality in urban areas.  Clearly, poor air quality would adversely affect persons suffering with respiratory ailments. The monitoring of fuel emissions and ambient air quality is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have been kept fully informed in relation to difficulties being experienced at Naas General Hospital.  In 1997, the Eastern Health Board undertook the following initiatives to alleviate difficulties experienced at Naas General Hospital.  These included: the provision of a dedicated day ward, six beds, to enable the more efficient and effective use of in-patient beds; the provision of an observation unit adjacent to the A&amp;E with accommodation for up to 13 patients; the appointment of a bed manager to ensure the most effective use of the acute hospital bed resource; the creation of two additional consultant posts and two non-consultant hospital doctor positions to enhance medical cover at the hospital and the nursing staff complement of the hospital was increased by 13.</P>
      <P>The revised phase II development brief for Naas General Hospital has now been approved and incorporates a number of additional provisions as compared to the original proposal.  The construction cost limit of accommodating these changes to the phase II development brief is £18 million.  The detailed planning of this major new development is ongoing and I am assured by the Eastern Health Board that the work will continue to be progressed as quickly as possible.  I am confident that the completion of phase II of the hospital development will address all the problems currently being encountered.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 117 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the waiting list initiative commenced in <Col N="769" /> 1993, it has focused upon those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times have caused the greatest difficulty including orthopaedics and ophthalmology.  I have provided a total of £12 million to address hospital waiting lists in 1998. This brings to £70 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initiative commenced in 1993.  It represents a 50 per cent increase over the funding made available last year for waiting list work.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have reviewed the arrangements for application of waiting list funding and I have recently taken the following initiatives to improve the effectiveness of the system: where applicable, agencies have been notified in their determination of net expenditure for 1998 of the level of funding available to them for waiting list work. This will give agencies much earlier notice of the money available than in previous years and will enable them to plan their activity accordingly; each agency's service plan must now specify targets for waiting list activity during the year.  It will then be the responsibility of the chief executive offficer-hospital manager to ensure that the targets are achieved and to take corrective action if necessary as the year proceeds; agencies have been instructed to focus increasingly on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialties targeted for attention and where agencies have not already done so, they have been requested to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work within the agency and as a contact point with the Department.  I am confident that taken together, these measures offer the best means of reducing both waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    <P>In order to maximise the effectiveness of the waiting list initiative, I recently announced a review group consisting of clinicians and managers with the following terms of reference: the net effect of the current waiting list initiative on waiting lists and waiting times; any incentive effects of the WLI on participating hospitals in relation to their activity and treatment schedules; the extent to which hospitals can consistently and accurately validate their waiting lists; and the adequacy of existing information systems to permit routine evaluation of the WLI.</P>
    <P>I have asked the review group to report to me by the end of June so that its recommendations can be taken into account for the Estimates process in 1999 and subsequent years.  The review group is holding its first meeting today.</P>

      <P>Public patient waiting list statistics are collected by hospitals and furnished to my Department on <Col N="770" /> a quarterly basis.  At the end of December l997, the most recent period for which information is available, there were 1,150 patients awaiting cardiac by-pass surgery.  I will shortly be allocating funding under the l998 waiting list initiative, specifically for cardiac surgery patients.  I am confident that this will have a significant impact on the l998 waiting list figures.  However, at this stage I am not in a position to be definitive about year end figures, given the difficulty in predicting with accuracy how demand will evolve over the course of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the number of persons infected with hepatitis C through the administration in the State of blood and blood products.  The following statistics have been taken from figures supplied by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  These figures cover the period up to 15 April 1998.</P>
      <P>The national blood screening programme commenced in February 1994 for recipients of human immunoglobulin &mdash; anti-D, their children and partners.  Under this programme, 64,965 women were screened for hepatitis C. The number of women who have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies is 1,016.  Of these, 488 have tested positive for the hepatitis C virus.  The number of children screened under this programme is 1,838. Some 12 of these tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies, of which three are positive for the virus.  The number of partners screened under the programme is 528, three of whom tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies.  No partners have tested positive for the virus.</P>
      <P>The targeted lookback programme was commenced in October 1994 to identify persons who may have been infected with hepatitis C as a result of a transfusion, by tracing the past donations of donors identified with evidence of hepatitis C infection.  Under this programme, 394 living recipients have been traced some 260 of these have been tested, of whom 142 are antibody positive.  Of the 260 who were tested for hepatitis C antibodies, 220 were tested for the virus.  Some 92 of these are positive for the virus.</P>
      <P>The optional screening programme, which commenced in September 1995, to ensure that all recipients of blood transfusions and blood products who might possibly have become infected with hepatitis C through the receipt of transfusions or blood products were given the option of being tested free of charge.  To date, 14,270 people have been tested under this programme. Of these, 57 have tested antibody positive.  Some 36 of these 57 have tested positive for the virus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> Testing for hepatitis C became available on 1 October 1991.  Many haemophiliacs and kidney patients would have been screened for hepatitis C before the national blood screening programme was introduced in February 1994.  My Department has been informed by the Irish Haemophilia Society that 210 haemophiliacs have been infected with hepatitis C. The Irish Kidney Association has indicated to the Department that 50 kidney patients have been infected with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Despite the intensive campaigns to encourage recipients of human immunoglobulin, anti-D, who may have become infected with hepatitis C to come forward for testing, I understand that there is still a significant number who have not presented themselves, particularly from the group of women who received anti-D in the period 1991 to 1994.  The BTSB is aware of the necessity for follow-up of this group and is continuing its efforts in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question refers to the question of lung or heart and lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis patients.  The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, includes a commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland.  The detailed arrangements required to facilitate this new and complex service are being advanced as a priority by my Department.</P>
      <P>I recently announced as part of the launch of a National Strategy on Cardiovascular Health that the Mater Hospital, Dublin, has been designated as the surgical site for lung or heart-lung transplantation, in association with other key service providers and in particular St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, which is the national centre for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.</P>
      <P>Pending the establishment of an Irish based unit the immediate requirement is to examine whether the existing service being provided in the UK to Irish patients can be improved in any way. This issue has been progressed in discussions held with a number of transplant centres in the UK with a view to contracting work to a selected and proven centre.  Proposals for service, including the training of Irish surgical, medical, nursing and support staff in preparing for the establishment of an Irish programme, were invited from four centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals for service have now been received by my Department and are currently <Col N="772" /> being examined by a review group, comprising officials of my Department and key personnel from the Mater Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital as part of the transplant centre selection process.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of associated issues to be discussed with the UK Department of Health regarding site selection.  I anticipate that these discussions will be concluded in the near future.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a lung and heart-lung transplant programme is an extremely complex and difficult task.  A critical factor in the successful delivery of a quality transplant programme is whether the level of transplant activity in an established programme is sufficient to maintain the level of expertise required to achieve successful outcomes.  It is essential to have appropriately trained staff, suitable infrastructure and a multi disciplinary approach to ensure successful outcomes. A phased approach is therefore being adopted, recognising the need to build expertise and to create a programme that is viable in terms of the outcomes for patients, whether it be at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>In summary therefore, it is my view that a lung or heart-lung transplant programme should commence in Ireland when the necessary expertise has been developed, through a mentor relationship with the UK, to the point where we can guarantee results which are on a par with those achieved internationally.  In the interim, my Department is looking to improve the level of service by UK transplant centres to Irish patients.</P>

      <P>The BTSB currently tests for HIV, HTLV-1/2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis using standard validated methods.  The range of tests are as comprehensive as any in Europe and conform to existing international standards.</P>
      <P>My Department has approved the introduction by the BTSB of new technologies to improve the safety of the blood supply.  Specifically, the BTSB is proposing to introduce the following procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Methylene Blue technology is a method of virus inactivation of plasma for transfusion. Plasma carries a small residual risk of transmitting viral infections since it is not subjected to a virus inactivation process in the same way as li ="3"factor concentrates now are.  In recent years techniques have become available for producing plasma that has been subjected to a virus inactivation step.  Methylene Blue technology is one <Col N="773" /> such technique and is due to be introduced by the BTSB during the current year.</P>
    <P>Leucodepletion involves the removal of white blood cells from cellular blood components.  A substantial percentage of cellular components have been leucodepleted in the past for particular patients.  The proposal to introduce universal leucodepletion of all cellular blood components is seen as a potential major improvement in the safety of the blood supply in the face of the threat of new variant CJD, nvCJD.</P>
    <P>PCR testing, the generic term to describe genome amplification technology, shortens the window period for detection of newly-acquired virus infections The technology is the most sensitive way of detecting the presence of viruses in the blood of patients and of donors.</P>
    <P>The EU regulatory authority, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, CPMP, is planning to introduce a requirement that plasma for use in the preparation of blood products should be PCR tested with effect from 1 January 1999.  The BTSB is currently preparing for the introduction of PCR testing.</P>

      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of services, including the development of day services, residential and respite care services for people with a physical and sensory disability, over a five year period.</P>
      <P>An additional £8.4 million has been provided for these services in 1998.  Of this £2.4 million is for the elimination of underfunding of existing services, £3 million is for capital projects and £3 million is for the development of services.  Priorities for the allocation of the £3 million development funding will be decided by the health boards following consultation with the local co-ordinating committees.  The provision of additional respite and residential places will be considered in this context.</P>
      <P>The Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, which was published by my Department last year and is based on information from the National Intellectual Disability Database, sets out the level of unmet need and the changing pattern of need over the next few years.  The assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential-respite places and 1,036 new day places over the period in question, at a revenue cost of £63.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> There are also associated capital costs.  As outlined in both Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness and An Action Plan for the Millennium, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services to persons with a mental handicap in line with the needs outlined in that assessment.</P>
    <P>Some £16 million additional revenue and capital funding was made available in 1998.  Last December, I announced the formation of a £30 million capital programme for mental handicap services which will run over four years in tandem with the assessment of need.  This programme is essential to ensure that the necessary physical infrastructure is in place to enable the new residential, respite and day services to be provided. The regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee structure will continue to work at local level to co-ordinate service developments and identify priority needs for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the findings of the baseline study on concentrations of volatile organic compounds and PM 10 in Dublin City, undertaken under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-99 and published earlier this year by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  This is the first Irish study of its kind and covered a 13 month period from January 1996 to January 1997.</P>
      <P>The study showed some correlation between traffic volumes and PM 10 concentrations, and higher levels in winter than summer.  While levels of greater than 50 microgrammes, per cubic metre, ug/m³, were recorded at various sites on a number of occasions, the highest annual average value was 44 ug/m³ at College Green, US EPA maximum annual average recommended level is 50 microgrammes per cubic metre, ug/m³.  At present there is no statutory national or EU limit value for this pollutant; a proposal for a directive setting a limit value for, <i>inter alia,</i> PM 10, to be attained in the period 2005-10 is under consideration by the EU Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>The health effects of PM 10 and suspended particulate matter, depending on size and composition, are primarily linked to respiratory and cardiovascular illnessess rather than to any potential carcinogenicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to benzene, a known carcinogen, the EPA study determined the annual average value, over a 42 week measurement period, at 4.97 <Col N="775" /> ug/m³.  This indicates that average concentrations in Dublin are representative of a moderately polluted urban environment.  There are currently no mandatory national or EU air quality standards for benzene, and the European Commission is expected to propose a directive setting an air quality standard for this pollutant as part of the programme of subsidiary directives to be developed under the framework directive on ambient air quality.  The benzene content of petrol, 5 per cent by volume, is controlled under the European Communities (Lead Content of Petrol) Regulations, 1985.</P>
    <P>Measures to reduce PM 10 and VOC, including benzene, concentrations in Irish urban areas include compliance with EU vehicle emission standards, local traffic management strategies and other stationary source emission reduction measures such as the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal.  More stringent vehicle emission and fuel quality standards, including a significantly lower limit of permissible benzene in unleaded petrol, are being developed currently under the EU auto oil programme which is supported by Ireland as an appropriate means of addressing many of the environmental issues arising from vehicle emissions.</P>
    <P>Finally, I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 13 and 38 of 5 March l998 in relation to air quality management planning and the preparation of a comprehensive air quality management plan for the greater Dublin area.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> I am informed by the Garda authorities that while there has been an increase in recorded crimes for the Donegal Garda division in recent times the detection rate has risen significantly for the same period.  I further understand from them that in an effort to combat crime, preventative patrols are performed on a 24 hour basis in all districts, with extra patrols at weekends or on special occasions. Scheduled checkpoints are carried out on a regular basis with both uniform and Detective Branch personnel monitoring the movements of criminals and suspected criminals.  Furthermore, crime figures are monitored on an ongoing basis, with resources deployed as and where necessary to combat changing trends.</P>
