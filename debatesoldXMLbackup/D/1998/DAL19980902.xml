I understand that 12 amendments have been circulated <Col N="4" /> to individual spokespersons on the Opposition but not to the House as a whole.

    <Title>Omagh Tragedy: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a little over two weeks since the Omagh atrocity, since a street carnival was turned into a massacre, a ghastly relapse that joins and even surpasses the worst tragedies of the past 30 years.  Even in ten years or more the passage of time will have done little to heal what was made to happen at 3.10 p.m. on Saturday, 15 August.  As with previous outrages, survivors of the Omagh bombing years from now will still suffer from their injuries.  In many cases the bereaved will still be trying to come to terms with their loss; survivors and the bereaved will still be troubled by thoughts of what might have been, and all those who responded so bravely and with such humanity at the scene will be haunted at times by terrible images.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of Omagh I visited the town and later visited the hospital there where many of those who were so terribly injured were being cared for.  As we all know and witnessed on television, the heart of Omagh was devastated on that Saturday.  Many people will have to work long and hard to rebuild the shattered town. However, at the end of the day, Omagh will be rebuilt and once again become a vibrant and vital part of life in County Tyrone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be much harder to rebuild the shattered lives of those who were so cruelly made victims and who somehow survived.  There will be many hours of surgery and physiotherapy.  Many victims, with the help of dedicated caring professionals and their families, will be able to live full and valuable lives.  However, for some, full recovery may be well nigh impossible. <Col N="5" /> The attack on Omagh was not just an indiscriminate attack on democracy and the British-Irish Agreement.  It was a reckless attack on a community, on a people.  Those who died were Catholic and Protestant, young and old, men and women.  They were from the North and South and included visitors from abroad.</P>
    <P>That is the evil done by the self styled &ldquo;Real IRA&rdquo; at Omagh &mdash; death, pain, suffering, grief and horror &mdash; that will unfortunately echo down through the years.  Our first objective must be to do all within our power to prevent the recurrence of such an atrocity.  I am under no illusions, though, as to the continuing danger fanatics who remain at liberty can pose to the rest of society.</P>
    <P>The Government and people have already conveyed, by our words, prayers and silence, our heartfelt sympathy for the survivors of this outrage and for the relatives of the victims and their friends.  I say to the people of Omagh: a terrible wrong was done to you.  We will continue to grieve for you and support you in any way we can.  Our hearts go out to you now and in the future.</P>
    <P>Paradoxically, this evil act has brought forth an outpouring of goodness and solidarity, a community of emotions and convictions shared almost universally among people throughout this island.  Amidst the grief and pain, we have seen sincere and significant statements and actions that give hope for the future and which must be further built upon.</P>
    <P>However, it is important that we, the elected representatives of the people, should also make known our feelings in this House, the seat of our democracy and the Republic.  We in this House, not any small self-appointed elite who would blow their fellow humans to oblivion, are the democratic successors of the first Dáil, the custodians of the Declaration of Independence of 1919 and other founding Acts.  It is for us to determine how best we can act today in accordance with their spirit, and we will not allow the legitimacy of the Republic, which has no other form, to be usurped or challenged by anyone.</P>
    <P>What was done at Omagh was a very far cry from what the people of Ireland, North and South, voted for on 22 May 1998.  However, we know that the bomb was intended as a direct attack on the British-Irish Agreement and the operation of democracy.  The bombers and their political associates have sought to deny the hallowed right of the people to freely choose their own destiny.  The British-Irish Agreement is about dialogue, trust, compromise, peace and democracy.  The attack on Omagh was designed to undo all that by generating fear and hatred and more violence and by trying to force everything back into the melting pot.  It has abjectly failed.</P>
    <P>Many people worked long and hard over many years to bring us to the British-Irish Agreement. It has the support of the Irish and British Governments and the principal Nationalist, Unionist, Loyalist and Republican parties with one or two exceptions, some of whom may yet come to work <Col N="6" /> it.  It has the support of the United States and the international community.  Above all, 85 per cent of the people of Ireland, North and South, voted for it by referendum on 22 May this year.  This included up to 95 per cent of the nationalist population throughout the island.</P>
    <P>The so-called &ldquo;Real IRA&rdquo; cannot hope to take on the people of Ireland and win.  They have already disgraced themselves and the name they have misappropriated.  There is no community in Ireland that wishes to have them operating in their midst.  The INLA acknowledged in its ceasefire statement, which I welcome, that the new conditions created by the Agreement demand a ceasefire and that the onus on all is to ensure that the democratic wishes of the people are upheld.</P>
    <P>The House expects and demands that all remaining groups follow suit forthwith or face the consequences.  These people are about to learn a lesson that will teach them to respect the strength of Irish democracy.  The time for sophistry that provides a cover for murderous attacks on fellow Irish men and women is over.</P>
    <P>Those who organised and carried out this horrific act of violence have a stark choice.  They can heed the will of the people now and tell us, and convince us, that their violence is at an end for good, or they can defy us to put them out of business. If they do so, they should not be in any doubt about the Government's determination to crush and dismantle any organisations that still engage in violence, as I made clear prior to the Omagh bombing.  They should be in no doubt about our determination to do everything we can to assist in bringing the perpetrators of this terrible crime to justice.  We are determined that the people of this island, North and South, will enjoy the peace they democratically endorsed and that the victims of Omagh will have justice.</P>
    <P>At a meeting in August the Government decided on a security and legislative response to the challenge of the Omagh atrocity, a response that is extremely tough, even draconian, but that will stay in force only as long as we require it.  I am satisfied that in this response we are reflecting and expressing the will of the vast majority of the people on this island.  Following these statements the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will introduce the Second Stage of the Bill that contains our legislative proposals.  Following the Agreement we would much prefer to be going in the opposite direction, removing emergency legislation we do not strictly need.  In normal circumstances we would not ask the House to enact the legislation we are enacting with the utmost reluctance because of the need to protect the people from any other atrocities. No society wishes to introduce further restrictions on freedom without evident and demonstrable necessity and if such restrictions are to operate successfully it is essential they have strong public support.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor the Garda underestimated the potential threat posed by this new organisation formed last December.  Every effort was made <Col N="7" /> through a tough security counter strategy to dissuade it from continuing and to frustrate its operations in so far as we could from this side of the Border.  The Garda had considerable success and intercepted it on six occasions.  On five of them explosives were recovered that could have caused large-scale loss of life and/or major destruction. The Garda was also instrumental in preventing a bomb attack in London.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the office of the Attorney General had started to examine further steps that could be taken.  My predecessor in the last Government faced a somewhat similar threat during the breakdown of the IRA ceasefire. With renewed bomb attacks there was always the grave danger of a major tragedy that would have put any recovery of the peace process in extreme jeopardy.  In those admittedly different circumstances the response was mainly political, and I did not criticise that.  Because we live in a democracy tough new legislation has always to be a last resort.  Even today there are voices saying that such groups should be left to the effects of broader republican opinion, an opinion which so far unfortunately has not been able to prevent the emergence or operations of this lethal splinter group.  While not discounting moral suasion, it is the State that has the ultimate responsibility to act.</P>
    <P>The measures being brought forward are to be targeted solely at those who would engage in violence. They are time limited and will lapse once we can be sure that they are no longer necessary. We will monitor closely their implementation, with safeguards and checks and balances in the British-Irish Agreement also coming into effect.</P>
    <P>In the past no pure security response could have resolved a complex political problem that has divided people so deeply.  It is always necessary to assess the full implications of any security measures and it would never make sense to take measures that could exacerbate the security situation and ultimately cause more lives to be lost than would otherwise be the case.  What has changed is that we now have the British-Irish Agreement.  There is for the first time a broad democratic consensus on the way forward.  The great strength of the Agreement is that it means that extremists are considered to be only extremists. They have no legitimacy and can claim no authority, no basis of support in international law. They act for nobody but themselves.  By their actions they have condemned themselves to complete and total isolation.</P>
    <P>This year has brought us many truly historic moments but it has also brought us some of the most appalling and heartless atrocities of the past 30 years.  I recall the Quinn children.  The tragic loss of those three children and the way in which they died touched the hearts of everyone.  We in this House have not had the opportunity to offer our sympathy to the children's family and friends. I do so now.  We will do everything we can to end the bitter sectarianism and division that led to <Col N="8" /> their tragic loss.  All of us have come to a realisation of the human cost of conflict and the terrible price that has been paid for an unwillingness to find accommodation.  It is tragic that children died, in Omagh and Ballymoney, because of blind hatred.</P>
    <P>In remembering the victims of Omagh and Ballymoney I know that all the other victims over the past 30 years and their relatives and friends will have been recalling their own tragedies and heartbreak.  We have to confront a terrible legacy of violence and its effects.  I know the former Tánaiste, John Wilson, has begun his work in the Victims Commission but the Government is conscious of all the victims of violence.  All our energies and efforts are focused on trying to ensure there are no more victims, no more tragedies.</P>
    <P>This year we have come a long way in understanding ourselves and our history.  In this year of commemoration we have been engaged in a voyage of rediscovery of the true non-sectarian, humane founding vision of the United Irishmen.</P>
    <P>It was a forward looking, popular movement which aspired to a unity of people, drawing its strength from both North and South and from Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter and which stood four square behind the principles of democracy and pluralism, of equality and inclusion, despite the ensuing horrors of repression and rebellion.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement is based on many of those founding principles.  Irish history has provided us with many ideals, with many leaders and many visionaries.  They, in their time, applied themselves in many different ways to their ideals, often at great personal cost.  Idealism and vision today is also about building a new future.  It is about accommodation, equality and partnership, and about new trust and reconciliation.  It is about building a prosperous, inclusive Ireland that all of us would want to live in.  The leaders that we respect are those willing to work together to build a better future, not those who would drag us back into violence to destroy the real chance of history-making that we are engaged in in today's Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like today to make a special appeal to any young people who might be involved or thinking of becoming involved in violence: listen to the voice of the Irish people and ignore the siren voices of the depraved few who will ruin your lives while using you to do their dirty work. These people are about as far from idealism as it is possible to be.  They have no realistic objective. They have no support.  They have nothing to offer but violence and death.  They have no hope of success.  It may be that they are so used to violence that they cannot give it up, but you have that chance.  Take it before it is too late.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that a security response in isolation is not enough in dealing with the threat from extremists.  Following the attack on Omagh, I have had an intensive, sustained level of meetings with many of the political parties involved. These meetings and contacts were geared towards <Col N="9" /> responding to the Omagh atrocity and, as well as focusing on security matters, they focused in detail on the importance of implementing the Agreement in all its aspects.  We are all fully agreed on the critical need to maintain political momentum.</P>
    <P>The Irish and British Governments are working closely together.  We are at one as to what is required.  We will continue all our efforts, working closely with all of the parties involved to see this process through and to build a better future for everyone in these islands.  We will keep going on until we succeed.  That is the best tribute that we could pay to the victims of the Omagh bombing, and I know from talking to some of the survivors and people of Omagh that that is what they want.  God bless them in their humanity and give them and all the people of this land a fair wind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in expressing sympathy to the victims of Ballymoney, who were victims of blind hatred.  The victims of Omagh were not so much the victims of blind hatred as of perverted calculation.  The massacre at Omagh was the worst mass murder in modern Irish history.  It was committed by former members of the Provisional IRA now travelling under the banner of the Real IRA.  It represents a direct defiance of the expressed wishes of the Irish people, who voted overwhelmingly for the Good Friday Agreement.  The ex-Provisionals in the Real IRA do not believe that their war should be over.  They believe the war should continue. The purpose of this debate is to apply our best collective political analysis to ensuring Omagh and its like never happen again.  We owe it to those who died and to those who will live their lives in incessant pain to be realistic about facts and not to read into words meanings we would like them to have but which they do not have.</P>
      <P>The Provisional IRA said this week that if the objective conditions exist for violent conflict, then such conflict will occur.  That is a sad fact of history it claimed.  The Real IRA clearly believes the objective conditions for violent conflict still exist. Where does the Provisional IRA stand?  What the Sinn Féin leader, Gerry Adams, said yesterday should be read for what it actually said, not for what one might wish it had said.  I have believed for many months that the Unionists should meet Sinn Féin and advised them to do so.  Mr. Adams' statement is presumably designed to facilitate such a meeting and, in that, it is welcome.  Face to face dialogue is the only way forward, but dialogue should not be based on fudge or illusion.</P>
      <P>Gerry Adams said yesterday that the violence we have seen must be for all of us a thing of the past.  That is just a statement of a wish, not a statement of what the IRA will actually do in all circumstances.  Gerry Adams is saying that Sinn Féin wants peace, as does everyone else, but wants it on terms which are acceptable to it. There is nothing wrong with that, but it is not new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gerry Adams's statement yesterday has not <Col N="10" /> fully taken on board the fundamental change in the political context of republicanism caused by the endorsement of the people of the British-Irish Agreement.  That was an act of national self-determination which should be recognised as such by all republicans.  Furthermore, in matters of importance, statements of the IRA represent the authoritative position of the republican movement and supersede those of Sinn Féin which are more in the nature of political gloss designed to represent things in the best possible public relations light.</P>
    <P>The Provisional IRA said the referenda on the British-Irish Agreement do not constitute the exercise of self-determination by the people. Gerry Adams's statement yesterday did not address or alter that in any way.  Mitchell McLaughlin of Sinn Féin endorsed that IRA statement when it was made in April.  I will return to the significance of this continuing omission later.</P>
    <P>The Provisional IRA has also stated that the British-Irish Agreement clearly falls short of presenting a solid basis for a lasting settlement and said flatly again this week that there will be no decommissioning by the IRA.  Gerry Adams's statement yesterday did not alter that.  This week the IRA said it was conscious of growing concern at the slow pace of movement &mdash; whatever that means.  Gerry Adams's statement yesterday did not disagree with that somewhat disturbing statement by the IRA or qualify it in any way.  The appointment of Mr. McGuinness to liaise with the decommissioning body does not change the fundamental IRA policy on disarmament which was stated this week and, as Sinn Féin itself points out, it is the IRA which has the arms.</P>
    <P>The IRA statement of 30 April was part of a carefully nuanced republican strategy to allow the luxury of an each way bet on the British-Irish Agreement.  This each way bet strategy has created the political space in which the Real IRA can claim falsely a spurious sense of republican justification for bombing.  Whereas other political parties committed themselves unreservedly to the democratic path, the republican movement said as recently as this week that it will maintain its military capacity indefinitely.  The IRA said that whether the agreement transforms the situation depends on the will of the British Government. It seems to believe the British have some sort of moral duty to coerce Unionists into a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>While there have been welcome elements in recent IRA and Sinn Féin statements, the Provisional IRA has continued to use arguments which could be claimed by the Real IRA to show that the so-called objective conditions for violence still exist notwithstanding the agreement and the referendum.  Some well intentioned people like to believe that Sinn Féin and the IRA are two separate organisations and that we can assess the Sinn Féin peace strategy separately from that of the IRA and of what the IRA says.  That is nonsense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> At the top level, the direction of the two organisations is identical in philosophy purpose and execution &mdash; they are one and the same.  They are two organisations in one movement with one purpose, one strategy and one direction.  If the IRA says the British-Irish Agreement referendum was not a valid exercise in national self-determination, that is what the Sinn Féin leadership believes too.</P>
    <P>The peace process initiated by Gerry Adams had, up to the IRA statement of 30 April 1998, an internal logic and consistency.  There is now a continuing contradiction between the recent public statements of the Provisional IRA and the logic of the peace process initiated by Gerry Adams and John Hume.  It is a contradiction which allows a political space for the Omagh bombers.  Until that contradiction is resolved we will not have lasting peace.  Unless it is resolved, the republican movement will continue to spawn new splinters, all claiming the banner of national self-determination and all able to argue that their difference with the mainstream is one of tactics, not of principle.</P>
    <P>The core concept in the Hume-Adams approach to the peace process was that of Irish national self-determination.  Republicans claimed that self-determination had been denied whereas other Nationalists argued differently.</P>
    <P>The logic of the peace process was that republicans had to be given a new exercise in 32 county self-determination which would replace and transcend the 1918 election of December of that year. The republicans had claimed that the original Sinn Féin 1918 mandate was unfulfilled and then justified violence to fulfil that mandate.  This unfulfilled 1918 mandate had provided the ideological and internal logic of the IRA campaigns of the past 40 years.</P>
    <P>The aim of all-party talks, which Sinn Féin demanded and got, was that they should lead to such a new Act of 32 county self-determination to transcend 1918.</P>
    <P>The Hume-Adams document, prepared by Sinn Féin in June 1982, contained two key statements which Sinn Féin wanted the British and Irish Governments, respectively, to make.  These were that the British Government would say that it accepts the principle that the Irish people have the right collectively to self-determination, and the exercise of this right could take the form of agreed independent structures for the island as a whole, and then, in turn, that the Irish Government would say that it accepts that the democratic right of self-determination by the Irish people as a whole must be achieved and exercised with the agreement and consent of the people of Northern Ireland, must be consistent with justice and equality and respect the democratic and civil rights of both communities.  These were words drafted by Sinn Féin.</P>
    <P>These conditions, set out in Sinn Féin's draft of the Hume-Adams document for peace in Ireland, have now been met.  There is, therefore, no continuing <Col N="12" /> justification, in terms of the republican movement's declared principles, for either the maintenance of military capacity by the IRA or for the IRA to fail to say that its war is over.</P>
    <P>For the first time since 1918, on 22 May, all Irish people, men and women in all 32 counties, were given the chance to vote on a comprehensive proposal for the future of the island in which all parties on the island, including Sinn Féin, had had a hand.  By any definition that vote was an act of national self-determination.  It is criminally wrong for the IRA to deny that because its denial is providing an implicit justification for the Real IRA.  It is wrong for Sinn Féin to support or condone that continuing Provisional IRA position.</P>
    <P>As the leader of the second largest party on this island, representing half a million voters, I challenge the Provisional IRA and its political allies, Sinn Féin, one of whose members is here in this House, to say why it does not accept the referendum on the British-Irish Agreement as a valid exercise of national self-determination by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The 1998 referendum accords with all the requirements of historic republican ideology. Violence committed by republicans for political ends after the 1998 referendum result is of an entirely different character to violence committed beforehand in terms of republican ideology.  The British-Irish Agreement deprives all such violence of any semblance of republican mandate. Furthermore, let us not forget that the British-Irish Agreement contains the following words: &ldquo;All participants accordingly reaffirm their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The political wing of the IRA-Sinn Féin was one of those participants and yet the IRA said last April, and said again this week, that it will not disarm.  This refusal was not qualified by any words like &ldquo;at this time&rdquo;.  It was a bald and unequivocal refusal to disarm.</P>
    <P>The Irish people, in endorsing the British-Irish Agreement, have voted for the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations.  This is not some new precondition.  It is not a Unionist ploy or a Tory ruse.  It is part of the British-Irish Agreement, approved by the people of the 32 counties of Ireland in an act of national self-determination. No one is suggesting unconditional disarmament, but one is expecting a progressive political commitment to disarmament which will be followed through, step by step, with other aspects of the British-Irish deal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that Martin McGuinness has described the Omagh bombing as &ldquo;indefensible&rdquo;. However, as long as the IRA's own war cannot be said to be over, the republican movement is saying that there are still some unstated circumstances in which violence might actually be defensible.  That continuing ambiguity provides a moral cover for the Real IRA and for its activities at Omagh.  That ambiguity must now be removed by: first, a clear statement from both the IRA and <Col N="13" /> Sinn Féin that they accept the referendum on the British-Irish Agreement was a valid exercise in Irish national self-determination and that it transcends the 1918 election; second, in consequence of that referendum result, the IRA war is over; and, third, in consequence of that war being over, the IRA is prepared to disarm itself, provided the other terms of the Agreement are honoured by others on a step by step basis.</P>
    <P>The Government has so far declined to call on the IRA to make such a clear statement.  It engaged in surprisingly similar evasion to that of the IRA itself which said this week that it would not say the war is over because it would not &ldquo;waste time in word games&rdquo;.  An Irish Government spokesman, just before the Omagh bomb, said that the Government would not ask it to do so because it would not allow itself to return to what it called &ldquo;a linguistic quagmire&rdquo;.  What on earth does that mean?  Saying a war is over is not a word game or a quagmire.  Words are the only tools available to democratic politicians to convey meaning.  Today's emergency legislation is only a collection of words.  Words are important and their meaning is crucial.  The meaning of the statement &ldquo;the war is over&rdquo; is crucial and very simple.  Why will the IRA not say the war is over?  Why is the Government afraid to ask it to say so?  Why is the Government afraid of the answer it will get?</P>
    <P>This is no academic question.  It is a fundamental civil rights issue.  Under the Constitution, only bodies authorised by the Oireachtas are entitled to hold arms or maintain an army on our territory. This is fundamental to any known concept of civic republicanism; one army, one state and one democratic authority &mdash; the people.  That is republicanism as I understand it.  It is unthinkable that the Dáil would accept that a politician associated with a private army, which exists in defiance of the State's laws, should simultaneously sit at a Cabinet table in this or any other jurisdiction. The British-Irish Agreement solved the dilemma when it called for the disarmament of all paramilitary organisations and transcended the political ideology that made Omagh possible.  The people endorsed that.  Let us all now implement it in full and without equivocation.</P>

      <P>Many words have been spoken since the mass slaughter perpetrated by the so-called Real IRA in Omagh on 15 August. However, no words are more poignant, painful or moving than those spoken by the victims of that murderous atrocity.  The comments of Lawrence Rushe, whose wife, Libby, was murdered in the explosion, of Róisín Kelly, who survived the attack, and of Constable Wesley Reid, who worked amid the wreckage of the evil, are testament to the horror visited on the people of Omagh and of the whole island 17 days ago.  Sentences fail me when I try to articulate the pain and suffering endured by so many.  I would rather let the words of the victims of this atrocity speak for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> I take this opportunity to convey the heartfelt condolences of the Labour Party to the victims of the Omagh bombing.  For so long as I live I will never see a clock at 3.10 p.m. on a Saturday without recalling the sheer evil perpetrated on that day.</P>
    <P>The Omagh bombing has shaken the Irish people to the core.  Over the past 30 years we have seen many dark days.  However, there was something different about the Omagh atrocity. Other brutal attacks which scarred the recent history of this island occurred when Northern Ireland was in the grip of violence.  Violence dominated that society.  For many it seemed a permanent feature on the landscape, a cruel twist of history from which generations of Irish people would not escape.  However, over the past 30 years there have been people and political parties who have struggled to break the stranglehold of violence that gripped this island.  Thanks to the courage, tenacity and humanity of these people we are now beginning a new chapter in the history of this island.</P>
    <P>This new beginning started with the signing of the British-Irish Agreement which was massively endorsed by the overwhelming majority of people in referenda on both sides of the Border last May. For the first time in nearly three decades and in the living memory of thousands of young people, we can see a resolution to the old conflict which has gnawed away at the heart and soul of this island for too long.  In recent months, many people who had been too frightened to look over their shoulders have taken the brave step of glimpsing into the future.  It is a future which contains hope of a better life for themselves and their families.  The people resolved that nobody would take this opportunity away from them.</P>
    <P>However, one group of fanatics &mdash; those who bombed Omagh &mdash; are trying to steal this opportunity. At a time of so much hope for the future, the fact that a small band is determined to maim and murder in an attempt to condemn us forever to the horrors of the past has made the senseless carnage at Omagh so different and so much worse than that which has gone before.  Let there be no doubt regarding the intentions of the evil perpetrators of the Omagh bombing.  It was more than an attack on the people of a Tyrone town &mdash; it was an attack on a democratic society and the properly expressed will of the people.  In the words of John Hume it was an act of &ldquo;undiluted fascism.&rdquo; The Labour Party believes there is a moral and political duty on every democratic state to defend itself and its citizens against those who wish to destroy that democracy by violence.  We believe the Irish and British Governments have a responsibility to take forthright and effective measures to eradicate the forces of violence intent on wrecking the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Government is right to introduce a Bill to amend the Offences against the State Act and we broadly welcome the intention and detail of that Bill.  We do not believe it represents an <Col N="15" /> attack on civil liberties.  The people intent on attacking civil liberties are those who planned, assisted with and detonated the bomb in Omagh on 15 August.  These are the people who wish to abolish peoples' rights in order to feed their frenzied fantasies.  However, we will seek some changes to the Bill.  We will propose amendments in a constructive spirit which will improve the Bill in a number of areas.  I hope the Minister will consider our proposals in the spirit in which they are proposed.</P>
    <P>The Government's legislation will aid the Garda in its pursuit of a gang of terrorists responsible for the mass murder in Omagh.  This group of fanatical and violent thugs cannot be allowed to destroy the new Agreement.  The Real IRA which presents a grave threat to democracy must be pursued and brought to justice.  However, we cannot allow the images and the all too present memories of the Omagh bombing to deflect us from the real opportunity for peace that now exists.  The bombers of Omagh wish we would. They are intent on forcing people back into the pessimism and tragedy of the past.  They wish to wipe out the progress, long and tedious as it may have been, that has been made on this island in the past four years.  It is our duty as political leaders in this democratically elected assembly not to allow this to happen.  The men and women of violence cannot be allowed to dictate the political agenda of this island.</P>
    <P>Despite the tragedy that has visited us in the past fortnight we must look to the future and redouble our determination to ensure the popular will of the people, as expressed in the recent referenda, is realised and that just and lasting political structures emerge in Northern Ireland in the coming months.</P>
    <P>We are now entering one of the most delicate phases of the peace process.  The work of the assembly and the formation of the executive are critical moments in the emergence of true democracy in Northern Ireland.  The spirit of compromise and accommodation that was so critical in drafting the Agreement must come to the fore again.  Many participants in the new assembly are taking enormous risks to ensure this Agreement works and that it has the backing of their respective communities.  It is incumbent on all parties in the assembly to recognise this and to use whatever means are at their disposal to assist in fashioning a new political landscape.  This historic task cannot be undertaken within an atmosphere where violence or the threat of violence exists or is perceived to exist.</P>
    <P>Given the result of the referenda there can be no ambiguity in any quarter regarding the use of violence for political objectives.  The old and invalid justification for armed struggle traditionally espoused by the republican movement has, at long last, been consigned to the pages of history by the result of the referenda which took place on 22 May this year.</P>
    <P>It is time the republican movement publicly <Col N="16" /> recognised this fact and the logic that flows from it.  Sinn Féin and the IRA must categorically renounce violence as a political means and expressly and emphatically commit themselves, their members and their organisation to peaceful democratic politics.</P>

      <P>The revulsion and rejection of violence by the people of this State is total.  Anybody who stood anywhere at 3.10 p.m. on the Saturday following 15 August knows just how total that revulsion is.  The republican movement can no longer remain deaf to the voice of the people and it must take the bold and imaginative steps that it is quick to call for from others.  It has a responsibility to move as well.  This development would provide a critical impetus to the momentum developing within the new Northern Ireland Assembly.  For a start, it would facilitate the establishment of a cross-community executive that could begin the difficult task of reconstructing politics in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>It will also ensure the entire Nationalist community in Northern Ireland is effectively represented in the new executive.  This inclusiveness and engagement in the emerging political structures is, frankly, essential for the future of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>I have spent much of my contribution looking forward to the developing political situation. Given the horror at Omagh, many people on the island may find this a difficult task at present. However, we cannot allow the depraved acts of a small group of fanatics rob us of all our hopes for the future.  It was clear on the airwaves and streets after the Omagh attack that this atrocity if anything strengthened the people's resolve to rid ourselves of the curse of violence and make the British-Irish Agreement work.</P>
      <P>We must take from this expression of popular feeling and use the Agreement to construct a fair and just future for everybody on the island.  The future must be free from the horrific violence of the past 30 years which has become the norm for over half of those living on the island, half the population being under 30 years of age.  It must be a society in which the unspeakable terror of Omagh can have no place.  It will be a society where the forces of fascism, determined to undo the democratic wishes of the citizens of the State, can find no hiding place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 15 August the people on the island were cruelly and brutally reminded of the mayhem from which we have slowly emerged over the past four years.  The anguish and suffering of the victims of the Omagh bombing will haunt many <Col N="17" /> people's lives for years to come.  We owe it to those murdered and maimed in Omagh to work tirelessly to ensure political violence of any kind is never again perpetrated on the island.  This work involves dedication, commitment and bravery. We will be presented with stark choices along the way and we must have the courage to make those choices however hard they may be.</P>
    <P>The legislation which will come before the House is such a stark choice.  I am aware that many people have serious reservations regarding aspects of it.  I understand their concerns and do not doubt their motives in any respect.  However, in the struggle to fashion a new society on the island we must be prepared to make hard choices which will protect the emerging political solution from the dark forces of terrorism.</P>
    <P>I again extend the deeply felt condolences of the Labour Party to the families, friends, colleagues and victims of the Omagh bombing.  Their immense pain and grief may not be eased by our presence here today, but I hope they can take some comfort from the contributions to this debate.</P>
    <P>I ask those who are determined to wreck our precious peace Agreement and who still cling to the twisted adherence to violence to dwell on a poem by Maya Angelou which reads:</P>
    <P>But seek no haven in my shadow,</P>
    <P>I will give you no hiding place down here,</P>
    <P>You.have crouched too long in the bruising darkness,</P>
    <P>Have lain too long face down in ignorance,</P>
    <P>Your mouths spilling words, armed for slaughter.</P>

      <P>The Omagh bombing was so manifestly evil, so grievous in its human consequences and so crudely obvious in its timing and intention that it presents us all with a challenge of unique urgency and importance.</P>
      <P>It was the work of a tiny perverted minority who reject the British-Irish Agreement.  Second only to the grotesque, immediate and continuing human misery caused, the cruellest aspect of the bombing was that it sought to eclipse the hope which flowed from the Agreement and threatened a return to the abyss of the previous 30 years.  It was as though the demon of violence, which we thought dead, was revived in all its horror.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many words of condemnation and revulsion have been uttered since that fateful moment in Omagh at 3.10 p.m. on Saturday, 15 August 1998. All those words will ring hollow to the relatives and friends of the Omagh victims and to the body politic of the democratic world unless the most powerful force of the law is unleashed against the perpetrators, sympathisers and fellow travellers of the self-styled murderous Real IRA and their ilk.  Just over three months ago, we submitted for the decision of the people of Ireland, North and South, very specific and far-reaching proposals aimed at ending the soul destroying, life blighting <Col N="18" /> violence which has marred our history and our lives for so long.  The people on this island endorsed the measures, some of them understandably distasteful to some, deemed necessary for the advancement of the peace process.</P>
    <P>That momentous assent, which involved recasting the very fundamentals of our Constitution, our collective self-image, and equally huge adjustments in the position of others, was given in great seriousness and with great hope.  It was an extraordinary effort for peace, reflecting the agreement of people of very diverse opinions that a lifeline out of our historic enmities had to be found and grasped.  In reality it was the achievement not so much of this Government or its counterpart, or of the Northern politicians who strove so mightily for it, but of this generation.  It is historic in the hope it offers.</P>
    <P>In the measures before the House later today, the Government is concerned to address its first clear political duty, that is to endeavour to bring to justice the perpetrators of this deed and to prevent the perpetration of another Omagh. These measures are in some respects harsh and draconian because they are designed to prevent something infinitely harsher.  They are based upon accepted civil and legal rights and procedures in order to enforce the rule of law and the right to life.  This right is under threat, as the events in Omagh proved all too graphically, from a tiny splinter group which is answerable to no one and which cares about no one.  That group is unaffected by the dictates of morality and by the unambiguous desire for peace among the people of this island.  Its members are crazed, deluded people full of perverted arrogance, which allows them to perpetrate mass murder without compunction. The words of Macbeth so aptly describe the Omagh bombers: &ldquo;I am, in blood, stepped in so far that should I wade no more, returning were as tedious as to go o'er.&rdquo; This group possesses the means to commit further murder and mayhem. It is against that background that the present measures become necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government has a clear duty to take extraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary threat to life and to the peace process which the people have so recently endorsed.  We do not underestimate the far-reaching nature of the interference with the ordinary process of law. Even the law so altered, however, stands in stark contrast to the random summary execution of 28 people by the nameless thugs against whom these measures are directed.</P>
    <P>These measures will affect only a small number of people.  Those so affected will receive a public trial, before an independent court, with a presumption of innocence and a judiciary properly concerned to apply the law in a dispassionate and even-handed manner.  They will have every opportunity to explain their position and dispute the evidence against them.  The modifications to the law of evidence under which they will be tried will have been enacted by the democratically elected Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> Those who have reservation as to the operation of the new laws will have the opportunity to analyse them as they are publicly administered and to raise any criticism they think appropriate. Everything which is proposed has been found necessary on the advice of those charged with providing fundamental security in the State and has been framed with the most careful legal advice.</P>
    <P>The nameless killers against whom these measures are directed, and those who directed or assisted them, claim to act on a republican principle which they think allows them to carry on a so-called war.  This principle is a perversion of the republican ideal.  The true ideal is that endorsed by the people, who have spoken so strongly and in overwhelming numbers against the dictatorship of the tiny, crazed, isolated group of evil zealots who placed the bomb.</P>
    <P>The people are the sole source of authority in this Republic.  All authority is expressed by and under the Constitution which, in the words of its preamble, the people &ldquo;gave to themselves&rdquo;.  That Constitution, and its recent amendment as reiterated, clearly requires an exclusively peaceful national policy and respect for the mandate of the people and for the position of the majority in Northern Ireland.  That is the constitutional essence of this Republic.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's statement by Mr. Gerry Adams, President of Sinn Féin, is highly significant.  It is groundbreaking for the republican movement and will, in time, be seen as a milestone in the evolution of the peace process.  As Senator Maurice Hayes pointed out this morning, it is a quantum leap for republicans and it would be churlish of us not to accept that the statement effectively says the war is over.</P>
    <P>The attitude and intent demonstrated in the statement opens up new possibilities for dialogue and political progress.  The key now must be for all of the main players to get down to the real business of making the British-Irish Agreement work.  The words of the Agreement must now become a political reality.  Full implementation of all aspects of the Agreement will make a vital difference to the lives of all the people of this island, particularly those in Northern Ireland.  It is not an <i>a la carte</i> Agreement; we cannot choose the things we like and abandon the things we dislike. Decommissioning is as fundamental to the Agreement as the release of prisoners.</P>
    <P>There is no room in this society for those who follow a perverted ideology so often and so recently rejected by the people.  The Omagh bomb was an evil rejection of the people expressed in the blood of innocents.  It is for that reason these measures and others, if necessary, are required.  The sovereignty of the people must now be acknowledged by those who, in the past, have given support to the men of violence.  The present proposals convert this moral imperative into a legal duty in the measures against the withholding <Col N="20" /> of information and the use of lands or premises to store the materials of murder.  Without such support, the killers could not function.</P>
    <P>The proposals, in targeting those who direct terrorism and murder without necessarily themselves participating directly in it, are targeting the godfathers of terrorism.  The members of this repugnant group must realise they cannot bask in legal immunity because they were far away when their evil schemes were put into effect by others. Those involved must now take on board the stark fact that their liberty and property may be forfeited if they act as the pawns or acolytes of killers.</P>
    <P>The Omagh outrage challenges us all to demonstrate the conviction between our words on Good Friday and their later constitutional endorsement.  We expect that others in Britain and Northern Ireland will stand firmly behind their words on that occasion and implement them.  It is by reciprocate action on those undertakings that the peace process will move from stage to stage and strengthen itself in so doing.</P>
    <P>The timing of the Omagh bomb makes its intention crudely obvious.  That intention was the destruction of the peace process and the repudiation of the principle of consent which underpinned it.  If the bombers were to succeed in this, the will of the people would be utterly frustrated and, inevitably, arrogant, fascist violence would claim further victims.</P>
    <P>Like the murder of the Quinn children in July, the Omagh bombing has attracted such heartfelt condemnation from every quarter as to raise real hope that, after so many unspeakable acts, we are indeed at a watershed in the evolution of our society, North and South.  I believe that we are, and that the Agreement and all that has flowed from it is a development of historic proportions, central to the peace and prosperity of this island. It is the Government's determination that the process will not, and cannot, be imperilled by murderous actions from any quarter.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach and others in conveying my condolences to the families of the three children who died so appallingly as a result of a sectarian attack.  I also join the Taoiseach in his call to young people, in particular, who may have joined or be considering joining groups such as the Real IRA, to think twice and consider the type of Ireland which would be created by events such as the Omagh atrocity.  What kind of united Ireland would that be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Words are the lifeblood of politics.  We rely on words to promote our parties, sell our policies and generally transmit our messages in the most coherent manner.  There have been a number of occasions during the past 30 years of conflict when events have been so awful as to render the human vocabulary inadequate to describe the horror of what happened.  Atrocities such as McGurk's Bar, Le Mons, The Droppin Well, Enniskillen, Greysteele and, more recently, the <Col N="21" /> murder of the three Quinn children in Ballymoney have all been etched on our minds, but rarely has there been anything to match the sheer awfulness of what occurred in Omagh on 15 August.</P>
    <P>The horror of what happened in Omagh is merely intensified by the hope that we had all felt following the conclusion of the British-Irish Agreement that acts like this had become a thing of the past.  In 30 years of violence no community has suffered carnage on a similar scale to that unleashed on the people of Omagh.  It was an act of vile and horrific mass murder that cut a swathe of destruction and devastation through hundreds of innocent people about their lawful business in a town centre on a summer afternoon.  The bomb was totally indiscriminate in the victims it took, murdering and maiming young and old, men and women, Catholic and Protestant, descendants of both planter and Gael, citizens of both the Republic and of Northern Ireland and visitors from abroad.</P>
    <P>It is entirely appropriate that the first thing this House should do on reassembling for this short session is to convey our sympathy and solidarity to the victims of Omagh, the families of those who died and the injured and maimed, many of whom remain in hospital and who will have to live with the physical consequences of this terrible deed for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>If there was one beacon of hope in the awful blackness following the bombing it was the sheer dignity and human decency of the people of Omagh and Buncrana.  The bravery and courage shown by many people in the immediate aftermath of the bomb, the immense dignity of the bereaved through what seemed like a never ending sequence of heartbreaking funerals was a source of hope for many throughout the island who were brought to the brink of despair by this evil deed.</P>
    <P>Words may convey some degree of comfort but they are not enough.  We must show our solidarity with the victims of Omagh in a concrete way by taking every possible step to dismantle the organisation responsible and to bring to justice those who had any hand, act or part in this deed.  We must ensure by political and policing action that there will be no more atrocities such as that which occurred at Omagh.</P>
    <P>The Government should also look at the possibility of making a substantial financial donation to aid the injured and the relatives of the dead and to assist in the rebuilding of the town centre. Of course money cannot compensate people for the loss of a loved one or for the terrible injuries inflicted by this bomb but extra resources will be required to help the survivors deal with the trauma of this terrible crime.</P>
    <P>Since the Omagh bombing the people of the Republic have shared the pain of the people of Northern Ireland.  It is now appropriate for the Republic to demonstrate our solidarity by sharing in the costs of the aftermath of Omagh.  There is at least one precedent for this in the past two <Col N="22" /> years.  The Government made a substantial contribution to the cost of rebuilding the Linenhall Library in Belfast following a firebomb attack by the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>In our anxiety to condemn the Omagh bombers we must be careful not to fall into the trap of offering <i>post facto</i> justification to some of the terrible atrocities that went before.  Some commentators &mdash; including Sinn Féin representatives &mdash; have gone close to suggesting that the Omagh bombing was to be condemned because it happened after the British-Irish Agreement.  No act of terrorism over the past 30 yeas, carried out in the North or elsewhere, on behalf of paramilitary groups on this island were justified and all are to be equally condemned.</P>
    <P>The cynical statement issued by the self-styled Real IRA accepting responsibility for the Omagh bombing echoed similar statements issued by other paramilitary groups, particularly the Provisional IRA, in the aftermath of previous similar outrages with its talk of commercial targets, war against the British and pathetic attempts to blame the authorities for failing to deal with inadequate and inaccurate bomb warnings.  Whether those who planted the bomb intended to take life on the scale that happened is immaterial to their culpability for the consequences of their actions. This organisation has been responsible for a series of similar car bombs in busy towns and devastation on this scale was inevitable at some time. The objective of terrorism is to put people in terror of their lives.</P>
    <P>The statement subsequently issued by the Real IRA in which it claimed to be suspending military operations has to be treated with a considerable degree of caution, especially in the light of the cynical and dishonest statement issued only hours earlier by the same organisation on the circumstances of the Omagh massacre.</P>
    <P>It is unclear whether this is a coherent organisation with a distinct leadership that is in control and capable of controlling its members.  Our concern must be increased by hints from some members of the Real IRA and its sister movement, the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, that a statement announcing a total ceasefire was imminent but no such statement has yet appeared.  A statement of complete and unconditional cessation of violence on behalf of this small but vicious group of people would be a welcome development, but is one which will come too late for the victims of the Omagh bombing.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the search for those responsible must be continued and concluded with urgency.  There must be no question of allowing any of those responsible to benefit from any of the terms of the British-Irish Agreement, which the Omagh bomb was clearly designed to destroy. In the aftermath of the Omagh bombing, it was clearly necessary for the Government to review the legislative and security procedures available to the State to fight terrorism.  The State has the right to take all appropriate action to protect its citizens from terrorist attack.  It has a particular <Col N="23" /> obligation to act when its territory may be used to launch murderous attacks on citizens in a neighbouring jurisdiction.  My colleague, Deputy McManus, will deal with the additional powers sought by the Government in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill in the debate later today.</P>
    <P>I will comment on the principles which will govern the approach of Democratic Left.  First, it is undesirable and potentially dangerous that a package of measures which has rightly been described by the Minister for Justice as &ldquo;draconian&rdquo; should be rushed through the Dáil in 12 hours, less than two days after most Deputies have seen the Bill.  The experience in the past has been that rushed legislation has turned out to be flawed legislation.</P>
    <P>Second, it is important that extraordinary police powers which may be regarded as necessary at particular times to deal with a specific terrorist threat, are not allowed to become a permanent feature of our legal code.  The Government's proposal that these new measures should be allowed to run for two and a half years is excessive and we will seek an earlier review.</P>
    <P>Third, such extraordinary powers need to be accompanied by measures to afford increased protection to innocent people who, for whatever reason, may find themselves caught up in events which result in them being taken into custody. Experience here and in the UK has shown that innocent people end up in custody and are wrongly convicted.  We will table a series of amendments which will seek to counterbalance the additional powers given to the Garda, with additional safeguards to protect the interests of the innocent.</P>
    <P>Of equal, if not greater, importance is the political response to the Omagh bombing.  Political opinion ranging from that of David Trimble to that of Gerry Adams has described the Omagh bombing as an attack on the British-Irish Agreement, a view which I share.  In these circumstances it is vital that those who are committed to the British-Irish Agreement do everything possible to consolidate it and build on the principles of consent and co-operation enshrined in it.  This requires additional movement on all sides.  It was predictably depressing to see the opportunism with which some anti-Agreement unionists tried to use the Omagh bombing as a stick with which to beat David Trimble.  Equally depressing was the <i>An Phoblacht</i> interview with a representative of the IRA leadership and its rigid and inflexible position on decommissioning and the anachronistic use of terms such as the &ldquo;occupied counties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I previously acknowledged the positive role played by leaders of Sinn Féin in the all-party talks which culminated in the British-Irish Agreement. It must also be acknowledged that, with the exception of punishment attacks, which must cease, the renewed IRA ceasefire has been solid in recent months.  I welcome the prompt and <Col N="24" /> unprecedented condemnation of the Omagh attack by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness.</P>
    <P>However, the republican movement, as a party to the British-Irish Agreement, has a particular obligation to face up to its responsibilities after the Omagh bombing.  We do not know if the explosives and detonator used in Omagh were originally from the arsenal of the Provisional IRA.  However, we can say with a fair degree of certainty that the technical skill and expertise of those who carried out the bombing was almost certainly acquired within the Provisional IRA, and from those who may well be in leadership positions in that organisation.</P>
    <P>Nobody can be surprised that the Omagh bombing has increased the genuine concerns that many people in Northern Ireland have about the continued existence of huge arsenals of weapons and explosives.  It is essential that all paramilitaries should now demonstrate they are prepared in the immediate future to comply with the spirit, as well as the letter, of the British-Irish Agreement on this issue.</P>
    <P>Similarly, a clear and unequivocal message is required from all sections of the republican movement that the campaign of violence is over for good and it is committed to seeking political change by peaceful and democratic means alone. This is not, as the IRA spokesman quoted in <i>An Phoblacht</i> would have us believe, word games.  It is an issue of fundamental principle.  People will reasonably ask: &ldquo;if they will not say it, does it mean they do not believe it?  &rdquo; They will wonder if the unwillingness on the part of the IRA to say the war is over is due to the IRA's realisation that the logical question which will follow is: if the war is over, why does the IRA need to retain its weapons of destruction?</P>

      <P>In the context of this ongoing debate, I welcome yesterday's statement by the President of Sinn Féin, Mr. Adams.  While it falls short of the unequivocal terms I would have preferred, it represents a step forward and marks the most significant rejection of violence yet expressed by any leader of the Republican movement.  What is of concern is the contrast in tone and content between the statement of Mr. Adams and the interview with the IRA representative in <i>An Phoblacht.</i>  A clear statement from the leadership of the IRA that it shares the analysis <Col N="25" /> and sentiments of Mr. Adams would be a catalyst for political progress.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement can only work if it is clear that all parties and, in relevant cases, their associate paramilitary groups have put violence firmly and irrevocably behind them.  The paramilitary organisations have been the principal beneficiaries so far of the agreement.  A substantial number of prisoners have been released in this jurisdiction and shortly the prison gates in Northern Ireland will be thrown open to facilitate the early release of hundreds of prisoners who were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for what were often vile and vicious crimes.  Civilised society has been generous and has taken a great leap of faith in agreeing to these early releases.  It is now payback time for the paramilitaries.  It is time for the Government to exert more pressure on the Republican movement to show a spirit of compromise with regard to the decommissioning of weapons.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the leader of the Unionist Party, Mr. Trimble, in his capacity as First Minister, has invited Sinn Féin to a meeting next week and I hope it will be followed by an early face to face meeting between Mr. Trimble and Mr. Adams.  The peace process has been built on a series of small steps rather than dramatic leaps forward.  Movement on one side must be met with a proportionate reciprocal response by others.  The imminent visit of President Clinton to Northern Ireland appears to have provided a catalyst to move matters forward and I hope further progress will be made in the next few days.</P>
      <P>The people of Northern Ireland cannot rely on others to resolve their problems.  The primary onus is on their political representatives.  They must redouble their efforts to find a way around potential obstacles to the establishment of the Executive and to pave the way for the full implementation of the provisions of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <P>Bhí mise as baile nuair a tharla an dúnmharú déisteanach san Omaigh ar 15 Lúnasa. Déanta na fírinne, bhí mé ar mí na meala.</P>
      <P>In planning one's honeymoon in the middle of August, one hopes it will be a quieter time, politically, than usual.  How wrong I was.  As one is so far away, one tends to see such a horrific crime as a remote occurrence.  However, as my wife and I watched the Taoiseach on CNN speak of his horror, the shock that this was happening at home became painfully and depressingly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Terrorism leaves death, pain and scars.  It is the most grotesque act imaginable.  Some people have no need to imagine its horror.  I have flashbacks of memory of Friday, 17 May 1974.  I was a 13-year old schoolboy and was attending a choir practice in the Dublin Central Mission Hall in Abbey Street.  Normal life was blown away at 5.30 p.m. in a thunderous bang and a violent blast caused by one of the car bombs which exploded nearby.  My clearest memory is of the huge window <Col N="26" /> at the opposite end of the hall falling in.  My mother who was at home was aware that her entire family &mdash; my father, sister, brother and I &mdash; were in Abbey Street at that time.  To this day I can only guess the distress which the news must have caused for her.</P>
    <P>However, I am alive today while the 28 victims of murder in Omagh, and the many other victims of terrorism, are not.  Ballymoney was also a place of unspeakable grief this summer.  With others I stood with the family and friends of the Quinn boys who died so needlessly, tragically and innocently. Our prayers are with their family at this time.  I have never been to Omagh but, like other Members, I attended a number of memorial services and vigils since the atrocity.  Repeatedly, I have heard the names, the ages and details of the lives of those who have passed on.  I prayed with people from Omagh who came to Dublin.  I prayed for the dead, the injured and the bereaved.  This was part of a phenomenal tidal wave of spiritual and community responses which touched every village and town.  A further response is now expected of all of us elected to this Parliament.  As legislators we must ask how do we deal with the hurt, the pain, the anger and the outrage that well up in us in the face of the Omagh atrocity without falling into the political trap the perpetrators have tried to spring on almost all people on this island, of all political backgrounds, who wish even now to work through the British-Irish Agreement democratically and peacefully.  To recall the Dáil to hear expressions of grief for those so cruelly murdered and to express our sympathy with the bereaved and our solidarity with those wounded and maimed is the right thing for the Government to do.</P>
    <P>The Green Party &mdash; Comhaontas Glas &mdash; like all political parties here, comprises people of goodwill interested in public affairs, who have been shocked, grief stricken and even maddened to some degree by this heinous atrocity.  The Northern Ireland Green Party, the Scottish Green Party and the Green Party in England and Wales have asked me to say that they are remembering the feelings and needs of the people of Omagh and their thoughts are with the people of Tyrone, Donegal and Madrid who were made to bear the brunt of the reaction of violent republicanism to the unfolding peace process. Yesterday I spoke to the chairperson of the Northern Ireland Green Party who told me that his wife is from Omagh, that he and his wife knew many of the people who were killed and injured and that they were there immediately they heard of the blast.</P>
    <P>The shock waves of this barbarous bomb have drawn together communities far and wide as one huge bereaved family.  In my own constituency a Malahide man originally from Omagh lost his mother, Mary, his sister, Avril, who was expecting twins, and his 18 month old niece, Maura.  How can words make a difference to the grief in that man's family?  In the face of such a burden of loss the spiritual response of prayer is sometimes the <Col N="27" /> only one that makes even the remotest sense.  As Jesus Christ said, &ldquo;Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted.&rdquo; It is also written, and this I personally believe: &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ who according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in Heaven for you.&rdquo; Is it not ironic, when one considers the dogma of those who carried out the attack in Omagh, that almost all people on this island are already united in the wish to live in peace together and are also united in their determination to end violence and to bring to justice those who remain involved in terrorism?  This resolve was demonstrated most clearly in the wake of the bombing by the many priests of all persuasions, the medical professionals and other people, near and far, who helped in whatever way they could, organising vigils, fundraising and bringing whatever comfort possible to the victims.  I support the suggestion that the Government should help with fundraising for the victims and the people of Omagh.</P>
    <P>The growing co-operation between the different traditions on the island came across very strongly in the joint statements from the Northern Ireland First Minister, David Trimble, M.P. and the Deputy First Minister, Séamus Mallon, M.P. in the aftermath of the bombing.  They stated that what was needed was a political response, a security response and a community response.  Later today the Dáil will make less of a political response than a legislative one to the tragedy.  Whereas there are such requirements, that response is no substitute for the other responses that must also be on our minds.  The community response, which in many ways is the most powerful and most needed, relies on every person on this island who opposes violence to act on the one hand by declaring what activities they can help with to promote understanding and peace and, on the other hand, to declare if they have any knowledge of hiding places for weapons or the whereabouts of anyone who has an involvement in terrorism.  Life depends on such information being reported.</P>
    <P>In saying that, my heart goes out to the many people I have heard from who have been intimidated; some have been killed.  They are those who have stood up and spoken out but have not had the community response to support their bravery. Listening to the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Pat Byrne, recently it was clear that the role of the community's response is the vital ingredient in bringing an end to crime and, in this case, terrorism as well.</P>
    <P>The security response will cost money, although that aspect is not contained in the legislation. This is the real test of how determined the Government is to catch the terrorists and prevent further atrocities.  The Minister must declare what <Col N="28" /> extra money will be provided for the Garda Síochána.  From talking to young people, I know there is a long waiting list of those wishing to enrol as trainees at the Garda training college in Templemore.  At a time when many employers are finding it difficult to recruit suitable workers, that speaks volumes for the willingness of school leavers who want a chance to serve in the Garda Síochána and to help in the response we are talking about.</P>
    <P>The political response requires immediate progress in implementing the British-Irish Agreement. When discussing this legislation in specific terms, a human rights commissioner is needed &mdash; as in Northern Ireland where there is a standing advisory committee on human rights &mdash; to ensure a balanced response when such emergency legislation is on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The dead have been buried but the injured and bereaved still suffer and will continue to do so.  It is time to work so that memories will be honoured by the hope that no more suffering will be visited on anyone through terrorism.  Political, security, community and spiritual responses will also continue to be required.  However, the British-Irish Agreement is the vehicle of that hope and its early implementation must now, more than ever, be the focus of our efforts in Leinster House and in the community generally.</P>

Is é an freagra is éifeachtaí anois dul ar aghaidh gan mhoill leis an bpróiseas agus comhaontú Aoine an Chéasta a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
      <P>I wish to extend the continuing sympathy and solidarity on behalf of myself, of Sinn Féin and of my constituents in Cavan and Monaghan to all who were bereaved or injured by the bombing of Omagh in our neighbouring county of Tyrone. The devastating personal impact of this tragedy was widely felt, especially in the network of inter-related communities along the Border.  We in that region know, from the experience of long conflict which has touched us all, that the process of grieving, recovering and rebuilding broken lives will take many years.  The magnitude of this tragedy which ranks with very few others in the 30 years of conflict, makes that process even more difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dignity and grief of the people of Omagh, of those in Buncrana and of the relatives of the Spanish victims has been remarkable.  My party colleagues in County Tyrone have described as humbling the demeanour of the bereaved and the injured.  This is a community united in sorrow but also in determination to see lasting peace as the permanent memorial for their loved ones. <Col N="29" /> For our part, we in Sinn Féin are more determined than ever to ensure a lasting and democratic peace settlement is achieved and firmly established.  The bombing of Omagh was an attack on the peace process in general and on the Sinn Féin peace strategy in particular.  It ran completely contrary to the democratic consensus among Irish republicans.  Those who carried out the bombing do not hold themselves accountable to any community or political constituency.  The republican consensus and the weight of public opinion generally will ensure their ill-conceived campaign, unbearably tragic though its consequences were in Omagh, will have been short-lived.</P>
    <P>The response to Omagh must now be a redoubling of efforts to ensure the full potential of the British-Irish Agreement is reached.  The spirit and the letter of the Agreement must be implemented.  The assembly must meet.  The executive must be established with due representation in ministries for all so entitled by virtue of their electoral mandate.  The North-South Ministerial Council and implementation bodies need to be in place and working this autumn.  Progress must be made and be seen to be made on issues of justice and equality, demilitarisation, prisoners and policing.</P>
    <P>Now is not the time for party politicking and point scoring, for recriminations or the placing of new obstacles to progress.  The onus is on all those democratically mandated by the people to join together in the creation of a new political dispensation.  Having attended this debate throughout, I must remark how out of step with what is required was the contribution this morning of Deputy John Bruton.  I will not be goaded into a political <i>cul de sac</i> of Deputy Bruton's construction. I record my disappointment that he has yet again demonstrated his failure to accept the changing political realities of this Agreement and its implementation.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement was endorsed by the electorate on both sides of the Border because it contained the promise of change and the prospect of lasting peace.  Change and peace are inextricably linked.  If we lose sight of that, the efforts of those seeking to wreck the peace process will succeed.  A return to a failed repressive agenda would run completely contrary to the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>It is time to leave the political failures and conflict of the past behind us.  We in Sinn Féin are certain that we have done all in our power to end the conflict.  We have lead Irish republicanism successfully into a peaceful strategy.  We have made republican consensus for a negotiated peace settlement a central part of the peace process and that is our ongoing task.  We will fulfil our obligations and our mandate and others must do the same.</P>
    <P>Again I express sympathy and solidarity with the bereaved and injured of Omagh.  Our commitment to them and to all who have been bereaved or injured in the conflict is to work without stint <Col N="30" /> until lasting peace and real democracy is established on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin West</i>): My heartfelt solidarity and that of the Socialist Party with the bereaved people of Omagh, Buncrana and Spain and with the suffering wounded, the maimed and the disfigured who survived the appalling bomb atrocity of 15 August is entirely consistent with our feeling about all such atrocities over 30 years. Whether appalling outrages were perpetrated by the Provisional IRA, such as the massacre of innocent Protestant workers at Kingsmill and Teebane in the 1970s and 1980s, or by loyalist paramilitaries, such as the Greysteel massacre of Catholic working people and the appalling and tragic deaths of the Quinn children at Ballymoney, our reaction has been the same &mdash; outrage, opposition and the demand for no more violence.</P>
      <P>I hope Omagh will be the last painful reminder that the activities of self-appointed paramilitary organisations advance not one inch the well-being of the working class communities &mdash; where they are often active &mdash; who suffer most from their activities.  Any organisation which transports a 500 pound bomb into a town, village or city is responsible for the resulting casualties whether occurring in an accidental way or not.  So also must a military superpower like the United States be held to account for sending flying bombs into Third World countries with equally reckless disregard for the innocent.</P>
      <P>The paramilitary organisation responsible for the Omagh barbarity must be ostracised and isolated. Leaders of the political establishment have also called for that and logically should not then be lining up to give a sycophantic welcome to a United States President who sends missile bombs into poor countries, much less escort him around golf courses.  The pain and suffering of black and brown people is no less than that of the people of Omagh and Ireland generally.  Those of us who have campaigned for decades against paramilitary violence, against State violence and repression and for the unity of working class people, Protestant and Catholic, take enormous heart from the massive and impressive demonstration of unity in the wake of Omagh &mdash; a unity of working people across the North, in particular, which has transcended sectarian divisions and pushed those divisions into the background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I stood in Omagh on 22 August with thousands of ordinary people in protest at the massacre I felt a vital determination that there should be no going back to the horrors of the past.  That determination was replicated in cities, villages and towns throughout Ireland.  This is the movement that is sending the sectarian organisation responsible for the Omagh barbarity and others of like mind scurrying for cover.  It is this movement that will ensure that the bombers, the sectarian killers, the sectarian fish of whatever hue, have no sea, lake or pond in which to swim. It is that response, not the panic rush by the British <Col N="31" /> and Irish Governments to introduce legislative measures so incredibly, ludicrously and dangerously wide-ranging in their effect that they threaten the fundamental civil rights of our people, that has already made a huge difference. These measures will be counterproductive and are not the way to end paramilitary attacks.  If the bitter experience of the last 30 years shows us anything, it shows us that repressive legislation does not solve the problem, it only creates more.</P>
    <P>I salute the heroism, superhuman dedication and compassion of the health service workers and assisting volunteers in Omagh and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are all conscious of the background against which this Bill is being introduced.  The tragic events in Omagh just over two weeks ago, when 28 men, women and children lost their lives and when many more were seriously injured, are a stark reminder of the threat which groups opposed to the British-Irish Agreement continue to pose.  They have lost the battle for the hearts and minds of the people who voted overwhelmingly, North and South, in favour of the Agreement in concurrent referenda in May.  They now have recourse only to terror and violence to pursue their campaign of opposition to the Agreement. Their actions, culminating in the horror which was Omagh, have had the opposite effect: they have united the Irish people in rejection of their methods and in a determination that they should not be allowed to succeed in undermining the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the strength of that public reaction has played its part in prompting a re-examination by groups opposed to the Agreement of the options now open to them.  The decision by the INLA to call a ceasefire is to be <Col N="32" /> welcomed.  The decision by the Real IRA to suspend armed operations while it engages in internal consultations is hopefully a precursor to a similar decision on its part.  While those decisions can provide little comfort to the victims of the Omagh tragedy and other attacks, they serve to show the power of the community response in the new situation created by the British-Irish Agreement.  Both the so-called Real IRA and the Continuity IRA must be left in no doubt about the consequences of any further vacillation on their part: they will continue to meet a determined response from the Government and the security forces and they will not be allowed to thwart the will of the people.</P>
    <P>What is of paramount importance now is that those who seek to oppose the British-Irish Agreement through violence must not be allowed to succeed in putting at nought the clearly expressed will of the people.  We cannot allow ourselves to be deflected from our commitment to secure full implementation of the Agreement by the actions of a tiny and unrepresentative minority.  We, as public representatives, must not only remain faithful to the mandate we have received but we must renew our commitment to the Agreement's implementation in all its aspects.  The best possible answer to those groups remains the Agreement itself, which offers the prospect of the very thing they seek to destroy &mdash; the possibility of a new beginning and a peaceful future based on the principles of partnership, equality and mutual respect.</P>
    <P>The Government has worked closely with the British Government in determining the overall response which should and must be made to the Omagh tragedy.  Both Governments have reconfirmed their commitment to the British-Irish Agreement and are actively engaged on moving forward with implementation of the Agreement in all its aspects.  Against that background, I note the significance of yesterday's statement by the Sinn Féin president and the broad welcome it has received.  Both Governments are continuing to work closely in determining the appropriate response to the Omagh tragedy.  My meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mo Mowlam, in the immediate aftermath of that atrocity was part of that process which is continuing in the form of high level contacts between the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the Chief Constable of the RUC.  The introduction of this Bill is another element of that response which is mirrored by the introduction of parallel legislation in the British parliament today.  The unity of purpose of the people of these islands in the face of the Omagh atrocity is therefore matched by a common and co-ordinated response on the part of their two Governments.</P>
    <P>The Government is satisfied that the proposals in the Bill represent a measured and balanced response proportionate to the threat which the activities of groups opposed to the Agreement pose.  They are measures which have been identified as offering potential in usefully supplementing <Col N="33" /> the existing provisions of the Offences against the State Acts.  The Government is further satisfied on the advice available to it that the measures the Bill contains are consistent with the Constitution and its international human rights obligations.  The measures it has decided on are moreover intended to represent a focused response which will have particular relevance in the context of the activities of groups such as the Real IRA.  The passage of this legislation will, therefore, be an important step in strengthening the powers available to the Garda for the purpose of countering such groups and those who provide them with support.</P>
    <P>The measures in the Bill are directed to four essential purposes.  First, the Bill makes changes to the rules of evidence which currently apply to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and more generally for the purpose of other offences under the Offences against the State Acts and scheduled offences under those Acts.  Second, the Bill will create certain new substantive offences of particular relevance to the activities of unlawful organisations and those who provide support for them.  Third, it will strengthen the hands of the courts in respect of those who provide support to the activities of unlawful organisations or engage in offences on their behalf.  Fourth, it will extend the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act.</P>
    <P>Three changes are proposed in regard to evidentiary matters.  The principal changes are contained in sections 2 to 5.  Section 2 makes specific reference to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and is one of the key provisions of the Bill.  Its effect will be to provide that where, in any proceedings against a person in regard to that charge, evidence is given that the accused failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question material to the investigation of the offence while being questioned in regard to that offence, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper.</P>
    <P>The section further provides that references to any question material to the investigation of the offence includes any references to any question requesting the accused to give a full account of his or her movements, actions, activities or associations during any specified period.  It also provides that any such inference may be treated as or as capable of amounting to corroboration of any other evidence relating to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation.  The section contains two important safeguards.  It provides that it will not have effect unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of a failure to answer or a false or misleading answer might be and provides that a person shall not be convicted solely on an inference drawn from a failure to answer a question or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply.</P>
    <P>The section will also only have effect in terms of the failure to answer a question or the furnishing <Col N="34" /> of a false or misleading response in reply to a question after the coming into effect of the Act.  Two related changes to the Offences against the State Acts are made by sections 4 and 13.</P>
    <P>Section 4, which amends section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, makes a related and consequential change. The effect of the existing section 3 of the 1972 Act &mdash; which provides that any statement or conduct by an accused implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation shall, when proceeded against for membership, be evidence that he was then such a member &mdash; was also to define the expression &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; as including an omission by an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation.  The change being made by section 4 will be to align the definition of conduct with the expression used in section 2 of the Bill; that is, conduct is being defined to include movements, actions, activities or associations in addition to the failure to deny such a report.</P>
    <P>A further related change is being made by section 13 which provides that section 52 of the 1939 Act &mdash; which provides for an offence of failing to give specified information to the gardaí &mdash; will not have effect unless, immediately before a demand for information is made of a person under that section, the person is informed in ordinary language of the fact that the demand is being made under that section and what the consequences are of failing to give an answer or furnishing information which is false or misleading.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill, which makes the second important change in the area of evidence, also has specific reference to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation.  It provides that in proceedings for such an offence the accused shall not, without leave of the court, call any other person to give evidence on his or her behalf unless notice has been given of his or her intention to do so.  The procedures to be followed in this regard are set out in subsections (2) to (7) of the section which are closely modelled on the existing provisions of our criminal law in relation to the requirement to give notice of an alibi an accused intends to rely on for the purpose of his trial.  The section also provides that the requirement in relation to the giving of notice will not apply to a witness whose evidence is solely in relation to the matter of sentence.  I might add, for the information of the House, that the question of introducing a general provision along these lines into our criminal law in the case of serious offences is the subject of a recommendation in a report I have recently received from an expert group I set up earlier this year to consider changes in the criminal law arising out of recommendations made in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The third change in the area of evidence is being made by section 5.  This section is not <Col N="35" /> restricted to the offence of membership but will, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years' imprisonment or more, have application to any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, scheduled offences for the purpose of the 1939 Act and offences arising out of the same set of facts as an offence under the Acts or a scheduled offence.  The effect of this section, which is closely based on a similar provision in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, will be to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so.  This section, as with section 2, incorporates important safeguards whereby it will not have effect unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of a failure to mention such a fact might be and provides that a person shall not be convicted solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.  Similarly, the section will only have effect in relation to a failure to mention such a fact if the failure occurred after the coming into effect of the Act.</P>
    <P>I think it important to point out at this stage there is not and could not be in the changes we are proposing any interference with the court's responsibility under our criminal law to convict an accused only where it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt of the offence charged.</P>
    <P>The Bill also creates certain new substantive offences.  There are five such offences: directing an unlawful organisation; possession of articles for purposes connected with certain offences; unlawful collection of information; withholding information; and training persons in the making or use of firearms, etc.</P>
    <P>Section 6 establishes the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act, 1939.  That offence will attract a penalty of up to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 will make it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article in his or her possession is for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.  The section also provides that it will be a defence to prove that the materials were not in the person's possession for such purposes.  This offence will attract a penalty of a fine or imprisonment up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 8 will make it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences.  A serious offence is defined for the purpose of the section as an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of five years or more involving loss of human life, serious personal <Col N="36" /> injury, false imprisonment or serious loss or damage to property or a serious risk of any such loss, injury, imprisonment or damage and includes an act or omission done or made outside the State which would be such an offence if done within the State.  The section also provides that it will be a defence to prove that the information in question was not being collected etc.  for the purpose of being used in the commission of a serious offence.  The offence of unlawful collection of information will attract a penalty or a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 9 will make it an offence to withhold information which a person knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by any other person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any other person for such an offence and who fails without reasonable excuse to disclose such information to a member of the Garda Síochána.  A serious offence is defined for this purpose in the same terms as for section 8.  An amendment, which I will bring forward on Committee Stage, will further clarify the position in this regard.  The penalty which will attach to the offence is a fine or imprisonment of up to five years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 12 will make it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  This offence will attract a penalty of a fine or imprisonment up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>These offences are of a type that are likely to be committed by members of unlawful organisations arising from the activities of such groups. They are therefore targeted at specific activities, such as the collection of information which would be of assistance in planning terrorist attacks or the possession of material which can be used in the making of improvised explosive devices, in which members or supporters of such groups can and do engage.  They will therefore have limited application.  Likewise the offence of directing an unlawful organisation will call for evidence over and above that of membership of such an organisation. It seems nevertheless right to provide for such an offence which will be capable of attracting the higher penalty of life imprisonment to deal with circumstances where such evidence may exist.  The offence of withholding information has a wider potential application, but the message it is intended to underscore is that it is the duty of persons who have knowledge of planned offences involving death, serious injury or destruction or information which would lead to the conviction of those responsible for such offences to make that information available to the Garda.  The effect of section 14 will be to make these new offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act.  That will mean that persons suspected of committing such offences will be liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act and may be charged before the Special Criminal Court in respect of such offences <Col N="37" /> on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The effect of the amendment to the Schedule to the Bail Act, 1997, which is being made by section 16 will be to enable these offences to be regarded as serious offences for the purposes of that Act when bail applications are being considered.  The Bill is also intended to strengthen the powers of the courts in respect of those who provide support to the activities of unlawful organisations or engage in offences on their behalf.  It contains two measures to this end.</P>
    <P>The first of these is the provision in section 15 which specifies that the court may impose unlimited fines in relation to the four principal offences dealing with possession of firearms and explosives. The offences concerned are possession of a firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property contrary to section 15 of the Firearms Act, 1925; possession of a firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances contrary to section 27A of the Firearms Act 1964; possession of explosive substances contrary to section 3; and making or possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances contrary to section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1883.</P>
    <P>The second such measure is the provision in section 17 to amend section 61 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which deals with the forfeiture of property used for the purpose of committing or facilitating the commission of an offence or intended to be used for that purpose in circumstances where a person has been convicted of an offence.  The effect of the change being made by section 17 is to provide that, in the case of persons convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, a court will be required to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order. The provisions of section 61 apply to both real and personal property and will therefore permit the seizure of lands on which arms are stored, should such a course be warranted.</P>
    <P>The fourth essential purpose of the Bill is to extend the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act &mdash; which is 48 hours at present &mdash; in two separate circumstances.  First, section 10 will allow a District Court judge to authorise the detention of a person for a further period not exceeding 24 hours, on the application of an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, provided that the District Court judge is satisfied that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.  I intend to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to make it clear that the person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make submissions or to have submissions made on his behalf.  Secondly, section 11 will also allow a District Court judge to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person, <Col N="38" /> in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained but released without charge, for a further period which again is not to exceed 24 hours in circumstances where the District Court judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána about that person's suspected participation in the offence about which they wish to question the suspect.</P>
    <P>The Bill finally contains a review mechanism. Section 18 provides that the provisions of the Bill other than sections 1, 13, 15, 16, 18 itself and 19 will cease to be in operation on 31 December 2000 unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that the section should continue to be in operation.  The remaining sections of the Bill are in standard form and contain the necessary definitions in section 1 and provision for the Bill's short title, construction and collective citation in section 19.</P>
    <P>Passage of this Bill will further strengthen our law for the purpose of tackling those groups, such as the Real IRA, who have yet to declare a complete ending of their campaigns of violence.  The Bill itself is only one element of a package of measures on the security and legislative fronts designed to counter the activities of those who engage in violence.  The other measures which are being taken include the ongoing examination of means of further enhancing police operational capacity on both sides of the Border being undertaken by the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the RUC who will report back to me and the Secretary of State on the matter shortly; the allocation of additional resources to the Garda Síochána for the purpose of countering the threat which dissident groups continue to pose, and my decision to bring the provisions of the Bail Act, 1997, into force in respect of persons charged before the Special Criminal Court to allow the courts to take into account the possibility of the commission of offences if the person was granted bail in parallel with the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to pretend that particular legislation or indeed any other security measure can provide a cast iron guarantee that terrorist activity will cease or that terrorist attempts will not succeed.  There are no simple solutions to the problem of terrorism.  If there were, they would have been tried and have succeeded many years ago.  We will continue to depend heavily on the professionalism of the Garda Síochána who have had considerable success in countering the activities of the Real IRA and preventing attacks in Northern Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>A question which has been raised is why this legislation was not introduced when the threat posed by the Real IRA began to manifest itself. The same question could reasonably have been addressed to both Governments over the past 30 years when the level of threat posed by terrorist activity was much higher than it has been since the latest IRA and Loyalist ceasefires began.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> Timing the introduction of particularly tough criminal law measures such as those before the House is very much a matter of judgment and successive Governments have tried conscientiously to respond with legislative and other measures in a way that was reasonable and proportionate.</P>
    <P>Rather than appear to blame successive Governments for not introducing measures of this nature before now, we should acknowledge that they are definitely needed now and represent an appropriate and proportionate response in circumstances where a terrorist grouping has shown its willingness, against the clearly expressed will of the people, to commit carnage on a scale never witnessed before.  We should keep the focus not on what might or might not have been done by Governments over the years, but on the absolute need to do all in our power to thwart those who are capable of atrocities like Omagh.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that the combined effect of the enactment of the Bill and the measures to which I referred will be to significantly enhance the capacity of the State as a whole to tackle such groups.  More than that, I hope these measures will provide a rallying point for those, the vast majority, who want to see an end to such violence for good and that the revulsion which we all feel in the aftermath of the Omagh atrocity should not be allowed to dim with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for those groups which have yet to declare a definitive ceasefire to renounce such violence and to prove in word and deed that they mean what they say.  The British-Irish Agreement offers a unique opportunity for both traditions on this island to live together in stability and equality.  It offers a means whereby the different relationships which bind us together can be acknowledged and developed.  The two Governments are determined to press ahead with the implementation of the Agreement and the commitments contained in it.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to put those who would still have recourse to violence on notice.  The Government will not allow any group to destabilise the British-Irish Agreement or subvert the will of the people.  The Government will closely monitor the efficacy of the measures to which I referred and will not shirk from taking other measures should they prove necessary to curb their activities.</P>
    <P>I described the measures in the Bill as harsh on its publication.  It gives me no pleasure to be the Minister who introduces such a Bill.  I referred to the review mechanism the Bill contains which will enable the House to consider the continuing necessity for the measures for which the Bill provides no later than 31 December 2000.  That date was fixed by reference to the commitment contained in the British-Irish Agreement to carry out a wide-ranging review of the Offences against the State Acts generally.  The Government intends to honour that commitment and I will establish such a review mechanism shortly by way of the establishment <Col N="40" /> of a special committee under independent chairmanship and with the participation of both Governments and outside experts.  To underline that commitment, I propose to bring forward the date by which the Bill will fall to be reviewed to 30 June 2000.  I hope that, by the time the date provided for in the Bill has been reached, violence for political ends will have ended completely and that it will be possible to reform the Offences against the State Acts and dispense with those elements no longer required, both generally and by reference to the provisions of this Bill.  Much will depend on the decisions which those groups which have not yet renounced violence take.  Only they can create the conditions whereby it will be possible to dispense with many of the powers which the Offences against the State Acts provide.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: The Omagh bombing was not an accident of poor planning or the result of speedy, panic abandonment of a bomb by amateurish paramilitaries whose intended destination was the local courthouse and not the busy, crowded shopping mall.  The Omagh bombing was a deliberate atrocity.  The more people killed and maimed the greater would be its intended public relations success and coup.  Its purpose was to send the loudest possible signal to the world that the IRA is alive and well and that the struggle goes on, regardless of the democratic will of the people.  Its purpose was to derail the British-Irish Agreement and to ensure that this most spectacular of holocausts would plunge Nationalist and loyalist paramilitaries into an even more full blooded conflict than heretofore.</P>
      <P>The sickening expression of regret from the organisation and its political wing, the 32-County Sovereignty Committee, and its cessation of military activity are part of a strategy to tide it over the wave of mass public revulsion and buy time in the hope that the memory of Omagh will recede in the mistaken belief that the extra legislative powers being enacted by this House and the Seanad this week might be deemed unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an enormous capacity for ambivalence and an amazing facility to respond emotionally and with overwhelming generosity to certain tragic events and situations.  We have the understandable human frailty of forgetting rather quickly.  The atrocities at Omagh, Enniskillen and Banbridge are part of the confused and muddled thinking about where people stand when it comes to the national question.  For the past 30 years we have tolerated people blowing hot and cold about republicanism and Nationalism.  Much of the rhetoric trotted out at Bodenstown was deliberately laced with double think, innuendo and <i>a la carte</i><Col N="41" /> republicanism.  Constitutional parties and politicians in the midst of some of the worst troubles in the North continued to indulge in the four green fields rhetoric and rabble rousing for their selected audiences and on selected occasions while managing to do a quick about-turn the next day in the wake of some further atrocity.  These were the people who disparaged as being less than Irish those who had the vision to speak out about the need for compromise or an agreed accommodation with Unionists.</P>
    <P>How often have we had public house republicans raise a lusty cheer for a news bulletin announcing the perverted ingenuity of the detonation of a landmine, the shooting of an RUC man in the back of the head or the killing of an old man like Lord Mountbatten?  Today there are the grieving fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters and heartbroken extended family members of the 28 innocent victims of the Omagh bombing. There are people scarred for life physically and emotionally.  How many among the 3,000 plus killed since 1970 were innocent victims of this most savage phase of violent Irish history?</P>
    <P>Today we should also remember the young privates and corporals from the British army who were mown down simply because of their regiments' insignia on their uniforms, the young RUC constables blown to pieces because of the badge on their caps, the members of the Garda Síochána shot down in cold blood doing their duty and thwarting so-called patriots from robbing a bank in this jurisdiction and the workmen who were time and again coldly fingered as legitimate targets by self-appointed executioners because they replaced slates on the roof of an RUC barracks. Tonight, thousands of widows and orphans of these victims are left grieving and asking why.</P>
    <P>The reality is that Irish unity has not alone not been advanced one iota by such murder &mdash; let us call it what it is, each and every killing in the Northern troubles was a murder &mdash; but it has left behind a legacy of misery, death and destruction, totally unnecessary and counterproductive.  It has poisoned people's minds and segregated and divided communities, making it difficult if not impossible to bridge the gap of mutual sectarian bitterness and hatred in the foreseeable future. The reality is that the civil rights movement, the dismantling of the old Stormont, the genuine proactive interest and input by the Government in the South, resolute input and management of Unionist attitude to domination by the British Government and the sheer weight of world opinion would collectively have delivered a solution before now at least as positive as the tentative Agreement now being taken through its teething stages.</P>
    <P>A senior Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform source is quoted as saying: &ldquo;The intelligence and evidence against these people is already there . but there is no way convictions would have been secured under existing legislation&rdquo;. The same source is also quoted as saying: &ldquo;There is enough actual evidence against those <Col N="42" /> responsible for this heinous crime to make strong cases against them under new legislation&rdquo;.  I hope this is the case because people want those responsible put away and will be watching with interest and impatience to see how quickly and effectively they will be rounded up, charged and convicted under the new powers in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The reality is that this time last year the Real IRA was a small group, ill-equipped and isolated. If their identity was so well known why was there no round the clock surveillance on these people to monitor their location, movements and activities?  They should have been subjected to exactly the same scrutiny, surveillance, vigilance and frustrations as was meted out to the drug barons.</P>
    <P>If inadequate legislation was the difficulty, why was this legislation not introduced as a matter of urgency as soon as possible after the British-Irish Agreement in order to head off the seepage of members, guns and explosives to the new movement?  The major problem now is that in a matter of weeks this erstwhile embryonic group seems to have mushroomed almost to the same scale as the Provisional IRA.  I acknowledge that there were a number of very significant interceptions of explosives but on the other hand there seems to have been a naive expectation on the part of the Government that such high profile interceptions were sufficient to send a strong signal to the splinter subversives.  The result is that these arsenals are now outside the control of the Provisional IRA.  As a result, Sinn Féin can no longer be deemed to speak with authority about the huge arsenals which are now outside the control of the Provisonals.</P>
    <P>We are, as a result, facing a major security emergency wherein the future of this island is at stake.  What is particularly regrettable in the wake of Omagh and in the wake of all the political progress that has been made is the repeated failure by Sinn Féin, in spite of Gerry Adams's statement last night, to insist on decommissioning whatever arms and explosives are still in the possession of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>Why should anybody require guns or explosives or access to guns or explosives if they sincerely believe the political process which is now under way has a meaning and a future?  Why should Sinn Féin still embrace and defend the concept of a private army while at the same time it has ostensibly embraced the democratic process with Members in this House, in Westminster and the new Stormont Assembly?  Sinn Féin must cease indulging itself in word playing and verbal conundrums and must accept its obligation to use its influence and insist the IRA makes a clear statement once and for all that the war is over.</P>
    <P>Why should any political organisation claiming democratic legitimacy continue its murky association with gunmen?  Why is there not decommissioning now?  The attempt to equate the legitimately held arms of the security forces with those of subversives and paramilitaries is but another red herring drawn into the midst of one <Col N="43" /> of the most serious political and security crises this State has seen.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin and the IRA have very serious obligations with regard to these matters.  The people who planted the bomb in Omagh, as was said in the House today, were trained by the Provisional IRA and there is absolutely no guarantee, given the psychopathic mentality of those involved in Omagh, that the outrage at Omagh cannot or will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>I note again with regret the recent comments by Martin McGuinness that he will not turn informer.  The word &ldquo;informer&rdquo; should be removed from our political dictionary.  To finger, expose and have subjected to the due process of the law people involved in atrocities such as Omagh is not being an informer.  In any stable civil society not alone is one not an informer by exposing the perpetrators of such murder and mayhem, one is actually carrying out one's civic duty.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael by and large supports this legislation and will support any legislation to deal competently and conclusively with those who set out to subvert the State.  It believes, however, that the maximum period of detention provided for in this Bill is inadequate.  We fail to see why armed paramilitary murderers should not be subjected to the possibility of the same period of maximum detention as drug barons.  In both cases we are talking about the deliberate killing of people.  For that reason Fine Gael has tabled an amendment to extend the possible period of detention to seven days.  There should be absolutely no shirking from the option of keeping a suspected killer in detention for the additional period if there is a real possibility that additional information will be forthcoming in order to enable charges to be brought.</P>
    <P>We have heard many strong words from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as to the measures which would be introduced to deal with the perpetrators of Omagh and to ensure that there will be no repeat. The real measure of the success of this so-called draconian legislation intended to crush such assassins will be the number and speed of convictions obtained.</P>
    <P>Legislation on the issue of withholding information is not new.  Section 15 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, requires a person to give information in his possession as to how a person came into possession of firearms or ammunition. Section 16 of the same Act creates an offence of withholding information about stolen property. Section 18 of the Act allows for inferences to be drawn from a person's refusal to account for the presence on his person of any mark or substance. Section 19 similarly allows for inferences to be drawn from a person's presence at a particular place where a crime is committed and where such person fails or refuses to account for such presence. The point I am making is that legislation is only effective if it is effectively applied and the <Col N="44" /> number of times these particular sections of the 1984 Act have been applied is very limited indeed.  Section 52 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, which provides that a person detained in custody is obliged to give account of his movements, has largely fallen into disuse.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a detailed scrutiny of this Bill by the House on Committee Stage.  We want assurances from the Minister that each provision in the Bill is practical and can be practically applied.  There is no use in talking tough if the measures being introduced today are aspirational but impractical.  We want to leave this Chamber this evening absolutely assured the measure which we are passing is an effective watertight instrument to ensure that not only will there never be another Omagh, Enniskillen, Moira, Portadown or Banbridge but that another drop of blood will never be spilled in the vain quest of a cause which flies in the face of the overwhelming democratic will of the people of the island of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill as a measure that I hope will bring to justice the terrorists who have acted in defiance of the peace agreement and who continue to threaten to engage in violent activities.  These people represent a huge threat to democracy.  They do not have any mandate and they have no regard for the rule of law and order.</P>
      <P>The response of all democrats must be to turn the screw firmly on this relatively small number of people and deny them the oxygen which allows them continue in their evil ways.  The oxygen supply must be severed and this cannot be done by legislation alone.</P>
      <P>After the Omagh bombing there is an onus upon the entire community to respond.  Politicians alone will not resolve the problem of terrorism in our midst.  There is a huge onus on all parties to the talks and on the Irish Government which has conceded that the main Real IRA and Continuity IRA membership and threat is from this side of the Border in our jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The legislative response before us is welcome but I am surprised that in the time that has elapsed since the Omagh atrocity the Minister has been silent on the matter of suppression orders under section 19 of the Offences Against the State Act.  He has been silent also on any reintroduction of section 31 of the Broadcasting Act to apply to spokespersons for the dissident republican groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In referring to the role of politicians not being sufficient to resolve the problem, I will elaborate on a point made by Deputy Higgins about the passing of information to the security forces.  The practice of informing has been difficult given our colonial past where the legacy of the empire has resulted in a certain ambivalence.  More than 70 years after independence we are now a mature and democratic State and this ambivalence should not have any place in our society as we approach the new millennium.  Our citizens have a moral duty and a civic obligation to co-operate <Col N="45" /> fully with the forces of law and order in rooting out those whose only function is to destroy the hopes of 90 per cent of the people who supported the agreement for peace and democracy.  No stone must be left unturned in isolating these people and bringing them to justice.</P>
    <P>The security response must allow for a top level of co-operation between the security forces North and South to include the British Army and our own Army personnel.  I am disappointed there has not been a greater effort on the part of the Government to ensure a joint standing committee is set up for the exchange of information and intelligence as well as joint patrolling of Border areas which may, from time to time, be deemed appropriate as circumstances dictate.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to confirm that the security forces in Northern Ireland will provide to the Garda authorities full forensic reports on the Omagh bombing.  The man who made the bomb has been described in the media as a 32 year old unemployed electrician living in a wellknown suburb of this city.  People are looking to us for answers.  They are looking to the Minister to explain how these people can be named in the media and yet freely engage in the type of activities that may result in further atrocities at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the purpose of the dreadful Omagh bomb, which brought so much pain and suffering to so many, was to smash the British-Irish Agreement, thereby scuttling the peace process. The purpose was to provoke a Unionist backlash such as would ensure that the Ulster Unionist Party could not continue to move towards an acceptable compromise to end the 30 years of mayhem and destruction in which democratic politics had little place.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to Mr. Trimble in that, since the atrocity, he has still been able to move the process forward.  His positive working relationship with the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Mallon, is a sign of great hope.  It is gratifying that the centre ground of Northern politics, dominated by the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP, has strengthened since the election and has not been weakened by the Omagh tragedy.  However, the assembly will meet the week after next and the Unionists cannot be expected to sit in the same cabinet with Sinn Féin without appropriate gestures from Mr. Adams and his party and encouragement from the British, Irish and US Governments. Mr. Trimble needs help and reassurance and that should be forthcoming as much from the Irish Government as from any other source.</P>
    <P>This legislation must show dissident republican groups that they will not be tolerated in the Republic of Ireland.  The Omagh tragedy has presented Sinn Féin and Mr. Adams with an opportunity to break with the past like never before.  He can show that both he and his party have crossed the line separating militant republican Nationalism and have engaged in a safe passage across the bridge to constitutional and democratic Nationalism.  He can show he is willing to <Col N="46" /> progress from the stale old bitter conflicts of the past to a new future.</P>
    <P>He can do that in five ways: by elaborating further on yesterday's statement and declaring categorically that the war is over; by ensuring that a supply of information to the security authorities will be forthcoming from his supporters now engaging positively in democratic politics; by ending the racketeering and punishment beatings &mdash; the latter flies in the face of the Mitchell principles and will present a stumbling block to future progress; by expelling the dissidents from the so-called republican family &mdash; it is a pity he did not avail of the opportunity yesterday to expel those who continue to operate in a climate of ambivalence towards violence; and by moving on decommissioning.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin must move if the Northern assembly is to work.  While Mr. Adams's words are welcome, they must be followed by appropriate and positive deeds.  No party to the Agreement can reserve the right to license a return to violence at the time of its choosing.  There is no room in any democratic forum for the strategy of the armalite and the ballot box.  The referendum results, North and South, removed any moral justification or mandate for the purveyors of the armalite, and any justification they may have had in the past to engage in violent activities has now been removed.  The armalite has been deprived of any semblance of a moral or political mandate.</P>
    <P>President Clinton will arrive in this country tomorrow and his help and involvement in the past have been most welcome and most important.  He is coming to see how he can further help and I believe he can by two means. First, he can reassure the Irish Government and people that he is taking a strong line on the misguided expatriates in the Irish community in the US who support violence by means of the cheque book or the armchair and, second, he can continue to influence Mr. Adams and Sinn Féin to move across the bridge to constitutional and democratic nationalism.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael supports the legislation on Second Stage.  We look forward to Committee Stage but it is regrettable that there was not a day's interval between Second and Committee Stages.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a direct response to the Omagh tragedy and it begs the question: what has the Government been doing since the signing of the Agreement in tracking down those still engaged in violence?  The Minister and the Government took their eyes off the ball in the early summer.  The so-called Real IRA made 16 attempts to engage in acts of violence, the last of which was the devastating blow to Omagh.  Some of these attempts were foiled by the security forces but it was clear to the Government from security and intelligence briefings that this group represented the threat which resulted in the atrocity perpetrated in Omagh.</P>
    <P>Even now those who planned and executed the bombing are members of an organisation which is not illegal and has not been proscribed.  The</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> Minister stated that his advice was that there was no need for a proscriptive order and I hope he will elaborate on this on Committee Stage. Groups which are openly associated with terrorism can post bills outside this democratic forum or in any part of this jurisdiction.  They can engage in recruitment, call meetings and take part in soft television chat shows.  I hope the Minister will address these matters as they are causing concern since the signing of the British-Irish Agreement and, particularly, since the Omagh tragedy.</P>
    <P>I am seeking explanations from the Minister on some sections of the Bill.  In particular, section 4(1)(b)(i) concerning &ldquo;movements, actions, activities or associations on the part of an accused person.&rdquo; Is this workable?  Much of this legislation may be difficult to apply successfully in court.  The phrase &ldquo;associations on the part of the accused&rdquo; conjures up much of the discredited and horrific aspects of the prevention of terrorism legislation in the UK.  The omission by an accused to deny a published report in the media confers a large degree of power and influence on the media.  If it prints a claim that a person is a member of an organisation and that person does not read the newspaper or regards the article with contempt and chooses to ignore it, that report can be a tool of conviction.  This has been included in previous legislation but I am not sure to what extent it has been successfully applied.</P>
    <P>The Bill has correctly been described as draconian. I hope that innocent parties and those with nothing of which to be afraid will not have their rights interfered with by this legislation. There are a number of sections which require clarification.  Section 7 concerns the possession of articles for purposes connected with certain offences.  Is this necessary?  Is it a new section?  It refers to situations in which a person may have articles in his or her possession or under his or her control in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is for the purposes of a crime under the Explosive Substances Act.  Is this not already a criminal activity?  How much of this is window dressing and how much of it can be applied to ensure terrorists cannot have a safe haven in this jurisdiction?</P>
    <P>For the most part, regrettably, the tough measures in the Bill are necessary to protect the Agreement, as democrats attempt to rebuild the deeply divided society and to ensure politics is not led or dictated to by a small minority of perverts who threaten to turn the clock back.  You, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body, will be familiar with the work we have done in recent months towards encouraging a process on the demilitarisation front.  Sadly, much of that work has been for nought.  That hope is dashed.  There were four key areas where we had hoped to see a reduction in the number of security forces North and South. For example, the removal of the security installations, the removal of emergency powers and a package of measures appropriate to a normal and <Col N="48" /> peaceful society.  The Omagh bombing represents a huge setback to that process.  Democrats must plough on regardless to heal the wounds and to foster a climate of peace.  Let us hope this legislation aids and assists that process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the Bill as a mechanism to strengthen the capabilities of democratic Ireland to combat and end the scourge of terrorism in our midst. Overall the Bill is a balanced response following the outrage at Omagh.  It provides some means to clamp down on a fringe terrorist group determined to murder and maim to destroy the peace process.  It provides a means to uphold the constitutional rights of ordinary citizens.  The Labour Party's position on the Bill is in accord with our long established policy on Northern Ireland.  On Northern Ireland we have not sought to criticise the Government for the sake of Opposition but have sought to be constructive at all times.  As part of this general policy we supported the position taken by the Government in the referendum Bill which followed the Agreement.  We continued this policy by supporting the Government when the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Bill was being debated because it was required by the Agreement.  This is the context in which we address the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>We support the Government's view that the Real IRA must be smashed and that no solutions can be achieved by violence.  We see no purpose in pretending any side of the House would be more effective in dealing with the Real IRA.  We believe there would be no fundamental difference in the response if the Opposition parties were in power.  We accept the Government has made great efforts to move the peace process forward.  The Labour Party along with other Opposition parties made our contribution to moving it forward also.</P>
      <P>Since the legislation was announced we have desisted from criticising points of detail and engaging in nit-picking.  Instead, we corresponded with the Government outlining what we considered were appropriate improvements to the legislation.  Early last week the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, wrote to the Taoiseach suggesting a time limit be put on the operation of the Bill.  We are happy the Government has responded positively to this suggestion, even if the time limit in the Bill is longer than the 12 to 18 months proposed by Deputy Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting with Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform officials last Friday we put forward a number of modifications to the Bill. We are happy that three specific suggestions have been accepted.  In section 2 the Government has accepted it should be made clear, in line with normal legal practice, that persons should not be questioned after being charged.  In section 9 we suggested a person should not be obliged to incriminate themselves and appropriate changes have been made in the Bill as published.  In section 10 we suggested that where detention is being extended by a court for an extra 24 hours <Col N="49" /> the Garda should have to physically produce the arrested person before the court.  This is in line with the Drug Trafficking Act and provides an important safeguard.  The Minister has also made a positive response to this suggestion.  Yesterday I wrote to him outlining our remaining proposals for improving the legislation and am awaiting a definitive response.  The proposals which did not receive a positive response will form the basis of our amendments at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Legitimate fears have been expressed regarding a possible erosion of civil liberties by the innovative parts of the Bill.  The Labour Party cannot ignore these fears, but neither can we renege on our responsibilities to ensure that all possible measures are taken to apprehend those responsible for the carnage in Omagh and to further ensure they are not afforded the opportunity to repeat their wanton acts of terror.  The Bill is a specific response to an indiscriminate and fascist act of slaughter.  It should be a temporary strike against a rump group of violent and dangerous fanatics.  I emphasise that it is not intended to be a permanent feature of Irish law.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also an important signal.  The British-Irish Agreement marked the successful conclusion of political dialogue on the competing interests of identity on the island.  It has also opened the way for a fully legitimate and effective law and order response to the use of terror. We must clearly articulate to those members of paramilitary groups remaining active that the only response to their terrorism will be more stringent law and order provisions.  The political debate has concluded: there can be no change in Northern Ireland, on the island as a whole or between east and west unless it is signalled in the British-Irish Agreement.  The Agreement envisages an Ireland with enhanced human rights provisions and a diminished emphasis on stringent security measures.  However, security can never be relaxed in the context of those who continue to undermine the Agreement by means of terror and indiscriminate violence.</P>
    <P>On 22 May the people, North and South, gave their overwhelming support for a new political future without violence.  The support in the South and within the Nationalist community in the North has been more remarkable.  The Real IRA neither has nor seeks a mandate to continue.  We must face the prospect of a repeat of the events in Omagh.  I see no change in the logic being used by the Real IRA.  It bases its actions on a certain vision of the Irish nation and has consistently worked counter to the wishes and interests of the people of the nation.  Regrettably, if it retains its technical capacity it may re-engage its campaign of indiscriminate violence.  The purpose of the Bill must be to prevent such a resurgence.  If the Omagh outrage is repeated on any scale in any town, east or west of the River Bann, further security measures will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Bill must be credible and effective.  It must herald the legitimacy and capacity of democratic Ireland to govern itself within the parameters of <Col N="50" /> the Constitution, the British-Irish Agreement and our international human rights commitments. The seat of the Irish nation resides exclusively in the ballot box.  There is no room for the gun or for explosives in Irish politics.  Neither is there room for the threat of physical force as a way of advancing a political position.</P>
    <P>Throughout its history, the Labour Party has stood firm in the face of terror.  This contrasts sharply with the views held by sections of other parties in the House at various stages in their history.  At all points, we have unambiguously opposed the use of terror as a means of securing the aims of the Irish nation.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I express my sense of pride at our consistency in opposing terrorist means. Former leaders of the Labour Party, from Brendan Corish and Frank Cluskey to Dick Spring, have never accepted the legitimacy of terror to further the so-called interests of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has participated constructively in all stages of the peace process and in all other attempts to resolve the problem in the North.  Unlike other parties we have not sought to score cheap political points.  Neither did we, when in opposition, seek to undermine the Government in its attempts to end the violence. I recognise the role played by Labour Ministers in the previous Government in progressing the peace process.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that the legislation is in some way dishonest, that it involves judicial participation in a sham exercise and that internment without trial or &ldquo;executive detention&rdquo; would be a more honest approach.  I do not share that attitude.  I do not believe that judges will allow their role to be reduced to rubber stamping the Executive's will.  It is reasonable to expect that prosecution cases consisting entirely of opinion and inference will be subject to rigorous scrutiny by the courts.</P>
    <P>There is a risk that if internment was available as an option it would be chosen as a matter of routine.  In many cases it could be used as an alternative to a criminal trial.  Where there are reasonable grounds for doubt as to innocence, but insufficient evidence to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, internment would be attractive in these circumstances if it was available.  Those who suggest that internment would be a better alternative to the provisions of this Bill should remember that this Bill provides for a criminal trial which involves independent adjudication and the safeguard of due process.  These are entirely absent from the process of internment and reduce, even if they do not eliminate, the risk of a miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>I will not consider every provision of this Bill in detail but will concentrate on specific aspects which are of particular importance.  There is one point of general application to the Garda questioning process which I want to make.  I refer to the electronic recording of interviews in Garda custody.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> In 1989, while in Opposition, Deputy Dick Spring introduced a Criminal Justice Bill to amend the law governing the rules of evidence and procedure as they apply to statements taken from persons in Garda custody.  This initiative followed the quashing of the convictions of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four and their release from prison.  These convictions had been obtained on foot of statements made in police custody.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Judge Frank Martin Committee, established by the Government to review the question of video recording of interviews in Garda custody, recommended the introduction of audio-visual recording of all such interviews.  The recommendation followed an examination of such systems in operation in the USA, Canada and Australia.  The recommendations of the Martin Committee were accepted by all sides of this House &mdash; including my own party &mdash; and a decision in principle was taken to introduce audio-visual recording of Garda interviews.  I understand that at present four Garda stations routinely record interviews of suspects in custody and that this will be increased by one in the near future.  The legislation we are debating today is intended to be operated in a narrow and focused manner.</P>
    <P>Given that the legislation is designed to remove from circulation a small number of RIRA activists, it seems prudent and practical to ensure that the interviews with these people while in Garda custody are recorded.  Such a move would do much to dispel any apprehension that this State is rowing back on its previously made commitments relating to safeguarding the rights of persons in custody.  It would also be in line with the preferences of the Attorney General's office, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda themselves.  It would offer a safeguard to gardaí against false accusations which may be levelled against them.</P>
    <P>I therefore call on the Minister, in his reply to this stage of the debate, to set out the Government's view as to the practicality of ensuring that audio-visual recording is available in cases of membership of an unlawful organisation processed under this Bill.  At the very least the Garda headquarters in Carrickmacross where the Omagh investigation is based &mdash; and to which arrested people have already been brought from Counties Kildare and Meath &mdash; should be designated under the regulations as a station in which interviews are recorded.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 18 which provides that the bulk of the measures will cease to be in force at the end of the year 2000.  Most of the rest of the Offences against the State Acts is intended to be permanent legislation, as integral a part of the criminal law of this State as our homicide or rape laws.  This Bill, on the other hand, contains what are best classed as emergency provisions and it is right that their effect and effectiveness should be subject to review.  This is of particular importance <Col N="52" /> in the context of the British-Irish Agreement.  It would be a worthless exercise if, in our efforts to defend that Agreement as a democratic expression of the wishes of the overwhelming majority, we undermined the integrity of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>For example, paragraph 5 of the security section of the Agreement commits the Government to a wide-ranging review of the Offences against the State Acts with a view both to reform and to dispensing with the provisions no longer required in them.  The provisions on human rights are also relevant.  The Agreement states that the Irish Government is committed to establishing a human rights commission with a mandate to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of laws and practices and to make recommendations to Government as necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to ensuring at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights in this jurisdiction as will pertain in Northern Ireland where the European Convention is to be incorporated in domestic law.  My party would be particularly concerned at the implications if the new measures on the law of evidence, set out in section 2, were to be successfully challenged before the European Court.  It has been suggested that it may be necessary to enter a derogation to the European Convention to prevent this happening.  It would be a disastrous setback to the full implementation of the Agreement if, to defend it, both Governments had to seek derogation from specific commitments made in the Agreement.</P>
    <P>As has been stated many times in recent months, the Agreement is a comprehensive package which places obligations on all sides.  We must avoid at all costs, and resist from others, the idea that its provisions can be cherry picked as circumstances suit.  For these reasons, we welcome the provision in section 18 that the major changes made by the Bill will lapse at the end of June 2000.  This will allow the full independent review contemplated by the British-Irish Agreement to take place and a full debate on whether these measures can, or should, be permanent.  We would argue, however, that this legislation should lapse automatically and unconditionally at the end of 2000, rather than retaining a possibility of its being further extended by resolution of both Houses.  We should remember that a review of the entirety of the Offences against the State Acts, under the British-Irish Agreement, will have been completed by that date.</P>
    <P>If that review is in any way serious, there will be a need for codifying and consolidating legislation which discards much of what is now irrelevant in the Acts, such as provisions relating to unlawful drilling and so on.  Much of this Bill could be incorporated in that consolidating Bill, where it would be subject to line by line scrutiny in this House and in the Seanad.  This is far preferable to a one or two hour debate on a motion to extend the lifetime of today's package without any provision for amendment of the various sections. <Col N="53" /> Section 4 gives an extended meaning to the word &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; as used in the 1972 Act.  That Act allows for a person's conduct to be used in evidence against him or her on a charge of membership of an unlawful organisation.  &ldquo;Conduct&rdquo; is now to include &ldquo;movements, actions, activities or associations&rdquo; on the part of the accused person. I have no difficulty with a person's conduct being taken to include his or her movements, actions and activities; it is difficult to know what else it could mean.  However, I object to a person's associations &mdash; those whom he or she meets &mdash; being used in evidence against an accused. None of us is responsible for the actions of our acquaintances.  Mere association with an individual should not be taken as an endorsement of those actions, still less as a form of complicity and responsibility for them.  The introduction of such a rule would be especially destructive in the context of personal and family relationships, with the real risk being run that a whole household would stand convicted because of the actions of one of its members.  The House should reject the temptation to enshrine &ldquo;guilt by association&rdquo; as a principle of Irish criminal law.</P>
    <P>A gap in existing legislation exists to the extent that there is no specific offence of contributing to, fund-raising for, or holding money on behalf of an unlawful organisation.  Although such money is held forfeit to the State under the Amendment Act of 1985, criminal proceedings cannot be brought against those involved.  To cover this point I propose that an additional subsection be added to section 6 which deals with the directing of an unlawful organisation.  I hope the Minister will respond sympathetically to it.</P>
    <P>Section 9 creates the new offence of withholding information likely to be of assistance to the Garda Síochána.  While I do not object to the general principle behind this proposal, I have serious doubts about the way in which it is drafted, which seems to give the offence an extent of operation which is far wider than either intended or needed. In particular it seems to pre-empt and make entirely redundant the study currently being undertaken by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, on the question of whether there should be mandatory reporting of child abuse.  The new offence applies to information likely to be of material assistance in preventing the commission of, or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any person for, a &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo;. As the Minister indicated in his speech a serious offence is defined as including an offence punishable by more than five years' imprisonment which involves loss of life, serious personal injury, false imprisonment, etc.  There can be no doubt but that the sexual abuse of a child would fall within a definition of serious personal injury.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the offence applies only where a person fails &ldquo;without reasonable excuse&rdquo; to disclose material information to the Garda.  It might be argued that health care professionals and health board officials would have such a reasonable <Col N="54" /> excuse if they, their professional bodies or their employees did not agree with the principle of mandatory reporting.  However, I believe that, rather than having to rely on the unknown outcome of some future court proceedings, such professionals are entitled to specific protection from the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider for committee stage a simple amendment which would exempt from section 9 medical practitioners and members of prescribed classes of health workers, social workers and teachers and other appropriate professionals as regards information which they properly acquire in the course of their professional duties and which do not relate to the thrust of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for similar provisions that exist in the Alibis Act, 1984.  A defendant in this case must notify the court of witnesses that he or she is calling in his or her defence.  The Labour Party supports the thrust of this section and the need for such notification.  However, we have included an amendment so that a court cannot make inference on the failure of a person to call a witness when he or she previously gave notice of his or her intention to do so.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a concerted, focused attempt to eliminate violence from Irish politics.  It is an attempt to face down those who do not adhere to democracy and who are not prepared to use democratic means to advance their cause.  When the British-Irish Agreement was signed, there were those who anticipated the danger of some elements continuing to use physical force to pursue their objectives despite the clearly expressed wishes of the people.  Those who are committed to peace should not underestimate the challenge we still face.  For nearly 200 years Irish politics has had an element of people who were prepared to resort to violence as a way of advancing their cause.  It would be naive and simplistic to think that all these people will be satisfied with anything less than the full attainment of their aspirations.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the Omagh bombing there was overwhelming revulsion.  Two weeks later, while the revulsion still remains, it is now modulated by concerns with civil liberties.  This pattern of events is unfortunately part of a recurring phenomenon experienced over the past 30 years. Emotional responses have not stopped the bombers and murderers.  They have not responded in the past to emotional appeals to stop.  Instead they have resorted to lying low for a period until the public outrage waned and then continuing their war.  This Bill is unique in its serious intent to isolate and crush those who cause carnage and destruction in the name of the Irish people and, therefore, the Labour Party supports it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which I welcome and support.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice on his good fortune in sitting in a House which is <Col N="55" /> almost entirely supportive of this Bill.  I recall late November and early December 1972 when I introduced a modest measure in comparison with this one &mdash; I read it recently and it is modest &mdash; and was assailed from all sides night and day.  The criticism from all parties was led by the former Deputy Cooney, who put down what he described as a &ldquo;reasoned&rdquo; amendment to prevent the passing of the Bill, and was extraordinarily severe. This shows how times have changed.  It is the Minister's good fortune that he holds office at the present time, even though at times he may think his life is not an easy one.</P>
      <P>I support the proposed four or five new offences created by this Bill.  They are important in counteracting violent subversive activities and are valid for now.  If they are valid for now, why are they not valid for all time?  Why will they no longer be offences after the end of June or December in 2000, as is now suggested?</P>
      <P>There seems to be a feeling abroad that legislation by any state to protect itself against violent subversion should be temporary and should be removed when an obviously violent overt threat disappears.  This is not the way a modern state should do its business.  Every state must have a corpus of permanent legislation which deals with acts of violent subversion against it.  The Minister should bear this in mind.  Given that the new offences he proposes to create are valid in present circumstances, they are likely to remain so and should be part of the permanent corpus of law.</P>
      <P>Section 6 creates the offence of directing an unlawful organisation.  Why should it become lawful to direct an unlawful organisation after 30 June or 30 December 2000?  It should not &mdash; it should be unlawful for all time.  Section 7 creates the offence of possession of articles for purposes connected with certain offences.  These articles are mainly fertiliser, fuel oil, detonators etc. which are used in the making of bombs, including the appalling Omagh bomb.  Why should it be lawful to have possession of these articles after 30 June 2000?  Why should the unlawful collection of information for the purpose of besetting, attacking or killing people ever be lawful?  Why should withholding information ever be lawful?  Why should it be lawful for a farmer who has members of an illegal organisation making bombs on his farm to withhold information from the Garda?  Section 12 applies to training persons in the making or use of firearms or explosives.  Why should it be lawful at any time to train such people or to receive such training?  It should not be lawful and these sections should be part of our permanent law.</P>
      <P>There is no need to apologise for having Offences Against the State Acts.  They have existed since 1939 and succeeded other Acts which dated from the early 1920s.  They exist for a valid reason; the State could not protect itself and its institutions if they did not exist.  They should always exist and we should not assume an apologetic attitude for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> Some sections of the 1939 Act tended not to be used and I often wondered why.  One of the most important sections in the Bill before the House is the provision for forfeiture of lands or property used for illegal subversive purposes.  To some extent that power existed under section 25 of the 1939 Act which provided for the making of a closure order.  Under another section of that Act a forfeiture order could be made.  The forfeiture order, which could be made by the Minister for Justice, might have been unconstitutional and I never sought to use it.  However, I did use a closure order, when I was Minister for Justice in 1972, against a building being used by Provisional Sinn Féin as a front for the Provisional IRA.  The order was challenged in the High Court and that court upheld the right of the chief superintendent concerned. According to the book <i>Political Violence and the Law in Ireland</i> by Hogan and Walker, that was the only occasion the provision was used and that is a pity.</P>
    <P>There was an important article on this topic by Dick Walsh in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday, 29 August.  Mr. Walsh is described in some quarters as one of <i>The Irish Times</i> liberals, people who are viewed with derision in some parts of the country. His comments, therefore are particularly valuable. He wrote: &ldquo;Omagh was the price paid for the casual attitudes of politicians, policemen and journalists who made light of bomb after bomb &mdash; in Moira, Banbridge, Dundalk, Portadown, Armagh, Howth and Dún Laoghaire &mdash; 10 in all since the beginning of the year.&rdquo; He went on to talk about the argument that internment or other harsh measures never worked in this country and pointed out how untrue and inaccurate that argument is.  He spoke about how different life might have been without these measures.  His comments are true, even though they are not usually made in what is currently written on these matters.</P>
    <P>This State, like any other, must protect itself. Some Members might seek to describe this legislation as a measure to counteract what is described as the Real IRA, but I view it as a measure to protect the State.  Even if the &ldquo;Real IRA&rdquo; disappeared in the morning, as did many of its predecessors only to resurrect themselves under other names, the State must continue to protect itself and it should not be apologetic about it.</P>
    <P>There is danger in the current atmosphere of appeasing people who have been convicted of serious violent crimes, including murder.  Nobody has been released, to date, under the Belfast Agreement.  That fact is often overlooked.  The people who have been released &mdash; and some would have had many more years to serve &mdash; have been released unilaterally and one might almost say arbitrarily by successive Governments as a gesture of goodwill towards provisional Sinn Féin.  While that is intended to send a type of message in one direction it sends another type of message in another.  I am concerned at the number of those so released who have since been rearrested and charged with very serious crimes. <Col N="57" /> I am concerned about section 14, as are some others who have been in touch with me about it. The time allocated for Committee Stage is so short that we shall probably not discuss section 14.  If the Minister does not object I draw his attention to a difficulty which is likely to arise under it.  The section declares that &ldquo;the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in relation to each offence under sections 6 to 9 and 12&rdquo;.  I do not know that this is necessarily in accordance with Article 38.3.1p of the Constitution because that reads &ldquo;Special courts may be established by law for the trial of offences in cases where it may be determined in accordance with <i>such</i> law that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order.&rdquo;.  That is implemented in sections 35, 36 and 37 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, and it is done, in accordance with this article, by way of Government proclamation made under section 35 of the 1939 Act.  Section 14 purports to overrule that and I do not think it can.  Article 38 provides that special courts may be established where it may be determined that ordinary courts are inadequate &ldquo;in accordance with such law&rdquo;, not <i>by</i> such law.  There are provisions in sections 35 and 36 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, for the making by the Government of a proclamation that circumstances have changed.  There is also provision in section 36 for the passing of a resolution by the Dáil bringing the proclamation to an end but none of that is now available.</P>
    <P>For the first time in all our Offences Against the State legislation a declaration of this kind is to be made by statute rather than by proclamation of the Government.  This may seem a lawyer's point but I think it is valid.  I cannot think of any reason it was done this way other than that of making things more convenient on paper. Section 14 appears to conflict with Article 38 and it certainly conflicts with the earlier legislation. The Minister should consider this point in the few hours that are left.  This of course is one of the difficulties of trying to deal with a Bill as extensive and important as this in one day.  This is a serious point and it should be examined very carefully because a problem could arise in relation to it.</P>
    <P>However, it is reassuring to see the various provisions that are made, both substantive and evidential, all of which are necessary and useful.  It interests me to see that this House will now so readily assist in the implementation of section 3 of the 1972 Act, which so many Members of this House said was virtually the death-knell of Irish democracy and all the usual claptrap that one gets on these occasions.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill on Second Stage.  I deeply regret the circumstances that led to its speedy introduction.  Like Mr. Walsh, I think legislation of this kind was needed anyway.  I regret that we did not see the need for <Col N="58" /> it earlier, after all the warnings we got of the murderous intent of these people.</P>
    <P>I saw Omagh the day after this tragedy.  While I did not get the opportunity to speak this morning, I feel I should not conclude what I have to say on Second Stage without recording my absolute horror at what I saw of the suffering and death that was inflicted on so many people.  As well as dealing with the perpetrators of that atrocity I hope this legislation, in conjunction with the remaining legislation enacted since 1939, will remain a permanent feature of our Statute Book and will be used to try to prevent any repetition, even on a much smaller scale, of the awful things we saw happen in Omagh.</P>

      <P>Every one of us in this House is conscious of the evil that lies within our communities on the island.  Today we are speaking in its shadow.  The Omagh bombing is an all pervading reminder of that terrible reality.  This is a day for acknowledging the horror, death and suffering which occurred at Omagh and to pledge ourselves to do everything possible to bring this kind of terrorism to an end.  We are all in agreement with the Taoiseach that those who shed so much innocent blood must be rooted out and crushed.</P>
      <P>We also need to acknowledge the bravery and compassion shown by ordinary people in Omagh, by professionals, social and health care workers and district council workers.  In particular, I acknowledge the work of the members of the RUC and the security forces generally.  Like the Garda Síochána, members of the RUC in the face of unspeakable evil, are expected to show strength and support at a time when human strength is stretched beyond endurance.  They are the ones who literally have to pick up the pieces. At Omagh, they did so in the most agonising conditions possible.  All of us in the Republic need to recognise their contribution and to do everything in our power to address any archaic discrimination that exists against them in our local and national organisations.</P>
      <P>Extraordinary circumstances demand extraordinary responses; that is why we are here today. That is why this legislation is being enacted while similar legislation is being passed through the British Parliament.  It proposes to give sweeping powers to the Garda Síochána and the Judiciary and sets out to deal with paramilitary terrorism by introducing provisions into law that in other circumstances would be intolerable in a democratic society.  It sets out to restrict the right to silence and allows a court to make inferences from the failure of a defendant to speak, to increase the time of detention and to allow guilt by association.  As the Minister said, the legislation is draconian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> We in Democratic Left accept the requirement on us all to tackle terrorism head on.  The nature of this legislation and the context within which it is being presented is unambiguous but, as it stands, it is not enough.  It is not enough to rush through harsh measures in response to a natural public revulsion at the Omagh bombing or to find and punish the guilty, if we do not at the same time, protect the innocent.  This is the function of any Government in a democratic society.  It is a function of the Government to ensure that this legislation is neither indiscriminate nor indefinite. If we fail to protect basic human and civil rights then we are handing the terrorists a victory.  The lessons of history are plain and it would be inexcusable to ignore them.</P>
    <P>We have already expressed our concern that this legislation does not provide adequate safeguards to protect the innocent.  On Committee Stage I will table amendments, which I hope will be considered seriously.  We are seeking not to change the legislation fundamentally but to change the context within which it is implemented.  We are seeking to create the democratic controls which are needed but which as yet are absent from the Bill.  Without such accountability a hasty knee-jerk reaction both here and in Britain can have serious long-term dangers.  In both jurisdictions over the years there have been enough precedents of miscarriages of justice to alert us to the necessity of getting this legislation right.  In 1974 a previous British Labour Government introduced the Prevention of Terrorism Act as another &ldquo;draconian&rdquo; and &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; measure.  It is still on the statute books.  We have our own examples of such so-called temporary measures.  The declaration of a state of emergency introduced at the outbreak of the Second World War was only finally lifted in 1995 by the rainbow Government.  Another so-called temporary measure, the Offences Against the State Act, was introduced in 1939.  Indeed, there are anomalous powers in the Act.  For instance, every newspaper which carried the recent <i>An Phoblacht</i> interview with an IRA representative committed an offence under that Act and the editors are liable at present to a prison term of six months.</P>
    <P>In responding to justifiable public criticism, the Government has set a time limit on this new proposed legislation, but two and a half years is an inordinately long time to prove the effectiveness of such legislation in dealing with a small, relatively known, group of individuals.  I hope in the limited time available for Committee Stage we can consider shortening that timeframe.  I regret the Government has chosen to compress this debate into one day only.</P>
    <P>I regret the Government has not seen fit to provide the necessary balance between stringency and safeguards.  We cannot beat the terrorists by becoming more like them.  We cannot deal with a paramilitary oppression of the innocent by introducing some new kind of parliamentary or police oppression of the innocent.  It is the very stringency <Col N="60" /> of the measures proposed which provokes the need for such safeguards.  The so-called Real IRA set out to undermine the British-Irish Agreement.  We must ensure that they fail totally in that mission.</P>
    <P>In the Agreement the Government committed itself to strengthening the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction and gave an undertaking to establish a human rights commission.  A standing committee already established in Northern Ireland is proving itself to be a good watchdog for human rights.  To date, the commitment has not yet been honoured.  Not only is this an opportunity for the Government to live up to that commitment but there is an onus on the Government to live up to that commitment, to prove to the terrorists that nothing will deflect the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement.  This matter can be addressed by the amendment which I intend to table on Committee Stage.  In the interim, while a human rights commission is being established, the Minister should be required to make a report to the Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights.  This kind of framework is necessary because the Government stated that it set 31 December 2000 as the expiry date for the legislation as it will coincide with the final date for the review of emergency legislation set out in the British-Irish Agreement, but a date was not set out in the Agreement for the completion of such a review.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section in relation to the forfeiture of property.  It is an important one, particularly in the light of the decommissioning process. Will the Minister consider delaying it for a short, limited period to encourage people who are engaged in providing safe locations &mdash; there seems to be no shortage of them &mdash; to give up the guns and explosives in their possession?</P>
    <P>Some of the language in the Bill is worryingly vague.  The section on conduct outlines and defines conduct to include movements, actions, activities or associations on the part of accused persons.  These are not defined in the Bill and there are questions to be asked.  I ask the Minister to deal with this when he comes back into the House.  What are we talking about?  Are we talking about the brother and sister who meets somebody who is a member of an illegal organisation on a regular basis, who drinks with such a member in a pub or who plays on the same football team?  These are questions which need to be addressed by the Minister in relation to this vague language in the Bill which is deserving in its wide remit.</P>
    <P>One of the most effective safeguards a person in custody can have against potential mistreatment is the electronic recording of interviews.  It also provides the additional benefit of protecting members of the Garda against spurious claims of ill-treatment.  It is unacceptable that 14 years from the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act facilities for the recording of interviews are available only in a handful of Garda stations.  Whatever about technical difficulties, the taping of interviews <Col N="61" /> is surely a relatively simple and low cost procedure.  I will be tabling an amendment on this issue.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement is the context within which terrorism can and will be defeated. It is the touchstone, the bedrock of the democratic will of the different communities on this island.  This legislation creates an opportunity for us to apply the principles which eliminate terrorism but also protect the innocent.  Inevitably, with this type of legislation the innocent get caught up and arrested from time to time &mdash; history teaches us so.</P>
    <P>The Agreement is infused with pledges from both Governments to guarantee civil and human rights.  That holds as good now as it did on the day it was signed.  If this Government is to live up to the Agreement then it too must infuse this legislation with something of the same spirit.  Our strength lies not just in severe law but in the allegiance of our people to the forces of law and order.  That allegiance can only be based on democratic principles.  Let us not see the bombers of Omagh succeed in any conceivable way in undermining the principles governing the British-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I thank Deputy McManus for sharing her time with me.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill is an incredible exercise by both the British and Irish Governments. The equivalent of what we are doing here today is being done in the British House of Commons &mdash; members there got sight of the Bill virtually hours before the debate.  It is quite clear that this is but a cynical ploy by both Governments in response to the natural outrage expressed by people throughout Ireland at the atrocity of the Omagh bombing.</P>
      <P>In that cynical response, failing to learn from the mistakes of the past, the Government is introducing proposals that play fast and loose with the civil rights of our people.  They are imposing these laws on 3.5 million people in an attempt to deal with what is estimated to be 50 to 100 people in the organisation, North and South, which carried out the Omagh atrocity.  It is quite clear how this organisation should be dealt with.  They have been dealt with in many ways already, not by this hastily cobbled together legislation but by the mass movement of opposition and revulsion by the ordinary people of Ireland.  It is the visible expression of that opposition in protest demonstrations throughout Ireland that has made this organisation scurry into a hole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers being introduced by this legislation are quite draconian on top of the already draconian powers under the existing Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and subsequent amendments. That is, by any stretch of the imagination, draconian legislation, many of the provisions of which are glossed over by the media and political parties which have been clamouring for the introduction of these powers.  The Offences Against the State Acts, for example, give the power to suppressprotest <Col N="62" /> movements or political movements of a very wide variety totally unrelated to the activities of paramilitarism.  For example, a boycott of the payment of motor tax organised by a residents' association to protest against the state of our roads could be declared unlawful and suppressed under the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates new all-encompassing offences with abandon.  It is as if the Government is intent on passing out lucky bags.  Under section 8, it is an offence for a totally innocent person to have information which could be useful to a group of paramilitaries.  Teaching a person to use a hunting rifle or a shotgun for innocent purposes &mdash; I disapprove of such activity &mdash; can be deemed an offence under the legislation.  There is also an &ldquo;out&rdquo; clause whereby it shall be a defence if a person can prove they were engaged in certain activities for innocent reasons.  The onus of proof will be turned on its head, which will be a major interruption of and interference with the administration of justice in a fair and equitable way.</P>
    <P>The Bill will rig the justice system to allow convictions to be made at the whim of individual gardaí and anyone could be subject to its catch-all and wide-ranging provisions.  That is alarming. If gardaí so wish, they can use the legislation as a virtual internment mechanism.  On this occasion, however, they will be able to do so under cover of a court hearing.  The Bill is an extremely cynical exercise in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that the Government, with the agreement of the Opposition parties in general, is rushing this far-reaching measure through in one day without engaging in public debate.  Such action represents an affront to the democratic rights of the people and shows that we are dancing to the tune of the gangsters who carried out the atrocity at Omagh instead of dealing with the problem in an entirely different way.  It is little wonder that a member of the Birmingham Six has voiced strong opposition to the Bill because it creates the conditions where people can be wrongfully convicted and imprisoned.  The Bill will be counterproductive because, following the passing of the tragedy at Omagh into memory, crude use of its provisions will lead some people to have sympathy for those who might have been responsible for that atrocity.</P>
    <P>Have the 30 years of the troubles not shown the Government that repressive legislation will not solve the problem and that in the past such legislation has only exacerbated the situation?  I am totally opposed to the Bill and will vote against it at all Stages.  This is a bad day for the democratic rights of the people.  I am amazed that parliamentarians across the floor favour both the legislation and the way in which it is being summarily dealt with by the Dáil.</P>

Ní hé seo an freagra <Col N="63" /> cuí ar an uafás san Ómaigh.  Is é an freagra is fearr ná dul ar aghaidh chun an Comhaontú a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
      <P>I am opposing the Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill, 1998, in its entirety.  The Bill comes before us in the heat of justified anger at the Omagh atrocity.  At the height of public emotion, the Government has brought forward legislation which, by the admission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was long in gestation.  Clearly in the past it was believed that passage of such drastic measures was not politically feasible.  Now the Bill is to be sped through the Oireachtas with minimal debate and fundamental changes in the law affecting the rights of all citizens are to be introduced with little public awareness of their long-term implications.  The political blunders and legal injustices of the past are repeated.  During the conflict emergency legislation was introduced rapidly in the wake of tragedies &mdash; the Offences against the State Act, 1972, the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Emergency Provisions Act and other lesser provisions. In every case it was stated that these were temporary measures which would not stay on the Statute Book; in every case their passage was facilitated by the promise that they were designed not for widespread use, but for the pursuit of those suspected of responsibility for particular offences.  The result was such cases as the Guildford Four, the Maguire family, Giuseppe Conlon, Judith Ward and the Sallins four in this jurisdiction. These are only the best known cases and long after these people were released or, in the case of Giuseppe Conlon, deceased, the laws remain.</P>
      <P>The measures before us run contrary to the spirit and letter of the British-Irish Agreement.  One of the main reasons for Nationalist and republican support for the Agreement is the centrality within it of human rights and civil liberties.  Those central elements of the Agreement are being undermined in a few hours today and tomorrow as drastic measures are rushed through the Oireachtas and similar measures are rushed through the British Houses of Parliament.  In the Agreement the Government committed itself to a widespread review of repressive legislation and to &ldquo;take steps to further strengthen the protection of human rights in its jurisdiction.&rdquo; The measures before us are backward steps.</P>
      <P>The legacy of repressive legislation in Ireland is inextricably linked with the legacy of conflict. It has always helped to fuel the cycle of repression and resistance, which the peace process is designed to bring to an end.  There is a direct line of succession from the coercive legislation imposed during centuries of British rule and the repressive legislation enforced on both sides of the Border and in Britain since partition. Instead of ending that legacy these laws continue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should look at the political effect in Britain and the North of the Government's action.  In <Col N="64" /> advancing this Bill it has facilitated and encouraged the British Government in the passage of legislation in Westminster which will be even more draconian in its effects.  The RUC is a discredited force which enjoys no allegiance among the Nationalist community in the Six Counties.  It has been censured by a succession of human rights authorities up to and including the United Nations Human Rights Commission, which this year criticised the force's treatment of solicitors and said it was guilty of &ldquo;intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference&rdquo; with defence lawyers.  Into the hands of this force is to be placed the power to imprison people on the basis of the word of senior officers and this potentially disastrous development has come about because the British Government is modelling its laws on those to be passed in this House.</P>
    <P>More than one Member has taken a special interest in the case of Elaine Moore.  This Bill and the British legislation opens the way for many more such cases.  The British-Irish Agreement has the potential to transform the discredited legal and judicial system in the North.  The new laws introduced by the British Government and made possible by the action of the Irish Government are now grievously damaging that potential for positive change.</P>
    <P>What does the Bill do?  First, it reinforces legislation which is already repugnant to civil liberties. The Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 to 1985, have been widely abused.  The powers they gave to the Garda have helped to turn the Garda Special Branch into a political police force which has systematically harassed citizens, including this Deputy, engaged in open, legal and democratic political activity, and citizens with no political involvement of any kind.  This needs to be borne in mind when we hear guarantees that these strengthened draconian powers will be used selectively.  We should heed the plain speaking of people such as Mr. Johnny Walker of the Birmingham Six, who criticised these new laws. He said of the Judiciary in his case: &ldquo;They believed the police and believed we were liars, and it took sixteen and a half years to prove them wrong&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With one stroke, section 2 attacks the right to silence and reinforces the provision for the conviction of a person for membership of an unlawful organisation on the basis of the opinion of a senior garda.  The exercise of the right to silence can now be used to corroborate the word of the garda and can mean that the court can draw inferences from failure to mention any fact later relied on by the defence.  In effect, the right to silence is removed.  The basis on which the garda forms the opinion that a person is a member of an unlawful organisation remains in the realm of secret intelligence, closed to the scrutiny of the court.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is surely one of the most drastic legislative provisions ever brought before the Dáil.  It widens the definition of &ldquo;conduct giving rise to suspicion of membership&rdquo; to include &ldquo;association&rdquo;. <Col N="65" /> Deputy O'Malley, as Minister for Justice, introduced the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972.  At that time he made clear, first, that the intention of section 3 of that Act, which it is proposed to amend by section 4 of this Bill, was principally to ensure the use in evidence of the failure of a person to deny media reports that he or she was the member of an unlawful organisation; and second, that section 3(1)(a) of the Act, relating to conduct which could lead to a reasonable suspicion of membership, was nothing new in law since it defined conduct as statements or activities.  However, in this Bill, the insertion of the word &ldquo;associations&rdquo; gives the section an entirely new meaning.  This is guilt by association.  What use will be made of this provision in the days after the passage of the Bill?  Are people to be arrested and charged on the basis of their friendship or acquaintance with others?  A person may be convicted on the dubious basis of the uncorroborated word of a garda, and the association of others with him or her will cause a ripple effect of new convictions.  Another effect may be the unwillingness of people to come forward as alibi witnesses for fear they too may be charged under this provision.</P>
    <P>While I have Deputy O'Malley in mind I should place on record that, contrary to the inference in his contribution, to my knowledge not one prisoner released in recent times, in his words, as a &ldquo;sop&rdquo; to Sinn Féin, has committed or has been charged with the committal of any serious offence.</P>
    <P>The provision for the confiscation of property has been described by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties as &ldquo;an extraordinary departure from the existing law and seems almost like a form of reprisal&rdquo;.  Like other sections of this Bill, it seems highly likely it will be constitutionally challenged and may well be struck down.</P>
    <P>One of the most worrying aspects of the Bill is the creation of British-style conspiracy laws. These are vaguely defined, catch-all offences.  The most serious is modelled on a British law; it is the offence of directing, at any level, the activities of an unlawful organisation.  For this nebulous offence, which seems designed to convict people against whom no substantive evidence exists, the penalty is life imprisonment.  Similarly vague is the offence of possessing any article which could give rise to reasonable suspicion that it is to be used for offences under various Acts, mainly to do with explosives.  Are fertiliser bags and shovels to be used to secure convictions?</P>
    <P>The offence of withholding information is also vague as is the offence of collecting, recording or possessing information.  These conspiracy laws open up whole new avenues of possible abuse. The extension of the period of detention for questioning to three days when taken with the provisions regarding the right to silence create a scenario where innocent people could be wrongly convicted.  Detained in a Garda station for three days the suspect is allowed access to a solicitor but not during interrogation.  The person's silence <Col N="66" /> will be legally admissible and so will his or her failure to mention to the gardaí a fact which he or she may later rely on during his or her trial. With no legal requirement for interviews to be video and audio taped and in the absence of a solicitor, it will be almost impossible to prove that a person answered relevant questions.  It is easy to see how innocent people, confused and pressurised in an alien environment and unsure of their rights, could implicate themselves.  The danger of this occurring in the present climate is especially acute.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the amendments proposed to the legislation before the House will go far enough to nullify its fundamentally repressive nature and at least one of the amendments alluded to during the debate would make it even more draconian.  Laws which attack fundamental rights are being rushed through the Oireachtas and, as so often in the past, the damaging consequences may only come fully to light in years to come.</P>
    <P>The so-called main Opposition parties in this House have evaded their responsibility in facilitating the passage of this Bill.  I oppose it for the reasons I have outlined.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  I listened with interest to Deputies Higgins and Ó Caoláin.  It is not easy for them to object to the introduction of this legislation because the vast majority of parliamentarians in this House believe it is the right way to go.  Deputy Higgins stated on numerous occasions in this House that he represents the ordinary people and I often wonder about that. His view at this stage is out of step with the ordinary people I represent.  They believe this legislation is necessary after the horrendous crime committed in Omagh.  I represent that view and I come from a Border county that has strong allegiances towards nationalism and republicanism. The vast majority of constituents I represent were utterly mystified as to the reasons for the carnage in Omagh.  They believe the Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill, l998, is necessary to try to bring the perpetrators of that horrendous crime to justice.  They will support legislators and security forces in their efforts to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why does the Government deem it necessary to introduce this legislation now after the bombing in Omagh?  Did the security forces and the Government with their intelligence not know there was a threat of violence and that even with the British-Irish Agreement there were splinter groups in the republican and loyalist movements which could cause the mayhem experienced in Omagh.  Why is the Government introducing this legislation now after the atrocity in Omagh, <Col N="67" /> although it is better late than never?  Perhaps we took too much for granted because the threat of violence has been very much in existence for the past 20 to 30 years and legislation such as this has been necessary on numerous occasions.  I support this legislation because the Omagh bombing was an attack not alone on the people who were murdered but on democracy.  As democratically elected representatives, the only way we can defend our society is to implement legislation that will support and defend democracy.  The vast majority of people believe this Bill is necessary, and as a legislator I support their view.</P>
    <P>The provisional IRA could now play an important part in bringing about a peaceful solution if they were to negotiate some form of decommissioning.  I do not expect them to give up all their arms and explosives, but they have to show they are willing to walk away from violence. Any form of decommissioning would be an indication to all the parties in Northern Ireland and to the elected politicians here that the Provisional IRA are definitely on the road to peace and firmly believe violence is no longer the way to secure their objectives.</P>
    <P>If the security forces here feel this legislation is necessary it is imperative that we support that view by introducing it.  I know the security forces &mdash; the Garda Siochána and the Army &mdash; are ordinary human beings and that there have been miscarriages of justice in our own State and in Great Britain.  Human error is possible.  However, what happened in Omagh was an attack on democracy, and if the only thing we as legislators can do is introduce legislation to catch the people who committed that horrendous crime, we are doing a good day's work in introducing it.  If it is necessary that this legislation be ongoing for a number of years to stop violence in our society, then that is the proper way to deal with such violence.</P>

      <P>It is a sad day for Ireland that the Dáil had to be recalled to bring in this legislation, and it is not being introduced because people said prayers at Mass on Sundays.  I am surprised by Deputy Higgins's opposition but I am not surprised by Deputy Ó Caoláin's &mdash; I did not expect him to support the Bill because many of his friends from the past will be dealt with over the next few months.</P>
      <P>What happened two weeks ago must never happen again.  I come from a strong republican background and some of my people were killed in the struggle to set up this State.  My great granduncle helped to set up the Garda Síochána. I respect the Garda Síochána greatly and support them.  They have done a wonderful job.  They have always defended the people and supported democratically elected Governments.  People going about their daily duties, who do not break the law and do not have guns in their houses have nothing to fear from this legislation, but people who go around murdering people have to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> For many years we listened to the media, the people on the ground and the Garda Síochána talking about the drug barons.  Sunday newspapers published the names and photographs of people and identified them as drug barons.  In recent weeks the Sunday newspapers have identified people as armchair generals.  The Garda Síochána and people in their home towns know them and it is time to deal with those individuals. I hope the events of a fortnight ago never happen again in the name of Ireland and its people.  Such individuals do not represent anybody.</P>
    <P>The Government and Deputies are democratically elected by the people who decided in the referendum on the British-Irish Agreement that they wanted peace and no more bombing. Mr. Gerry Adams and Mr. Martin McGuinness are tied into the peace process and I welcome the statement yesterday.  However, I hope they will deal with their comrades who call themselves the Real IRA.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Members of the House dictate events.  The Real IRA has no say.  It is not elected by anybody.  The people have spoken and decided that they do not want any more violence.  The peace process is in place and they want it implemented.</P>
    <P>There are many former Ministers for Justice, including Deputy O'Malley who was a good Minister for Justice and was not afraid to take on the Provisionals.  Former Deputies Paddy Cooney and Ray Burke are other former Ministers for Justice who were not afraid to deal with similar problems when they arose.  The current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform using the powers contained in the Bill and working in conjunction with the Garda Síochána, will not be afraid to deal with the armchair generals who are cowards and murderers and who do not speak for anybody but themselves.  There is no respect for those individuals; only a small minority wants them.</P>
    <P>I hope those people will be dealt with after the legislation is passed.  The &ldquo;nod and wink&rdquo; attitude has operated for too long and these people must be dealt with now if we do not want a continuation of violence for the next 25 years.  The Sunday newspapers have identified and named them and the Garda Síochána know them.  I hope the Bill will ensure they are lifted off the streets.</P>
    <P>The individuals involved became frightened in recent weeks and dumped a number of devices in Dundalk which were ready to be used to bomb more innocent people.  The Minister has my full support in dealing with those individuals.  I speak on behalf of ordinary people and they want this legislation enacted to deal with the thugs.  They do not want them to be in a position to bomb or murder any more people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">

      <P>I also support the legislation.  It is regrettable that it is necessary to recall the Dáil during the summer recess to deal with this matter almost five months after the British-Irish Agreement was reached.  We never envisaged that the events in Omagh would take place.  We thought <Col N="69" /> we had seen the end of violence once and for all. However, some people will not listen.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister's actions and my party will support the Bill.  I take exception to Deputy Ó Caolain's remarks about the role of the main Opposition party.  I was elected to represent the people and they want this legislation enacted. They want those involved dealt with and I want the Minister to deal with them when he has the powers to do so.</P>
      <P>I am not being wise in hindsight, but the Omagh tragedy should not have happened.  I have read accounts which state that a monitoring system was in place.  The Government directed that certain people whom the security forces suspected were still active were to be monitored. That was a bad decision.</P>
      <P>I am concerned because numerous speakers, including the Minister, said this matter involves only a small number of people.  We should not be foolish.  It does not only involve a small number of people.  It involves the IRA which has been operational for the past 25 years.  The old IRA was respected because it worked for the country and fought to have British rule lifted.  The members of the old IRA believed sincerely in what they did.  No matter what letter the bandits who have emerged in the past 25 years choose they are the same animal.  We have had the Old IRA, the Official IRA, the Provisional IRA and now the Real IRA.  What will come next &mdash; the Definitive IRA or the New IRA?  They must be dealt with effectively and put behind bars so that we can feel safe and get on with our lives.</P>
      <P>I am aware, as someone who lives close to the Border, that the people of Northern Ireland want to do business with us.  On Saturday in a ceremony outside Belturbet, County Cavan, to mark the restoration of a bridge blown up over 25 years ago dividing the peoples of counties Fermanagh and Cavan, Senator George Mitchell will lay the first stone.  This is a positive step but unless the IRA in all its forms is dealt with effectively by the security forces the success of this endeavour will not be ensured.  I do not want to listen to Deputy Ó Caoláin ask if he is guilty if he has a drink or shakes hands with them.  It is not as simple as that.  It is a matter of providing support. The message must be sent loud and clear that the farms on which arms are hidden will be confiscated. In this way we will tackle the root causes of the problem and can look forward to a new beginning.</P>

      <P>The necessity to recall the Dáil in these circumstances is another depressing calendar addition to our nation's history.  For many there was movement towards political co-operation <Col N="70" /> and a resolution of the conflict through peaceful means which culminated after many long and difficult months in the British-Irish Agreement.  The achievement of agreement was not inevitable, even given all the work done by the various party leaders.  The ensuing euphoria and the outcome of the referendum which was carried with overwhelming support, should have sent a clear message to anyone interested in the concept of democracy that the people wanted peace.</P>
      <P>Where does democracy lie?  On 15 August hundreds of ordinary citizens headed towards Omagh &mdash; some on a cultural visit, others to buy school outfits for their children, to celebrate a birthday or a new job, to be part of the annual religious procession in honour of the Assumption or just browse on a busy Saturday afternoon &mdash; a cross-section of life which was turned upside down and torn inside out in one fell swoop.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy for Donegal North-East, I express my sincere sympathy to the Doherty, Barker and McLaughlin families, the families of Oran, Sean and James who did not return alive to the Inishowen peninsula.  I extend my sympathy to the families of their Spanish friends, Fernando and Rocia, who also died.  I sympathise with all the other families whose loved ones died or were injured.</P>
      <P>The families in Buncrana of those who died or were injured would like me to take the opportunity to express their gratitude to the people of Omagh, the surgeons, doctors, nurses, emergency services and lay people, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the bomb.  Everyone I spoke to expressed utter astonishment at the level of energy and hospitality from people at a time of great chaos and confusion.  They also asked me to commend the work done by both the RUC and the Garda which facilitated the movement of large funeral corte ges at various times during the week.  The tremendous support and leadership the clergy gave to all involved was unsurpassable. On behalf of the families I also thank the many dignitaries, personalities and thousands of others from all walks of life who have been there for the families and who continue to support them in a time of great distress.</P>
      <P>Within the large corte ges on the streets throughout that week, it was noted that while not a word was spoken, everything was said in the silence of thousands of people.  The glow of candles could not exorcise the darkness.  The question that hung in the air was simple: why?  Why did we have this darkness again, given the British-Irish Agreement and the resounding wish of the people to move forward in a peaceful manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Father Shane Bradley spoke in his homily at the funeral of the three young boys about the strange and alien place that Buncrana had been turned into &mdash; a land of dark shadow and appalling pain, an eerie place, lonely, desolate and full of inconsolable torment.  These words encompassed, as close as words could, the experience <Col N="71" /> one had on entering our peninsula.  It was also felt by those who had lived through previous bombings and I have no doubt it was the same sensation in all the parishes and townlands surrounding Omagh and in Spain.</P>
    <P>In the spontaneity of the applause for Bishop Seamus Hegarty's words of encouragement for David Trimble, Seamus Mallon, the new Assembly and the furthering of the peace process lay the confirmation of how those thousands of people wish to move forward.  The British-Irish Agreement is the only alternative.  Nobody who came close to the events of Omagh on 15 August wants to see another family go through the anguish and hurt that many of these families will go through for a long time to come.  All of us must pursue the message of the Agreement and advocate the challenge of peaceful means at every opportunity.  The price of 15 August was a high one for all of us and we cannot let it happen again.</P>
    <P>Returning to where I began, it is truly sad to have to make this amendment to the Offences Against the State Act.  It goes without saying that while a swift and decisive reaction to events such as those in Omagh is necessary, it is also important that adequate care is taken in presenting legislation that will be implemented in a fair and just manner.  I commend the Bill and trust that the necessity for such legislation becomes a part of history that the island can move positively away from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the funeral in Omagh of Mrs. Geraldine Breslin and I decided then not to let this occasion pass without saying what was on my mind.  Two things struck me when I was in the church.  First, I only wished that those who planted the bomb could be there to see the grief of the family, relatives and friends and to experience the sheer agony and anguish in the church and throughout the town of Omagh. That was but one of many funerals.  I wished that the bombers could have been there to see the havoc they had wrought on decent people.</P>
      <P>My second feeling was that now more than ever the Agreement must work.  I came out of the church thinking that whatever doubts exist, however people might try to undermine it or whatever naysayers think, we owe it to the person being carried out of the church and the 27 others to make the peace agreement stick.  We should send that message from this House.  The sense of unity in the House today is not an accident.  It is important to note a virtually unanimous voice on all sides of this democratic assembly for the world to hear, although it will probably pick up only sound bites.  The world will see that virtually all parties in the Irish Parliament will not tolerate such people, will stamp them out and will make the peace agreement work.  That sense of unity is critical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must respond to Omagh and we are doing so in two ways.  We must respond in terms of <Col N="72" /> security and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is doing so today by introducing extremely tough legislation which gives the Garda the weapons it needs to fight these desperate people.  We also need to respond politically, which we are also doing by making the peace agreement work.  I welcomed Gerry Adams's statement yesterday which was very significant. He said violence was at an end.  Taken with Martin McGuinness's meetings with the de Chastelain commission about decommissioning, one sees some genuine movement in that area.</P>
    <P>For two years we painstakingly negotiated a peace agreement with many false dawns.  We had to go back and rework.  We took the Agreement to a referendum, North and South, and established an Assembly.  The next step is get the executive in place from which we will get the establishment of cross-Border bodies.  We must move on; we cannot stop the process now.  The next step is to get the shadow executive in place and critical in that regard is a meeting between Mr. Adams and Mr. Trimble very soon.  Given how far we, the Unionist population and Mr. Adams's people, for want of a better word, have come, it is a little silly that those two protagonists cannot meet face to face and try to move this process forward.  I believe they will do so in the not too distant future.  That will open the door for the shadow executive to be appointed.  Once that executive gets going, we can take it from there.</P>
    <P>Omagh really means that more than ever the peace deal we have put in place must work.  We owe it to those who died, their families, friends and relations to do no less than make it work.  I am encouraged by what Mr. Adams said and by Mr. McGuinness's discussions with the decommissioning commission.  I hope Mr. Clinton's visit will give further momentum so that in a short period the executive will be in place and we can take it from there.  We should get on with the peace agreement.</P>

      <P>I visited Northern Ireland on many occasions.  The first time I visited there I was 16 years of age and it was the high point of my life at that time.  I found the people warm and friendly and I do not believe they have changed. What has changed is the political climate of the Six Counties, and for the worst at this time.  In the past 30 years we have seen unbelievable changes with television, radio and press bringing regular news to us from the stricken province.  We hear how so-called patriots have out done each other in proving their devotion to their different causes.  They have killed and maimed the innocent and have justified their evil acts by pro-claiming they are acting on our behalf, but they do not speak for me.  We hear of atrocities and counter atrocities committed in the name of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The horrific and outrageous campaign was lately indelibly marked by the senseless murder by loyalists of the three young boys and the brutal killing by the Real IRA over two weeks ago of <Col N="73" /> 28 people in Omagh.  The revulsion felt by the general public on both occasions was expressed instantly and unanimously.  It showed clearly that those murderers do not act on our behalf and they certainly do not represent the massive majority throughout this island that voted for the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, all the Members of the Dáil, the British Prime Minister, his Government and the vast majority of politicians in the North have been unequivocal in their support of peace in Ireland's 32 counties.  We cannot allow our people to be further terrorised by the dissident groups who initiate the slaughter.  Their leaders have been active in promoting their individual campaigns. The same leaders have been equally active in trying to distance themselves from the backlash of outraged public opinion that has become even more evident since the murder of the three Quinn boys and the carnage in Omagh.</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that some of these people have made public statements asking for the protection of the law for their young families following threats made upon their children. Those threats came as a result of the parents' open espousal of the cause of the Real IRA and their public utterances in support of the continuation of the campaign of violence.  They have consistently and openly advocated opposition to the laws of this land.</P>
    <P>The young children of these people of violence should not be targeted; they did not do any wrong.  However, the young children of other families should not be maimed for life or killed following the bombing of public places.</P>
    <P>I find it equally difficult to understand the reaction of groups who say that the laws being introduced now will infringe civil rights.  There is no more sacred civil right than the right to life.  Why should young and old people be denied the right to a peaceful existence?  Do those groups who protest against this amendment believe the murderers who perpetrated these evil killings will go away of their own accord?  Did they go away following the different horrors we have experienced over the past 30 years?</P>
    <P>I support the legislation.  I had much more to say but I realise time is against us today in that each Member has only a few minutes to contribute. We will not allow the killers to turn back the clock.  I never again want to witness the tears of the families of the innocent.  I support the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in their decision to introduce this amendment to the legislation.</P>

      <P>I give my sympathy and prayerful support to all the victims of the Omagh bombing, not just to those who lost loved ones through <Col N="74" /> death but also the injured and all who will carry the trauma of the Omagh bomb to their graves.</P>
      <P>There are few in this House &mdash; I accept that you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, are one of them &mdash; who really understand the way in which the people of Omagh district have been affected by the work of a few evil, depraved people.  I attended the prayer service in Monaghan town where thousands of people came out in genuine sympathy for what had happened to men, women and children of all political and religious backgrounds from both parts of this island and also from Spain.  However, the difference between the assembled people in Monaghan and those at the funerals in Omagh had to be witnessed to be understood.</P>
      <P>If those who planned and planted the bomb intended to divide the people of Omagh, they failed.  The Church leaders, emergency staff, medical teams and their support backup, together with the security forces, deserve all our praise and thanks for the way they dealt with this unreal situation.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill although I had hoped that with the signing of the British-Irish Agreement it would not have been necessary.  The Bill is not an attack on civil liberties, as some have said here. Those who planned and planted the bomb took away the lives of 30 people in Omagh and damaged the lives of hundreds of others without thought to their right to either life or liberty. Avril Monaghan, together with her unborn twins, her daughter and her mother, and Fred White and his son are but two examples of families where liberty and life were taken without any due legal process.</P>
      <P>Some people in this House believe the Bill is not necessary as public opinion has forced underground the Real IRA and others.  Deputy Ó Caoláin criticised my party leader, Deputy John Bruton, for his lack of commitment to the peace process simply because he asked relevant questions. Deputy Bruton, like other leaders in the House, has worked hard, both in Government and in Opposition, to bring people from every background into a structure where they can build trust and understanding for the future.  He led support for and urged all to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for the British-Irish Agreement.  Why did Deputy Ó Caoláin not give any public guidance to his people at that vital time?  We cannot sit on the fence regarding the Real IRA or any such group.  We must be either for or against peace.</P>
      <P>My only worry regarding this Government is that, in the middle of the bombings of Portadown, Moira, Banbridge and others, which only by the grace of God did not have the same consequences as Omagh, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, decided to close the Army barracks in Castleblaney without consultation.  This was the wrong message at such a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, his Department, the Taoiseach and all others who are bringing forward this unfortunate but necessary legislation.  There are still punishment <Col N="75" /> beatings and there are those who still tacitly support the Real IRA and perhaps the IRA, which has not yet given up any bombs or bullets. I welcome the fact that, in the past few days, there has been a change of heart evident in the words uttered by the Sinn Féin leadership and that after many years, but only after the Omagh bombing, Gerry Adams saw fit to condemn an atrocity.  It was no different from the one in Enniskillen, the one in Derry city or any others but the Sinn Féin leadership has at last realised that condemnation of such actions is important.  The removal of the bomb and the bullet by some form of decommissioning is also important.</P>
    <P>Much effort has been put into the British-Irish Agreement.  One thing which was clear from Omagh to those of us who mixed with ordinary people during the sad funerals was that they do not want any other town or city or any other person to suffer as they have.  They want to see the Agreement work.  However, people cannot choose parts of the Agreement, such as the release of prisoners, and then not agree to decommission.  I want to see David Trimble, Gerry Adams and others negotiating and bringing the Agreement to a point where we can live and work together.  People cannot pick and choose from what is a bilateral agreement.  I hope that, through the legislation we pass today, those who want to wreck the Agreement will be taken out once and for all and that we can live together and have hope for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The measures before the House are ones which each and every citizen would prefer were not called for.  The actions of the murderers of Omagh not only call but scream for measures such as these to be placed on the Statute Book.  It may appear harsh that the State has responded by the introduction of this legislation which replaces the responsibility on individuals to account for their actions and to explain themselves when there are reasonable grounds for the security forces to believe that there is a question for them to answer.  It is hard for parents to bury innocent children.  Those who indiscriminately took the lives of the young, old, mothers, fathers, children and the unborn must not be allowed to continue to take the fundamental civil liberty of life from other people.</P>
      <P>The decision to place a time limit on the application of this legislation is of real importance.  The State is not conferring totalitarian powers on itself, rather it is enacting laws to allow and ensure liberty.  I hope these measures will be successful and that there will be no need to extend them beyond the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Caution must always be exercised when enacting legislation and consideration must be given to the rights of all who may be affected. That is what a good and caring society ought to do.  These repugnant terrorists showed no care or compassion.  They took life and for what?  It is <Col N="76" /> right that those who recruit, train and direct unlawful organisations are punished and that those who use their premises for the purposes of terrorism are severely punished and denied the right to that property.  Citizenship confers rights but it also confers duties, one of which is to respect the rights of others.  Those who refuse to accept their duties must not be allowed to abuse the rights of others.  Thirty people lost their lives and their families lost their loved ones.  Every parent has the right to see his or her children grow up, mature and develop.  Communities have a right to live in peace without the frightful scars which this terrible bombing has inflicted.</P>
    <P>Through the ballot box, the people of Ireland, North and South, have stated that they want peace and to live and work in harmony.  They do not want to see people cheated out of life, maimed, nor families torn apart, be they Catholic, Protestant or dissenter.  The people want to be safe and they want their families and friends to be likewise.  To achieve this, they are prepared to accept that it is necessary to implement this legislation.  It is important that it be seen that this legislation is not open to abuse and the Bill affords such protection.</P>
    <P>Many of my constituents have asked why the Government failed to enact this legislation prior to the summer recess if it was aware of the danger posed by these foolish, misguided people.  The people have had enough.  They are no longer prepared to accept legislative inaction.  They have told their TDs to act responsibly and introduce laws to protect them, their families and the people of this island and not to expose them to the hurt, sorrow and shame which this country has endured in recent weeks.  That is not to say they are prepared to allow the State, the Garda Síochána, the Army or the courts to act unreasonably. People want peace.  We are their political leaders and we must do all possible to stop this small band of foolish people from depriving anyone else of the most basic human right.  In so doing we must always be aware of the rights of all and introduce laws which afford the maximum protection to the innocent but which are not so weak as to allow the guilty to side-step the courts.</P>
    <P>It is right that it be deemed an offence to withhold information.  There is an obligation on everyone to be honest and forthright.  Any person who has the smallest piece of information which may assist the State in preventing murder and violent crime must give that information.  Those who do not do so are, and will be seen to be, guilty of evil crimes.</P>

      <P>Our hearts go out to those bereaved and injured in Omagh, Donegal, Spain and elsewhere over the past 30 years and all victims of terrible acts of horror.  Unless one has been personally affected by such horror it is hard to imagine what it must be like for parents to face their children's empty beds or children to have to face the rest of their lives with the memory that their mother or father was slaughtered.  Thousands <Col N="77" /> have died and thousands more have had their lives ruined by physical or emotional damage over the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, said he wished the bombers could be present at the funerals to see the grief.  I wonder whether it would have made a difference to them. The bombers left a car loaded with explosives in the centre of a market town.  If they were patriots they would not have had the bomb there at all. They say the warning went wrong.  There is no justification for that.  They ran and allowed the atrocity to happen.  Deputy Jim Higgins said they meant it to happen and I think he is right, they meant the slaughter to occur.  This horror is worse than we realise.  If we contemplate that, we are dealing with a horror even greater than I can take on board.  This organisation endeavoured to put a large bomb in a car ferry.  Imagine what would have happened if it went off in the middle of the Irish Sea.  I support the legislation being introduced today.  It is time the so-called patriots were rounded up and locked up.</P>
      <P>The Irish people, North and South, have voted in a democratic referendum and have directed that violence must end for good.  Terrorists who reach back to the 1918 election to justify, by misguided and flawed reasoning, a mandate to carry out an armed struggle have been ordered by the people or Ireland to stop.  It is the wish of the people that the war be declared over for good and that all weapons be decommissioned.  All those who are for peace must isolate people who are for violence by declaring for peace.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach, my colleagues in Government and all the other Members who, today and in the immediate aftermath of the Omagh tragedy, have been united in their condemnation of this heinous crime.</P>
      <P>Never in the 30 years of violence and death which has gripped Northern Ireland, have we witnessed such carnage as was unleashed on Omagh on that Saturday afternoon only a few weeks ago. Never, in the history of the Northern Ireland troubles, were so many innocent men, women and children, from North and South, from Ireland and abroad, killed in such a brutal and cold blooded way.  Never were so many people injured and never was the sense of shock and grief across all of Ireland so palpable and so heart felt as now.</P>
      <P>In the days immediately following the Omagh atrocity, in my own city of Waterford which is far removed from the North, the palpable sense of horror and disbelief was evident on the face of everyone with whom I came in contact.  The Mayor of Waterford, councillor Brian Swift, opened a book of condolence &mdash; which I signed &mdash; which allowed all the people of the Waterford to express their sympathy in a tangible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all only too familiar with the sight on our television screens of atrocities such as Greysteel and the Shankill Road bombings.  What made <Col N="78" /> the Omagh bombing so different and in many ways much worse was that ordinary people, right across this island, following on from the Agreement, had begun to hope and believe that such atrocities, after 30 years of bloody conflict, were finally at an end.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Omagh bombing was not only to injure and kill innocent people but to destroy people's hopes and dreams for a peaceful and better future.  We cannot allow that to happen. Gradually over the course of the past year, culminating in the signing of the Agreement by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, things had been getting better.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference which I attended earlier in the year the determination to work together, even over the most difficult of issues, to reach agreement for the common good was very much in evidence, was very real and very genuine.</P>
    <P>It is this determination, which has been shown by both the Irish and British Governments to work together to achieve change and to achieve a peaceful settlement in Northern Ireland, which has frightened extremists such as those who carried out the Omagh bombing.</P>
    <P>The only way we can truly and finally defeat these extremists is to continue to have both Governments working ever more closely together.  I welcome the fact that, just as the Oireachtas has been called back in special session to debate new security legislation, so too the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, has recalled the British parliament today to debate similar security measures.  That both parliaments are meeting on the same day to discuss similar measures is evidence of the high level of trust and co-operation which the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have built up over the past year.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said, the first and best way to fight the perpetrators of such crimes as the Omagh bombing is to resolutely reaffirm our commitment to the British-Irish Agreement, as the Government has done.  I fully support the Taoiseach and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in bringing proposals before the House which seek to strengthen and amend the Offences against the State Acts, 1939-85.  The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has already outlined the details of the changes and I do not intend dwelling on them.</P>
    <P>As I have said on previous occasions, the economic dynamic which was released as a result of the first ceasefire was very significant and must not be lost.  Many people from the South visited the North, probably for the first time in many cases.  Tourism in general in Northern Ireland recorded an upsurge.  Foreign direct investment by multinationals in the North was stimulated with the active support of the United States administration.  North-South trade grew significantly to such a level that the Republic became the third largest investor in Northern Ireland after Britain and the United States.  All of this resulted in significant employment creation which <Col N="79" /> has enabled ordinary people's lives to be much improved.</P>
    <P>The larger island market can provide for a whole range of economic synergy and for the development and consolidation of strong successful companies.  In the longer term both economies must become less dependent on external investment and assistance and rely more on strong indigenous sectors.  For all this to happen, a high level of business confidence is necessary, whereby companies North and South can feel free to make business decisions without the fear of terrorist violence.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the Omagh bomb, the perpetrators of the crime claimed their intended target was the business premises and commercial activities in Omagh town.  Even if this was so, it is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>For things to change in Northern Ireland and for the lives of ordinary people to get better, there must be economic as well as political development.  The North-South structures provided for in the British-Irish Agreement can over time provide a strong underpinning for developments across a wide range of economic areas. Business confidence must also be strong and this can only come about when bombings and tragedies, such as that in Omagh, no longer occur.</P>
    <P>I fully support my colleague and the Government in the measures brought before the House.</P>

      <P>It is with a heavy heart that I support the measures being introduced.  They are necessary and form an appropriate response to the murder of the three Quinn boys and the savagery in Omagh.  They show our firm intent not to tolerate such activity and our complete solidarity with the vast majority of the people on the island who clearly and unequivocally said they wanted no more bombings.  The measures are necessary because as legislators we must be seen to strongly underwrite the will of all the people on this issue.</P>
      <P>My concern is that what we do here today is also dangerous.  Interference with civil liberties should only be done with extreme reluctance and great care.  We all recognise that these are special powers and we know why they are necessary and what we want to achieve by them, namely, empowerment of the Garda and the justice system to arrest, bring to trial and convict those guilty of planning, executing and sustaining acts such as the Omagh bombing.  However, it is not Members of the House who will implement the measures.  Neither is it Members who will implement the equivalent measures in Northern Ireland.  Any abuse of the powers would be disastrous for future progress towards peace and a political settlement on the island.  Even one case would be enough to damage confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are improving on a special and temporary basis the powers given to the Garda and the courts to deal with paramilitary organisations.  I again stress that with special powers come special <Col N="80" /> responsibilities.  Despite the importance of the legislation it will only play a very small part in securing peace and progress in Northern Ireland. Full, early and generous implementation of the Agreement is the only guarantee of stability and progress.  In this regard I wholeheartedly welcome the statement issued yesterday evening by Sinn Féin which gave a clear commitment to peaceful and democratic means.  Real progress is being made: our responsibility is to foster the progress and maintain the pace of change.</P>
    <P>We should never underestimate the fear which exists on both sides of the community in Northern Ireland and it will take time to remove the fear and mistrust.  Far more important, ongoing evidence of progress and a delivery on the cornerstone of the Agreement, namely, parity of esteem, is necessary.  Because of the nature of this legislation, I urge the Minister to consider establishing an outside watchdog which would have a role in reporting on implementation of this legislation. Implementation of the legislation is a matter for the gardaí and the courts and cannot be open to outside pressure or interference but, because the measures represent a curtailment of civil liberties, it would be appropriate that cases be reported to the human rights commission to be established under the British-Irish Agreement. This requirement should not delay implementation of the legislation.  The commission would be in a position to express concerns it feels appropriate. It would provide a public assurance that special powers were being properly implemented and it would strengthen the legislation before us today.</P>
    <P>In contrast to Deputy O'Malley, it saddens me deeply that on 1 January 2000 these special powers will still be on our Statute Book.  I hope the effect of this legislation can be so targeted and so effective that we can remove it before that date. I urge the Minister to make specific provision which would allow him to bring a motion before the Oireachtas to remove these provisions at a time which he considers appropriate.  This would provide an impetus not to allow the legislation to continue to its natural end on 31 December 2000.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the Opposition why he feels it is helpful to the peace process to try to rewrite the British-Irish Agreement through the columns of the daily newspapers.  Why does he find it appropriate to encourage isolation and polarisation on the sensitive issues of decommissioning and the establishment of the executive?  These are not issues for party politics.</P>
    <P>I ask our national media, the Independent Group in particular, why they describe those who perpetrated atrocities such as the Omagh bombing as the last remaining republican groups and republican sources.  This gives credence to the suggestion that these people are the core of republicanism.  They are not.  I am a republican and a Nationalist and proud of it.  I am a member of the largest republican party in this country.  I believe that erroneous descriptions such as these <Col N="81" /> give a status to the groups involved and encourage a belief that they have a legitimate message.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise three points concerning the legislation before us and before the British Parliament in Westminster.  These measures are necessary but they will play only a small part in ending paramilitary violence on this island.  Full and early implementation of the British-Irish Agreement will do far more.  When the people of Ireland from all traditions walk down the road together, the paramilitaries will be left behind. These measures place a grave onus on the Garda Síochána, the RUC and others to whom extra powers are being given.  Abuse of these powers will end peace and any hope of progress.  Any person abusing these powers will be guilty of an even greater crime than those we are targeting today.</P>
    <P>Terence McSwiney, who died on hunger strike in 1920, left us a phrase which has been the property of republicans ever since: &ldquo;It is not those who inflict the most but those who suffer the most who will endure.&rdquo; I address this phrase to those in the so-called Real IRA and others who persist with the bomb and the bullet.  We have suffered enough.  The time has come to turn the suffering around and use it as a positive tool to build our future.  We need suffer no more to achieve our aim of an Ireland united in its people and its territory.  The time has come to stop, not only because of Omagh but because the people of Ireland, North and South, Nationalist and Unionist, Catholic and Protestant, have said loudly, clearly and without equivocation that it must stop.</P>

      <P>This legislation has been prompted by the Omagh bombing, an atrocity which all right thinking people roundly condemn. The bombing is in stark contrast to the political developments in Ireland and the new relationship which exists between the British and Irish Governments.  Mr. Adams has given a sincere indication that he believes IRA violence is at an end.  Some Members opposite may find his statement incomplete but it should be accepted for what it is.  If it is accepted it will be followed by fuller expressions from the same quarter.  Now is not the right time for semantics or word play.</P>
      <P>Many might think that introducing legislation such as this is indicative of a return to the dark days of atrocity piled upon atrocity, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Those who advocate and use violence for political ends are thoroughly marginalised, so much so that this legislation, while necessary, may not last long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inevitably, debates such as this become dominated by views on whether violence is justified in any circumstances.  The clear message from the two referenda results is that it is not and nobody calling himself or herself a republican could argue otherwise.  Over the years, republicans of various hues have sought to justify violence by recourse to history, British occupation and other diverse reasons.  The current circumstances belie those <Col N="82" /> previous justifications.  We are at a stage where coercion and repression are at an end and where the British Government stands willing to facilitate a united Ireland if that is the express wish of the Irish people.  The poll taken on Good Friday is, in spite of the views of those who nit-pick on this point, a real and <i>de facto</i> expression of self-determination by the Irish people.  Those in the so-called Real IRA should take careful note of that demonstrable fact.</P>
    <P>My only concern in regard to this legislation is that it should be subjected to more regular review.  Perhaps when it comes up for review in the year 2000, the Minister will take this into consideration. I am also concerned at how the gardaí will use the new powers conferred on them.  I am sure the Minister will clarify on Committee Stage the lines within which the legislation will operate.</P>

      <P>I do not like to say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; but for 16 years I have opposed the IRA in all its forms, in my native town of Dundalk in County Louth in general and in this Chamber. Only two months ago, I was the only Deputy in this House to oppose the release of prisoners.  I did so because of my total opposition to terrorism and my belief that it should never be rewarded. Having said that, I wish to express my total support for the measures the Minister is introducing today.  However, it is like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.</P>
      <P>The tragedy of Omagh in which so many women and children were killed was such that violent republicanism will be dead in Ireland for several years to come.  The rats who have murdered people for the past 30 years have retreated into their bolt holes.  Some of them will hopefully be bolted up for good but some will escape.  I do not believe violent republicanism is dead.  Like Dracula, it would be necessary to drive a stake through its breast to achieve that.</P>
      <P>We should seek to inculcate in our people a spirit of nationalism as opposed to republicanism. Republicanism equates with violence.  Part of the problem is that generations of Irish people have been brought up listening to mythical teachings in the schools.  We need to foster the kind of nationalism demonstrated by John Redmond, a man who sought a united Ireland through peaceful means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 30 years, we have witnessed the appeasement of terror in this country.  Politicians are currently jumping on the bandwagon following the horrific slaughter at Omagh.  Why were these measures not introduced 30 years ago?  Why were they not introduced after Enniskillen in which an equally horrendous assault occurred?  Why was action not taken after Warrenpoint in which 18 young men were butchered?  The Government <Col N="83" /> was aware of the perpetrators in that instance but the DPP refused to press charges, probably for political reasons.  I indict all Governments over the past 30 years, including my own, for being soft on terrorism.  They were constantly looking over their shoulders to see if people would approve of the introduction of repressive measures or if such action would be considered politically correct.  I am not politically correct and over the past 16 years I have unambiguously opposed the IRA &mdash; sometimes under threat to my life and my town.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Justice, Mr. Paddy Cooney, Deputy O'Malley and Deputy John Bruton are the only people in this House with the political balls to address this problem.  I hope time will show that the Minister has the same courage. These measures we have been forced to take are an indication of how much out of control this country has been for the past 30 years when death stalked the land &mdash; death promoted by Adams and McGuinness, the IRA's chief of staff, who are guilty by association of the deaths of hundreds of Irish people.  Now they are being hailed as international statesmen.  They are the bastards who have brought Ireland to its knees.  They were a cause of this horrendous tragedy and now they pose as international statesmen because they have been sung a song by the British Government, who sing a different song to everybody &mdash; including the loyalists &mdash; and have done for many years.</P>
    <P>Like everyone else I want a peaceful Ireland.  I live in the front theatre of it, just two miles from the Border.  I have known people from both sides of the Border who have lost their lives, people who have been murdered by various terrorist gangs while we stood idly by.  Terrorism has to be confronted and pious platitudes and pleas for people to sit down and rationalise are simply not enough.  There must be a deterrent factor.  Some time in the future dissent will occur in the Assembly and the IRA terrorists will emerge from their hideaways to kill again.  We must accept that society has to be protected by Governments and they should have the courage to govern without looking over their shoulders to see if it is politically expedient to do so.</P>
    <P>I wish to dissociate myself from the comments made by Deputy Ó Caoláin when he castigated the Garda Síochána.  The organisation to which he belongs has taken the lives of 16 gardaí and seven members of the Irish Army.  That is a shameful record.  He should hang his head in shame when he makes comments in relation to the fairness of the Garda.</P>
    <P>These measures in a normal society would not be necessary but, sadly, we have to recognise that we live in an abnormal society and it is 30 years too late for many people.  The Omagh bombing took the lives of 28 people and left many more maimed for life.  There have been 3,700 people killed in the North and their lives were as valuable as those of the victims of Omagh.  I commend the Minister for belatedly bringing in these <Col N="84" /> measures and I indict my own party for its failure to do so in the years in which it was in power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation.  It is four months since the British-Irish Agreement and during that time there have been many other bomb efforts in the North and attempts were made to send bombs to the UK.  It is regrettable that we waited so long to introduce this Bill.  Perhaps we were distracted by the euphoria that followed the British-Irish Agreement.  The Real IRA and the Continuity IRA had clearly stated that they would continue their operations because they did not support the Agreement. However, it is sad to think that the tragedy of Omagh which had a palpable resonance throughout the country has brought us back here to debate legislation.  Our party supports this legislation and it irks me a great deal when I hear people criticising our leader, Deputy Bruton.  We have always been known as a party which supports law and order.  We have never deviated in our support in this type of situation.  Unlike many others, we believe Sinn Féin and the IRA are the same, as are the Thirty-two County Sovereignty Committee and the Real IRA.  It is interesting to note that Gerry Adams, his party, the Thirty-two County Sovereignty Committee and the Real IRA, who perpetrated this terrible atrocity, have condemned this legislation.  I would like to think that the spirit of co-operation which exists on this side of the House is responded to by the Government and that we do not hear unfair criticism of a party leader who has always been responsible and spoken his mind.</P>
      <P>It is an honour to speak after Deputy McGahon.  I admire him because he was not afraid to speak out at a difficult time when the country was full of those with a sneaking regard for the IRA cause.  I ask the Minister to implore his colleague, John Wilson, to meet the families of those who have lost their lives as soon as possible.  The Minister is aware of my concerns, particularly at having to stomach the measure in the Agreement which relates to the capital murder of gardaí.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  In an ideal world this legislation would not be necessary.  However, we are far from that ideal world and have been for the past 30 or 40 years.  The murder of men, women and children in Omagh over two weeks ago shocked and sickened every right thinking citizen not only on this island but throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is necessary and it must remain on the Statute Book for as long as there are groups in society who perpetrate such horrific and murderous acts against the people of this island.  The legislation is being introduced at a time when there is widespread demand for this action from the general public, unlike in the past when efforts were made to introduce necessary emergency legislation and people were not ready. At that time, they did not realise that the efforts <Col N="85" /> of the Government were necessary to stem the growing tendency towards violence by the IRA and subversives.  I welcome the Minister's and the Taoiseach's clear declaration of their intention to destroy the existence of violent fringe groups in society.</P>
    <P>In the past there was an ambivalence towards republican activities and anything that was antiBritish was lauded.  This ambivalence existed in the Fianna Fáil Party and was partly responsible for the failure of many Government efforts to eradicate these groups from our society.</P>
    <P>I support the Government's provisions and I have full confidence in the ability and capacity of the Garda to fairly implement the new powers given to them by this new legislation.</P>
    <P>It is unfair of Members to compare the work of the Garda with the failure of the British and Northern Irish police forces in the past.  We have all learnt from past misdeeds.  We must realise that the lives of many gardaí have been taken by these subversives.  This must be put in the proper context.  Gardaí must perform their duties in a proper fashion and implement the powers given to them by this legislation in a fair way.  It is also important to show full commitment to the British-Irish Agreement by passing this legislation.  I hope it will enable all people on this island to live in harmony so that the wounds of past deeds can heal in a new environment of peace and goodwill.</P>

      <P>The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, believes that the people who conceived, plotted, organised and executed the Omagh bombing are murderers who can claim no conceivable justification for their recklessness and their deeds.  We believe the group is motivated by an essentially racist hatred that amounts to fascism. The self-styled Real IRA are fascists; I will not use the Irish language name they have adopted, Óglaigh na hÉireann, as to do so would be a slur on the men and women of our Defence Forces.  I hope the Minister for Defence will address this issue in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever about the callousness of the deed &mdash; the deaths, maiming and mayhem &mdash; the perpetrators had a political point to make.  They appear to believe that by their murderous incivility they can reduce this society, which is in the process of dramatic political renewal and transformation, and return it to the level of exacting raw retribution and vengeance.  The way out of the morass into which the Real IRA wishes to force us is through vigorously implementing the British-Irish Agreement, especially its human rights provisions.  In future, therefore, everybody <Col N="86" /> can be confident that their grievances can be met by political and legal means and that if they are accused of an offence, even a serious offence, they will be given due process and a fair trial. Even with such provisions in place, can the public be assured that people convicted under this legislation are guilty?</P>
    <P>It is presumably the intention of those who retain their attachment to terrorism to distract the State from the business of creating a new political reality and to move it as far as possible in the direction of their lawless and intolerant world view.  Reactionary, hastily cobbled together legislation is itself a political tactic which must be resisted by democratic political means.</P>
    <P>How should one approach this legislation which is introduced by the Government in the wake of the Omagh mass murder?  In an article in <i>The Observer</i> of 23 August last, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, suggested that the use of punitive security measures hardens support for the political wings of terrorist groups.  He said they were often politically counterproductive and were seen as a substitute for political progress. We do not need, as a result of Omagh, an environment where false confessions can be made in certain circumstances.  If that happens the authority of the State is weakened and the hand of those who retain their attachment to the bullet and semtex is strengthened.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement had the effect of creating a split within the ranks of military republicanism. The Omagh bombing, which apparently arose from this split, has been condemned by the Sinn Féin leadership which itself is opposed to the decommissioning of the arsenal of weapons and semtex of violent republicans.  That contains a mixed message for spokespersons for militant republicanism.  The Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill, 1998, is the Government's legislative response.  It is a security response which runs counter to the necessary political response that is appropriate in the wake of the British-Irish Agreement.  It, too, sends a mixed signal to the community.</P>
    <P>The society envisaged by the British-Irish Agreement is not a society governed by draconian legislation.  Draco, the Athenian tyrant of the 7th century BC whose name is given to legislative measures of this type, is not the type of political figure who could prosper in the climate which the British-Irish Agreement seeks to create.</P>
    <P>However, there are elements of the legislation which are welcome.  It is good that the absolute right to the enjoyment of private property, which is at present guaranteed under the Constitution, should be qualified in the interest of what the Constitution refers to as the common good.  That is the essence of the provisions on the forfeiture of property used in the pursuit of terrorism with the co-operation of its proprietor.  The updating of the provisions to deal with the training of persons in the making and use of firearms is also rational and intelligent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> The Green Party has tabled several amendments to the Bill.  In the circumstances in which we find ourselves, with the bereaved and wounded of Omagh still suffering and mourning and with the promise of the British-Irish Agreement, we do not feel it would be appropriate to oppose the Bill outright.  We are willing to believe that, in the extraordinary circumstances which gave rise to the publication of the Bill, the Government will be generous in its attitude to the amendments we have tabled and will allow the full Legislature to legislate on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to use the failure of an accused person to answer questions as corroboration of a Garda chief superintendent's opinion that the accused is a member of an unlawful organisation.  It does not provide for video or audio tape to be used in recording the circumstances in which the person exercised his legal right to silence while in Garda custody.  It therefore exposes accused persons to serious risks and the gardaí to serious charges, including perjury. We need to be completely assured that the Government is absolutely committed to securing safe convictions and to protecting the human and civil rights of innocent persons who may fall under suspicion.  In this regard the Government's attitude, even its bona fides would be most clearly expressed by its willingness to take account of our position relating to the mandatory audio and video taping of interviews taking place under Garda custody on foot of arrests made under this legislation.  We urge acceptance of that amendment in particular.</P>

      <P>It is with great sadness that we discuss this legislation.  Most people can remember where they were on Saturday, 15 August when they heard the news of the massacre in Omagh.  This legislation is a response to what happened in Omagh and to the murder of the Quinn brothers in Ballymoney.  We discuss this legislation with a heavy heart because it infringes on people's rights but we have a duty to ensure that what happened in Omagh never happens again.  Great goodwill was experienced after the signing of the British-Irish Agreement.  We thought that the events of the past 30 years could be consigned to the past.  Unfortunately, the Omagh bombing has cast us back 30 years and shattered Ireland's reputation throughout the world.</P>
      <P>While reservations may be expressed about some parts of this Bill it is, on balance, welcome and will, we hope, eliminate the gun from Irish politics for all time.  It is very easy for people in the South or across the water to say what should be done in Northern Ireland, but we must listen to the opinions and wishes of the ordinary people of the North.  At the funerals of the Omagh victims the message was heard very clearly that tough action is needed by both Governments to eliminate the men of violence once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> I commend the Minister for preparing this legislation in a little over two weeks.  It is important that checks and balances are put in place and that this legislation is reviewed on an ongoing basis.  I hope by the time it is next reviewed the menace which gave rise to it will have been stamped out.</P>

      <P>It is fortunate that we are Members of an Irish Parliament with a privileged opportunity on behalf of our people to take on the function of protecting this democracy.  That is what is at issue.  The response of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be commended.  It was swift, to the point and acknowledged the seriousness of the threat to this State and, indeed, to the Northern Ireland State.  It also recognised that serious legislative processes had to be introduced.  That is the way one approaches these matters in a democracy.</P>
      <P>I have heard people here today speaking out of the two sides of their mouths.  People seem to forget that the philosophy of republicanism is admirable, desirable and recognised world-wide in many great democracies, including our own.  It must also be recognised that the Fianna Fáil party in Government never flinched in the past.  Our aspirations and aims have always been to achieve the unity of this nation through peaceful means. Primarily we have stood up against the threat and the challenge of subversiveness on many occasions.  We introduced the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and amended it after a Supreme Court challenge.  We introduced internment when we had to contend with difficulties. Today, in a different society with different attitudes and values, we are leading our people again and responding to their wishes.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are entitled to all the commendations we can give them.</P>
      <P>There is a distinct difference between what happened in Omagh and anything that happened in the past.  It occurred after a referendum had taken place both North and South.  It was the first time the people of the whole island had taken on a constitutional function in relation to the future of the North and South.  Any organisation or group that would seek to challenge that would challenge the Constitution.  A challenge to the Constitution is, singularly, the most serious challenge that can be made in a State.  It is a direct challenge to democracy and it must be met with all that the Government and this Parliament can use to respond to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must legislate to protect freedom.  People must recognise that freedom is special.  It gives one the right to communicate, to travel and to exchange information.  However, when people go outside that freedom they challenge those rights. Consequently, I hope that members of any illegal organisation who are duly brought before the courts will be held in detention &mdash; even if it is necessary to amend this legislation &mdash; for the duration <Col N="89" /> of a period the Government considers necessary to exclude them from the normal freedoms we enjoy in this society.  They cannot be tolerated.</P>

      <P>It is ironic that the Dáil is meeting today to pass additional special powers in response to the Omagh bomb, yet tomorrow a hero's welcome will be given to a person who gave the order for the &ldquo;no warning&rdquo; bombs in the Sudan and Afghanistan.  The end result was undoubtedly the same &mdash; innocent people were the victims.  In Omagh 28 people died, in the Sudan 26 innocent victims died.</P>
      <P>The US itself has experienced anti-civilian bombings, the most devastating being the Oklahoma bombing which resulted in nearly 200 people losing their lives.  The response was not to stage-manage an array of special powers.  Instead, the police, using their resources under existing law, went after the bombers and got them.</P>
      <P>The response here is a one day public relations exercise designed to give the impression that something temporary is being done, which will be used exclusively to deal with those responsible for the Omagh bomb.  That is far from the reality. Experience shows that emergency powers, which are presented as temporary measures, quickly become permanent.  They are used for purposes for which, and against persons for whom, they were never intended and produce a litany of miscarriages of justice, to which several speakers referred.  For example, the Special Criminal Court, set up by the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, an Act which itself was speeded through&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: The awful atrocity committed at Omagh shortly after the British-Irish Agreement had been supported by more than 90 per cent of the Irish people has lead to the introduction of this legislation.  One could say that previous atrocities should have lead to legislation like this and one can recall the double speak of past politicians who did little to condemn many IRA atrocities, but it is now time to look forward.  It is good that we are now in a new era where straight condemnation of the Omagh atrocity is heard from all political parties in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> I do not wish to nit-pick on present negotiations as I feel it is not enough to criticise one side or the other since the British-Irish Agreement has set out the necessary requirements.  However, I heard Deputy Ó Caoláin ag labhairt as Gaeilge agus as Béarla anseo &mdash; is cuma cé acu teanga a úsáidtear. His reference to the RUC being a discredited force rings somewhat hollow when one recalls, as my colleague, Deputy McGahon, did, that the IRA killed 16 gardaí and seven soldiers in this State.  They were never discredited and they are not discredited.  It is another form of double standard to use the RUC as legitimate targets while at the same time there is a history of killing members of our security forces.  I suppose that is not the first instance of double speak.</P>
    <P>There are concerns about this legislation.  Civil liberties are important, and that includes the civil liberties of the majority of the Irish people. Nobody wants to see innocent people jailed &mdash; there are too many examples of that &mdash; but I hope the people who explain their position will have nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about section 9 which deals with the withholding of information.  It could easily happen that an innocent person could, for example, stumble across an IRA unit hiding guns.  If the person knows those involved and they know him, he might find himself seriously concerned about his safety because obviously he is automatically identified if the information is given.  Out of sheer fear for his life, he may not be prepared to give the information. I hope that in such court cases the possible sentence of five years would not be imposed.  I hope the courts will be lenient in a situation like that.</P>
    <P>However, I have no qualms about any section of the Bill which deals with the godfathers of the IRA who are the real murderers.  They are sleveens who sit at home safely sending out young people to do their dirty work.  While the driver of the car in Omagh was a serious criminal, the people who made the bomb or caused it to be made are much more guilty and deserve greater punishment.  No punishment could be severe enough for them.</P>
    <P>We must all ensure that the peace process continues without a hitch.  We must make it clear that no small group can usurp the authority of the State and we must make certain that life will return to normal and continue as such from this day forward.  I support this legislation.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the constituents of Sligo-Leitrim, I extend my heartfelt sympathy to the survivors of this outrage, to the relatives and friends of the victims, and to the people of Omagh and County Tyrone.  Ireland's blackest day was 15 August.</P>
      <P>If we wish to take effective action against terrorism, we should keep in mind the need for preventive work as well as security measures such as this legislation, which will be effective and which I welcome.</P>

      <Col N="91" /> In this context I would like to speak specifically on the activities of Co-Operative Ireland, formerly Co-Operation North.  Since 1979 Co-Operative Ireland has worked to advance understanding and respect by promoting practical co-operation between the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  It is a non-political organisation but believes that political progress must be supported by the building of a network of positive relationships between the peoples of this island at individual, organisational and community level.  While such relationships can be promoted and supported at political level, they cannot be built directly at that level and require complementary voluntary activity.</P>
    <P>To date, Co-Operative Ireland has set itself the task of generating examples of North-South co-operation and in this way gives 20,000 people each year the opportunity to meet and explore common concerns and interests.  It does this through two main programmes, Youth, Education and Community Programme and Economic Co-operation.  The Youth, Education and Community programme involves young people and others meeting in circumstances of managed co-operation to undertake joint projects and to learn from each other's experiences.  For example, links are taking place this month between Easkey Development Group, Sligo, and Fintona Development Group, Tyrone, involving youth groups looking at leadership training and sport, and Ballymote Youth Club, Sligo, is exchanging with Sarsfield Juvenile Committee in west Belfast.</P>
    <P>Economic Co-operation links have been built between local authorities North and South, with the Agricultural Science Association, tourism groups and small businesses.  A thriving chamber of commerce link between Sligo and Coleraine grew from local authority links with Co-Operative Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sadly, although an independent study on behalf of the North's central community relations unit concludes that most participants were overwhelmingly positive about their experience of North-South cross-Border and cross-community exchanges, a shortage of funds has forced a reduction in exchanges from 470 last year to an estimated 150 this year.  That is regrettable.  We should ensure that fund is increased.  The same report stated: &ldquo;It is largely because of the real and perceived absence of bias that Co-Operative Ireland has been able to retain, uniquely, the support of both sections of the community in Northern Ireland and hence go on to achieve the success for its programme which it currently enjoys.&rdquo; Co-Operative Ireland has responded to the changes which led to the British-Irish Agreement by broadening its aims to include the development of innovative partnerships with other organisations.  An example of this is the link established between County Cork VEC and the South Eastern Education and Library Board.  This link which started in 1996 has seen <Col N="92" /> the successful piloting of a North-South transition year module in the curriculum this year, with further links between the organisations being established on the ground.</P>
    <P>The vital role of organisations like Co-Operative Ireland is recognised and valued in the British-Irish Agreement.  A pledge was made to positively examine the case for enhanced financial assistance for the work of reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Many speakers dealt with the legislation before us.  I compliment the Minister and the Taoiseach on introducing this legislation which is very welcome because it aims to take terrorism out of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Co-operative Ireland has declared its willingness to use its knowledge, experience, skills and enthusiasm to assist in achieving peace.  We for our part should ensure we enlist these qualities in the building of a stable future for all on this island.  We should provide practical support to assist Co-Operative Ireland in achieving its aims which, I am sure, we all share.</P>

      <P>I welcome this legislation and compliment my fellow countyman, Deputy O'Donoghue on bringing it forward.  It is unfortunate that its introduction is as a result of the atrocity in Omagh &mdash; the previous Government had to introduce similar legislation to deal with the murderers of Veronica Guerin.  Nevertheless this legislation needs to be introduced if we are ever to come to terms with the threat of terrorism in this country.  There is almost universal support in the House for the introduction of the measures in the Bill.  This is the first occasion on which the Dáil has been united in the fight against terrorism here.  If Sinn Féin is genuine and honest in its expression of condemnation of the tragedy in Omagh and in its declaration that the atrocity carried out there should be the end of violence, this represents an historic occasion.  Time will be the test of Sinn Féin's commitment to peace. However, I believe that party is genuinely committed to peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those, such as Deputy Ó Caoláin, who have attacked Deputy John Bruton during this debate despite the fact that, since entering politics and becoming a Member of this House, Deputy Bruton has been absolutely consistent in his condemnation of violence.  The agenda currently being pursued by the Government is the agenda of Deputy Bruton.  The Government may use different or more carefully chosen language, but the Bill represents the type of law and order mechanism Deputy Bruton has promoted since entering political life.  To attack my party leader and accuse him of being destructive is unfair and inaccurate.  Ten years from now I hope Deputy Bruton will be obliged to admit to the Dáil that his analysis and perception of Sinn Féin's intentions were wrong.  If that happens, it will be a great day for this country.  History will be the judge of Deputy Bruton's analysis and his demand that Sinn Féin and the IRA use clearer language. <Col N="93" /> In the past I listened to people, many of whom are seated on the Government benches, making speeches at church gates, county council meetings and in this House and the equivocation, ambivalence and doublespeak which marked those speeches led to a veiled support for a great deal of the IRA's activity in Northern Ireland. Members of Sinn Féin and the IRA believed that even though politicians in the South condemned their actions an underlying republicanism coloured the beliefs of many people on this side of the Border.  That is particularly true of members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  However, I gladly welcome the introduction of this legislation which represents clear action on Fianna Fáil's part.</P>
    <P>Differences on the question of law and order &mdash; both in general and in Northern Ireland &mdash; between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are minimal. That is an historic development.  The total metamorphosis in the attitudes of a number of Fianna Fáil Members who have already contributed to this debate has been dramatic.  I welcome that and I hope it will continue in the future.</P>
    <P>The future peace and prosperity of this country depends largely on the workings of the British-Irish Agreement.  I am concerned about the pace at which the various provisions of the Agreement are being put in place.  I recall reading that the North-South bodies are supposed to be established by October and that other structures were to have been put in place by now.  However, there seems to have been a lack of progress.  I hope the visit of the American President will accelerate the process because progress must be made.  From the many conversations I have had with people in Northern Ireland, I am aware that they are anxious to see how the assembly will work, how its operation will affect their lives and correct the democratic deficit in Northern Irish politics.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Taoiseach should seek full implementation of the provisions of the British-Irish Agreement.  It is very important that we support the Government in whatever way possible. I am involved with a group in Listowel, which is twinned with Downpatrick.  We can support the Government in creating and fostering links with various communities in the North through twinning, business and culture.</P>
    <P>Although Fine Gael supports this legislation and will support any legislation to deal competently and conclusively with those who set out to subvert the State it feels the maximum period of detention in the Bill is inadequate.  We fail to see why armed paramilitary murderers should not be subjected to the possibility of the same period of maximum detention as drug barons.  In both cases we are dealing with the deliberate killing of people.  For that reason Fine Gael has tabled an amendment to extend the possible period of detention to seven days.</P>

      <P>The proposed legislation has correctly been described as tough, far reaching and draconian.  The issue for us is not whether such legislation is desirable, but whether it is necessary. If we sought to debate that issue in an isolated academic vacuum, if we wilfully blinded ourselves to the atrocity of Omagh, if we ignored the existence on this island of a tiny anti-democratic group prepared to use mass slaughter to further its aims, our answer would undoubtedly be that this legislation is not desirable, but to conduct this debate in that manner would be to ignore reality and do a disservice to the people.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the British-Irish Agreement as endorsed by the democratically expressed wishes of the people and in light of the calculated slaughter perpetrated at Omagh, the questions which we, as a Parliament, must address are two-fold. First, as a democracy, is it necessary to enact new legislation to protect our citizens and institutions?  Second, does the package of measures proposed represent a reasoned and balanced response?  I believe that the answer to both questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  In the aftermath of Omagh legislation is needed.  I do not subscribe to the view that the need for this legislation ought to have been seen before the Omagh atrocity.  To express that view at this stage is offensively opportunistic.</P>
      <P>The success of the Garda and security forces in thwarting other attempts at mass destruction was powerful evidence that existing measures were adequate.  No politician, commentator or columnist had suggested the need for legislation, but depravity on the scale perpetrated at Omagh was not alone unforeseeable, it was unthinkable in the context of the British-Irish Agreement referenda.</P>
      <P>This House has not initiated this legislation, the bombers in Omagh have.  The new offences proposed in the Bill would not cause difficulty in any democracy.  There is no rational reason for criminal law to ignore those who direct or train members of unlawful organisations or grant an immunity to those who possess articles connected with the commission of subversive offences, nor is there a reason that the collection of information of the nature set out in section 8 should not attract a criminal sanction.</P>
      <P>The proposed new offence of withholding information is more far reaching but not without legislative precedent.  Many Acts from finance to road traffic Acts require citizens to provide information in their possession to State authorities on pain of criminal sanction.  There is no democratic reason any citizen should be allowed the callous luxury of unreasonable silence in circumstances where he or she is in a position to prevent an atrocity.</P>
      <P>The evidential provisions of the Bill will perhaps prove to be the most controversial.  Some if viewed in isolation are capable of being seen as amounting to a significant shift in the traditional balance which has existed between the State and an accused citizen.  It would be a mistake to view them in isolation.  Undoubtedly they represent an important new weapon in the arsenal of the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> Garda and in giving them this power we place a great deal of trust in their integrity, in the expectation that they will use these provisions honestly. We also place our traditional trust in the Judiciary in the expectation that it will use the new measures within the constitutional framework which guarantees fair procedures.  In some instances the evidential provisions amount to little more than in certain circumstances, if it is just and appropriate, allowing a court to draw an inference from conduct which ordinary citizens would find suspicious.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill must be used to teach the so-called Real IRA that it is no longer a case of &ldquo;tiocfaidh ár lá&rdquo;.  Their day is, to use the language of the week &ldquo;a thing of the past, over, done with and gone&rdquo;&mdash; tá ár lá thart, críochnaithe, imithe.</P>

      <P>It is never an easy task for Parliament and Government to introduce laws which curtail people's freedom.  This Bill, setting out these new laws, is regrettable and would not be necessary if this island was at peace with itself.  A violent act at 3.10 p.m. on Saturday, 15 August in the lovely town of Omagh shattered that peace. Faceless people who call themselves the Real IRA committed murder on behalf of no one but themselves.  I regret and resent these people calling themselves the Real IRA, because the real IRA placed its cause in the hands of God and vowed to cherish all the children of the nation equally.</P>
      <P>These faceless people used a national pattern day, 15 August, to maim and murder.  For centuries on this day our people have assembled at holy places to pray.  There was no thought of cherishing the nation's children in Omagh.  We witnessed the slaughter of the innocent, including the unborn.  To these faceless ones we must say, in the name of the people of this island, &ldquo;stop or be stopped&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The founding fathers of this nation included in the national flag the traditional colours of the two groups on the island.  If that is how they saw our future, that is good enough for me and the people I represent.  It is sad to think that, 200 years after the coming together of Catholic, Protestant and dissenter in 1798 to make a nation state, the blood of all three groups was shed on a regrettable Saturday in Omagh.  If the law we are asked to examine and pass today prevents such murderous deeds happening again, we will have acted wisely for and on behalf of our people.  It may also hasten the day when we can all live in peace and harmony and treat each other as equals on this beautiful island.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Hanafin for sharing her time.  I extend my sympathy to the victims of the Omagh bomb and their families, and hope the injured make a speedy recovery.  Every Member wants to condemn the actions of the bombers and, more importantly, the godfathers who masterminded <Col N="96" /> the operation.  While the bomb caused death, destruction and tragedy it has led some people to realise, perhaps for the first time, the implications of terrorism.  It has also brought people from all persuasions together and made them realise that we must, as a State and a democracy, introduce legislation which will at long last crush those subversives.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach for his immediate response on the day of the bombing.  I was on holiday in the region and I was proud, to say the least, to see him act immediately and show his determination to pursue the bombers.  This has been followed up today by the Minister, who has introduced legislation which I support wholeheartedly. This bomb was not only an attack on the market town of Omagh but on all thinking people who supported the British-Irish Agreement and the peace process.  It is worth noting that the best way we can support the people of Omagh is to support this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doherty said we should be privileged to be Members of this House and be able to speak and act on behalf of those who were attacked two weeks ago.  I would like to show solidarity with the people of Omagh, the families of the 3,000 people who were murdered over the past 30 years and the thousands more who were left injured, and the most effective and vocal way I can do that is by supporting this legislation.</P>
      <P>It is also worth noting that since the Omagh bombing thousands of people, North and South, have come together to show their determination to crush this evil.  Local authorities have met and church bodies and voluntary groups have arranged vigils and peace demonstrations.  That has shown the commitment, belief and hope that at long last we can resolve our difficulties in peace and move forward from here.  In that regard, this legislation is necessary and I fully support it.</P>
      <P>I visited Omagh last week and was struck by the normality of the town after such a tragedy and of the people trying to build their lives once again.  The Taoiseach said this morning that Omagh will build itself again and move forward, and I hope it will, but the concern is that the people there will be able to do likewise.</P>
      <P>This legislation is a commitment by this House to the people of Omagh and the North that we are ready and willing to ensure that such an atrocity never occurs again.  It is proper that we should go down this road.  Only four months ago the people, North and South, for the first time in 80 years voted on the same day on the one issue, but a tiny minority have tried to upset that decision. Some 85 per cent of the people of the island and 95 per cent of Nationalists voted for peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wholeheartedly support every line in this Bill, which is proper and timely.  I congratulate the Government on it.  I do not intend to be critical of Deputy Deenihan's contribution, but as a Fianna Fáil Member I find it rather difficult to accept his remark that Fianna Fáil is only acting in response to Omagh.  I have often mentioned in the past the involvement of Fianna Fáil Governments <Col N="97" /> down through the years, particularly de Valera's response during the emergency years, internment during the 1950s and most specifically the Offences against the State Act.  Fianna Fáil's record has been clear and determined and we are back here today to show a full commitment to crush for all time the subversives who have tried to bring this State to a new low.</P>
    <P>I congratulate all those involved in the preparation of the Bill, the Minister for introducing it and the Government for proposing it.  I extend my sympathy to the relatives of the victims of the Omagh bombing.  I hope we never again see any such atrocity committed in this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">

      <P>The Omagh bombing was an indiscriminate act of slaughter carried out against innocent people.  Words cannot describe how we feel about that carnage.  It was the most evil of deeds.  Every right thinking person was horrified as we watched the unfolding horror or listened to news of the rising death toll.</P>
      <P>Each of the deaths was an individual tragedy. The victims were ordinary people going about their lives, shopping for and with their children. Many who survived will carry physical scars until they die.  Let us also consider the psychological injuries, the memories of the event and its aftermath and the sorrow of those who never got a chance to say goodbye to their loved ones.  What demented mind could see as targets people who were milling around in the street, enjoying an afternoon shopping or a local carnival?  A terrible injustice has been inflicted on families and communities in Omagh, Tyrone, Buncrana and Spain.</P>
      <P>It is perverse that the worst atrocity ever visited upon the North &mdash; there have been other desperate and multiple murders &mdash; should have occurred in the year when the foundations for peace were established.  The vast majority of people, North and South, demonstrated their desire for peace by voting in favour of the British-Irish Agreement.  They did so because they wanted an end to the fears and uncertainties of the past, because they wanted a better future in which everyone could live in happiness and security, free to carry on their daily lives.  The ratification of the British-Irish Agreement was a democratic act embodying the will of the people.  There are always people who have nothing but disdain for democracy.  This century has witnessed their dreadful actions throughout the world.  The bombing in Omagh witnessed such contempt in our own land.  Democracies have a duty to ensure that the will of the people is enforced and that the people are protected from those who have nothing but sordid contempt for them.  That is why the measures introduced by our Government and outlined by the Minister are necessary, and I commend the Minister, the Minister of State and their officials for their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must protect ourselves against those whose redundant arguments have been replaced by the instruments of destruction.  Our weapons can only be legislative, but they will prevail.  We must <Col N="98" /> ensure that the sorrow of Omagh, which we cannot erase, never occurs again and that those responsible for it are brought to justice.  Those who planned and planted the bomb in Omagh and those who would try to engage in such evil deeds must be brought to justice speedily.</P>
    <P>The people who planted the bomb in Omagh thought they were delivering a mortal blow to the peace process and to the efforts to ensure political progress in the North of Ireland.  It is a tribute to the British-Irish Agreement, to its architects, to the people that it has had the opposite effect. The purpose of the Agreement is to overcome the divisions of the past and build a better future. It is a statement of conciliation between all traditions. It is not a peace treaty imposed by a victor upon the vanquished but an understanding between victors, as all sides see that they are winners and that the future of this country lies unequivocally in the hands of its people.  Everyone must do his utmost to ensure that a fine and fitting memorial is erected to the victims of the Omagh bombing, and that monument must be the continuation and the consolidation of the peace process in Northern Ireland and the assurance that their relatives and friends will be able to walk down the streets of Omagh free from fear.</P>

      <P>The horrific bloodletting that occurred on the main street of Omagh on 15 August was perpetrated by a group of people who claim to be republicans.  In their own twisted logic this brigade of fanatics attempt to excuse the carnage they inflicted on the people of Omagh by reference to a noble political principle that has inspired generations of people across the world to struggle for equality, justice and fraternity.  This perverted logic cannot go unchallenged.  In my contribution today I wish to make that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year is the bicentenary of the 1798 rebellion. The events, commemorations and analysis that have accompanied the centenary year are developments that are welcome and that have contributed greatly to our understanding of the ideals that inspired the men and women who struggled for freedom and equality 200 years ago. Seventeen ninety-eight is a seminal point in Irish history.  It represents the first organised expression of republican principles on the island. It is an insult to that concept of republicanism that those responsible for the slaughter in Omagh would dare to attempt to associate their indescribably evil acts with the political movement first led by Wolfe Tone.  Republicanism as articulated by Tone and the other leaders of 1798 is a noble political philosophy inspired by the American and French Revolutions.  Despite the selective representations of this era that were subsequently propagated by many historians and analysts, particularly in the last century, the <Col N="99" /> theme of independence and separatism formed only one thread of the philosophy that motivated people from all walks of life and from as far apart as Wexford, Antrim and Meath to join the United Irishmen.  The leaders of the 1798 Rebellion were driven by the principles of justice, equality and freedom.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that a great injustice was done to the integrity of Irish republicanism when the catch cry of break the link with England came to symbolise the uprising for a later generation, fed on a diatribe of political propaganda.</P>
    <P>The principles of justice, equality and freedom have been a key source of inspiration for parties of the left throughout the Continent of Europe and beyond since the time of the French revolution. I have always viewed the Labour Party and its sister parties in the group of European socialists, including the SDLP, as the true inheritors of the republicanism espoused in 1798.  This republicanism is non-sectarian, opposed to the use of force for political ends in a democratic society and deeply committed to the abolition of poverty and all forms of discrimination that reinforce inequality between equal citizens in society.</P>
    <P>This is the real republicanism that infuses the work of my party and many others in the House. We will not stand by as the term is used to justify a bloody armed campaign.  We have opposed that perversion of republicanism in the past when others were what could be best described as sneaking regarders.  We oppose it in equally strident measures today.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party accepts the need for legislation of this nature, given the threat to democracy and the peace process from small but fanatical terror groups.  As a social democrat I take no pleasure in supporting in principle a Bill of this nature.  However, I am deeply committed to protecting our democracy against attacks by fascists intent on destroying all that we hold dear.  It is against that background and for that reason that the Labour Party supports the Bill.</P>
    <P>The threat posed to democracy and the peace process by the so-called Real IRA is substantial. The people in that organisation are deluded fanatics immune to the wishes, hopes and aspirations of the people.  They have demonstrated their commitment to perpetrating the most appalling crimes to strike directly at our democracy.  It is the duty of the State to respond to that violence with whatever legal means are necessary.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Upton, said the Labour Party believes the Bill can be improved and enhanced in a number of key areas.  We will propose amendments on Committee Stage to seek to bring about those changes.  I hope the Government will view the amendments in the spirit in which they are put forward and give them proper weight and consideration.</P>
    <P>Emergency legislation of the nature proposed by the Government must receive the full attention of the Legislature.  It is vital that such potent legislation, which was described by the Taoiseach <Col N="100" /> as draconian, receives the scrutiny of the elected representatives of the people before it is placed on the Statute Book.  Some commentators made the point in the past fortnight that the Bill is rushed.  However, the Labour Party has taken, and will continue to take, the greatest care in reviewing this legislation.  The Dáil is debating the measures in one special sitting.  However, we have examined the proposals in detail and teased out the implications of the sections.  We have proposed changes which we believe will ensure a constructive debate before the measures are enacted.</P>
    <P>We are not rushing to pass the legislation to convey the impression that something is being done.  We have given thought to and debated the Bill.  We recognise that it needs to be passed with alacrity to ensure that the Garda Síochána can proceed with their investigations against the Real IRA and bring before the courts those responsible for crimes committed over the past year and, in particular, those in this jurisdiction responsible for the carnage at Omagh.</P>
    <P>During a debate such as this the fate of groups such as the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and other victims of miscarriage of justice have a particular resonance. Those responsible for the slaughter in Omagh must be brought to justice but in doing so we must not infringe on the constitutional rights and proper legal protection of the citizens of this State.  This is an important point to bear in mind and has prompted many of the amendments to which I hope the Government will give full consideration.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Garda Síochána, working in close co-operation with their colleagues in Northern Ireland, will be able to crack down on the men of violence who have brought such terrible tragedy and sadness to the people of this island and beyond.  It should be noted that before the bombing at Omagh the Garda had successes against the planned attacks of the so-called Real IRA.  With the enhanced temporary powers this Bill will confer on the Garda Síochána, I hope they can continue their important work with even greater alacrity.</P>
    <P>As the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, noted in his contribution, we cannot allow the political agenda to be hijacked by fanatics. Despite the horrific carnage at Omagh we are still in the process of constructing a new political future for all the people of this island.  Nothing that the men of violence can do must distract us from that historic task.</P>
    <P>Public opinion was at one after the Omagh outrage. The people of this island let it be known in clear terms that they would not allow the progress achieved step by step over the past four years to be destroyed by wanton violence.  The people of this island have expressed their total commitment to the British-Irish Agreement in referenda North and South.  That democratic mandate was reinforced by the public outrage expressed after the August 15 attack.  It behoves us as politicians <Col N="101" /> to ensure that demand of the people for a new beginning is brought to fruition and that the forces of fascism opposed to democracy and progress never wrest control from the democratic representatives of the peoples of this island.</P>

I join with all those who extended that sympathy.</P>
      <P>In the few minutes I have to speak I want to clarify some points.  This legislation will be enormously strengthened, both in terms of focus and clarity, by the acceptance of the six amendments in the name of the Labour Party.  I am sure this House would be almost unanimous in that it would prefer to be discussing the ending of legislation of this kind and moving on to the ordinary corpus of legislation for a society at peace, which is where we should be at this time, but the Real IRA has subverted this logic of normalcy that should be governing our operations.  It has perpetrated so horrific an act not on a military target but on the civil society that many of us who would prefer to think about the normal course of the law now find ourselves dealing with an extension of special powers which are necessary to handle the threat posed by the Real IRA, both in terms of what they have done and those who might seek to emulate their actions.  The legislation is made clear and given focus by the proposed amendments, and the first of these is that the legislation be given a termination point.  I differ here with Deputy O'Malley's deeply held view that the legislation should run beyond the year 2000.  I do not consider this a normal action but an action in a category of horror far greater than the actions usually perpetrated against the State.  There is a logic for including a termination point.</P>
      <P>When I recommended to the Government of the day that the order under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act be ended, an order which related to similar legislation, it was suggested in the debate that the order continued automatically unless it was rescinded by a motion of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That was not satisfactory, and it gives more cogency to the arguments being made for this legislation if one says that the events were extraordinary, that the legislation is extraordinary and that we are discussing legislation we should not otherwise be discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a huge difference between an inbuilt termination point and legislation that goes out of existence because we hope the circumstances that caused it will go out of existence.  Building in a case for review or renewal is not the same thing <Col N="102" /> in legislation, and I speak from the experience of dealing with the order on removing section 31. My thinking at that time was that I trusted the public and the RTÉ authority.  It was not to reward one group or another, and I pay tribute to those who took the opportunity of moving their activities firmly away from violence into the path of political dialogue and who have made such good use of it.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear that what happened in Omagh was a deliberate attempt to disrupt that process and to destroy the logic being used by those who have moved into the political framework.</P>
    <P>It is better to be honest in the processing of legislation.  In relation to emergency legislation, not just in Ireland but in other countries, there is always the difficulty of its operation.  By its nature it is outside the ordinary process even though guarantees to the citizen remain.  It is especially important that video recording of suspects be made.  The other amendments are equally important.  They deal with the question of association, and I cannot stress how bad the parallels in legislation are for guilt by association.  It was argued by former US President Richard Nixon before the McCarthy hearings in America.  I strongly oppose this.</P>
    <P>With these amendments in place, the legislation will be focused and justified.  A termination date should be specified.  The reason one would have to support the legislation in principle would be that any version of civil rights, civil liberties or human rights are not absolute personal civil liberties but they include a primary set of rights that attach to the society and to its safety, operation and the practice of its liberty.</P>

      <P>I join other Members in remembering the victims of the terrible tragedy of</P>
      <P>Omagh.  My county of Donegal has been relatively free from the troubles over the past number of years but, unfortunately, on this occasion it lost five members of the community, which included two Spanish visitors.</P>
      <P>This is a time of new hope.  The statement from Sinn Féin yesterday represents a highly significant and historic turning point in the painful chronicle of conflict and tragedy that has blighted the politics of this island for so many years.  I want to look to the future.  It is a time of new and historically unprecedented opportunity.  We all have a duty to the present generation and to posterity to seize that opportunity and to do everything in our power as politicians to bring the golden promise of these days to fulfilment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, however, also a profoundly sensitive time, a time when ill chosen words or ill timed statements can cloud and darken the climate of goodwill <Col N="103" /> that is so essential if we are to have a new beginning.  That is why I was somewhat disappointed by the tone of the comments of the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy John Bruton, on television yesterday and in Dáil Éireann today.  At a time so sensitive, following the clear and most unambiguous Sinn Féin statement to date that the war is over and after David Trimble has issued a courageous invitation to all party leaders to come together, I ask in what direction the Leader of Fine Gael is leading his party.  I do not want to be confrontational today but do all his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party endorse the line he pursued in his recent television interview and in his Dáil speech?  I remind him of the worldwide revulsion which Dr. Paisley, Mr. Peter Robinson and their party aroused when they held a nauseating press conference on the streets of Omagh the day after the bomb.  The people of this island, particularly the people of the North, are craving for peace and are looking to us for hope and for the fulfilment of their dreams.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa said in the Dáil today that words are the lifeblood of politics.  I totally agree. Words can so often be triggers and detonators.  In this conflict worldwide, words have often been as lethal as the bomb and the bullet.  I urge all commentators and interviewers in the media to take heed of this fact.  In these situations, there is something far more important than good sound bites or high TAM ratings at stake.  What is at stake for the communities concerned is literally life or death.  I appreciate presenters have a very difficult job to do and I know most of them are conscious of the responsibilities involved.  I ask them, some in particular, to keep in mind the sensitivities of the fraught and delicate situations that arise on the difficult road to agreement and peace.  Provocative questioning on issues like decommissioning and condemnation can at the wrong time and in the wrong atmosphere serve no positive purpose and instead stir up old aggravations. They can generate an atmosphere which throws the whole situation back to where it was months ago.</P>
    <P>The answer to decommissioning is simple.  It has been left to a special international representative body under General de Chastelain with special responsibilities and a timeframe in which it must work.  The answer to the decommissioning question is to be found on 22 May 2000, as agreed in the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>I ask politicians, commentators and journalists to remember the words of the Rev. Meyers at the funeral of Mrs. Annie McCoombe, the last victim of the Omagh bombing to be buried.  The Rev. Meyers pointed out that the people and the communities had come together as one following this dreadful tragedy.  They have mingled in all the different churches as never before.  His heartfelt plea was that Annie McCoombe should be the last victim to be buried in this manner.  He continued much along the same lines by urging politicians to come together and put flesh on the <Col N="104" /> bones of the dreams and hopes of all the people of this island.</P>
    <P>I ask those who may still harbour thoughts of violence to revisit the carnage and grief of Omagh and to look at the havoc and bereavement of those days in the context of the noble words of the Proclamation which is to be found in the GPO: &ldquo;We place the cause of the Irish Republic under the protection of the Most High God whose blessing we invoke upon our arms, and we pray that no one who serves that cause will dishonour it by cowardice, inhumanity, or rapine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We fervently hope the terrible event in Omagh will be the last of its kind and that it will prove to be a decisive watershed and turning point in our history.  A new and better way forward has been agreed and massively endorsed by the people, North and South.  In the spirit of that Agreement we look forward to a new era of co-operation in which we can work together to develop the great potential of the wonderful island we are privileged to share.  That is what this legislation is about and what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is trying to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wade</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to know what to say at times like this.  There is always the worry that the few words we use will never be enough to describe our sense of shock, sorrow and revulsion. There have been many sad occasions but none can match the loss of 28 people in one incident. Many in Limerick were driven to tears when the full extent of the carnage became apparent.  Our thoughts must be with the people of Omagh, with those who have lost a son or daughter, a mother or father, husband or wife. We must think of those who will bear the physical reminders of this brutal act for the rest of their lives, those who have lost limbs and will never walk again.  I also extend my deepest sympathy to the two Spanish families who have lost loved ones, taken from them in this murderous act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should endeavour to put politics aside and remember that we were elected to this House as representatives of the ordinary people, the same people who brought their children to Omagh to buy new school uniforms or who went to Omagh to meet their friends for a quiet pint on a Saturday afternoon, never to return.  We must put their memory above all else in this debate and strive to avoid engaging in political point scoring which has been indulged in recent weeks.  The importance of adopting a bipartisan approach was impressed on me recently as I listened to a radio interview in which a bereaved family member singled out a particular Opposition leader for criticism and said that while he and his family were going through the worst crisis of their lives, like many others in Omagh and Buncrana, certain individuals viewed their situation as an opportunity to score points against their political opponents.  This is regrettable and the Deputy concerned should be ashamed.  If we are to show a degree of humanity and truly represent those who elected us we must avoid engaging in point <Col N="105" /> scoring and remember the human element of this tragedy.</P>
    <P>While the reintroduction of internment is not being considered, it has not been ruled out.  I caution against availing of this option.  Should the Government consider it necessary to pursue this option I urge it to proceed with caution.  It is important that the Government explains clearly, especially to the Irish-American community, why this option is not being used.  I have no doubt that, if internment was reintroduced, the chorus boys, fund-raisers and apologists for the murderers, such as Martin Galvin in the United States, would waste no time in turning these butchers into martyrs.  We cannot afford to take the risk of letting these people profit from the death of 28 innocent people.</P>
    <P>To be effective, the proposals put before the House must be pursued and enforced with full vigour and determination.  We must also ensure these people's lives are made unbearable so that they cannot walk down a street without meeting members of the Special Branch or open their doors without having members of the Garda waiting for them.  The possible option of proscribing the Thirty-two County Sovereignty Committee must also be considered because there is no difference between it and the group which calls itself the Real IRA.</P>
    <P>We must never forget that this tragedy is about 28 innocent people whose lives were brutally cut short, about families who will never again see their loved ones and about people who will be physically scarred for life.  I extend my sympathies and those of the people of Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in extending my sympathy to all those in Omagh who have been bereaved or badly injured and maimed for life as a result of this appalling tragedy.  I had the opportunity to attend a number of funerals in the aftermath and one had to have been there to really appreciate the level of grief and sorrow which has been visited upon the mid-Tyrone town.  Today is an opportunity to congratulate the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, on their handling of this tragedy.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement has been supported by the vast majority of right thinking people on this island.  A small minority of people think they can overturn the Agreement by visiting atrocious bombing incidents on the people of the North.  In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, parts of my constituency of Louth attracted some negative publicity.  I hope the peace vigil organised in Dundalk in the days immediately following will go a long way towards showing the world where the people of the locality stand as regards this incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As chairman of the economic sub-committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Group, we had an opportunity to meet Omagh District Council just a short few weeks prior to the bombing.  I was particularly impressed at the willingness to promote the cross-community working relationship in Omagh.  I hope it can be restored and built <Col N="106" /> upon as part of the ongoing process of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that such draconian legislation must be introduced but it is necessary to deal with a small group of mindless fanatics intent on overturning the British-Irish Agreement.  I welcome yesterday's statement by the President of Sinn Féin which clearly indicates its commitment to the furtherance of the Agreement.  I hope it will act as a platform for the acceleration of the process of cross-community development.</P>

      <P>Over the past 30 years we have witnessed many atrocities emanating from the difficulties and troubles in Northern Ireland.  No words can describe the degree to which we are revolted by what happened in Omagh on 15 August.  No one can justify on any grounds the carnage which took place.  What makes this atrocity different from all other atrocities which took place over the past 30 years?  On television and in newspapers we have seen the continuous litany of deaths from bombings, shootings, maimings and knee-cappings, so can we view the Omagh tragedy in a different light?  The most important fact which sets it apart is that it is a direct challenge to the people as it came directly after they gave their approval to the British-Irish Agreement in referenda.</P>
      <P>The Omagh bomb laid down a challenge to the Irish people.  If the perpetrators ever ask themselves questions, they must ask themselves whether they thought they could take on the Irish people?  The difference is that in some parts of the country almost 100 per cent of people gave their approval to the British-Irish Agreement. However, there were still those who thought they could set it aside, but they cannot do so.  Hopefully the perpetrators will learn a lesson from this unfortunate, terrible and heinous act and it will serve to imbue within all of us a sense of duty and direction, to look to the future and to take on the challenge issued to the Irish people on that day.  I hope this is the last time this House has to react to such an atrocity.  I have some minor reservations about this legislation, but I hope it will be successful in dealing with the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in some discord with other Members on this Bill.  We all have one objective &mdash; to see the Omagh and Ballymoney murderers behind bars as quickly as possible.  The objective of the British-Irish Agreement was to establish and embed the rule of law in Northern Ireland as it is in the Republic.  This Bill is a departure from what we have always considered the rule of law. That was recognised by the Taoiseach this morning when he rightly admitted that the Bill introduces further restrictions on freedom.  Other Government spokespersons have rightly characterised the measures as draconian.  Are these measures necessary?  I do not believe we have <Col N="107" /> been shown the necessity for them.  To the extent that we depart from the rule of law we begin to act more like the terrorists we wish to put behind bars.  They do not recognise any rule of law.  The further we depart from the rule of law as we understand it, the more like the terrorists we become.  We should only do so after careful consideration.</P>
      <P>Sections 2 and 4 introduce a new basis on which we will bring people before the courts &mdash; their associations.  What are these associations?  They are not defined in the Bill.  No guidance is given to the courts or the Garda Síochána on what associations are concerned.  It could be a second cousin twice removed or members of one's GAA or hill walking club.  Those are associations and the Minister will have to explain in more detail what he means by the word &ldquo;associations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 6 creates a new offence of directing the operations of a terrorist organisation &mdash; not just membership, but directing the operations &mdash; but it does not define what is meant by &ldquo;directing&rdquo;. What time will gardaí have if they bring people before the courts charged with directing the activities of a proscribed organisation?</P>
      <P>Sections 7 and 8 introduce a major departure in our legislation in that they provide for defences that effectively reverse the burden of proof on the defendant.  Section 7 deals with the possession of articles, by which the Bill seems to mean fertilisers and fuel oils that could be used in making home made bombs.  Those are the new things, the possession of which will be an offence under the proposed legislation.  The other innovation in that section is that these things are possessed in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion they will be used in the commission of a crime.  The defence has to show the person in question has these things for some other purpose &mdash; that is the reversal of the burden of proof.  If that is all the section sets out to do, I wonder why we need it because possession of explosives or possession of firearms is already an offence, under the legislation referred to specifically in subsection (1) of that section.</P>
      <P>Section 8 deals with the collection of information. It gives us no idea what kind of information is in question, how much of it a person would need to have, how a person would have had to collect it or what they were going to do with it to provide the grounds for a charge leading to indictment on an offence under the Bill.  There is no indication, no guidance for the Garda or the courts on how they are to treat this collection of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the possession of information and makes the possession of certain information an offence.  It makes the withholding of information an offence.  We can see that clearly. How will the Garda or any prosecutor prove that somebody possessed a given kind of information, or if that person possessed the information whether he or she understood what it meant or if he or she understood what it meant what they were going to do with it that would help unidentified persons, unknown to the Garda, to carry out <Col N="108" /> certain kinds of crime including, perhaps, the forcible detention of unknown and unidentified people?  That is not legislation.  That is the provision of a belt, a pair of braces and safety pins for a pair of trousers that we do not even know we need.  That is not the way to write legislation. We are inserting a series of provisions which run a serious risk of being unworkable.</P>
    <P>Earlier Deputy O'Malley, who opposed a modest provision I fought through the House in 1986-87 on extradition &mdash; opposed also by Members opposite &mdash; recalled one provision of the 1972 Act which was controversial at the time which has been used only once in the 26 years since it was enacted.  Nobody can persuade me, not even Deputy O'Malley for all his eloquence, that a provision that has been availed of once in 26 years is worth having on the Statute Book and that what has been achieved could not have been achieved by other means.</P>
    <P>What the Minister wants to achieve will be achieved by the other means he mentioned earlier: enhancing police operational capacity on both sides of the Border and the allocation of additional resources to the Garda to counter terrorists. That should be the approach rather than this badly drafted and badly thought out Bill.</P>

      <P>In parliamentary terms this is an historic day.  Two parliaments are meeting simultaneously to enact similar legislation with the aim of preventing a recurrence of the Omagh tragedy.  It is sad it took such a shocking atrocity to alert us to the threat to our democracies and the need to protect the democratic decision of the people, North and South, by the enactment of this necessary legislation.  Omagh, on 15 August, will go down in the annals of Irish history as the location and date of one of the most brutal and savage atrocities perpetrated in Ireland in the 20th century.  In the past 30 years we have had a long and sad litany of bombings and killings but the Omagh bombing was different.  It was a brutal and indiscriminate attack on an entire community. It did not differentiate between Catholic or Protestant, Unionist or Nationalist, adult or child, or even nationality.  On a busy Saturday afternoon the bomb was placed at a location which I know as well as my own back yard.  The misleading directions given regarding its location were designed to inflict the maximum injury and death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have always been close associations between Donegal and Tyrone.  Strabane and Omagh are frequented by hundreds of people from Donegal on a daily and weekly basis for shopping expeditions and other purposes.  Saturday 15 August was no exception.  Three young Donegal boys lost their tender lives in the awful atrocity.  Oran Doherty, little more than an infant, was only eight years of age.  James Barker was only 12 years of age.  His family moved to Buncrana less than one year ago as they felt it was a safer place than England to rear their children. Seán McLaughlin and his Spanish friend, Fernando Brasco, also 12 years of age, and his teacher, Rocio Abad, aged 23 years, also lost their lives.  It is a sad and tragic litany of carnage. <Col N="109" /> We also remember the many friends who suffered terrible injuries and the families throughout Tyrone and Spain who have been bereaved as a result of the insane act of these evil people.</P>
    <P>The one ray of hope resulting from the Omagh atrocity and the needless sacrifice of so many lives is the countrywide and worldwide revulsion at this insane act of terror.  We have all been united as never before in our grief.  Never again must we tolerate the use of violence to achieve a political goal.  The legislation we are enacting is designed to crush the people and organisation responsible for this mindless atrocity.  I and my party have no hesitation in fully supporting the measures in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The names and faces of those murdered in Omagh were remembered in the Chamber during the minute's silence which was a political homage to those murdered on that fateful day, as were the names and faces of many of the 3,000 people murdered in many circumstances over the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>I will raise a number of questions on Committee Stage &mdash; I do not have time to do so now. The Taoiseach referred to the recall of the Dáil as being necessary to deal with the people involved with the Real IRA which has not been proscribed.  My understanding is that legislation passed by the House does not apply to a select band of individuals, or 20 or 30 murderers in this case, but across the board.  This must be spelled out in the legislation &mdash; otherwise we do not know the purpose of what the Minister is introducing.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said &ldquo;these people are about to learn a lesson that will teach them to respect the strength of Irish democracy&rdquo;.  The House was recalled from its summer recess to pass the legislation which will enable the authorities deal with the perpetrators of the Omagh bombing so that such an event can never again happen.  We very strongly support this objective.  However, this is very broad legislation and I understand it applies across the board.  What is the difference between one hundredweight of semtex found in a field owned by a former member of the Provisional IRA, which is now on ceasefire, and one hundredweight of semtex found in a field owned by a member of the Real IRA which is not yet proscribed and is not on ceasefire?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, questioned the words used by Deputy Bruton, the Leader of Fine Gael.  Deputy Bruton has never had a problem with the consequences of speaking the truth. There is a contradiction between the army council of the IRA saying it will never decommission and the political representatives of the movement, which signed on for the British-Irish Agreement, saying it will work for the Agreement in the interests of peace and constitutional democracy throughout the island.</P>
      <P>I hope the window dressing in terms of the Sinn Féin statement, which has made it look better than it is, is not because of the visit this week of the US President, a good friend of Ireland, in an effort to show he has not been sold a lame duck.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to join other Deputies in expressing my sympathy to all those affected by the Omagh bombing.  Indeed it is difficult to find words to express how we all feel about what has happened.</P>
      <P>This atrocity has shocked not just Ireland but the world.  President Clinton's visit to Omagh later this week will be a fitting symbol of the sympathy which people throughout the world have expressed for the victims of the bombing, their relatives and friends.</P>
      <P>I also express the solidarity which we all feel with those affected by this terrible crime.  Coming as I do from Dundalk, the place where I was born and bred and which itself experienced bombing in the early 1970s, I know how long it takes for the scars to heal and we must do all we can to support those affected by the bombing and, most of all, ensure that it never happens again.  The people of Louth have shown how they feel.  Over 12,000 people gathered in Dundalk after the bombing in a vigil to express their sympathy and solidarity.  I thank the organisers of that vigil and congratulate the people of the area for their magnificent response.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measures which are proposed in this legislation.  It is unfortunate in a democracy that we have to take these tough measures but they are needed.  This Government and the party I represent have never baulked at taking tough measures in the past, nor will we do so in the future if the necessity arises.  I support and compliment the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice on the way in which they have handled this. We must, as the Taoiseach said, crush the people who are involved in this type of atrocity.  I echo the Taoiseach's appeal today to young people not to get involved in violent activity, not to be used by the men and women of violence who refuse to accept the democratically expressed views of the vast majority of our people, North and South. These people will use them and will also ensure for their own ends that their own fingerprints are not on any horrific deed.  I condemn the armchair generals who corrupt impressionable young people in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not forget that the British-Irish Agreement was overwhelmingly supported by the people of our island &mdash; by 94 per cent of voters in this jurisdiction.  Despite this a handful of unelected and unrepresentative people have continued to ignore the democratic wishes of the people and to engage in heinous crimes.  This has led not only to this Bill but has meant that it has not been possible to remove security installations in Border areas to the extent that we would all like.  These people should take that into account. They represent nobody but themselves.  They besmirch the aims and ideals of true republicans like Wolfe Tone and the United Irishmen.  There <Col N="111" /> must be no haven for these people.  We do not want them on our island or in our community.</P>
    <P>The call of the people of Omagh after the bomb was for the politicians to get on with it. We cannot be delayed in doing so.  Together the British and Irish Governments have worked to produce a coherent package of measures which have been introduced in emergency session in this House and simultaneously in the House of Commons and will be enacted into law, hopefully with the required effect.</P>
    <P>All sections of our community, with the exception of a handful of unrepresentative extremists, have accepted that violence is over for good. Every single member of this community must do all that they can to ensure that those extremists are brought to justice.  As politicians, we have a duty both to provide moral leadership to the community and to provide the appropriate legislation and resources for our security forces.  This legislation, and its equivalent in the House of Commons, will help to ensure that this type of atrocity will never happen again.  I commend the legislation to the House.  I accept that some people have reservations about it but I have full confidence in our security forces on this side of the Border and in our Judiciary to ensure that this legislation is properly and wisely implemented.</P>

      <P>: I wish to add my voice to the expressions of sympathy to the families of the victims of the Omagh bomb.  Their lives have been torn apart as a result of a cowardly act which could never have achieved anything except death, destruction and grief.  The only crime these victims committed was to be shopping in a busy town on a Saturday as we all do from time to time.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement was not easily arrived at.  It took hard work and political courage for politicians to sit down opposite those they perceived as enemies and work out an agreement which would put an end to the ways of violence. None of us will ever know what occurred behind the scenes but we must be very grateful agreement was reached.  We assumed and hoped, in vain, that we would never again witness the violence of the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>The ordinary people of the Republic and of Northern Ireland voted overwhelmingly to endorse this Agreement in the hope of a normal future.  By doing so, they hoped to declare their wish for peace to the world.  The people who carried out the Omagh atrocity did not act on behalf of anybody but themselves, they did not have a mandate from anybody and they must now live with themselves.  I hope the measures being introduced here today will be effective in combating the ruthless groups which seek to destroy peace through violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of concern has been expressed in recent days about human rights and the speed with which this legislation is being introduced. This legislation is necessary and will assist in dealing with the ruthless murderers responsible for Omagh.  The Real IRA did not have any regard for human rights or life on 15 August.  This legislation <Col N="112" /> will not make any of us feel better about ourselves or about what happened to the community in Omagh but it will hopefully give us the power to deal with these terrorists without the kid gloves and restrictions of the past.</P>

      <P>My initial reaction on hearing the news of the Omagh bombing was one of utter horror followed by great anger.  How could people exist who were capable of perpetrating such an atrocity and wreaking such havoc and grief on so many lives?  Many people in Wexford and elsewhere have since expressed their anger and outrage to me.</P>
      <P>It is time for the communities in which these criminals live to stop harbouring them.  It is regrettable this House should be obliged to convene a special sitting &mdash; a simultaneous sitting has been convened in the House of Commons &mdash; in such tragic circumstances.  It is important to stress that today's business is not about vengeance.  The current situation demands measures which will further concentrate our minds and efforts.  The measures introduced by Dáil Éireann in the aftermath of the Veronica Guerin murder were very successful and a similar response is appropriate now.  Let us be clear on the simple fact that those who committed the atrocity at Omagh pose a danger to our society.  The historic Agreement arrived at on Good Friday is the way forward.  I was very pleased to hear the statement by Gerry Adams yesterday as it signified a historic step forward for Sinn Féin and Irish republicanism.  Violence is now a thing of the past.</P>
      <P>We must recognise the work carried out by the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and the US President during the past year which ensured every effort was made to strengthen and nourish the peace process.  Those efforts must be applauded.  It would also be appropriate to recognise the efforts made by the Northern Secretary, Dr. Mo Mowlam, the US ambassador, Jean Kennedy Smith and the British ambassador, Veronica Sutherland.</P>
      <P>During the past year, I have spoken at numerous 1798 commemoration ceremonies in Wexford. To honour the work of the United Irishmen we should build a society based on the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity.  That is what the peace process is about and it is the prize which necessitates the measures currently before us. These proposed measures have been carefully crafted and I am convinced they are overwhelmingly endorsed by the people on this island who gave their verdict so clearly on the Agreement. We have come too far in reaching a settlement to the conflict which has endured in these islands for so many generations to allow the actions of a tiny minority to thwart us at this critical juncture.  I fully support the measures before the House.</P>

      <P>Like others, I too condemn the Omagh bomb which was an outrageous act of violence and I express my sympathy to the families <Col N="113" /> and friends of those who were killed and injured.  It is hard for any of us to imagine how difficult it must be for victims and people from the area to try to rebuild their lives and return to some kind of normality.  Like other Members I cannot comprehend the pain and anguish these families have suffered at the loss of members of their family and children.  Unfortunately, desperate men do desperate things and these people are desperate.  Election results on this island did not suit their political aims.  I am sure they were shocked at the massive turnout and support for the peace process and the demand for change in the direction this island was taking.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the swift and decisive action they have taken.  It is with much sadness that I support this tough legislation. It is not something any of us thought we would have to do because we all felt that a new chapter had been opened on this island and that we were moving forward.  I recall the positive speeches made when we debated the British-Irish Agreement and various election results in this House. There was a great sense of a new beginning and then, sadly, we had another massive atrocity.</P>
      <P>I am delighted this legislation will be reviewed next year as there is great concern about it.  We have to enact this Bill because of this kind of act and the fact that some people do not want to accept the views of the vast majority of people on this island.  As legislators we have a responsibility to protect people and that is what this Bill will do.  It is not &mdash; as many people have said &mdash; something that we all wanted but, unfortunately, we are being forced to do it.  I support the legislation and I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government on taking this swift and necessary action.  If it is as successful as the legislation we enacted in the aftermath of the murder of Veronica Guerin then it will be a huge success and these atrocities will be at an end once and for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a native of County Tyrone and Omagh is my county town.  My wife was born and reared in Omagh and her relatives still live there; some are in business and others are in the Church.  Thankfully, none of them was injured or murdered.  The Omagh bombing was an abomination. It was a deliberately barbarous act carried out by barbarians.</P>
      <P>Members of the Fine Gael Party will recall a meeting of the parliamentary party some months ago when I recounted a conversation I had had with a traditional republican about what would happen if the peace process failed.  I explained to him there was no alternative to the peace process but he replied, &ldquo;We have been called terrorists. If the Agreement collapses we will go back to being real terrorists&rdquo;.  That meant putting the civilian population, including women and children, in the front line.  I am sorry that I was correct in my prediction of what might happen in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> We have had the backlash.  The outrage and anger in republican heartlands has been so great there is a good chance that Omagh will be the last of these abominations, in Northern Ireland at least.  There are republican extremists who will not see this as the last act and are perhaps thinking of further activity beyond the shores of this island, particularly in Britain.  Part of the reason we are here today is to ensure these madmen are stopped.</P>
    <P>Omagh is a symbol of the futility of violence over the years.  The reaction to that abomination is important as a symbol and as a warning to people of how things could develop.  However, the referenda of 22 May last are far more important in political terms.  It is more than 20 years since I was part of the SDLP leadership which decided to press for joint referenda, North and South.  That decision was taken in 1975 or 1976.  The results of the recent referenda have given a greater political and moral authority to the British-Irish Agreement and the institutions created, and to be created, under it than any institutions have ever had on this island.  They have a greater political and moral authority than in 1920-21 when the Dáil was established, than the 1937 Constitution when the people of the North were not consulted and there was a relatively close majority in the South, and than the Sunningdale institutions which collapsed in 1974.  The joint referenda result was a watershed.  It may be that from the vantage point of history the joint referenda will turn out to be the most significant political development in 20th century Irish politics.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of Deputy John Bruton. I ask the Government to consider that perhaps Deputy Bruton was being helpful.  As a result of his experience in Government, he knows there are certain questions Governments cannot ask and points it cannot make in particular circumstances. Someone has to ask those questions and make those points.  Challenging Sinn Féin to state its support for the referenda result as an exercise in self-determination which eclipsed the 1918 election was valid and useful.  It is dishonest of Sinn Féin not to reply to that challenge.  To use a word used by Pat Doherty, one of its leaders, on one occasion, its position on this issue could be described as &ldquo;devious&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The people, given a free choice, gave this House and the Government elected by this House a free hand to use whatever powers we feel are necessary to implement the will of the people.  We have the political and moral authority to put out of business, by whatever means necessary, those who try to usurp our function.  The question is not whether we have the authority to do it, which we have, but by what means we will do it.</P>
    <P>I stood on the courthouse steps in Omagh on the Saturday after the dreadful bombing.  I recalled taking part in civil rights marches through the street where the bombing occurred.  I also remembered my opposition to the Northern Ireland Special Powers Acts.  The Minister for</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> Justice in South Africa said at the time that he would give up all the legislation in South Africa in exchange for one section of the Northern Ireland Special Powers Acts.  I remembered the disaster of internment and many other measures which were introduced in what was described as the politics of the last atrocity.</P>
    <P>With my background &mdash; Deputy Eoin Ryan expressed many of my sentiments &mdash; I can only be uncomfortable with what the Government has described as &ldquo;draconian legislation&rdquo;.  However, in considering and agonising about these matters, I have been helped enormously by a recent letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> from Fred Heatley of Belfast. Like me, Fred Heatley was a founder member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. He marched with me in Omagh, Dungannon and other places in Northern Ireland for one of the principal aims of NICRA, the abolition of the Northern Ireland Special Powers Acts which provided for internment without trial.  Mr. Heatley wrote:</P>
    <P>I was on holiday in Dublin when news came of the butchery and my immediate reactions were of horror and a damnation to all those associated with such a deed.  Returning home, those feelings have eased &mdash; a little &mdash; to be replaced with resignation to the fact that if the normal processes of law are inadequate to deal with the quasi-political fanatics in our society, then stronger methods have to be adopted to curb them.</P>
    <P>The safeguarding of human life and the prevention of unnecessary suffering to all people are the most basic rights of all, and those who would deprive us of either have to face the consequences. If internment, with obvious legal protections, has again to be brought into play, this is one individual who will not raise a voice in opposition.  It goes against every fibre in my being to state that, as the beliefs of a lifetime are being cast aside.  But there must be no repetitions of Omagh and the so many brutal carnages of the past 30-odd years.  The majority of the people on this island, on both sides of the Border, have voted for peace and their democratic wish has to be obeyed.</P>
    <P>I come from the same background as Fred Heatley and I agree with his sentiments.</P>
    <P>The way forward is the full and speedy implementation of the British-Irish Agreement.  Unfortunately, as a result of the ruthless savages with whom we must contend, security measures are required which will effectively quarantine them. That is an unfortunate fact and it is why I will support this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Words fail to describe the horror everybody felt when they heard about the Omagh bombing.  I was out of the country when it occurred and I never before experienced such feelings of revulsion.  It is difficult to find words to describe how horrible it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> I was on the street where the explosion occurred less than a week previously with my wife and children.  To think that somebody would place a bomb on that street knowing the obvious outcome is hard to accept or understand.  The fact that the House is meeting in special session to pass this legislation is a necessary response to this undiluted fascism.  There are people who think they have the right to be fascists, to form terrorist organisations and to bomb and maim the rest of us.  They have received succour, support and empathy from those whom the late John Kelly called the sneaking regarders, some of whom were in this House.  These people are fascists although they are backslapped and presented as so called republicans.  They are undiluted fascists and it is up to us, as democrats, to defend the common good.  I would prefer if we did not have such legislation as this but if these or stronger measures are necessary the Government of the day will have the support of this party in putting them in place.  There can be no tolerance for fascism. The sneaking regarders and public house republicans who have allowed this cancer to grow in our society have a lot on their consciences.</P>
    <P>I would be very concerned if certain sections of this Bill became part of the general corpus of legislation.  I put these concerns on the record. First, I urge the Minister to reduce the timescale for the operation of the legislation.  A period of 12 or 18 months would be more appropriate than the two and a half years which he proposes.  The Opposition will be happy to renew this legislation in 12 months if it is still necessary and if we are still in Opposition.  The question of the time for renewing the legislation should be brought before the House and I think two and a half years is too long.  I hope by then we will have seen the beginning of the end.</P>
    <P>Second, I am concerned about the provision which allows newspaper reports which are not denied to be used as evidence.  I know this is a repetition of a section of the Offences against the State Act, 1972 but I do not understand why the Minister feels it necessary to repeat a provision which is already made.  If there is a change of wording I hope the Minister will point it out but I do not see the necessity for this measure.  I would prefer if it were not in the 1972 Act although it may have been necessary over the years.</P>
    <P>I join with others in paying tribute to the Garda and the security forces.  For many years they have put their lives on the line.  We live in a democracy which has checks and balances.  Under our Constitution we have courts, an Executive, a Parliament and other organs of the State, one of which is the Garda Síochána.  The Garda must exercise its duty independently.  We must ensure that where there is independence there is accountability. When we give the Garda Síochána sweeping powers to deal with drug pushers and fascists we must be careful to demand accountability and we must examine this question.  I am not suggesting that this matter needs to be addressed on this <Col N="117" /> occasion but this should be done in a calmer atmosphere in the new session.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael sees the need for this legislation and strongly supports it in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>I join other colleagues who have expressed their revulsion at the obscenity that occurred at Omagh and at an equal obscenity that occurred when three children were burned to death a few weeks earlier, arising out of sectarian hatred.  There is a lot of sectarianism and naked bigotry still alive and well in Northern Ireland.  It is something that will have to be dealt with in a singular way in the context of the new future we are putting together in the form of new institutions.</P>
      <P>I welcome the expressions of support from all Members of the House at the range of provisions we are putting in place.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his officials for the work they have put into bringing these provisions before the House.  It is the Government's job to bring forward provisions but there is also a huge responsibility on all Members of the House to scrutinise that legislation to ensure it is not needlessly vulnerable to challenge and that it is robust and fit for the purpose for which it is intended.</P>
      <P>While the tragedy of Omagh broke our hearts and the hearts of thousands of people around the island, it united us in a new and firm resolution that this would be the last atrocity that would take place under the guise of politically motivated violence.  Even at that time of despair it was amazing to hear from the injured victims that they were charging us with the responsibility, as politicians north and south of the Border, to get on with the work of putting in place the new institutions north, south, east and west, which provide the best way forward for the people of the island.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an unequivocal statement of our resolute determination to stamp out, once and for all, the people who are hanging on to the old ideology and the misguided tradition of physical force as a way of achieving political aspirations. In the wake of the British-Irish Agreement that tradition of physical force has been absolutely rejected by the people North and South.  People had a long time to deliberate on the provisions of the Agreement.  There was a plentiful and open democratic debate in Northern Ireland during the Assembly elections and, North and South, during the two referenda.  We grappled with those dilemmas, took courage and said we would vote for the new Agreement, even though it is painful in many aspects.  We said we would work together in a new partnership and dispensation on the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been plenty of talk &mdash; it is quite proper and I would not seek to minimise it in any way &mdash; expressing views on the harshness of this legislation and the need to protect civil liberties. It is the purpose of the House and the overriding obligation of the Opposition to scrutinise this <Col N="118" /> legislation.  Both parties in Government have been careful to scrutinise the amendments that have been tabled and have taken the best legal advice.  Our job as Ministers is to protect our citizens and, ultimately, that is about balancing rights.  We have decided that this legislation, though harsh, is required to deal with this dissident rump which is trying to flout the democratically expressed will of the people.</P>
    <P>There are those who say that repressive legislation has never worked, but that is nonsense. The Offences against the State Act, as amended since 1939, has provided a bulwark against terrorism and subversion.  It has saved the lives of countless people and has provided a basis upon which a political evolution has arisen so that the republican movement has come around to the view that it could not bomb a million Protestants into a united Ireland.  It came around to that view after a long period of being suppressed.  For that reason I say to those people who argue that this sort of legislation is counterproductive that it works, it has worked and it will work in the future to finish off for good those people who are determined not only to attack British forces but to attack civilians living on this island, citizens of this country going about their business, with no support from the Irish people.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to which I want to refer, that is the attitude of some commentators and, indeed, politicians who say that this sort of legislation does not work or that it makes the situation worse.  We are determined on this side of the House and I am grateful for the support of other Members who have spoken in support of the legislation.  We must take a stand once and for all against the people who have provided safe houses, the sneaking regarders, and those who have been ambivalent about the sacred tradition of physical force.  It is important that at this critical stage in the peace process the whole of Ireland democratically unites to say once and for all that physical force is finished, it has no support and the way forward is the one which has been mapped out and blueprinted by the British-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for the manner in which they have approached this debate.  The House is broadly supportive of the measures proposed by the Government in the Bill.  Having said that, I recognise equally that clearly there are also issues of concern to a number of Deputies and parties and I hope to be in a position to deal with those in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the difficulties involved in considering legislation of this nature in circumstances where it has been necessary to recall the Dáil in the aftermath of an atrocity such as that at Omagh.  There are those who would say that we should not legislate in such circumstances, but both the Government and the House would be failing in their collective duty were they not to <Col N="119" /> respond to the challenge which the perpetrators of the atrocity at Omagh have thrown down.  This Bill represents a package of carefully considered and balanced measures which the Government believes would improve the capacity of the State to counter those who would seek to undermine the British-Irish Agreement through violence.  I want to deal with some of the principal points which have been raised in the debate.  I will of course be happy to return to these and any other points raised on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the suggestion, which is without any supporting evidence of which I am aware, from some quarters that the tragic events of Omagh were in some sense the result of a security lapse or failure on the part of the security forces here or outside of this jurisdiction or perhaps both.  Anybody with any knowledge of these organisations and their capacities will be aware that there can be no absolute guarantees that all their activities and schemes will be thwarted.  If there were such guarantees, the people of this island would not have had to endure terrorist violence over a period of 30 years.  What the security forces, both here and in Northern Ireland, are required to deal with are organisations which of their nature are secretive of their activities and of course which ruthlessly enforce their own code of secrecy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the activities of the so-called Real IRA, both the Garda and the RUC have already had significant successes in dealing with this group and in preventing attacks on both sides of the Border.  In the context of the Garda in this jurisdiction, I need only to point to the seizures of 1.5 tonnes of homemade explosives at Howth in January, a car bomb with 600 pounds of home-made explosives at Hackballs Cross in March, a further bomb in Dundalk later that month, the car bomb intercepted at Dún Laoghaire port in April and the interception of two car bombs near the Border at Dundalk in May.  The Garda were also successful in preventing the attempted armed robbery of cash in transit at Ashford in May and provided information leading to the arrest of a number of persons in London arising from the seizure of incendiary devices there.  Arising from those successes, 15 persons have been charged and are awaiting trial before the Special Criminal Court in connection with offences involving the Real IRA.</P>
    <P>What is also clear from those successes and other security force successes over the past 30 years is that organisations who engage in terrorist activity are prepared to employ people whose connections and associations have hitherto either been of minor concern to the Garda or may not previously have been brought to their notice.  The godfathers of the organisation will ensure their hands remain clean when it comes to the actual mounting of attacks.  The job of tackling organisations like this is far from simple.</P>
    <P>It cannot be assumed &mdash; I refer to suggestions by some Opposition Deputies &mdash; that methods <Col N="120" /> employed by the Garda to tackle one category of crime or type of criminal would automatically prove successful in the case of terrorists.  We have to be guided by professional Garda assessments as to the best methods to be employed.  I have discussed the matter with senior gardaí and it appears that some of the proposals on what might appear to be superior ways of dealing with terrorist groupings simply would not succeed.  One of the most serious concerns I have about suggestions that the Garda may have followed less than optimum methods in the case of the so-called Real IRA is that, however unintentional it may be &mdash; I believe it must be unintentional &mdash; it points the finger at those who put their lives on the line to prevent terrorist attacks and away from those who commit them.  We must, therefore, try to get away from suggestions which can only serve to shift the focus from those who have committed atrocities.  If the investigation of any crime demonstrates a clear security lapse that has to be dealt with, but to speculate about such a lapse in the absence of any evidence is not only distinctly unhelpful but acts to deflect the attention from where it truly belongs.</P>
    <P>We return to this House today for a very serious reason.  It is not a day on which we should engage in the usual political cut and thrust; it is not a day for attempting to put about the impression that we are suddenly faced with a level of threat to the security of this State which is of unprecedented magnitude.  While stressing that one can never hope to have knowledge of the vile schemes that may be under consideration by terrorist godfathers, those on whom we rely for security advice are not in any doubt that the security threat has been far greater for much of the past 30 years than it is now.  There is no foundation for the suggestion that terrorist capacity has suddenly grown because of inactivity by the security forces or anybody else.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to employ criticism of the security forces or blame my predecessors or the Governments to which they belonged for the fact that the measures I am proposing today were not introduced by them.  Let the criticism and blame for the Omagh atrocity, and all the other atrocities, lie where it belongs.  We want to move forward. Thankfully, the signs are that the road to real progress is widening all the time and we want to keep it that way.  There is no merit in putting forward ideas which would set back the progress made and being made.  The principal message we need to send today is that we will not allow a ruthless minority to parry the progress towards peace and stability which all right-thinking people on this island and beyond dearly wish to see achieved.  Therefore, we must focus our attention today on tackling those still engaged in conflict or only temporarily desisting from it.  Let them halt their campaigns now so that we will not have any more atrocities like that in Omagh.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Real IRA, the issue of proscription was considered by the Government and the advice received is that it is not necessary to <Col N="121" /> make suppression orders in respect of that or any other organisation.  Two suppression orders have been made in accordance with section 19 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939.  The Unlawful Organisation Suppression Order 1939 &mdash; No. 162 of 1939 &mdash; provides that the organisation styling itself the Irish Republican Army &mdash; IRA &mdash; or Óglaigh na hÉireann is an unlawful organisation. The Unlawful Organisation Suppression Order 1983 &mdash; No. 3 of 1983 &mdash; declares that the organisation styling itself the Irish National Liberation Army &mdash; INLA &mdash; is an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>Concerns were expressed regarding the right to silence.  I do not accept the proposition that allowing inferences to be drawn from silence in certain specified circumstances represents an unwarranted attack on the right of an accused person.  Section 5 of the Bill, which contains an inference provision, mirrors provisions which are already in place under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>That leads to the question of surveillance evidence. This is a possibility which I and the Garda authorities see value in examining further.  I have, therefore, asked my Department and the Garda authorities to review existing practices and legislative provisions concerning the use of evidence generated by surveillance in the context of prosecutions with a view to the development of legislative reform in this area should such action be required or prove desirable.  This matter is not without its complexities and it raises policy and evidentiary issues of considerable significance. For example, the question of how such evidence can best be proved is clearly among the issues which must be addressed in the examination I have put in place.  The Law Reform Commission's recent report on privacy raises other issues in this regard which will, of necessity, form part of that examination.</P>
    <P>A number of objections were raised in respect of the collection of information.  I stress that the information with which we are concerned here is of a type which is likely to be useful in the commission by members of an unlawful organisation of particular kinds of serious offences.  The offence is specifically targeted at those who may not be involved directly in acts of terrorist violence but who play an essential part in their planning or preparation by way of the collection of information which is used for the purpose of the selection or identification of targets for terrorists attacks or otherwise in the carrying out of such attacks.  In addition, with regard to the withholding of information, the offence only applies to the most serious cases where there is or has been a real risk of loss of human life, serious personal injury or serious loss of or damage to property.</P>
    <P>I ask those who have difficulty with the provision what they perceive to be the duty of a person with knowledge of a planned murder or bomb attack.  I am sure that no reasonable person would state that an individual should keep such information to themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> A number of Deputies queried the inclusion of the word &ldquo;association&rdquo; in section 4.  I will return to this matter on Committee Stage but I must make it clear &mdash; it is obvious that confusion has arisen &mdash; that there will not be an individual offence of associating.  That was never the intention. A number of colourful examples have been provided but the reality is that what is proposed is that the question of association will only be utilised by way of inference in corroborating other evidence.  It would be a matter for the courts to decide whether the inference in support or in corroboration of other evidence should or should not be accepted.</P>
    <P>With regard to it being reported that an individual is a member of an unlawful organisation, that has been the law in this country since 1972. This legal mechanism is limited in its scope because people who are mentioned as being members of unlawful organisations routinely deny such accusations.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to section 14(1).  I am advised that the subsection in question complies with the requirements of the Constitution. However, I will ensure that the concerns raised by Deputy O'Malley and others are given consideration. I intend to see if a formula can be found to make clear what he had to say about the Bill.  To my knowledge no prisoner released under the terms of the British-Irish Agreement has been arrested under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the Agreement Reached in the Multi-Party Talks&rsquo; means the Agreement set out in Annex 1 to the British-Irish Agreement done at Belfast on the 10th day of April, 1998;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is very important indeed.  It is consistent with the principles laid down in the British-Irish Agreement.  It is worth noting that in the Second Stage debate today practically every Deputy in the House referred to the British-Irish Agreement.  None of us expected when that Agreement was being signed that we would be here today in these circumstances.  We understand it is necessary to bring in legislation to deal with what is and has been described as a fascist gang.  However, it has also been said that while the circumstances have changed, the new context has not changed.  The amendment proposes the fulfilling of an obligation to which the Government is already committed regarding the establishment of a human rights commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government does not have a shining record in terms of fulfilling commitments it has made under other agreements, such as the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Downing Street Declaration. <Col N="124" /> We have been tardy on occasions in living up to commitments we have made.  In this case, we do not have a choice in relation to committing ourselves to a timeframe on the establishment of a human rights commission.  The timeframe suggested in the amendment is approximately a year after the signing of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>It is important that we live up to our word and act as we say we will act.  If an overarching framework is not established in that manner for the protection of human rights, there is a danger that we will continue the experience that has been part of events in Northern Ireland, the South and Britain where anti-terrorism legislation has from time to time served the public badly and given rise to miscarriages of justice.</P>
    <P>The human rights commission, which would be independent, would have as part of its brief an ongoing role in overseeing and monitoring legislation and its implementation.  This is the most significant legislation relating to anti-terrorism measures that the House has dealt with in recent years.  Grave concerns have been expressed in relation to the powers that will be given to the Garda Síochána.  I do not suggest the Bill should not be implemented or that it should come to an end next March.  However, I ask the Minister to consider his role in the post British-Irish Agreement context and the new scenario which everybody has welcomed.  I ask him to ensure that protections are in place to avoid a position where people may be alienated from the forces of law and order and the political system because of flawed legislation or human failings which inevitably occur from time to time.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes a balance which ensures that we are tough and harsh on terrorists and those who have done terrible things to others, but also that we bear the responsibility of ensuring that the innocent are protected.  I listened with interest recently to Mr. Tom O'Malley, a distinguished law lecturer in University College, Galway, who made the point about the importance of having a reference in relation to the legislation and how it is implemented.  We need to provide this structure and ensure on an ongoing basis that it works.</P>
    <P>I would have no problem if the Minister suggested a better structure.  However, it appears the best option would be the promised human rights commission.  It would be a beacon if it was provided in Northern Ireland.  The standing committee there is already doing a good job, but committees in both parts of the island would be an indication that the commitments in the British-Irish Agreement will stand regardless of the worst efforts of the terrorist.  I ask the Minister to indicate how he intends to protect the innocent and established human rights.  We also have an obligation internationally to offer protection.  I understand the Minister said in reply to questions from the media that it would be up to the courts to do that, but the courts will protect the constitutional status of the legislation.  We cannot expect them <Col N="125" /> to act the part of an authority such as the independent commission.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept what we are saying in good faith.  We may not like the legislation but we understand the necessity for it and agree with the Government in its determination to root out and crush these evil people.  That does not absolve it, however, from its responsibilities, particularly in the context of the British-Irish Agreement, to ensure innocent people are not hurt.  There are too many examples where innocent people have been hurt as a result of flawed legislation.  We are doing our best but we are not infallible, no more than the police force or the security forces.  Nobody is infallible in their daily activities.  That is the reason it is so important to establish the commission within a specified timeframe.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the then Minister was asked in a parliamentary question to appoint an independent commission to examine the workings and operation of the Offences against the State Act.  That question was tabled by Deputy Harney.  When Deputy De Rossa recently asked about the commitments in relation to human rights and a human rights commission it was stated in reply &mdash; I was taken aback by this &mdash; that matters were being referred to the all-party committee on the Constitution, of which I am a member.  As the Taoiseach is aware, that committee has agreed a work programme.  There is a danger that it will be used as a dumping ground to delay rather than activate.  I am concerned that the human rights commission &mdash; legislation will be required to place it on a statutory basis &mdash; will float out of reach.  While this legislation meets a need, it does not negate the spirit of the British-Irish Agreement which the Real IRA set out to damage and undermine.  If we are to protect the Agreement in full I ask the Minister to accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am suggesting in my amendment is that the legislation should cease to have effect at the end of the specified period which the Minister is now suggesting should expire on 30 June 2000.  Should it prove necessary to renew it this should be done by way of further legislation, <i>de novo.</i>  The British-Irish Agreement specifies that emergency legislation will be reviewed. Should it prove necessary to reincorporate some of the proposed measures they should form part of consolidated legislation.  That makes much more sense than what is being proposed and would be preferable to a one or two hour debate on a motion to extend the lifetime of the proposed measures without any provision for amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 45<i>a</i> is associated with this group of amendments, and the Fine Gael Party and I wish to be associated with amendment No. 41 in the name of the Minister. Nobody would disagree that this is tough legislation. It is draconian, as the Minister said, and because of that it is important that there should <Col N="126" /> be a time limit on it.  On a number of occasions since the foundation of the State legislation dealing with offences against the State has had to be introduced and expanded to deal with offences against the institutions of the State.  Perhaps we did not allow in the past for circumstances in which such legislation would not be necessary.  It is extraordinary that there was a state of emergency in the country from 1939 until 1995, when it was repealed.</P>
      <P>In spite of the atrocities of recent weeks and the fact that the Government has deemed it fit, on the advice of the security forces, to bring in this legislation, which we support, there is still room for considerable optimism.  The parties that have signed the Agreement and that have been elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly, as well as the parties in the South that have supported the peace process which has been underpinned by massive support in the referendum, allow for a certain amount of optimism.  If the Agreement progresses according to the timeframe envisaged by the signatories to it, we feel this legislation will not be necessary beyond the year 2000.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has allowed, in amendment No. 41, that the bulk of the legislation will cease, if not re-enacted, by 30 June 2000.  If, at some future date or in June 2000, the Dáil feels part or all of the legislation is still necessary, it is important to include a proviso allowing for its annual review.  I hope it will not be the case and that when we reach June 2000 the bulk of the Agreement will have taken effect, the men of terror will have disappeared and those who have not disappeared will be behind bars.  I hope the Minister considers amendment No. 45<i>a</i> favourably so that we can signal our optimism that this legislation will not be needed in future and that, if needed, it will be subject to an annual review by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is heartening to hear a general acceptance from the Opposition that there will be an annual review if one of these amendments is accepted.  Amendment No. 42 in my name and that of Deputy Gormley makes the point that if there is a case for marking the end of December 2000 as a special date and significant in terms of the British-Irish Agreement, then surely it is also appropriate to review this legislation on the annual anniversary of the signing of the Agreement or around that date when minds would be focused on the workings of the process.  It is important this legislation is regularly reviewed.  If, as looks likely, it is accepted, that should at least be acknowledged.  It is an acceptance that the British-Irish Agreement should take precedence over any political climate created by this legislation. Regular review of this legislation may show we have moved faster than expected.  We would then be able to do away with legislation, which the Government has acknowledged as draconian. That is a worthy objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emergency legislation has a bad name generally, if only because it is introduced as such but <Col N="127" /> grows legs of its own and affects areas never anticipated.  Therein lies the danger.  Emergency legislation in the North is referred to as temporary but has been in place since the foundation of the State there.  It is important some credibility is restored to the objectives of this legislation by having a regular annual review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: While continuing my outright opposition to this ill-advised draconian legislation, I thought it proper to table an amendment which calls for the Bill, if passed, to lapse on 28 February next year.  There are strong arguments why that proposal should be accepted and why the timescale should be concentrated and telescoped.  Even by that time, it will be clear that this Bill is a knee-jerk reaction by the Government and not the answer to the problems as regards Northern Ireland and the campaigns of certain paramilitary organisations.</P>
      <P>It is crucial there is a time limit because of sinister new concepts and offences which are all encompassing in their meaning and are generally there simply to be seen as some type of corroboration for the opinion or word of a senior police officer that a person is a member of an unlawful organisation.  The concept of association being taken into account is one of those sinister new concepts which should not be in our legislation.  We should at least include a time limit if the majority of the Dáil wishes to pass the legislation.</P>
      <P>The fact of somebody mixing with people at a funeral or other such occasions could be used as evidence simply for a catch-all offence in order to convince judges, who, when the penalty was increased for membership of unlawful organisations, were quite reluctant to convict based on the opinion of a police officer.  This is a dip into a lucky bag of three, four of five new offences the Minister has invented in order to give that corroboration.  That is extremely dangerous.  The inference from the failure to answer questions is another reason this time limit should be automatically introduced.  This is a turnaround in the traditional way justice was administered in that people were innocent until proven guilty.  It is draconian that totally innocent activities can now be criminalised with the onus on those who may be innocent to prove their innocence.</P>
      <P>Laws can and have been used maliciously by arms of the State for purposes other than those for which they were originally introduced.  The Offences against the State Act has been abused in the past in this State.  I do not trust the State authorities not to abuse it in the future in regard to trawls for general information about matters that have nothing to do with paramilitary organisations, arms or explosives.  The Act has been used in that way to vet people who are politically opposed to aspects of the capitalist State in which we live.  The turnaround in regard to the onus of proof is extremely sinister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the Bill is that it is to deal <Col N="128" /> exclusively with the so-called Real IRA and the perpetrators of the atrocity in Omagh.  I remind the House, and people generally, that when legislation is put on the Statute Book it is not applicable only to 50 or 100 people but to every citizen in the State.  Every citizen in the State can be caught in the web that is being spun by this legislation.</P>
    <P>I remind the House also that the Offences against the State Act, 1939, which is the basis for this amendment, was not introduced simply to make unlawful paramilitary organisations or people like those who perpetrated the barbarity in Omagh.  It is stated in section 18, for example, that an organisation that promotes, encourages or advocates the non-payment of moneys payable to the central fund or any other public fund or the non-payment of local taxation shall be an unlawful organisation within the meaning and for the purposes of this Act.  It states also that this Act shall apply and have effect in relation to such organisations accordingly.  Therefore, an organisation like the Anti-Water Charges Federation, or an organisation set up in Cavan in the past which may have advocated the non-payment of motor tax as a protest against potholed roads, is an unlawful organisation according to the draconian legislation in existence.</P>
    <P>The implications of the new proposals in the 1998 amendment could apply to people actively involved in campaign groups which have nothing to do with paramilitarism.  That is an extremely sinister development and one to which I am absolutely opposed because peaceful civil disobedience can be criminalised.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if these new laws are left on the Statute Book they will be used at some stage by some members of the Garda to trawl for information on organisations involved in civil disobedience and political action totally unrelated to paramilitarism.  While unremittingly opposed to the introduction of the legislation, if the Minister is to introduce it, I must insist for the reasons stated that he accept an automatic time lapse so that this repulsive legislation does not remain the law of the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 18, most of the provisions of the Bill will cease to have effect on 31 December 2000, unless renewed by resolution of the Oireachtas.  The number of amendments tabled on this matter reflects a wide range of approaches among Members.  Deputy Joe Higgins's amendment proposes that the provisions should lapse by February 1999 unless renewed. The Green Party proposes 22 May 1999.  Democratic Left proposes 31 December 1999 and also proposes that the provisions should lapse from 31 March 1999 unless the human rights commission specified in the British-Irish Agreement has been established by that date.  The Labour Party proposes that the Bill should lapse completely by 31 December 2000 without any provision for renewal. <Col N="129" /> I will deal with the Labour Party approach first. The Bill already contains the safeguard that most of its provisions will lapse unless a positive resolution of the House is made continuing them in force.  That is the way the detention provisions contained in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act have been dealt with.  I do not accept the argument that there is a democratic deficit by approaching the matter in this way rather than by introducing primary legislation to bring about the same effect.</P>
      <P>I understand the link Deputy McManus wishes to make between the provisions of the Bill and the establishment of a human rights commission. Both Governments are totally and wholeheartedly committed to the human rights aspects of the British-Irish Agreement.  The British Government has provided for the establishment of a human rights commission in the Northern Ireland Bill and that legislation is well advanced. We are committed under the terms of the Agreement to establishing a human rights commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to the Northern Ireland commission, as well as taking further measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights in this jurisdiction.  I have established a human rights division in my Department to deal with our obligations in this area.  A human rights commission Bill is in the process of being drafted and we hope it will be processed in the Oireachtas in the forthcoming session to enable the setting up of the commission to be completed by early next year.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it is right to make a legislative connection between that and the terms of the Bill.  It seems to me to be wrong in principle that, if for any reason the Oireachtas was not in a position to finalise the necessary legislation, the provisions of a Bill aimed against those who represent a murderous threat to the community should lapse.  Who would benefit from that?  I hope the Deputy accepts my assurances that we will do everything in our power to establish the commission in the timescale referred to in the amendment.</P>
      <P>This leaves the issue of what review date should be set for the legislation.  I have reconsidered the matter in the context of the amendments tabled and I suggest that my amendment, bringing forward the review date to 30 June 2000, is a reasonable approach in the circumstances.  In suggesting that date, I am conscious of a realistic timescale for the review of Offences Against the State legislation, including this Bill, which is to take place and the timescale to process legislative proposals when that review is completed.  I have made considerable efforts to meet the concerns of the Opposition in the matter and I hope the date of 30 June 2000 will prove acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 45<i>a</i> seeks to ensure that if sections of the Bill are renewed they should be subject to an annual review by the Oireachtas.  I propose to meet Deputy Flanagan's point.  The official amendments will provide that where a provision is being renewed it shall be for a period <Col N="130" /> specified by the Oireachtas and that before any such renewal takes place a report must be made on the operation of the relevant section.  I hope Deputies Flanagan and Higgins accept that these amendments meet the objective of Fine Gael's amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Higgins stated that the burden of proof is being reversed by this legislation.  That is not correct.  The burden of proof is the same as it always was in a criminal trial &mdash; the case must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.  Evidential changes are being made which will, for example, provide that the court may or may not take an inference from an individual's silence or refusal to answer a question material to the charge or offence.  However, that is far from stipulating that the burden of proof has been reversed and that it is the accused who must prove his or her innocence. That is not the position.  The inference may be taken by the court as corroboration of the evidence already given on the individual's guilt, but it is neither the case that the burden of proof is being reversed nor that the inference alone could be used to convict an individual.  It is important to make that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins must also be aware that the 1939 Act made various provisions concerning illegal organisations.  However, for an organisation to be made illegal it would have to be proscribed by a suppression order.  Two such orders exist &mdash; one concerning Óglaigh na hÉireann, the IRA, and the other concerning the INLA.  I am strongly advised and satisfied that the term &ldquo;IRA&rdquo; or &ldquo;Óglaigh na hÉireann&rdquo; used in the context of a paramilitary organisation remains proscribed irrespective of the adjective placed before it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made an interesting contribution and asked a rhetorical question which all Members are obliged to ask themselves in the context of the review of this legislation.  He asked why it should not be an offence for all time for an individual to direct the activities of an unlawful organisation; to withhold information concerning a bombing or murder using firearms; to collect information for such purposes; to engage in training people in the use of firearms or explosives to maim and kill or to be in possession of items to be used to blow up people?  Those good questions impressed me.  We have legislation on the Statute Book pursuant to the Firearms Acts and the Explosive Substances Act dealing with matters such as this.  These are new offences in Irish criminal law.  I understand people's concerns in regard to the drawing of an inference in relation to an individual's silence.  I am of the view that this provision is constitutional and within the parameters of the European Convention on Human Rights. While I am not the final arbiter, it is also the advice of a number of leading experts in the criminal law field, not least some of the experts in the Department.  That is important for the reason that the ultimate guarantor of human and civil rights here, so far as any individual is concerned, is the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> A considerable body of jurisprudence has been built up since then by the High and the Supreme Courts which is the envy of much of the free world.  If any provision of this legislation interferes with human rights to a degree that takes away the constitutional protection, it is clear the courts would hold any such provision or provisions of this legislation to be unconstitutional. I hold that the legislation is constitutional but I emphasise we have a written Constitution which is the envy of many countries in the free world and it is the ultimate guarantor of people's protections.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister speak on the establishment of a human rights commission.  I thought he was doing well for a while and I was pleased to learn some progress has been made.  It appeared he would have no difficulty in having it in place by the deadline of 31 March until he said &mdash; I think he let the cat out of the bag &mdash; that somehow the Oireachtas may not be able to set up this commission on time.  That is extraordinary and unacceptable.  Not long ago, to satisfy some tourist interests, the House rushed legislation through in relation to firearms which foreign gun clubs bring into this country.  We were able to do this without any difficulty and with tremendous speed.  Yet the Minister, who has clearly indicated there is some backing for his commitment in relation to the establishment of a human rights commission, cannot guarantee, even though there is a generous allowance in my amendment, that body will be in place by the first quarter of next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: There is more argument than ever for an automatic lapse of this legislation, if passed.  The Minister is wrong in a number of the points he made about the Offences against the State Act.  An organisation does not have to be declared unlawful by the Government. It can be so by virtue of section 18.  Section 19 provides that the Government may issue suppression orders against specific unlawful organisations. My initial points about the alarmingly wide-ranging nature of the original legislation being compounded by this amendment Bill still hold.  I spoke today to a person active in building opposition to Ronald Regan's presidential visit to Ireland several years ago.  He was involved in political activity of a campaigning nature which involved distributing leaflets, posters, etc.  His house was searched by the Garda using powers under the Offences against the State Act.  That bears out the point I am making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the burden of proof has not been shifted.  However, on the most simple reading of the Bill a lay person will see the Minister is absolutely wrong.  There is a huge shift in the burden of proof to people accused, many of whom may be innocent.  Let us leave aside the fine arguments of lawyers, etc.  What does the Minister say, for example, about section 8 which <Col N="132" /> states, &ldquo;it shall be an offence for a person to.possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful in the commission by members of any unlawful organisation of serious offences generally&ldquo;?  What does he say about section 12 which states: &ldquo;a person who instructs or trains another or receives instruction or training in the making or use of firearms&rdquo;&mdash; for example, teaching somebody to hunt &mdash;&ldquo;or explosives shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The section continues, &ldquo;it shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to prove that the giving.of such instruction was done with lawful authority&rdquo;.  What does this do other than potentially criminalise a whole sector of the population and place upon those people an onus to prove their innocence?  What is this if not a shifting of the burden of proof?  I ask the Minister to explain this issue to the Dáil as I am sure other Members would like to hear him squaring the circle.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, and the continuing draconian nature of the legislation, the time safeguards being put forward should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments tabled by the Green Party concern a review of the legislation on an annual basis.  I listened carefully to the Minister and believe he has provided further argument to the case for accepting the amendments, principally because he has selected certain parts of the Bill which he feels will stand the test of time and ought to be part of the normal corpus of legislation.  There is a case to answer in this regard and the matter is worth examining. However, this requires a review of the Bill.  This makes it even more important to provide for an early review of the legislation so that there can be a sifting of the wheat from the chaff and to ensure we are not lumping essentially reasonable aspects in with completely unreasonable and very questionable aspects which we seek to amend.</P>
      <P>Directing an unlawful organisation, if it is of a paramilitary nature, ought to be a crime. However, the Bill must be amended to make it so.  Also, training persons in the making of or using firearms in a paramilitary or criminal context ought to be a crime.</P>
      <P>Alongside this is the very questionable issue of guilt by association.  On the one hand we are asking people to co-operate while on the other hand we are saying that if they talk to or know somebody associated with a crime they themselves could quite likely be as guilty of the crime as the person they are reporting.  This Bill is a mixture of proposals, some of which are highly questionable. For that reason I ask the Minister to consider making provision for an annual review as is done in Britain, or any other country where emergency legislation exists, so that the law can be repealed or improved.</P>

Could he advise the House on the consequences of that report for the legislation?  I understood that he would await the report, meaning that he could not fulfil his hope of introducing the legislation in the autumn.</P>

I believe it is trying to defend the British-Irish Agreement against terrorist attack.  It should be borne in mind that had the bomb in Omagh been in another town, it could have meant the end of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach have been honest enough to describe the legislation as draconian, as it certainly is.  It was stated by an Opposition leader this morning that the legislation posed no threat to civil liberties.  That is patently untrue.  The Bill represents a significant erosion of civil liberties.</P>
      <P>As legislators, we must ask the question if such an erosion of civil liberties is justified in the current conditions.  We must try to ensure that the most important civil liberties are safeguarded. Most importantly we must ask if the suspension of these civil liberties is a temporary phenomenon. We have heard from the Minister that there will be a review in 2000.</P>
      <P>If we look at the situation in Britain, where there have been many miscarriages of justice, at least there is an annual review.  The calls from the Opposition are entirely reasonable and I ask the Minister to tell us why he cannot agree to the suggestions which have been put forward.  I have listened to him carefully but the Opposition is displaying a genuine concern for civil liberties. There can be no question that this legislation is a significant erosion and that we cannot let it remain on the Statute Book permanently.  That is the fear on this side of the House.  I ask him to reconsider what he has put to us tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister is accepting a Fine Gael amendment on the timeframe for this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed on the Opposition side of the House about certain sections of this legislation and, therefore, a limit to the length of time which some of these sections stay in force is essential.  That is what we did in the drug trafficking legislation which introduced very heavy penalties into law.  There was a review of that legislation after 12 months.  I see from the Minister's speech that he selected the year 2000 because it ties in with other aspects of the Agreement. That is a defensible position although I would be happier if there was consistency in the time limits for sections introduced in legislation and we stuck with a 12 month timeframe.  People <Col N="134" /> have spoken about the need to review the legislation from a civil liberties point of view and that is as it should be.  We, in the Opposition, can only take the Government's word that it has the necessary security information available to it that legislation of this kind is required at this time in order to protect our citizens.</P>
    <P>We cannot second guess the Government.  The former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, made the same point during the 1970s when he said that Parliament must take into account the fact that only the Government has access to certain security information.  However, we must ensure that if this legislation is put in place with the express purpose of taking monsters off our streets who continue to see bombings, killings and beatings as legitimate acts, it will stand up to scrutiny and will not be cast down by a Supreme Court judgment, the European Court of Human Rights or by any other court within this jurisdiction or outside it. We have a responsibility to ensure the legislation will stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I assume the Minister, in preparing these sections, has taken advice on the European Convention on Human Rights and has satisfied himself that if somebody were to challenge any sections of this legislation, it would stand up to scrutiny.  Not only is it necessary to stipulate a time limit for the review of the legislation in order to ensure that nobody with extra powers will abuse them, we must also ensure the legislation will not be challenged easily or overturned. That would be the worst of all worlds.  I wish the time limit to be included for those reasons.</P>
    <P>At the time of the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act in 1996, we included an extension to the seven day detention period and the various safeguards which judges were obliged to observe.  I recall speaking to the Garda Commissioner at the time and pointing out that for the sake of the men and women of the Garda Síochána, it was necessary that no criticism should be levelled at any action taken by them.  It was necessary that the accusations about the heavy hand of the law made in the 1970s would not again be made against the force.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the amendment which goes some way towards ensuring that if it is found that this legislation must continue after the year 2000, it will be reviewed regularly. I have no doubt that if the Minister finds the legislation is flawed, which I hope it is not, he will get a ready ear in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, seemed to indicate, as did the Taoiseach this morning, that the only people who objected to the terms of this legislation were those not on ceasefire.  He stated that the Real IRA and Continuity IRA should be left in no doubt as to the consequences of their actions.  The Minister appeared to be excluding the Provisional IRA which is on ceasefire.  We know judges refer to debates in this House when interpreting legislation and I want the Minister to give a categorical assurance on the record that this legislation, when enacted, will be used against <Col N="135" /> anybody who perpetrates, or is suspected of perpetrating, terrorist acts.  We must ensure that we do not create a second class of terrorist called the Real or Continuity IRA and that we do not exclude the Provisional IRA, which murdered people for the past 30 years, from the application of these measures.  The Garda must be instructed that anyone involved in terrorist activities can be subjected to this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), lines 10 to 12, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;being&rdquo; in line 10, down to and including &ldquo;be,&rdquo; in line 12.</P>
      <P>Section 5 states that &ldquo;in any proceedings against a person for an offence to which this section applies evidence is given that . at any time before he or she was charged with the offence, on being questioned by a member of the Garda Síochána in relation to the offence or when being charged . failed to mention any fact relied on in his or her defence in those proceedings, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned, charged or informed, as the case may be, then the court . may draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper; and the failure may, on the basis of such inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence in relation to which the failure is material . &rdquo; This proposal is manifestly unfair.  I and the Socialist Party hold no brief for anyone involved in paramilitary organisations or activity at any level and have never done so even while members of other parties were attempting to arm them.  My main function in the Dáil is to stand for the rights, not of a tiny handful of sectarian bombers and killers, but of the three-and-a-half million law abiding people in this State who will come under the ambit of this legislation if it is passed into law.</P>
      <P>In the course of this debate many Deputies claimed that the people overwhelmingly support these measures and they criticised me for not doing so.  I take issue with that claim.  The fact is that people have had no time to consider these measures.  The public wants those responsible for the atrocity in Omagh caught, they want all paramilitary activity to cease, they want these people isolated and they want them to finish their campaigns once and for all.  However, they have had no opportunity to discuss these measures and, therefore, Deputies cannot say the Government has backing for all of them.</P>
      <P>This provision is manifestly unfair and I am amazed it is being proceeded with.  Essentially, if somebody does not mention or remember every single thing about some past issue they are being questioned about by the Garda, yet, they remember it later, an inference may be drawn against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a person who is not a hardened criminal is being questioned by the Garda he or she will be nervous, confused and upset.  In fact, it is the hardened criminals who will not be nervous or confused and who will probably remember every &ldquo;fact&rdquo; they are questioned about.  However, it is primarily innocent people who will be at a disadvantage if this provision becomes law.  It is utterly unfair to say that somebody should be able to remember everything within the time limits set down and that if they do not it can be used <Col N="138" /> against them in court even if they try to raise issues or facts later.</P>
    <P>It is possible that a person may not have the opportunity to speak to a solicitor when being questioned by the Garda or even before being charged.  In that case, when a person talks to a lawyer that lawyer may be able to mention some facts or circumstances that are extremely significant in his or her defence.  They may not have been aware of their significance, yet, if those are introduced in a subsequent court case a negative inference can be drawn against the accused person. That is manifestly unfair.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons people who are entirely innocent may not be in a position to, or may not want to, answer all questions asked. There may be some circumstances in which they could produce an alibi but perhaps felt compromised quite innocently in terms of not being involved in any law breaking, and not wanting initially to involve somebody else, for example, as an alibi.  If they were later convinced they could or should do so, that can be used as an inference.</P>
    <P>There is the simple question of people's memories. If a person is questioned by the Garda about an alleged offence which was committed, perhaps months or even a year previously, the person may not remember many facts about the issue, or his or her movements.  How many of us know exactly what we were doing even a few weeks ago, let alone a few months or a year ago?  This is one of the Minister's catch-all provisions to get evidence to corroborate membership of an unlawful organisation on the opinion of a senior member of the Garda.  The provision is so wide-ranging as to be open to abuse and to be dangerous.</P>
    <P>A conflict may arise in the court between the Garda version of events and that of the accused. That has often happened and, as we are aware from abuses, in Britain in particular, police versions were patently manufactured.  The Minister is refusing to include even the minimum safeguard, proposed in a number of amendments, of a video taping procedure of all questioning, interrogation, etc., of an accused person.  It would be some small safeguard for the accused person if the Minister had inserted that provision in the Bill.  The Minister is refusing to do so.  Inevitably conflicts will arise in the court to the detriment of an accused person.  It is manifestly unfair and I oppose the provision.  My amendment proposes that no such inference, negative or detrimental to the accused person, should be drawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Just as in section 3, which set down definitive periods in relation to the calling of witnesses, this is tough but necessary legislation. It is necessary because one is dealing with tough people and circumstances, potential killers, people who are ruthless and have no compunction about doing what they consider must be done to achieve their aims.  One is trying to bolt down as firmly as possible any possibility of people <Col N="139" /> introducing alibis.  The people about whom we are talking are professionals.  They are conspirators who are quite capable of constructing elaborate alibis.  They are quite capable, just as in relation to the production of witnesses, of paying witnesses to come on board and substantiate their side of the story because there is no problem as regards money.  They are quite competent and capable of coming up with a well-woven tissue of lies and fabrications.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that there is a possibility of memory lapse but, as Deputy Owen said, when dealing with legislation of this kind we must take it from the Government that it knows exactly what it is doing; that it is acting on security advice, and that the advice given to it is that this measure is required to cope with the existing problem and until the year 2000.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day, the court may decide in determining guilt whether or not such inferences may be drawn.  The ultimate arbiter is the court.  By not accepting this section, one is drawing on all kinds of paranoia in relation to the possible indiscretions which may occur.  We are not saying such indiscretions have not occurred because there have been some, but we must support as watertight a provision as possible to ensure that what I outlined does not happen.  The court will decide and some Members seem to have little faith in the courts to decide whether or not an inference can be drawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have an opportunity to contribute on Second Stage but I followed with interest the debate on this and previous amendments.</P>
      <P>It is my view, and I think it is one shared by the overwhelming majority of Members, that a democracy has the right to protect itself from those committed to subverting and destroying it. The ultimate civil right and liberty is the right to life.  The people at whom this legislation is directed, we are assured by the Minister, are those who place no value on other peoples' right to life.  It is, of course, important that this legislation works properly.  Opposition Members are relying on assurances from the Minister that the extensive powers conferred by this legislation will be used and directed against any unlawful group or individual committed to violence, in particular, those responsible for the appalling tragedy at Omagh.</P>
      <P>The Opposition has a particular duty.  It is regrettable that the Committee Stage debate is being compressed.  I am always concerned that a brief Committee Stage debate on legislation such as this creates more problems than it solves in that this House does not have an opportunity to tease it out fully and, perhaps, the Minister does not have the opportunity to reflect overnight on what has been said.  I would have preferred a procedure whereby the Committee Stage debate would be taken tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> I would like the Minister to reply to my questions on section 5, amendment No. 15, which apply equally to section 4 which we did not have an opportunity to discuss.  My questions relate to the provisions which criminalise associations on the part of certain persons.  Has the Minister obtained advice from the Attorney General as to the constitutionality of sections 4 and 5?  Is he concerned that those sections could be deemed unconstitutional?  Has he addressed the possibility that if there is a referral of the legislation to the Supreme Court and the Bill is found to be unconstitutional because of imperfections in either of the sections that the whole Bill will fall?  I would like the Minister to address that very important issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also address an issue which could have arisen in the debate on sections 1 to 4 and which is applicable to section 5, Deputy Higgins's amendment, the Bill as a whole and other legislation currently in force.  If we assume that upon enactment of this Bill there is the possibility or likelihood that certain persons involved in subversion here, who show nothing but contempt for democracy and human life, will be brought before the courts, can we have assurances from the Minister that such people if convicted under this or existing legislation as a member of an unlawful organisation for offences under section 5(1) committed since 22 May cannot benefit from the early release provisions which the Minister is now exercising in respect of other persons?  As a result of Garda investigations some individuals may be prosecuted and convicted arising out of the Omagh tragedy under some of the offences described in section 5(1) of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am seeking an assurance from the Minister that the powers delineated and contained in the legislation enacted by the House prior to the summer recess, namely, the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, 1998, will not be utilised by the Government to effect the early release of those responsible for the atrocity that occurred in Omagh and the other atrocities referred to on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that in dealing with this legislation we are not engaging in a public relations or an academic exercise.  A strong message must emanate from this House that the type of subversion of the Republic to which a small group of individuals are committed will not be tolerated.  These people should not be given encouragement or allowed to believe that if they are apprehended, prosecuted and convicted by the courts, within two years they will be likely to benefit from the type of early release system for which structural provision is made under the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act.  That system has already benefited a number of individuals without the passage of the legislation to which I referred.</P>

      <P>As the Minister stated on Second Stage, section 5, which Deputy Joe Higgins is attempting to amend, follows along the lines of <Col N="141" /> sections of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act which introduced certain restrictions on the right to silence so that inferences could be drawn.  However, as the Minister correctly pointed out, a person cannot be convicted on the sole basis of inferences being drawn from their remaining silent.</P>
      <P>It is not contained in the legislation, however, the Government indicated that it intended to bring back into play the mechanism whereby someone could be declared to be a member of an illegal organisation on the word of a chief superintendent and that this would be corroborated by the inference drawn from a person's silence.  In turn, if the inference drawn from someone's remaining silent cannot be used as the basis for a conviction, two wrongs cannot be added together to make a right because the section of the 1972 amendment Act which states that a person can be convicted of membership based on the word of a chief superintendent has already been overturned by the courts.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to an article by Gerard Hogan, an eminent constitutional lawyer whose words the Minister and Minister of State at Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, were fond of quoting when in Opposition, which appeared recently in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  The article stated that any effort to reintroduce the mechanism where the word of a chief superintendent would suffice to convict someone of membership of a proscribed organisation would be unconstitutional.  Is the Minister drawing together two pieces of evidence, namely, the word of a chief superintendent and the inference drawn from a person's silence and making each corroborate the other?  This will lead to problems because if the legislation is overturned by the Supreme Court it will collapse in its entirety.  I am concerned that, because the Bill has been hastily drawn up, the Minister may not have had the opportunity to give this matter proper consideration.</P>
      <P>What is meant by the use of the term &ldquo;unless the accused was told in ordinary language&rdquo; in section 5(3)?  Does &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; refer to language in every day use as opposed to extraordinary language or the kind of convoluted legal language which contains the terms &ldquo;herewith&rdquo;, &ldquo;theretofore&rdquo; and &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo;?  I do not know what is the legal definition of &ldquo;ordinary language&rdquo;. Everyone can assess what ordinary language might mean in terms of someone being held by the Garda.  Will the Minister clarify if the section is referring to ordinary, civilised language?</P>
      <P>We are discussing sections 5, 6 and 7.</P>

      <P>We got caught in the last grouping of four sections so that the Minister got off scot free without having to answer questions about three of the four sections.  What does &ldquo;a person <Col N="142" /> who directs terrorism&rdquo; mean?  Does the Minister have a legal description for the word &ldquo;directs&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister think in section 7 the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; should at least be included so that it will read a person &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; has an article in his possession?  Somebody might not knowingly have an article in his possession.  Will he clarify why he included section 7 when the offences referred to are already covered under the Explosive Substances Act, 1883, and the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1990?  It seems the section might be superfluous.  I hope the Minister has not formed the habit of including superfluous sections so that legislation will look harder.  We must be sure of the need for it.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Shatter's remarks.  The Taoiseach is on record saying people would not receive the early release benefit of the Agreement if they were not on ceasefire when the Agreement was concluded and had not yet been convicted of offences, even if those offences were committed before the ceasefire.  However that commitment is not legally binding and that is why Fine Gael wanted to amend the legislation to make sure that is included in law.  As things stand people who committed offences and were not convicted before May 22 will find a loophole through which they will slip and be able to avail of the prisoner release programme under the Agreement.  The Minister would stand indicted if people who carried out the Omagh atrocity could avail of the prisoner release programme, which is part of the Agreement.</P>

      <P>Section 5 is obviously intended to allow inferences to be drawn from silence in certain cases.  The purpose of Deputy Higgin's amendment appears not to allow inferences to be drawn and I oppose that.  To accept it would be to take one of the main pins from under the legislation.  It could be argued that I would have been better off not producing the legislation rather than accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the proposition that allowing inferences to be drawn from silence in certain specified circumstances represents an unwarranted attack on the rights of an accused person. This is already contained in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.  I recently received the report of an expert group which I established to examine changes in the criminal law proposed in the report of the Garda SMI steering group. The expert group recommended that such an inference provision be extended to all offences which carry a penalty of five years, which is wider than that proposed in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a large extent, Deputy Higgins's argument amounts to putting a hypothetical case before the House and arguing it as if he were in court.  The court can decide to draw an inference from the silence of an individual in certain circumstances but it is also open to it not to draw any inference. The effect of section 5 is not to require a court to draw an inference from the failure of a person to mention a fact relied on in his defence; it permits <Col N="143" /> the court, as appears proper to it, to draw such an inference from such a failure.  Also, a failure would only give rise to such an inference where a person could reasonably be expected to have mentioned the fact relied on.  The requirements will mean that many of the circumstances mentioned by Deputy Higgins will not arise.  We are not talking about stand alone evidence where an inference is concerned.  If the court should decide it is entitled to draw an inference, that may only be used as corroboration of other evidence.  In other words, the fact that the court decides it is proper that an inference should be drawn does not mean that it may convict on foot of that inference alone &mdash; it may not, there must be additional evidence.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have strayed on to different sections and amendments.  It would be inappropriate to go into the issue of prisoner releases, raised by Deputy Shatter.  Amendment No. 4<i>a</i> dealt with that subject and I will deal with it when it arises.  We are now dealing with amendments Nos. 15 and 16 to section 5.</P>

      <P>I will give the Deputy an overview, although I do not know whether that is in order.  His amendment seeks to prevent the Minister exercising any powers of release, remission or commutation in respect of any offence or offences referred to in section 1 of the Bill.  The provisions for special release arrangements in the British-Irish Agreement do not refer to offences committed after the date mentioned in the amendment.  Everyone would agree that it is unreasonable for me to accept a blanket prohibition on releases.  Under Deputy Shatter's amendment, if a prisoner with a short time left to serve was at death's door, no power of release could be exercised.</P>

      <P>And time is of the essence.  This is an extremely important amendment.  I listened with interest last Monday to &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on RTE television when the Minister of State, Deputy Liz O'Donnell, was quite adamant in saying she would support such an amendment.  It was also stated by Deputy Brendan Howlin that he would be supportive of videotaping.</P>
      <P>If we are going to have such draconian measures, if individuals are going to be kept for periods of up to four days in police custody, we ought to have a safeguard of a civil liberty so that we can see clearly that no abuse takes place while a person is in custody.  We are all familiar with the case of Elaine Moore, on behalf of whom my colleagues in Fine Gael have made representations. If this individual or someone like her, someone who is vulnerable, were to be held in police custody for four days, perhaps intimidated, perhaps deprived of sleep, that person could at the end of that period of time sign a confession. So often we have seen examples of people who have signed confessions in that intimidating atmosphere.  Often it is the vulnerable and the innocent who sign confessions, not those who are hardened and have the psychological wherewithal to withstand that.  Terrorists have their so-called green book on how to avoid that sort of intimidation so that they do not sign confessions.  This is a safeguard and already, because of 1984 legislation, there is an option.  Because of the draconian nature of this legislation we are calling for this provision to be mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> It is regrettable that our police force attracted over 1,200 formal complaints in the past year for which records are available.  Seventy-five separate civil actions were initiated against the Garda Síochána in 1997 and 13 gardaí were disciplined arising from sworn inquiries.  The criminal justice system and the absolute necessity to secure safe convictions must be protected from possible wrongdoing by rogue gardaí relative to persons who are in custody and likely to be charged with a serious offence.</P>
    <P>Videotaping is not expensive and not technically demanding.  It must be used when arrests are made under this Act and where inference provisions are to apply.  All of this is common sense if we are to avoid the suspicion that intimidation is taking place.  We have seen examples of it in the cases of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six.  I have the highest respect for the Garda Síochána but in certain circumstances intimidation can take place.  To avoid this suspicion and to ensure we have safe convictions it is vital that we have videotaping.  I call on the Progressive Democrats to honour their commitment and on other parties who have looked for this provision to support this as well.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), lines 13 and 14, to delete &ldquo;which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful in&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;with the intention of assisting&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope even the conservative political parties which are supporting the Government will oppose the provisions of section 8 which are all-encompassing and alarming.  If one leaves aside ideology, anybody who claims to be liberal could not possibly agree to section 8 as it stands. Section 8(1) states: &ldquo;It shall be an offence for a person to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful in the commission by members of any unlawful organisation of serious offences generally or any particular kind of serious offence.&rdquo; I am opposed to the Bill in its entirety, but the amendment seeks the deletion of the terms &ldquo;which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful in&rdquo; the commission of serious offences. Could anybody disagree with the amendment?</P>
      <P>As it stands, the section criminalises everybody. Each person probably has some information in their possession in whatever form which might be useful to a person who wants to commit a serious offence.  This is an incredible and all-embracing blanket provision which criminalises an entire society.  I do not understand what the Government is attempting to achieve.  I hope the other parties in the House will support my request to the Minister to explain why the provision does not state that it will be an offence for a person to collect, record or possess information with the intention of assisting illegal activities.  Why is the provision not framed in that clear manner.  If proof of an offence was adduced, somebody might be convicted.  However, half the population would be criminalised under the section as it stands.  Section 8 (2) does not make up for the way in which section 8(1) is formulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not respond to the points I made about the burden of proof which he denied is being shifted irrevocably under the Bill on to the accused whom until now the State has had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt has committed an offence.  How can he do this when section 8 (1) states that it shall be an offence for a person to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to an unlawful organisation in the commission of a serious offence?  Section 8(2) states that it shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under the section to prove that at the time of the alleged offence the information in question was not being collected or recorded by him or her or in his or her possession for the purpose of its being used in the commission of a serious offence. The burden of proof is being shifted irrevocably on to the accused who is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.  I would be astounded if this <Col N="148" /> catch-all measure had the support of other political parties in the House.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that this legislation could lead to miscarriages of justice.  Deputy Jim Higgins is acting on blind faith in using the security advice available to the Government as justification for supporting it.  That is extremely dangerous. Security advice is not proof.  The security forces in Britain were convinced that six men had perpetrated an appalling atrocity in Birmingham in the 1970s.  They would have availed of the provisions of section 8(1) liberally to try to corroborate their belief.  Even though they were innocent the six men concerned spent 15 years in jail.  We cannot rely on the word of unnamed and unseen members of the security forces.  These provisions would have been manna from heaven for those who framed Annie Maguire and her family in that infamous episode.  This is extremely dangerous and most alarming.</P>
    <P>I hope to receive the support of other parties and ask the Minister if he still holds to his assertion that the burden of proof is not being shifted irrevocably to the accused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 is very important and raises significant questions amongst those who are used to the presumption of innocence as a cornerstone of our legal system.  Amendment No. 24 is an attempt to claw back some of the doubt concerning the dilution, or even reversal, of the presumption of innocence.  The substitution of the words &ldquo;it is intended to be used, or to be made available for use&rdquo; in the commission of a serious offence for the words &ldquo;it is likely to be useful&rdquo; is intended to focus the work of investigation into terrorist organisations more clearly.  We also seek to delete subsection (2).  It is vital that we recognise that under the legislation as proposed, a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Dáil or a local authority who is in possession of information from a committee meeting, for example, is liable for arrest and charge depending on the nature of the material concerned.  A person in one of those positions could get enough public attention to clear themselves, but someone who does not have access to the media may not be able to do so.  It is not acceptable to treat people who cannot be proven to have some criminal intent as criminals on the basis of information available to them.  We all have material available to us which would be useful to persons plotting a serious offence.  As former Deputy Michael McDowell said, a telephone directory may be analysed for such criminal intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not make criminals of us all, but criminal intent is a different matter, and the objective of these amendments is to focus on criminal intent.  If we do not amend this section, I fear we will play into the hands of those looking for propaganda to recruit young people into illegal organisations.  One need only remember an incident when a member of Sinn Féin was arrested while in possession of number plates. The IRA got great propaganda value in the area <Col N="149" /> by saying that this was harassment, as the number plates were collected to demonstrate harassment. The charge was that these number plates were being collected with criminal intent.</P>
    <P>This section will be of propaganda value and will also take up police time with wild goose chases and lines of inquiries which would help to focus investigations will be diluted.  It is important to focus this section if it is to remain in the Bill, but it borders on a charge of reversing the presumption of innocence which is a cornerstone of our legal system.  For that reason the Minister must seriously consider it before it discredits the entire Bill.</P>

This legislation is riddled with constitutional anomalies and difficulties and I predict that if section 4 is not the first section to be found unconstitutional, it will be section 8, as an alternative, if he attempts a prosecution under it.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that in the context of the amendment tabled and section 8(1) to which it applies there is a defence provided in section 2. There is the defence for a person charged with an offence to prove that at the time of the alleged offence the information in question was not being collected or recorded by him or her or in his or her possession for the purpose of its being used in the commission of any serious offence.  The offence is contained in section 1 and is simply collecting, recording or being in possession of information which is of a nature which is likely to be useful in the commission of a serious offence by members of any unlawful organisation.  If the section referred to information not only likely to be useful in the commission of a serious offence but information collected, recorded or obtained by someone and in their possession which was passed on to them or communicated by them to an unlawful organisation to be used in the commission of a serious offence, I could well see that constituting an offence.</P>
      <P>If I case a bank I intend to rob or follow a person I intend to murder, I am recording the information for myself, if I carry out the offence. My following the movements of a bank manager so that I know the time of day he travels to his bank and the route he follows and my passing that information on to the IRA which uses that information to carry out an offence is what should constitute the offence.  Some of the previous speakers made the same point in similar language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a grave difficulty with this section.  We, on this side of the House, are anxious to do what is necessary to ensure the gardaí have available to them any powers they genuinely require to bring to justice those guilty of atrocities.  This section is badly drafted.  The danger of nodding it through tonight and sending <Col N="150" /> it to the Seanad compounds the difficulties we have.</P>
    <P>A journalist accumulating information on the activities of an unlawful organisation could be said to have in his possession information which would allow for the commission of a serious offence.  If a member of an unlawful organisation like the Real IRA is unhappy about future proposed activities of the organisation and he communicates the information about future activities to a journalist, the journalist writes the exposé. The journalist's possession of that information is useful to the unlawful organisation because if he communicated to the unlawful organisation the name of the person who provided the information, it might shoot the person.  This section is not well thought out or well drafted.  It has constitutional problems and there are difficulties also in the context of the European Convention.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister what advice he has from the Attorney General about this section.  Has the Garda or the Commissioner requested the insertion of this section for a particular purpose?  The Minister may not wish to reveal the purpose but where is the need for this section?  We are entitled to an explanations as to why this section is included in the legislation.  Has the Minister considered the grave dangers it poses to a democracy?  Other Deputies referred to miscarriages of justices which occurred in the past in other jurisdictions. There is always the danger in the aftermath of the type of appalling atrocity we saw in Omagh that ill-thought out legislation is enacted by parliaments by way of a knee-jerk reaction. This is one aspect that is ill-considered.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's responses to the amendments proposed and his explanation as to the need for this section.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to retain the section in the legislation and is unwilling to accept amendments from this side of the House, I invite him to consider, as he has not done with his own Report Stage amendment, providing for an offence under section 8(1) that the information collected is collected with the intention of communicating it to an unlawful organisation or members of an unlawful organisation or is so communicated. There is need to ensure we deal with this issue correctly.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Members to give us time to reach the Minister's amendment No. 26 which is bizarre in the extreme.  I am not sure whether the impact of that amendment is fully understood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because Deputy Shatter has said much of what I wanted to say. The Minister may have been coerced into putting this section in the legislation, which appears to mirror the British legislation.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, did not appear to be briefed about this when she appeared on a radio programme with me last week.  To use a common expression, she was &ldquo;gobsmacked&rdquo; when the interviewer put it to her.  This is one of the sections she seemed to have difficulty with and <Col N="151" /> she appeared to question it in yesterday's newspaper.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister not to put this section to the House because I am equally unhappy that the amendments tabled by our Opposition colleagues will address the problems.  I await with interest the Minister's explanation for his amendment No. 26 and the reason it is being brought forward tonight.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have second thoughts about this section.  I presume it has something to do with a person being found with a list of car registration or telephone numbers, as happened in the case of a group of people in the UK who were carrying out surveillance on a property and who had particular information.  That is different from the offence referred to here which refers to collecting, not using, information.  If the Minister were on this side of the House and I brought forward such a section he would find a number of holes in it and would ask me to withhold it until such time as he had an opportunity to amend it. If the Minister puts it tonight I hope he will come back with amendments later this evening on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Neither I nor the Government have been coerced by anybody.  We are reacting to a real and serious threat.  Incidentally, to my knowledge, Deputy O'Donnell did not query this section.</P>
      <P>Section 8, as drafted, provides for an offence of collecting, recording or possessing information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful in the commission by members of any unlawful organisation of serious offences.  It provides for a defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have that.  The Minister should move on.  He is taking up too much time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for a person charged to prove that the information was not being collected for the purpose of its being used in the commission of such offences.  Under the amendments now presented it would have to be proved that the information was intended to be used or made available to members of an unlawful organisation and in those circumstances the defence allowed for would not be necessary.</P>
      <P>It is difficult, if not impossible, to see how the section would be of any use if these amendments were accepted.  It would be virtually impossible to prove that the information would be used by members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of an offence.  If that could be proved there would probably be no need for the offence because the person could be charged with conspiracy or aiding or abetting an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter said that the passage of the information should constitute the offence but in those circumstances it appears there would be no point in having the legislative provision as it is now presented.  What I propose merits a provision <Col N="152" /> in UK legislation and is designed to deal with circumstances where a person is gathering certain types of information.  For example, if gardaí were to discover that someone possessed details of the movements of members of the RUC and literature on bomb-making equipment, they might not be able to show that this information was going to be used for the commission of a particular offence.  In those circumstances, it is proposed under section 8 that the person could be charged with an offence and what would be at issue would be for that person to show the information was not being collected for the purpose of the commission of an offence by members of an unlawful organisation.  Given the realities involved in combating the ruthless activities of terrorist organisations, the provision is reasonable and balanced and I oppose the amendments which, as I explained, would be likely to deprive the section of any effect.</P>
    <P>I reject Deputy Joe Higgins's assertion that the burden of proof is being shifted.  The offence as constituted is contained in subsection (1) but that offence must still be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  Subsection (2) provides that it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove that, at the time of the offence, the information in question was not being collected or recorded by him or her for the purpose of being used in the commission of any serious offence.  That does not obviate the necessity for the offence to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before the Special Criminal Court.  There is a difference between the proof required for the prosecution to succeed and the defence with which subsection (2) deals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins said that an unlawful organisation is an unlawful organisation under section 18 irrespective of whether there is a proscription order on it.  However, it has never been known for a person to be convicted of being a member of an unlawful organisation without there being a proscription order because such an order, under section 19, is conclusive evidence.  If an offence is brought under section 8, it will be for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the information was likely to be useful in the commission by members of unlawful organisations of certain types of serious offences.  In the example of a journalist to which Deputy Shatter referred, such a person may collect and possess information which could be construed as being useful to members of an unlawful organisation if supplied to them.  In the unlikely event of a journalist being prosecuted for that, it is clearly stated in subsection (2) that it is a defence for the journalist to prove that the information was not being held for such a purpose.  In any event, the prosecution would still have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the individual possessed the information for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with serious offences which are defined for the purposes of this section to only include the most serious offences involving loss of life, serious personal injury, false imprisonment or serious loss of or damage to property. <Col N="153" /> The offence is targeted specifically at those who may not be directly involved in acts of terrorist violence but who play an essential part in their planning or preparation by the collection of information which is used for the purposes of the selection or identification of targets for terrorist attacks or in the carrying out of such attacks.  Terrorist groups cannot operate without the active assistance and involvement of such persons who must, therefore, also bear some responsibility for the use to which the information they collect is put.  However, as with the offence of possession of articles for purposes connected with firearms and explosives, it will equally be open to a person who has been proved to have information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;4(a) Where a member of the Garda Síochána arrests without warrant a person ('the arrested person') whom he or she, with reasonable cause, suspects of having committed a serious offence, the arrested person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) may be taken to a Garda Síochána station, and</P>
      <P>(ii) if the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of the station has, at the time of the arrested person's arrival there, reasonable grounds for believing that his or her detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence, may be detained in that station for a period or periods authorised by subsection (4A).</P>
      <P>(b) Without prejudice to paragraph (a), where a member of the Garda Síochána suspects an arrested person of having committed a serious offence, that person may&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) be taken to a place of detention, and</P>
      <P>(ii) if a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector who is not investigating the serious offence has,</P>
      <P>at the time of that person's arrival there, reasonable grounds for believing that his or her detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the serious offence, be detained in that place of detention for a period or periods authorised by subsection (4A).</P>
      <P>(4A)(a) The period for which a person may be detained under subsection (4) shall, subject to the provisions of this subsection, not exceed 6 hours from the time of his or her arrest.</P>
      <P>(b) An officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent may direct that a person detained under subsection (4) be detained for a further period not exceeding 18 hours if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned.</P>
      <P>(c) An officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent may direct that a person detained pursuant to a direction under paragraph (b) be detained for a further period not exceeding 24 hours, if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned.</P>
      <P>(d) A direction under paragraph (b) or (c) may be given orally or in writing and, if given orally, shall be recorded in writing as soon as practicable.</P>
      <P>(e) Where a direction has been given under paragraph (b) or (c), the fact that the direction was given, the date and time when it was given and the name and rank of the officer of the Garda Síochána who gave it shall be recorded.</P>
      <P>(f) The direction or, if it was given orally, the written record of it shall be signed by the officer giving it and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) shall state the date and time when it was given, the officer's name and rank and that the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention was necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned, and</P>
      <P>(ii) shall be attached to and form part of the custody record (within the meaning of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations, 1987) in respect of the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(g) (i) An officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent may apply to a judge of the Circuit Court or a judge of the District Court for a warrant authorising <Col N="157" /> the detention of a person detained pursuant to a direction under paragraph (c) for a further period not exceeding 72 hours if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned.  On an application under this subsection the detained person shall be present in court and may make submissions or have submissions made on his or her behalf before the court.</P>
    <P>(ii) On an application under subparagraph (i) the judge concerned shall issue a warrant authorising the detention of the person to whom the application relates for a further period not exceeding 72 hours if, but only if, the judge is satisfied that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>(h) (i) An officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent may apply to a judge of the Circuit Court or a judge of the District Court for a warrant authorising the detention of a person detained under a warrant issued pursuant to paragraph (g) (ii) for a further period not exceeding 48 hours, if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned.</P>
    <P>(ii) On an application under subparagraph (i) the judge concerned shall issue a warrant authorising the detention of the person to whom the application relates for a further period not exceeding 48 hours if, but only if, the judge is satisfied that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>(4B) On an application under subsection (4A) the person to whom the application relates shall be produced before the judge concerned and the judge shall hear any submissions made and consider any evidence adduced by or on behalf of the person and the officer of the Garda Síochána making the application.</P>
    <P>(4C) When issuing a warrant under subsection (4A) the judge concerned may order that the person concerned be brought before a judge of the Circuit Court or a judge of the District Court at a specified time or times during the period of detention specified in the warrant and if, upon the person's being so brought before such a judge, he or she is not satisfied that the person's detention is justified, the judge shall revoke the warrant and order the immediate release from custody of the person.</P>
    <P>(4D) If at any time during the detention of a person pursuant to this section there are no longer reasonable grounds for believing that <Col N="158" /> his or her detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence to which the detention relates, he or she shall, subject to subsection (4E), be released from custody forthwith unless he or she is charged or caused to be charged with an offence and is brought before a court as soon as may be in connection with such charge or his or her detention is authorised apart from this Act.</P>
    <P>(4E) If at any time during the detention of a person pursuant to this section a member of the Garda Síochána, with reasonable cause, suspects that person of having committed a serious offence other than the offence to which the detention relates and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the member of the Garda Síochána then in charge of the Garda Síochána station, or (b) in case the person is being detained in a place of detention, a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector who is not investigating the offence to which the detention relates or the other offence, has reasonable grounds for believing that the continued detention of the person is necessary for the proper investigation of that other offence, the person may continue to be detained in relation to the other offence as if that offence was the offence for which the person was originally detained.</P>
    <P>(4F) To avoid doubt, it is hereby declared that a person shall not be detained pursuant to this section for more than 168 hours from the time of his or her arrest, not including any period which is to be excluded under section 4 (8) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, in reckoning a period of detention.</P>
    <P>(4G) Nothing in this section shall affect the operation of section 4 of Criminal Justice Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>(4H)(a) The Minister may make regulations prescribing specified places as places where a person may be detained pursuant to subsection (4) (b), and a place for the time being standing so specified is referred to in this Act as a &lsquo;place of detention&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(b) Section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 and any regulations made thereunder shall, with any necessary modifications, apply in relation to places of detention as they apply in relation to Garda Síochána stations.</P>
    <P>(4I) Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will be brief because the debate so far has been <Col N="159" /> marked by a lack of contributions on the part of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I hope that between now and the end of the debate the Minister will avail more often than heretofore of the opportunity to explain many of these sections, rather than merely paraphrasing the sections as contained in the Bill in reply to questions raised.</P>
    <P>This is a lengthy amendment which attempts, on the part of Fine Gael, to offer an element of streamlining as far as all aspects of detention and extension of detention are concerned.  The Minister will be aware of the debate which took place on the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act two years ago.  The features of that Act, as far as detention is concerned, are reproduced in the form of an amendment this evening.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we treat those persons accused of drug offences in a more stringent and draconian fashion than those accused of very serious terrorist offences.</P>
    <P>This amendment will extend significantly the powers of detention available under the Offences against the State Act in this jurisdiction.  Included in what will, in effect, be a seven day period of detention will be a number of built-in safeguards which should meet the concerns of those who might not wish to have a period of detention of seven days' duration.</P>
    <P>At a stage when an extension to a detention period is sought, not only will an application have to be made before a judge sitting in court but the accused person, on whose behalf the application for detention is being made, will also have an opportunity of appearing in court, making submissions and having a lawyer present to outline why an extension to the detention period might not be reasonable in the circumstances.  Before any decision on an extension could be granted, such a person would have every opportunity to place before the court reasons in his or her defence why he or she had acquitted himself or herself within the meaning of the legislation The judge would obviously have to satisfy himself or herself on the necessity for a further order under the section and he or she would have to be satisfied that such an order was required for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and also that the investigation was being conducted in a diligent and expeditious manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in this legislation, has provided for a cumulative detention period of five days.  He will recall the Emergency Powers Act, 1976, which was introduced following the horrible murder in this jurisdiction of the then British ambassador to Ireland.  That Act allowed for a detention period of seven days.  Such a detention period was deemed necessary to ensure the Garda had sufficient time to conduct their investigations. I would have thought that, having regard to the serious manner in which we are treating this legislation, the Government might also have considered a seven day detention period in this instance.  The safeguards contained in this amendment <Col N="160" /> are sufficient to meet people's concerns.  I would like the Minister to outline his reasons for not allowing for the same period of detention as was catered for under the Criminal Justice Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>Criminal law requires proper and adequate codification and should be consistent.  I can think of no better way of ensuring that than to introduce various Bills which attempt to protect society from those who are not prepared to abide by the rule of law and order.  A set series of measures should be introduced in order that people would be aware of the law.  Creating a labyrinthine structure of legislation makes the interpretation of the law extremely complex and does little to instil public confidence in the criminal justice system.  The Minister would be doing a service by providing for such consistency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I am at a total loss to know why the Minister has not opted for a seven day detention period.  It is difficult to understand why he would settle for something less than that and enshrine it in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act.  Why is a distinction being made between drug traffickers and barons on the one hand and paramilitaries on the other when both cases concern lethal, cold blooded and insidious actions?</P>
      <P>I recall vividly when the Minister was in Opposition and the drug trafficking legislation was being passed through the House by the then Minister, Deputy Owen, he advocated that the strongest possible measures should be taken, such as the seven day detention provision, to ensure a valid conviction against drug traffickers.  The 1996 drug trafficking legislation is positive proof that, irrespective of what has been said, the State has the capacity to avail of strong measures like seven day detention without abuse, overuse and the dangers of miscarriage of justice.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for a gradual approach to detention, starting with six hours, 18 hours, 24 hours, etc.  Paragraph (g)(i) which provides for 72 hours detention states: &ldquo;A judge concerned should issue a warrant authorising the detention of the person to whom the application relates for a further period not exceeding 72 hours but only if the judge is satisfied that further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously&rdquo;. The same provision applies where extension of a warrant is sought for a further 48 hours.  There is also a provision that if at any stage it becomes obvious there is insufficient evidence, the person is released forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the arguments the Minister will make is that in dealing with drugs you are dealing with something that has to be ingested and passed through your system.  That argument was not used when the 1996 legislation was being passed.  There is a parallel here in that one case exactly replicates the other.  There should be no differentiation between the effective seven day detention <Col N="161" /> provided for in the drug trafficking legislation and this provision.  I cannot understand the rationale of Members.  On the one hand we are talking tough, but tonight we are reluctant to introduce a very effective measure that has worked for drug trafficking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment for a number of reasons.  First, I do not believe it is necessary.  The seven day detention provision has been referred to.  Deputy Higgins said that the basic reason for inclusion of that provision in the drugs legislation relates to the time it takes for drugs to pass through the intestine.</P>
      <P>Second, the Garda Síochána does not want this provision because it feels it is unnecessary.  In this case we should defer to the views of the Garda. There is no useful purpose to be served by including unnecessary harsh provisions in the Bill.  It is adequately harsh and is designed to serve a purpose. If we can go forward on the basis that it will serve that purpose, that should be adequate.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a balance between harsh measures and concerns about civil liberties, etc.  The Minister has got it right and this extra harsh provision would serve no useful purpose.  There are also concerns about how this measure would relate to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights.  There is the risk that we would find ourselves in difficulty with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), line 28, after &ldquo;explosives&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;with the express intention of using the explosives or firearms to cause grievous bodily harm to another person or killing another person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 12 deals with another all-embracing new offence created by the Minister.  Section 12 (1) states that a person who instructs or trains another or receives instruction or training in the making or use of firearms and explosives shall be guilty of an offence.  While continuing my vehement opposition to all the measures in this section, I am putting down an amendment which adds &ldquo;with the express intention of using the explosives or firearms to cause grievous bodily harm to another person or killing another person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The way this debate is being handled bears out the correctness of the protest I made this morning to the Taoiseach about the allocation of time.  Not one Deputy from the major Opposition parties supported me.  They probably agreed the allocation of time with the Whips.  It is absolutely incredible.  Members of the leading party of the Opposition have made devastating criticisms of section 8 and have raised serious constitutional issues.  Yet, the Bill is being rushed through with the consent of all the main parties.  The folly and irresponsibility of it was clear to me and I hope it is clear to more people now, so it will not happen again.  Fine Gael is all over the place in relation to the legislation and it clearly needed more time to consider its position.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I ask the Minister to listen to me on this occasion.  In his provision there is no distinction with regard to the innocent use of firearms, for example, for clay pigeon shooting.  The hunting of birds and animals is not a nice activity and I do not approve of it but it is not illegal.  A person training someone to be a good clay pigeon shooter is guilty of an offence under section 12(1).  My amendment specifies that to train someone with the intention of maiming or killing a person is a serious offence.  Why is that not spelt out in the Bill?  I hope the Minister can offer a rational explanation.</P>
      <P>This is my third attempt to seek an explanation from the Minister on the burden of proof.  Perhaps he will be able to give a satisfactory reply on this occasion.  It is clear from section 12(1) that a person who simply trains somebody to use a gun for innocent purposes shall be guilty of an offence.  Subsection (2) provides that it &ldquo;shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to prove that the giving or receiving of such instruction or training was done with lawful authority&rdquo; or for innocent reasons.  In other words, the burden of proof is irrevocably shifted.</P>
      <P>When a similar point arose with regard to section 8, the Minister said there is still an onus on the prosecution &ldquo;to prove&rdquo;; but to prove what?  Under section 12(1) it means the onus is on the prosecution to prove that a person instructed another person on how to fire a gun.  However, that instruction might be given for lawful reasons. Under another subsection the burden of proof is shifted to the person concerned to prove that the instruction was for lawful purposes.</P>
      <P>This legislation is turning on its head the traditional approach to where the burden of proof lies. In two previous attempts the Minister failed to answer this point.  I hope that having spelt it out clearly, he will now be able to give an answer.  He might also explain the logic of section 12(1).  Why does it provide for an all encompassing offence with regard to activities in which 99 per cent of participants are innocent people?  Why not provide for a more specific offence, for example, training people in the use of explosives or firearms to assault, intimidate, maim or kill others?  Why is the provision so broad?</P>
      <P>Members of the Opposition have raised serious questions about this legislation even though they support it.  There is an onus on them to demand answers from the Minister in this regard.</P>

      <P>Section 12(1) states baldly that &ldquo;a <Col N="164" /> person who instructs or trains another or receives instruction or training in the making or use of firearms or explosives shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.  The section provides for two defences: that the instruction or training or the giving or receiving of it was done with lawful authority or on the basis of a reasonable excuse.</P>
      <P>I do not know what type of lawful authority exists in this regard.  Leaving aside the exception provided in subsection (4) which relates to the Defences Forces and the Garda Síochána whose members are trained in the use of these items, many other people would be affected by this provision. Some people are trained in the use of explosives for mining, quarrying and demolition work.  Many people throughout the country use firearms for legitimate purposes.  They possess shotguns for the control of vermin and hunting rifles for hunting and, although some people might not approve of such activities, the weapons are legitimately held.</P>
      <P>Anybody would prudently train or arrange training for a young family member who wished to engage in such sports or activities.  If a person cannot prove that this was done with lawful authority, or does not have a reasonable excuse for doing so he commits an offence.  Can the Minister explain what a lawful authority is for people not included in the assembly referred to in subsection (4)?  If I am an ordinary citizen holding a firearm certificate and receiving instruction in the use of a shotgun for legitimate purposes or being trained in the use of explosives for mining or quarrying is there a lawful authority to whom I can turn to sanction my training?  I am not aware of one.  I know of no official person in our public service or local authorities who is entrusted with giving lawful authority for training in the use of firearms or explosives.  If there is I would like the Minister to tell me who it is.  The courts would be interested in knowing of this authority if they are to implement this legislation.  Judges will have people charged before them under this legislation and they will need to know what the lawful authority is.  They will also need to know what constitutes a reasonable excuse.  Would it be a reasonable excuse for me to say that I was training with a pistol because I wanted to try out for the Irish team in the European pistol shooting championships?  People who use hunting rifles and any of the more specialised firearms already must conform to a number of stringent conditions in order to hold their gun licences.  People cannot, without moving heaven and earth buy a rifle of bigger than a certain bore.  If they do they must show that they have a safe place to keep the rifle or else keep it in the local Garda station.  Such people have legitimate reasons for training in the use of firearms but I do not know if they have lawful authority.  Can the Minister explain what he means by lawful authority and what he has in mind when he speaks of a reasonable excuse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another section where specific provision is made for a defence.  This involves a clear and unambiguous reversal of the burden of proof.  If <Col N="165" /> I am brought before the courts because I have been receiving training in the use of a firearm I will be guilty of an offence.  My only defence will be that I had lawful authority or a reasonable excuse.  I am not told what lawful authority or a reasonable excuse is.  I will have to prove my innocence rather than the prosecution prove my guilt.  Will the Minister tell us why the burden of proof has been reversed here as in two other places in the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am perplexed.  Section 12(1) states that a &ldquo;person who instructs or trains another or receives instruction or training in the making or use of firearms or explosives shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo; Can the Minister tell us why that is?  If a person cannot prove lawful authority or give a reasonable excuse but there is no evidence of illegal activity or of connection with an illegal organisation is such a person still liable to be convicted and sentenced to as much as ten years in prison?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another section which threatens to discredit the legislation the Minister is trying to enact.  It has all the hallmarks of rushed legislation, there is no doubt about that. When one reads it and listens to those who have spoken, clearly the burden of proof is on the accused, which radically turns our legal system back to front.  It has a serious danger also of effectively allowing lazy investigation, especially when there is a crisis and a considerable amount of public anger after an atrocity.  Proper forensic testing will send somebody who is guilty down.</P>
      <P>We have had bad forensic testing in the past and huge miscarriages of justice relating to firearms and explosives.  This is where the Minister needs to focus his energy and resources.  His own forensic testing unit is severely under-resourced. He would admit that himself and maybe blame the Minster for Finance.  Nonetheless, that is where the test will be as to the seriousness of the Government in dealing with offences relating to arms and explosives.  This section does nothing except put up a smoke screen whose constitutionality and effectiveness are extremely questionable. There is a serious risk of turning the legal system back to front resulting in gross miscarriages of justice.  I ask the Minister to look more closely at the section and come back with commitments on forensic testing, which would ensure some credibility for his intentions.</P>

      <P>It appears the language in section 12(1) is not sustainable or defensible.  It is totally unqualified; it is not even qualified directly to subsection (2).  However, even if it were to be defended in terms of section 12(2), I imagine the Minister would say that lawful authority and reasonable excuse being allowed as a defence will make it possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interesting point made by Deputy Dukes is that the offences in section 12(1) and the lawful authorities are not specified.  However, the <Col N="166" /> assumption is that in any case something that is allowable only by having the permission of a lawful authority, or something that has to be defended by offering a reasonable excuse, is entirely abnormal.  There is no construction of subsection (2) other than that there is no normal legal use of a firearm in terms of instruction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and training and no preparation of explosives other than for the use of demolition sections of local authorities in knocking down a dangerous building.  These are not specified in terms of lawful authority.  The suggestion is that in such a vacuum they are all offences and the person has to come in with a defence. Are people to argue the existence of the public good to defend themselves?  It is absurd.  The fact that the provision has a sanction of ten years tagged onto it makes it ludicrous.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to acknowledge that section 12(1) is unsustainable and to re-examine it before Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <P>Section 12 provides for the offence of instructing or training another, or receiving instruction or training in the making or use of firearms and explosives.  It is a defence to show that the training or instruction was given or received with lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  This amendment would involve having to prove that the training was being given with the express intention of using the explosives or firearms to cause grievous bodily harm to another person, or killing another person.  This would mean in practise that the Garda would have to be able to link the training to a specific offence that was going to be committed.  Putting it simply, if the Garda found members of an unlawful organisation drilling with firearms on the side of a mountain and someone giving instructions, an offence would not be committed under the section if the amendment were accepted because they would have to prove what offence would be committed as a result of the training.  This would completely reduce the effectiveness of this section and I cannot support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the House are reading section 12(1) in isolation and not taking into account that, according to subsection (2), it is clearly a defence for a person to show that the instruction or training was done with lawful authority or that he or she had a reasonable excuse.  In those circumstances it must be clear that the Director of Public Prosecutions when presented with a file such as this would have to be satisfied that the State was in a position to prove its case against the individual.  Clearly if there was the possibility that an individual could prove that what he or she did was done with lawful authority or could produce a reasonable excuse and the Director of Public Prosecutions was satisfied that the possibility was such that he would not be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, there would <Col N="167" /> be no point in the State bringing the case because the case could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  If an individual was in a position to prove that the training or instruction was done with lawful authority or that there was a reasonable excuse, that would stand as a defence which clearly would rebut the prosecution in that instance.</P>
    <P>If one reads subsection (1) in isolation one could be forgiven for making the case which has been made but I respectfully submit that the case falls because of the presence of subsection (2). For example, section 15 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, provides that:</P>
    <P>Save as authorised by a Minister of State under this section, and subject to the exceptions hereinafter mentioned, it shall not be lawful for any assembly of persons to practise or to train or drill themselves in or be trained or drilled in the use of arms or the performance of military exercises, evolutions, or manoeuvres nor for any persons to meet together or assemble for the purpose of so practising or training or drilling or being trained or drilled.</P>
    <P>If there was no such authorisation for that, it would obviously be an offence.  That subsection (2) is set out in the Bill means that the situation is as I outlined.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: &mdash;&mdash;but it is quite clear that in the aftermath of the terrible events at Omagh some people, who are perhaps in his Department and who are over anxious in regard to what they want to put on the Statute Book, have bent the Minister's ear beyond any rational understanding.</P>
      <P>Even the short and satisfactory debate we have had points out the idiocy of some of these proposals. It is repressive legislation but some of its proposals are also idiotic and this is perhaps one of the clearest examples of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in many courts, including higher courts, at various cases.  One thing I have learnt is that when one's counsel stands up to argue, he or she does not argue that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in moving a Bill stated that it should really be taken to mean other than what it says.  You would be laughed out of court if you tried that approach.  We must deal with the construction of the Act before deciding the outcome.  It is incontrovertible that under section 12(1) it is an offence to engage in what is <Col N="168" /> a totally innocent activity.  It is written in black and white, one is guilty of an offence under subsection (1) if one trains somebody in the use of firearms.  Subsection (2) states: &ldquo;it shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence.&rdquo; but one is guilty of an offence under subsection (1).  The fact that one might or might not be charged is fortuitous, but this Bill criminalises entirely innocent activity, and that is absolutely idiotic.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear why this measure is included.  It is included as another catch-all section for corroborative evidence, particularly in regard to membership of an unlawful organisation.  A senior officer stating his belief that the accused is a member of an unlawful organisation may require corroboration and give evidence that such person was teaching another person how to shoot clay pigeons.  It is part of a general all-encompassing section which is discredited.  The Minister has conceded our point; the burden of proof is shifted and he has had to belabour the fact that innocent people will have to rely on section 12(2).  He has conceded the point that he has irrevocably shifted the burden of proof onto entirely innocent people.  The Minister should accept this amendment or table an amendment which would make this less idiotic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of a careful lengthy reply has failed to explain what is meant by the words &ldquo;lawful authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo;.  In that failure, he has admitted that this section is only there for show.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a case where the Garda would come across a number of members of an organisation on a mountainside drilling with firearms or being trained in the use of firearms or explosives.  If the gardaí find a group of people on a mountainside in Wicklow, Connemara or anywhere else &mdash; it does not have to be a mountainside &mdash; engaged in training in firearms or explosives, what else are they likely to find?  If a group of subversives are being trained in the use of a kalashnikov, an automatic pistol, a revolver, semtex, plastic explosives or homemade explosives, one can be sure of a number of things.  They will not possess a firearms licence nor will they have a licence for each kalashnikov, automatic pistol or revolver.  That being the case they are immediately guilty of an offence under the Firearms Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one finds a group of people being instructed in the use of plastic explosives, semtex or homemade explosives, they will not possess a certificate such as that required when blowing up the cooling tower at Allenwood power station or demolishing a dangerous building.  One is obliged to obtain permission from the Garda to do such things.  The people in question will not have a certificate of that kind in their possession, particularly if they have home-made explosives comprising a mixture of fertiliser, fuel oil, etc.  By virtue of the fact that these people are in possession of semtex, plastic explosives or home-made <Col N="169" /> explosives, they are already committing an offence and there is no need for the provisions contained in the section.</P>
    <P>There is no requirement to include subsection (2) in the section.  One need not define what is a defence because there is no defence for being in possession of an unlicensed firearm or explosives without an authorisation to use them.  There is no need to go to the trouble of reversing the burden of proof in the way it is done in subsection (2) in order to convict people of such offences once there is adequate eyewitness evidence from the gardaí who apprehend those involved in this sort of activity.  We do not need the section, the reversal of the burden of proof it contains or the mysterious, inexplicable, unexplained, mumbo jumbo about lawful authority or reasonable excuse. There is no reasonable excuse under the law for having an unlicensed firearm or being in possession of explosives without a permit.  The law already caters for what the Minister states needs to be done.  We do not need this &ldquo;cockamamie&rdquo; section to do that because the activities against which it legislates are already offences in their own right.</P>
    <P>This debate has shown that it might not be a bad idea if the Minister, instead of producing garbage of this sort, recognised that there are certain legitimate uses of firearms and explosives and that perhaps we should establish a lawful authority to regulate how people are trained in the use of these dangerous devices.  There is no such authority in existence at present and the Minister has failed to explain why that is the case. We do not need to discuss reasonable excuses because there is no reasonable excuse for people to be engaged in paramilitary training on mountainsides or to be taught how to use kalashnikov assault rifles, explosives, etc.  The section is not needed and including it in the Bill will place in law an unenforceable and unworkable provision, which is bad.</P>
    <P>Earlier today I listened to Deputy O'Malley doing his tough guy act for the Progressive Democrats and sticking out his chest with pride while discussing the 1972 Act, which encountered difficulties while passing through the House.  I am familiar with such difficulties because I had trouble putting an extradition Act through the House in 1986 and 1987 due to the opposition of those on the Government benches and Deputy O'Malley who wanted to insert a <i>prima facie</i> provision into the of warrants procedure with the UK.  He did not succeed because I stuck to my guns.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage, Deputy O'Malley regaled Members with the story of one section of the 1972 Act which he went to great trouble to have passed.  In 26 years, the provision of that Act to which the Deputy referred &mdash; under which a chief superintendent can obtain a closure order against a building he believes is being used by a subversive organisation &mdash; was used on one occasion.  I am not a betting man but I would bet my bottom <Col N="170" /> dollar that whatever was achieved by that one use of that provision, which was upheld on appeal in the High Court, could well have been achieved by other means.</P>
    <P>We do not need to clutter the Statute Book with unnecessary legislation.  We do not need window dressing of the kind contained in section 12 which will enable the Minister to pretend that he is doing the devil and all about this problem in order to assuage a mood of public outrage.  We do not need to include in law mechanisms which are so complex and unfathomable as to be utterly unusable.  The Minister's explanation of the workings of the section was a model exposition of the futility of this measure.  I want the Minister to get the report of what he said during this debate, sit back in tranquility some evening and amuse himself by reading it because it was the most hollow, futile explanation I have heard in 17 years in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, one would not be able to make a successful film such as &ldquo;Saving Private Ryan&rdquo; without being guilty of an offence and would have to offer as an excuse that people had to be trained in manoeuvres and to use explosives.  That is another little footnote on the realms of absurdity to which this subsection can be interpreted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Dukes had to leave because his argument is as disingenuous as the earlier statement by Deputy Flanagan that I was not giving explanations when he knows I am limited by time and most of the time seems to be taken up by the Opposition, which is its privilege.  His argument is disingenuous mainly because neither I nor the Government took this matter lightly.  We carefully considered the provisions and it is a disgrace that somebody of the Deputy's experience should insinuate otherwise.</P>
      <P>If I were to accept Deputy Higgins's amendment the offence could not be established because it would be impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the instruction was taking place to cause grievously bodily harm to or to kill another person.  Deputy Michael Higgins appears to agree with Deputy Dukes that the provision with regard to a reasonable excuse is a joke. However, it was a standard provision in criminal legislation long before the foundation of the State.  That is how much of a joke that is and now we know where the joke lies.  This is no joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An individual can have a reasonable excuse.  If an individual was being trained, to use Deputy Joe Higgins's example, to clay pigeon shoot, that would constitute a reasonable excuse.  If, for example, members of the Army were training other members how to shoot that would constitute lawful authority.  Gardaí teaching colleagues how to discharge rifles, etc, would be teaching with lawful authority.  However, to suggest that one could not have a situation where there would not be a reasonable excuse or lawful authority, <Col N="171" /> and that this provision is a window dressing exercise is as illogical as it is farcical and nonsensical.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes stated that there could not be a reasonable excuse for having explosives anyway. Of course, he defeats his argument because if there could not be a reasonable excuse for having explosives then there would be no need for the defence of reasonable excuse because one would be correct on convicting under subsection (1) in the first instance.  That is the circuitous, nonsensical argument put forward by the logician, Deputy Dukes.</P>
    <P>It has long been the practice in Irish criminal legislation to establish an offence and then go on to outline what the defence might be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>For example, the Firearms Act, 1990 states that it shall be a defence if one can show good reason or lawful authority for having knives, etc., in a public place.  This provision has been the law in Northern Ireland for a considerable period and the sky has not fallen in. Deputy Dukes may not be aware that Irish criminal law is similar to British criminal law and that both of our legal systems derive from common law.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McManus that something is wrong.  I regard Deputy Dukes's argument as disingenuous &mdash; he insulted the Government by alleging this legislation was a smokescreen, when it is dealing with a serious problem in a serious fashion.  He hardly expects me or any other member of the Government to accept such a sneer on a matter as grave as this.  The offence in section 12 of the Bill is a major one and it carries a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment and/or a fine.  This provision is designed to deal with people involved in instructing or training people in the making or use of firearms or explosives for the purpose of blowing up people or property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">

      <P>The Minister must accept the good faith of this side of the House.  Strong words were said but it is wrong of him to adopt this attitude to the amendment.  We all want to get the bombers and killers but this section undermines the Bill.  It makes it an offence to train and instruct or to get training and instruction in the making or use of firearms &mdash; it does not say &ldquo;illegal firearms&rdquo;.  This means that a person who buys and has a permit for a legal firearm will be less likely to end up in court if he does not learn how to use it &mdash; that is the logic behind the section and the Minister cannot simply rubbish that view.  We made the point that there is an obligation on the Minister not only to find the guilty and punish them but to protect the innocent. I take it from what he said about the earlier Act that this is already covered in relation to people organising in a military fashion and for illegal purposes.  However, the experience has been that almost inevitably the innocent are drawn into this kind of legislation.  At some point somebody who is innocent and may be considered suspicious because of the way he or she looks or talks or because he or she cannot express himself or herself well and is not able to give a pat answer may be drawn into this legislation. The gardaí can get it wrong.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to understand that we are not playing games here.  We are taking this seriously despite the fact that we were not given the necessary time to tease out the detail of this Bill and that the Government is insisting on bringing in this Bill in one day for no good reason other than it likes to do it that way.  It did that with the legislation on Cabinet confidentiality and the firearms amendment legislation to suit the Italian tourists and it is doing it again now. We sought to extend the time for this debate to provide for proper reflection, but we did not succeed. The Minister has a duty to do his best as regards this Bill.  I do not like to hear the type of response he has given in this House to the serious questions that were raised about this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  &mdash;A person under the age of seventeen years shall not be detained under section 30 of the Act of 1939 (as amended by this Act).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the age at which persons may be detained under the Bill.  I am concerned because I see no lower age limit.  We are all conscious of past miscarriages of justice such as the Annie Maguire case, which was one of the most notorious.  Some young children were locked up for a number of years and there were tragic consequences.  How does this legislation affect younger people or will they be dealt with under the Criminal Justice Act?</P>

      <P>This amendment provides that a person under 17 will not be detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act. I appreciate the thinking behind this amendment but it would be very foolish to pretend that the type of organisation we are dealing with would not use 16 year olds to pursue their activities, particularly if it was aware that those young people could not be detained for questioning. Deputy McManus would accept that if the Garda knew that a 16 year old was involved in the Omagh bombing it would be vital that they were able to question him or her.  The approach taken in relation to detention of young persons, which applies under section 30 as it stands and longer periods of detention under the Drug Trafficking Act, is not to exclude the possibility of detention but to provide in the custody regulations special measures in relation to the detention of young people.  The custody regulations make special provision in relation to the detention of young people such as the obligation to notify an adult <Col N="175" /> about the detention.  That is the proper approach to this matter and in the circumstances I cannot support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.  &mdash;The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform shall not exercise any power conferred on the Government or the Minister, as the case may be, by or under any enactment to provide for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the release (including temporary release) of prisoners from prisons or places of detention, or</P>
      <P>(b) the remission or commutation of any punishment imposed by a court exercising criminal jurisdiction,</P>
      <P>in respect of any person convicted of any offence or offences as referred to in section 5(1) of this Act on or after 22nd May, 1998.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to offences under section 5 of the Act and inferences drawn from the failure of an accused person to mention particular facts in relation to offences in which he or she was suspected of involvement.  This applies particularly to the prisoner issue, and Fine Gael is very supportive of the reference to the prisoners issue in the British-Irish Agreement.  A fundamental part of advancing the peace process is the often delicate question of prisoners, and the manner of prisoner release is enshrined in legislation that the Minister was reluctant to bring forward.</P>
      <P>It is important in the context of this legislation that we are clear on the sentences that will be imposed by courts in given circumstances and that these sentences should not come under the ambit of the British-Irish Agreement's provisions for the early release of prisoners.  This amendment specifically states that the Minister shall not exercise any power of commutation or order the release of any prisoner, temporary or otherwise, from a prison or place of detention with particular reference to an offence committed after 22 May 1998.</P>
      <P>It is important to send a strong message.  I believe the Minister will agree that the import and, indeed, the objective of this legislation is to ensure that those who are still prepared to engage in acts of violence against this State will not be tolerated under any circumstances, that they will be brought to justice at the earliest opportunity, that they will be convicted by the courts and given due sanction by a court of law.  If that sanction is a term of imprisonment, it should be served in its entirety without reference or ambiguity on the part of any Minister as to the length of sentence persons might from time to time serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> It is important we specifically refer to the question of prison sentences in this harsh legislation, which is designed to be so and to ensure we send a strong message from this House that no form of appeasement will be tolerated.  We already agreed in legislation that prisoners affiliated to organisations which have not established a ceasefire will not benefit from the arrangements under the Agreement.  I understand that situation will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>In circumstances where acts of terrorism were committed after 22 May, it is important that no benefit under the Agreement or otherwise is forthcoming to these persons.  It is not overstating the fact that this should be enshrined in the legislation. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment and assure the public that there is no ambiguity and that persons sentenced by a court for offences under this legislation will serve their sentences as set out by the courts, which will not be subject to any variation on the Minister's part at any stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment &mdash; let us not be in any way coy about it &mdash; is to put on a statutory basis what the Government has already said is the case, that is, that there is an agreement that people who may have committed offences before or since the Agreement but who have not been convicted will not benefit from the prisoner release programme, as agreed under the British-Irish Agreement.  The Minister and the Taoiseach have said that on the record.  The reason they are on record is that, as everybody knows, strong concern was expressed that people now accused of the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe might under the British-Irish Agreement have been released almost before being convicted and sentenced.  The Government said there was absolute certainty that would not be the case.  I have not seen this in any legislation and it is not part of the British-Irish Agreement. It appears to be an understanding or a side deal agreed behind closed doors in Belfast when the Agreement was being reached.  The purpose of Fine Gael's amendment is to make it explicit as opposed to something which is implicitly said.</P>
      <P>Those who claim to be members of organisations which committed offences before or since 22 May but have not been convicted cannot be party to the releases.  If we do not put this into legislation there is a risk that some months or years from now pressure will be put on a Minister for Justice &mdash; perhaps it will be somebody from this side of the House &mdash; to release these people. We want to ensure that the people who will be convicted of the killing of Detective Gerry McCabe will not be released under this Agreement. It is already causing great anguish to the families of policemen killed by members of terrorist organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The punishment for a capital offence was changed to 40 years imprisonment but nobody in this House envisaged at that time that the killers of policemen would be released early.  That will <Col N="177" /> happen now and it will cause great pain and anguish to the families.  Those of us who want to see this Agreement work have had to accept that there are elements of it that will not gain overall support.</P>
    <P>It would not have been easy for the Minister to agree to this because I am sure he was lobbied heavily by the Garda Síochána.  Gardaí put their lives on the line every day to protect us and it is understandable that they feel their work is not valued as it was before the Agreement.</P>
    <P>In this amendment, which I hope the Minister will accept, we want to ensure that people who are not yet convicted of offences committed before 22 May will not slip under the parapet of the Agreement.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: May I ask the Minister the steps that have been taken to establish whether any of those in custody under the existing offences against the State legislation have defected to the Real IRA?  Disaffected members of the INLA on the outside have defected to the Real IRA as have members of the Provisional IRA.  Can the Minister give a categorical assurance that everything possible will be done before any further releases to ensure such defections do not take place?</P>

      <P>These acts of terrorism are not acts of war.  People talk about the war being over but these acts could not reasonably be termed as acts of war.  If it were a war, however, what happened in Omagh would be a war crime.  It was certainly a crime against humanity.</P>
      <P>The general thrust of this legislation has to be supported.  I have certain reservations about it which I referred to earlier on Second Stage but I ask the Minister, when he has an opportunity, to consider the possibility of introducing in our law an offence which is a crime against humanity.  If it were not possible to bring the people guilty of the bombing in Omagh before the Irish courts they should be brought before an international crimes tribunal.  Thankfully, it is possible to bring them before the courts here but when that happens there should be an offence which is a crime against humanity.  The crime in Omagh and similar crimes of the past 25 years should be designated crimes against humanity.  Where there are crimes against humanity, there should be no question of early release of prisoners.  I urge the Minister to consider in future legislation the issue of crimes against humanity, which is what Omagh was.  Early release should not apply to people who committed crimes which fall into that category.</P>

      <P>People convicted of offences after the date mentioned in the amendment will not benefit from the special early release arrangements. The amendment as set out is too broad in scope.  It would preclude the temporary release of a very ill person and there could be situations where that would be the humane thing to do.  The <Col N="178" /> offences are also broader than terrorist ones.  I accept the point about sending a strong message but I cannot accept an amendment which is as sweeping in its terms as this.  It would preclude the legitimate exercise of the release powers by the Minister and that would be detrimental. However, where acts are committed after the date mentioned, the early release provisions will not apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister began his reply in a manner which gave me a sense that he understood the import of the amendment by saying that those convicted after the date mentioned would not benefit from early release.  However, he finished by saying that those who had committed offences or acts after the date would not benefit.  We want an assurance that acts committed before 22 May for which no one has yet been convicted will not be included in the early release scheme.  The case I have in mind, the Jerry McCabe murder, is one of those.  I emphasise this matter because it is not written anywhere in the legislation that the Minister does not have the power under the Agreement to release people if they committed an act before 22 May for which they were not convicted at the time of the Agreement.  As it is not written anywhere, we have only the words spoken in the House to convince people who have lost loved ones in this manner that their killers will not benefit from early release.</P>

The Agreement makes clear that prisoners affiliated to organisations which have not established or do not maintain a complete and unequivocal ceasefire will not benefit from the early release arrangements.  The Agreement indicates that the situation will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Where a person is arrested for the purpose of detention pursuant to section 30 of the Act of 1939, on suspicion of having committed an offence under section 21 of that Act, he or she shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, be removed to, and detained in, a Garda Síochána station to which the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 74 of 1997) apply.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had an opportunity to refer to the basic contents of this amendment on Committee Stage.  It proposes that as far as is practicable people in custody should be video taped during questioning. These facilities are available and should be used in the case of the Real IRA and its associates which comprise a relatively small number of people.  The basis for this amendment is the manner in which prisoners and suspects are treated while in custody.  There is also the risk of false or malicious accusations being levelled against the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>This matter has been under consideration for more than 15 years.  The Martin committee concluded in 1990 that this system should be utilised. That recommendation was based on studies of similar systems in the US, Australia and elsewhere. It provides valuable safeguards for the suspect in prison and those questioning such suspects and allows matters of fact to be determined objectively.</P>
      <P>The technology is available.  Even if it is not possible to equip every Garda station in a short period it is possible to equip a small number of stations at which suspects would be questioned. It should be possible to manage this matter in such a way that when questioned, suspects are brought to stations where these facilities exist. That would mean taking them to one of the four stations which have this technology or the extra station at which it is planned to install the system. It may be necessary to install the system at other stations.  Only a small number of stations would need to be equipped with these facilities in a short space of time.  The technology is readily available and I hope the Minister will accede to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Upton's approach to this matter.  I will speak to my amendment which is more modest but Deputy Upton's proposal is preferable if feasible.  The Minister should give a commitment on the issue of video recording and tape recording the interviewing of suspects.  There is an anomaly in having a police force which often operates out of stations which are not fully equipped, up to date <Col N="180" /> or suitable for the 21st century or which do not keep up with general changes in society.  There are a large number of camcorders and video recorders in the general population, yet we have very limited provision for the use of such technology within the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>It is not helpful to law and order for a police force to be out of date in terms of technology and other aspects of policing.  Technology is an important aid and is common in other areas of life.  It should be common within policing for two reasons.  It can protect the innocent in relation to this proposed amendment and the Garda from wrongful accusation. That is a feature we have to take on board as well as ensuring the innocent are protected. Those enforcing the law have a right to certain protections.  The Minister will have to go further than simply say this is a lovely idea.  It needs to be provided in the context of this legislation because of its significance and the impact it will have not only on the few who are the perpetrators of serious violence but those others who may be brought in for questioning and may subsequently be released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that all over the city there are video cameras and closed circuit television which are used effectively by the Garda to uphold the law and catch criminals.  There is no reason we cannot use the same technology to protect those who are taken into Garda custody and to protect the Garda from wrongful accusation.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the uptake of the video taping and recording option is low.  Will the Minister confirm that only 8 per cent of people take up the offer.  Why is this the case?  We need to get to the bottom of it.  There is anecdotal evidence that in some cases the Garda may use video surveillance of people while in custody as a plea bargaining that in the event of such use the charges will be even greater.  We need to find out why only 8 per cent of people use it.  If it were mandatory it would get over these problems.  Since we are entering the 21st century, it is absolutely vital in upholding the law that we also have effective monitoring in upholding civil liberties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with this amendment.  Deputy Gormley's amendment is badly worded because it is very specific.  It states that any interviews conducted will be recorded on audio and video tape.  If that were accepted many cases would be thrown out if they were not conducted in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Upton's amendment is more reasonably worded.  I am surprised the Minister has not included this amendment given his own words on the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1998, that the video taping of interviews by the Garda can be introduced if it is deemed that certain safeguards are required to ensure innocent people will not be victimised as a result of an inference being drawn by way of corroboratory evidence from an individual's silence.  That was in the days <Col N="181" /> when the Minister was in Opposition.  I am surprised he has not included this provision in the legislation although I realise there is a difficulty.</P>
    <P>Video taping and recording was introduced on the basis of ensuring nobody was victimised, that it would not be obligatory or mandatory and that was the way people wanted it.  It was introduced as a civil libertarian reason.  After a number of years of testing it was found that a small percentage of people willingly chose to have the interview conducted on tape.  I would have thought everybody would have used that option to ensure nobody did anything untoward to them, but for some reason people who were being questioned did not want to be videoed.  While Minister, I amended the legislation to allow for cameras to be turned on automatically, unless the person did not choose that option.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us what percentage of people have opted to exercise their right not to use the cameras.  The idea was that the gardaí would say when the video recording machine was being turned on and that it would only be turned off if the person asked that that be done.  This would ensure the procedure was not used in any untoward manner in the court either against the person or the gardaí.  I do not understand why the Minister cannot find a way to do what is being suggested.</P>
    <P>There were only four stations which were properly equipped with the necessary technology when I left the Department.  The risk is that people might have to be driven all over the country if they are arrested in a place which is 150 miles from the nearest station with recording equipment.  I would not like half the time in detention being used to drive people around.  I wonder what the Minister's response to this matter will be.  Is it practicable for gardaí to be told that as far as possible they should bring people to the stations with the necessary equipment?  I hope the Minister will be able to inform us that he has sought additional resources to put more of this equipment into a much wider range of stations throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I support amendments Nos. 3, 6 and 9.  However, video taping is not the be all and end all and its use would not make everything else in the Bill okay.  It would not counter some of the extremely repressive and unfair provisions by which innocent people can be put at a serious disadvantage if charged under the legislation.  Section 5, for example, allows inferences to be drawn in the case of a person mentioning something in their defence in court which they were unable to state when questioned by gardaí.  The provision of video recording would not assist them in overcoming the disadvantage they are put at under that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding demeanour, those who are innocent are far more likely to look uncomfortable than hardened criminals in video recordings shown in court.  Those who are innocent and who are not members of illegal or paramilitary organisations, etc., are those most likely to be disorientated, <Col N="182" /> confused and perhaps seemingly evasive because of their state of mind, the unfamiliar situations, the questioning about serious issues, etc.  Video taping might work against them in a sense.</P>
    <P>While such provision can be seen as a safeguard in some senses, I wish to make it clear that the inclusion of such provision would not cleanse the Bill of the serious attacks on civil liberties implied in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that these amendments be supported.  The manner in which evidence is presented in court is the basic issue in the context of video and audio recording, regardless of wording &mdash; Deputy Upton's wording would be very acceptable if acceptable to the Minister.  As things stand we are inclined to get the Garda presentation which is given by a trained presenter.  I feel it would be the lesser of two evils to make it mandatory for cases brought under this legislation, because it is so wide-ranging, to be video taped and for those being interviewed to have their solicitor present &mdash; another important aspect of these amendments.  That is the nub of the legislation.  I urge the Minister, as I did earlier on Second Stage, at least to ensure the availability of video taping technology &mdash; technology which should have been there a long time ago &mdash; and to consider the mandatory requirement of video taping so that people would not be bounced into making confessions when the public mood is so outraged that such a thing might be possible.</P>

      <P>The Bridewell Garda stations in Dublin and Cork and also in the Garda stations in Tallaght and Portlaoise.  These trials are being overseen by a steering committee under the chairmanship of the President of the Circuit Court, Judge Esmond Smyth.  His task is to assess them and report to the Minister on a national scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until February of last year the pilot trials had been in operation in these stations on a non-statutory basis.  Deputy Gormley is correct &mdash; on average only 8 per cent of suspects agree to have their interviews recorded.  It is fair to say that the low take up rate by detained persons of the option of electronic recording caused serious difficulties in progressing the pilot scheme; if one does not have the data it is impossible to assess the scheme.  The steering committee did advise that it would be unable to reach a definitive conclusion on the effects of electronic recording on the basis of such a low percentage take up.  Accordingly it recommended that arrangements be made under section 27 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, to <Col N="183" /> make it mandatory that interviews in the pilot trial stations be recorded, subject to the gardaí having the discretion to discontinue electronic recording where a suspect objected.</P>
    <P>Arising from this recommendation, the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, issued the Electronic Recording of Interviews Regulations 1997 on 11 February 1997.  These regulations provide for the electronic recording of interviews of suspects in the four Garda stations which I mentioned. With these regulations in place, the committee expects that the pilot scheme will begin to produce data upon which a proper evaluation can be based.  The services of a research consultant have been engaged for the purposes of carrying out the necessary statistical analysis of the data emanating from each of the pilot scheme stations.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that as much progress as possible is made in this matter as quickly as possible.  I will take whatever steps are open to me to achieve that.  It is my intention to discuss this matter with Mr. Justice Smyth in the near future because I want to talk to him about measures which would facilitate the committee's work.  I will bring to his attention what has been said in this debate.</P>
    <P>I can tell Deputy Owen that a further two Garda stations &mdash; Henry Street, Limerick and Mill Street, Galway &mdash; will be added to the pilot scheme and the necessary installation work is being undertaken.  However, it would not be possible to put in place a workable nationwide scheme for some time.  The measures in this Bill are clearly required right now.  In that context, it is worth noting it was decided it would be appropriate to proceed with much longer periods of detention under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act without a nationwide scheme being in place.  We would also have to proceed on this basis in regard to the detention provisions of the Bill currently before the House.</P>
    <P>A seven day detention period is provided for in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, but the Garda authorities advised me they did not require seven days detention under this legislation and that the time set out would be adequate for their purposes.  Distinctions must be drawn between an offence of drug trafficking on the one hand and an offence to which this legislation relates.  There is the question of ingestion where drugs are concerned and the question of evidence coming from abroad from agencies such as Europol or Interpol.  Neither of those situations would arise in relation to detention pursuant to this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I must take the advice of the Garda authorities.  It would be foolish to do otherwise.  The approach outlined in the Labour Party amendment requires a person detained under section 30 to be detained, as far as practicable, in a Garda station where electronic <Col N="184" /> recording is available.  This is mirrored to some extent in the amendment tabled by Democratic Left although it only applies where a further period of detention has been granted by the court and it purports to impose an absolute obligation that a person be detained in a Garda station equipped for recording.  Given the reality I have outlined, I do not believe these approaches are workable.  The concept of &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; could lead to endless litigation and the amendments would have the unintended consequence of substantially increasing the amount of time a person is held in Garda custody as the time of detention for the purposes of section 30 only counts from the time the person reaches the station.  The provisions could not be brought into operation quickly if these amendments were accepted and accordingly, I cannot support them. My argument does not emanate from any philosophical base or from a point of principle, rather it is a question of logistics.</P>

      <P>I welcome the general attitude adopted by the Minister in that he seems to be favourably disposed towards the amendments but cannot accept them because of practical considerations. What does this kind of equipment cost or what is involved in installing it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>How long would the installation of such equipment take and would it, as Deputy Owen has suggested, require the construction of a special room?  Will the Minister reconsider the amendment or some modification of it?  The provision of &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; was specifically included to cater for awkward situations which could arise where such provisions would not be feasible.  I understand the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda are in favour of such measures.  Will the Minister reconsider the amendment and give us some indication as to when it might be feasible to put such a process in train?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I cannot give Deputy Upton a definitive answer in relation to the questions he has raised.  I will arrange for the cost to be communicated to him.  Presumably it will be related to the size of the station and the kind of equipment to be purchased.  I will give the Deputy a general idea of the current position and when it is hoped to have a sufficiency of data which will enable us to progress the matter further.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 27, to delete &ldquo;, activities or associations&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or activities&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment calls for the deletion of the word &ldquo;associations&rdquo; as defined as an aspect of conduct. <Col N="185" /> It applies most acutely to the new provisions contained in section 3 of the Act concerning notification of witnesses.  Taking sections 3 and 4 of the Act together literally provides for an offence of guilt by association.  One could be on a committee or a voluntary body with someone who is arrested and charged under this legislation.  In that scenario the application of sections 3 and 4 together leaves a person open to a charge of guilt by association.  That is an unacceptable basis upon which to build a legislative provision, no matter what its intention.  This is a Kafkaesque scenario where a person can be found guilty by association, something which this House should find unacceptable.</P>

      <P>It was regrettable that we did not have an opportunity to tease out this matter at Committee Stage.

      <P>Section 3(1) of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act provides that any conduct by an accused person implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a particular time a member of an unlawful organisation shall in proceedings under section 21 of the Act of 1939 be evidence that he was then such a member.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of this Bill defines conduct as including movements, actions, activities or associations on the part of the accused person.  The purpose of the amendment is to exclude the reference to associations.  In as much as what the Bill proposes reminds people of the phrase &ldquo;guilty by association&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>People might find it instinctively unpalatable but we have to deal with the reality of membership of an unlawful organisation or organisations.  That reality encompasses the fact that the associations of a person can be relevant to the question of membership of such an organisation.  In those circumstances it would be unwise to delete the word &ldquo;associations&rdquo;.  This provision is included in the Bill for the avoidance of any doubt because a strong case can be made that conduct, as it already stands in the 1972 Act, would already include the concept of associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the thinking behind the amendment. However, it is important to emphasise that the associations the court can take into account are only those implying or leading to a reasonable inference that a person is a member of an unlawful organisation.  There is no question of a court <Col N="186" /> being in a position to say that because an individual associated with a number of people, he or she is a member of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>Whether it is a question of an individual's associations or movements or his or her actions or activities, the law will be that the court may draw an inference from that fact.  The court may also decide it will not draw an inference from that fact.  It will only decide to draw an inference from the fact concerned if it deems it to be proper to do so.  That could not, of itself, convict an individual because it is an inference which would go on from there to constitute corroborative evidence. This is an important point.</P>
    <P>It is also important to point out yet again that the court must be satisfied of an individual's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The changes which this legislation makes to the Offences Against the State Acts, when one excludes the creation of the new offences, are for the most part evidential.  It is important that people do not get carried away with the notion that because one associates with people who are members of an illegal organisation it automatically means one would be found guilty of being a member of an illegal organisation. That is not the position.  I do not believe the fears expressed about the Bill's proposals are justified.  I cannot support the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has rewritten section 3(b) of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, and reiterated the part dealing with the omission by an accused person to deny published reports that he or she is a member of an unlawful organisation.  Does the Minister have any evidence of how often section 3 (b) of the Act was used in our courts?  If it was not used, why is it being reiterated, as if it was a new section?  That section has existed since 1972 and I have no recollection of anyone being accused of not denying a report in a newspaper.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Gormley, I cannot comment on what is happening in the British courts in relation to any person who is charged, no more than I can comment on what the position would be in the British jurisdiction with regard to hypotheses.</P>
