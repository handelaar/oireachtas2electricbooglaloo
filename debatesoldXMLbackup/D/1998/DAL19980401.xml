      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware of the reports of a serious public health outbreak in regard to the safety of certain foods in a shopping outlet in Dundrum.  Is he aware that on 12 November he promised the food safety authority legislation would be brought before the House before the end of that month and that at the beginning of January he said the legislation would be available either in February or this month? What is the position in regard to this legislation? Why was the promise to introduce the legislation by last November not fulfilled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a delay in drafting the Bill.  The final draft is before an interdepartmental committee which will meet tomorrow. It is intended to circulate the Bill to the relevant Departments to try to clear it for next week.  I hope the Bill will be before the Cabinet during the Easter recess and introduced in the House during the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that a large proportion of the work involved in preparing the Bill was completed by the previous Government?  What is the reason for this interdepartmental jockeying which is delaying the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government took office it stated it would seek to ensure that the Bill gave the authority the fullest statutory powers possible.  We want to bring as many of the food safety regulations as possible under one roof so that we have a strong Bill which can deal with issues such as the one to which the Deputy referred.  It is important that the authority can fulfil its functions.  Work was carried out on 60 sections of the draft Bill some time ago.  The Bill is now stronger and I hope it will be introduced in the House after the Easter recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it proposed to introduce the television coverage of major sporting events Bill which will give effect to an EU directive and will ensure that major national sporting events are transmitted free of charge on the national air-waves? Next Saturday, for the first time since television was broadcast, the Ireland-England match will not be televised live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="651" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The television coverage of major sporting events Bill will be ready later in the year.  It will transpose into Irish law Article 3A of the EU directive which is designed to ensure the coverage of major sporting events free of charge to the national television station.  The Bill will also implement other parts of the directive. The latest information available to me is that the legislation will not be ready until after the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Can he confirm to the House that following the enactment of that legislation, Ireland <i>v.</i> England matches, or any other sporting events deemed to be of national importance, will be broadcast free of charge?  Will that be the effect of the domestic legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different categories under the directive.  As I understand it &mdash; this is from my own sporting knowledge rather than the legislation &mdash; rugby is not on the A list in terms of English law, which is extraordinary.  That is the reason Sky could get access in terms of this match.  We must ensure in our legislation that our treasured sporting events are on our A list.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the latest revelations concerning NIB and the contemptuous manner in which it treated the Central Bank, will the Taoiseach indicate whether the legislation promised to improve the monitoring procedures of the Central Bank in relation to the private banks will be worked on over Easter and if it will be introduced here immediately after the Easter break?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated yesterday, the Minister for Finance, in his letters of yesterday and the day before, has asked the Departments and agencies involved to nominate people immediately so that an early meeting can take place. They should get to work over the Easter period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach about two matters.  First, on promised legislation which may have a bearing on the debate on Articles 2 and 3, the Coastal Zone Management Bill, will the Taoiseach bring that legislation before the House immediately given the higher than ever levels of erosion around our coast?  One might call it the erosion of our national territory. Second, will a supplementary Estimate be moved <Col N="652" /> to meet the additional cost of placing a Luas light rail system underground given the European Commission's commitment not to provide funding for such an option?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Coastal Zone Management Bill, a consultation process will take place this week between the three Government Departments involved in this issue.  This is a serious problem in numerous parts of the country.  It will be some time before we see legislation.  On the other matter, the Minister will have the report at the end of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Government's inquiries into the National Irish Bank, will the Taoiseach also order an inquiry into the An Grianán farm déba cle in which the NIB and Mr. Tom Graham were involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not appropriate to the Order of Business, Deputy.  It can be raised in many other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very appropriate to Mr. Tom Graham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has failed to honour a solemn undertaking it gave to the United Nations Committee on Children to have a debate in this House on the rights of children. I ask the Taoiseach to give an undertaking that he will hold this debate early in the new session. He has already stated it is up to the Whips to determine this but the Taoiseach has an obligation, having made this undertaking through one of his Ministers to the United Nations, to have an early debate on the rights of children.  This is an extremely urgent matter relating to many thousands of children in this country whose rights are not being adequately protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important matter and I have given an undertaking to have a debate in the House.  The debate should be scheduled early in the new session but it is a matter for the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the creation of up to 10,000 jobs in the western region, will the Taoiseach state the reason for the delay in regard to the Western Development Commission Bill to establish the commission on a statutory basis?  Will he also comment on the western investment fund, which is overdue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation regarding the commission is in the final stage of preparation. The legislation in regard to the investment fund will be available in the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, may I ask the Taoiseach for clarification on the children (juvenile justice) Bill which had reached Second Stage and lapsed with the fall of the last Dáil? When questioned about this matter over the past <Col N="653" /> six or seven months, the Taoiseach said that the Government would substantially amend the Bill. The Bill was recently republished in its original form so I now ask the Taoiseach to outline the Government's intention in relation to the Bill. When can we expect it before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill had to be restored in its original form and that has been done.  I understand it is back on the Order Paper.  The Bill will come before the committee and any amendments will be put forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>When will that happen?  We have been waiting for this Bill for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That will happen shortly.  The Bill has been restored to its original form but I understand it is ready to be taken.  If that is not the case I will inform the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>An appropriate answer for the day that is in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is ready to be taken by the committee but it is a matter for the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>So it will be taken early in the next session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the daily Orders of Business and the documents laid before the Dáil, will the Taoiseach explain why the report of l996 which the Department of Health and Children received in the summer of l997 from the Adoption Board detailing not merely statistics on adoption but a critique of the way adoption law is working has not been laid before the House? Is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister for Health and Children is in violation of his obligations under the l952 Adoption Act in this regard?  Will the Taoiseach tell us when that report will be published and laid before the House and why it is being suppressed by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Par for the course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The report is not a matter of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a document that, under Statute, should be laid before the House and traditionally it is laid before the House just before or immediately after the summer recess.  This report relates to l996.  The l997 report has since gone to Government but has not been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy could pursue the matter by way of parliamentary question or a question on the Adjournment.  It is not a matter for the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other ways of raising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised it by way of Dáil question to the Minister of State with responsibility for children who seems to be of the view that the report will be produced whenever it suits the Government.</P>

      <P>In respect of promised legislation on a national minimum wage, will the Taoiseach state if the Government has taken the report from the commission as it was intended to do before the end of last month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to promised legislation and the information concerning the numbers of travellers who live beyond the age of 65, a housing Bill was promised by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal.  When is it intended to take Second Stage of that Bill and will the Taoiseach use the occasion to make a major statement on the needs of the travelling community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Travellers Accommodation Bill, which was published yesterday, will be taken first in the Seanad and the policy will be outlined at that stage.  The Bill will be a major improvement in dealing with the defects in the current housing system to which the Deputy refers.  The Minister is anxious to move the Bill quickly along after Easter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was largely drafted by the late Deputy Hugh Coveney, and substantial work was done under his stewardship.  It does not require much consultation with other Departments. What is the reason for the delay?  Has it been downgraded in terms of priority within the Department of Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While work is going on, an enormous amount of consolidation is needed to <Col N="655" /> prepare this Act.  That work is not completed but it is ongoing.  If there is any other aspect, I will inform the Deputy of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach about legislation that he regarded as a priority, the school attendance Bill.  Why has it slipped back by six months in the schedule since November when it was indicated that it would be published before Easter?  We are now told it will be autumn before we see it.  Is the Taoiseach aware that no record is currently held in the Department of suspended or expelled students?  If we are to be serious about this, we need to regard it as a priority.  Will the Taoiseach go back to his own position of September-October and put this on the priority list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated previously, it is a matter of priority.  We want this legislation dealt with.

This was extensively covered during Question Time last week.</P>

        <b>Mr. Higgins</b> (Mayo):</i> Given that the Eastern Health Board recently confirmed that approximately 130 people a week are seeking asylum in this country and that there is a major accommodation problem in Dublin, given the Government's refusal to accept the Democratic Left Private Member's Bill on asylum seekers, and our flagrant breach of international obligations on human rights, what is the current situation in relation to dealing with refugees?

        <i>(Mayo):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) establish and oversee a research and statistical unit&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to establish and oversee a research and statistical unit.  One of the difficulties that has dogged the criminal justice system for a considerable time, and this was acknowledged by the Minister when he was in Opposition, is the lack of hard information, of statistical data, of a clear body of facts for establishing the different elements in the criminal justice system.  At a time when we are talking about updating and modernising the criminal justice system, when we are promising radical new proposals on all aspects of it, it is essential to establish, in all the different instruments of the criminal justice system, within the Garda Siochána, a mechanism for accurate up-to-date data in relation to offences and happenings within their remit.  In the prison service we should have a modern system of establishing key and crucial <Col N="658" /> statistics on the performance of the service.  Also, in determining what is happening within the courts service, we should have an up-to-date research unit which will provide information to the courts and to the Minister on the performance of the courts.  Time and again a parliamentary question is tabled to establish some information in relation to an aspect of the courts and the Deputy is told it is impossible to answer given the amount of resources it would take up.</P>
    <P>I will give some examples.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was asked &ldquo;.  . the number of persons convicted in each of the past five years under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, who had more than £10,000 in their possession. .&rdquo; The reply reads:</P>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 156, 157 and 158 which came before the Dáil on 11 December 1997.  The position remains that court statistics are not compiled in such a way as to provide the information sought by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Information was sought here regarding the contentious arbitrary fine and sentence for somebody caught in possession of drugs.  The Criminal Justice Bill proposes that anybody caught in possession of an arbitrary amount of drugs &mdash; worth £10,000 &mdash; can get up to ten years in prison.  I query the relevance of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Fundamental information that could defend the Minister's position, with which we do not agree, or which could provide information to support the Opposition view, is not provided.  Even if there was no argument on this point, it should be possible to provide an up-to-date record of the last five years.</P>
      <P>If information is not available for 1996, what about 1992 to 1995?  The Minister is not able to give us one statistic on the number of people who, under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, had more than £10,000 of illegal drugs in their possession. However, people who possess far more than £10,000 worth of drugs are regularly tried in the courts under this legislation.  The Minister says there is no mechanism within his Department to give us this information.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was asked &ldquo;.  .if he will establish a system to manage statistics related to the work of the Department to ensure efficient work practices .&rdquo; The Minister's reply refers to Coopers and Lybrand being commissioned to do an information technology review and goes on to state while some statistics in relation to the courts are currently compiled and collated in my Department, the working group and the Courts Commission have highlighted an absence of adequate statistics in the court system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is telling us that the sheer paucity of information in relation to adequate statistics <Col N="659" /> has been highlighted.  A Member from his party tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister on 26 March about &ldquo;.the person with the responsibility to check and police the hackney drivers operating in the greater Dublin area; if it is the function of the Carriage Office in each individual Garda station.&rdquo; The Minister replied about the courts and went on to say, &ldquo;. the statistics are not readily available and could only be compiled by expenditure of a disproportionate amount of time.&rdquo; The Minister was asked a fundamental question by Deputy Upton, which sought information about the rate of recidivism among persons under 18 years, and who were convicted of criminal offences, for each of the past five years for which records are available. The reply stated that records are not maintained in a way that would allow the provision of the information sought by the Deputy, but that the Deputy might be interested to know that an expert study by Mr. Paul O'Mahony, <i>Mountjoy Prisoners: A Sociological and Criminological Profile</i>, was published by the Department in June 1997.  The Department commissioned Mr. Mahony to produce this excellent document, which showed approximately 77 per cent recidivism.</P>
    <P>A fundamental part of discussing juvenile crime is the number of people under 18 years who are convicted of criminal offences.  However, the Minister's reply states that records are not maintained in a way that would allow provision of such information.  Another question seeks the number of officers from the probation and welfare service working with persons under 18 who have been convicted of criminal offences for each of the last five years for which data is available.  Again, the exact numbers are not available.  The Minister was asked the number of persons under 18 years convicted of criminal offences for each of the past five years for which figures are available, which is a further question to the one I cited earlier. Again, the reply states that the extraction of the information would require the use of an inordinate amount of staff resources which could not be justified.</P>
    <P>We could go on.  This Bill is welcomed by all Members.  It sets up a new and efficient courts service.  As this service is being set up to introduce the administrative procedures the courts have yearned for, it is surely now time to insert the requirement for a statistical and research unit in the Department.  It need not cost the earth, and I asked the Minister on Committee Stage to indicate the approximate cost.  It need not be done now, but let us bring it in.  Every other country has this facility.  A huge amount is spent on such research in Britain every year, and the number of cases going through the courts here is small in comparison.  In addition, there must be a natural necessity for a research and statistical unit so that there is research on what is happening in the courts and hard information on statistics which is now lacking.</P>
    <Col N="660" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments.  In business, progress can be determined to some extent by an organisation's investment in research and development, which underpins progress. Those economies which have done well, such as Japan, Germany and America, invest in research.  We do not invest to the extent that we should.  If one looks at the Department of Justice as a company, it has a huge turnover but its expenditure on research this year, for the first time, seems to be approximately £250,000.  This seems a crazy way to do business.</P>
      <P>It is even crazier that the Department does not collect data.  I am lost as to how one can make progress without understanding what is effective and what is not.  We appear to be thrashing incoherently in the dark.  It is a pity the Minister does not give us an estimate as to the cost of a properly equipped statistics unit.  Given the normal practices and expenses of these matters, it cannot cost an inordinate amount of money.  If it cannot be based in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, perhaps the Central Statistics Office could provide the necessary expertise.  To learn from one's mistakes one must know what is happening.  The only way to do that is to collect the information in a way in which it can be accessed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins spoke at length about parliamentary questions that have not been answered. Most of those questions are reasonable; they seek simple information that the Minister and the Opposition should have.  In that way policy positions can be formulated.  Justice policy in Ireland is made up as we go along in relation to the ebbs and flows of public opinion, and nobody was better or more dextrous in sniffing out the public mood than the Minister.  He did a magnificent political job for his party on the crime issue. However, as I am sure he has discovered, what one does in Opposition meets one fairly sharply when one enters Government.  If we are to make real progress in dealing with crime we must know what will work and what will not.  It is regrettable, therefore, that information is not available.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins referred to a series of parliamentary questions for which answers were not available.  It is outrageous that they cannot be answered.  What constitutes &ldquo;an inordinate amount of staff time&rdquo;, a term which informs many of those replies?  Does it constitute one minute, one hour, one day or one year and how many people would be involved?  While a typical question costs approximately £80 to answer, the cost can vary.</P>
      <P>We do not have information on the extent of truancy, yet juvenile crime is a major problem. Those at high risk of engaging in crime are easily identified, but we do not have information on when they opt out of the school system.  We do not know how many are prosecuted or the level of intervention in this regard.  How can we be expected to make progress if such information is not available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a considerable degree of variation in <Col N="661" /> sentencing policy.  I am not proposing that judges should impose a similar level of sentence for all crimes, but we need to know the level of geographical variation and the pattern of characteristics of those being sentenced if we are to solve the crime problem.  We must know what is happening before reviewing the effects.  There appears to be no answer to the question about the £10,000 drug seizures, yet at the Minister's initiative a body of law is proceeding based on this concept.  We do not know the extent of the problem, but we are proposing a major initiative to deal with it.  We do not know the number of reoffenders under 18 years.  While Paul O'Mahoney's study in that regard is very welcome, we need more information.  In the process of modernising the courts system, I hope the Minister accepts these amendments which seek to establish a statistics and research unit in his Department.</P>
    <P>What is happening in the Minister's Department reminds me of what used to happen in the Department of Agriculture 30 years ago, when people bleated on incoherently at one another about the values of all sort of farming practices. Subsequently the country invested in worthwhile research to understand the effects of various treatment and how it would modulate the outcome. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is back in the dark dismal days of incoherence.  If we are to make progress, it is essential that we collect data and know what will work.  That would put an end to the nonsense we all have to listen to from time to time.  I note the Minister is laughing.  None of us can escape that nonsense and he could make a great contribution to minimising it by providing proper data.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments.  I am sure all Members accept this transforming and innovative Bill will have a lasting impact on modernising our courts system.  However, it will not be complete unless due regard is given to gathering statistics and ensuring the procedures and facilities are in place to collect the knowledge that is developed every day through the courts system. That information is not available in a coherent manner to policy makers or to those who administer the various agencies under the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Not long ago we had the most extraordinary spectacle of a judge making a decision in court which he did not have authority to do.  Nobody in the court knew he did not have that authority. The officials of the Department did not even know he was not a nominated judge.  That is the type of vacuum that exists in regard to proper and adequate procedures for getting information, which would be useful to the Minister, his Department and, more importantly, to the courts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was a Minister I was rather shocked at the retarded nature of information technology in a number of Departments.  While I am not an <Col N="662" /> expert on information technology &mdash; I merely know how to plug in a computer &mdash; I can identify a problem when it exists.  We can acquire the technology to garner the evidence from experience if we start early enough.  The Minister will probably say this is part and parcel of the functions described in the Bill, but that is not true. The Bill does not make it a key function of the Courts Service.  The Minister is laying down problems for the future.  It would be regrettable if, in the future, people realise that, even though it would have saved money in the long term, the Minister was not willing to accept a modest proposal that would have ensured his Department and the Courts Service would have been better equipped to meet the demands of the next century. Surely the Minister must accept his obligation to live up to that duty and accept this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments were discussed in great detail on Committee Stage.  On that occasion I sympathised with the views expressed by Deputy Higgins about the difficulty in accessing statistics on court business.  I recalled that, as Opposition spokesperson on Justice, I found it extremely frustrating that legitimately sought replies could not be given for logistical reasons.  Court statistics are, by and large, still manually collated and this limits the level and detail of their compilation.  I also stated that, on foot of a major IT scoping study commissioned by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I provided an additional £2.5 million for expenditure on information technology for the courts in 1998.  A key element of this IT expenditure will be the development of comprehensive systems for collating and interpreting statistical data from the courts.  This clearly indicates our appreciation of the need for improved statistical information systems in the area of the courts and to honour commitments made in this area.</P>
      <P>Section 5 sets out the proposed functions of the Courts Service, the first of which is to manage the courts.  Deputy Upton's amendment would include in those functions the establishment and management of a statistics unit to compile and publish statistical data and research on court proceedings. Deputy Jim Higgins's amendment, which is similar, would include the function of establishing and overseeing a research and statistical unit.  These amendments clearly reflect an appreciation of the importance of maintaining comprehensive and up-to-date statistics, something I share.  I am convinced, however, that the amendments are unnecessary and would not improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not purport, nor should it, to prescribe in detail how the Courts Service should be managed as it would defeat the purpose of establishing the service.  If the Bill provides for the establishment of a research and statistical unit, should it not also provide for the establishment of a finance unit, a technology unit or a personnel <Col N="663" /> unit?  I believe that the provision of statistical information is comprehended by the functions of managing the courts and of providing information on the courts system to the public, something already provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 8 requires the Courts Service to submit an annual report to the Minister which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These reports &ldquo;shall include information on the performance of the functions of the Service during the year to which [they relate] and such other information in such form as the Service thinks fit or the Minister may direct&rdquo;.  Such reports would include relevant statistical information.  The Bill does not set out a comprehensive list of headings under which the reports are to be compiled and I am satisfied this is the correct approach.  I am certain that including one specific heading as proposed in amendment No. 5, in this case relating to judicial statistics, would distort the balance of the section.  A wide range of information would be expected to be included in the annual report of a State body, but I do not believe it desirable in a Bill like this that it is specified in any great detail what it should be.  In those circumstances, the inclusion of the requirement relating to one specific issue, as the amendment proposes, would raise questions as to why a range of other headings are not included.  The general approach adopted in the Bill &mdash; the correct one &mdash; is to provide the broad framework within which the Courts Service is to operate rather the adoption of a very prescriptive approach.  The Bill gives the Minister a significant role in that he or she may direct certain information to be included in the annual report.  The working group on a courts commission advised that a statistical unit should be established by the Courts Service.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the development of a unit for statistical and research purposes will be very prominent on the agenda of the service.  There is no difference of purpose between myself and the Deputies who tabled these amendments and Deputy McManus, and I hope they will accept my assurances in this regard.  For the reasons I have given, the amendments are neither necessary nor appropriate.</P>
    <P>If Deputies believe the Courts Service cannot be trusted to maintain proper statistics as part of its management function, fundamental questions regarding the operation of the service are raised.</P>

      <P>We seek to give the Courts Service the independence and power to run the courts, but Members seem to want to specify, at least as regards this matter, exactly how the service should run its business.  The intention of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to give the Courts Service a degree of independence to allow it to manage the courts in an effective <Col N="664" /> and efficient manner.  It is neither the intention of this legislation nor the philosophy behind it to direct the Courts Service as to how it should do its business.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton asked what constitutes an inordinate amount of time.  That is a rhetorical question. The only certainty is that it is not an ordinary amount of time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> I am mystified by the Minister's stonewalling and the degree of his disingenuousness in, first, trying to imply it is a question of our not trusting the new service or of our wanting to infringe on its independence, and second, using the annual report as the answer to providing these vital statistics.  There is no conflict. All we say is that the annual report should contain those statistics and that a vital organ in doing so should be the research and statistical unit.</P>
      <P>I recently asked the Minister the number of paedophiles and other sex offenders serving prison sentences who are scheduled for release on 30 June 1998 and also before 31 December 1998. Records are apparently not maintained in a fashion to have allowed the precise information sought by me to be furnished in the available time.  Each person in prison is an individual brought before the courts.  The court is presided over by a judge, a sentence was handed down, the person went to jail and will shortly be released, either between now and June or between June and December.  Nonetheless, the Minister cannot give me crucial information to ensure there is no barbaric recurrence of what happened in my county at Christmas, when a paedophile was released unannounced into the community and was burned out.</P>
      <P>The Minister is committed to doubling the number of prison places and yet 77 per cent of prisoners reoffend.  Each prison space costs £110,000 to build and £44,000 to maintain.  There are more prison officers than prisoners and yet the Minister states he will pour millions of pounds into servicing a system which has a 77 per cent chance of failure.  He should cut out the obfuscation and stonewalling and provide a sensible instrument for the provision of statistics and data and the measurement of performance.  It is in his interests and those of the Department, the criminal justice system and the taxpayers to adopt this sensible proposal.</P>

I cannot go any further than that <Col N="666" /> except to say that I believe the objective being pursued by Members will be achieved without necessarily including it in this legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 13 and 14 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>(e) at the request of the Minister, or on its own initiative, recommend to the Minister appropriate scales of court fees and charges,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was happy to be in a position on Committee Stage to give an undertaking to Deputy Higgins that I would introduce an amendment to meet the objective he was seeking to achieve in his amendment. Section 6(2)(e) provides that at the request of the Minister the service may recommend appropriate scales of court fees and charges to the Minister.  The issues relating to court revenue are significant and must been seen in the context of the cost effectiveness of the new service.  It is appropriate that the Minister should be in a position to seek the recommendations of the service with regard to the level of court fees and charges. I agree with the Deputy that the power of initiative in this regard should also be at the disposal of the Courts Service.  I remind Deputies that the working group on a courts commission recommended that the Courts Service should be in a position to advise the Minister on the question of court fees.</P>
      <P>I have pointed out that the manner in which the section is structured could not be construed as precluding the service from recommending appropriate scales of court fees and charges on its own initiative.  The reference in section 6(2)(e) to making proposals to the Minister in relation to fees at the request of the Minister was included to ensure that the service would respond to such requests from the Minister.  It was not intended and it does not preclude the service from making recommendations on its own initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in the light of Deputy Higgins's amendment, I accept that the Bill would be improved by making it explicit that the Courts Service will have the power to make such recommendations on its own initiative.  It is important that the Courts Service should also make such recommendations at the request of the Minister and this aspect of the matter is not adequately dealt with in Deputy Higgins's amendment.  My amendment will ensure that the service will be in a position, on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister, to recommend appropriate scales of court fees.  In the circumstances and since the <Col N="668" /> broad objective of his amendment is being accepted I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment in favour of the one I have tabled.  I thank him for bringing the matter to my attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> I thank the Minister for honouring the commitment he gave on Committee Stage.  His amendment meets the spirit of what I am trying to achieve, that the board will have discretion to make recommendations without waiting for an invitation from the Minister to so do.  His amendment is also very much in keeping with the spirit of what he was trying to achieve in the previous amendment, to ensure the independence and autonomy of the board which should have maximum discretion in relation to the way it operates.  The matter of fees is of fundamental importance in this regard.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 8, after &ldquo;period&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including a comprehensive set of judicial statistics for the period in question&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was discussed with amendment No. 2.  I do not want to regurgitate the same arguments but what the Minister has done is unpardonable. He has done damage to something that is of fundamental importance to the welfare of the board.  I am not pressing the amendment as I am anxious, in the limited time available, to proceed to other amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister, in making nominations under subsection (1), shall have regard to the <Col N="669" /> need to ensure that membership of the Board includes both men and women.  &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that we debated the important issue of gender balance on the board of the Courts Service at some length last week at the select committee.  Amendments were tabled by Deputies McManus and Higgins.  If I recall correctly, Deputy Upton and others were in broad support.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus's amendment seeks to ensure the membership of the board of the Courts Service will include both men and women. The Bill provides that three members of the board are to be nominated by the Minister &mdash; an officer of the Minister, a person to represent consumers of court services and a person representative of commerce, finance or administration interests.  Deputy McManus's amendment would require the Minister to have regard to the need for gender balance in nominating these three members.  It would also require the Minister to ask all other nominating persons or bodies to have the same regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus was prepared to withdraw her amendment on the basis of my commitment that I was in favour, in principle, of inserting a provision in the Bill to reflect our concern with regard to the need to promote gender balance on the board.  I indicated that acceptance of the amendment would be subject to drafting approval.</P>
    <P>I have had the amendment carefully considered in the interim.  As I mentioned, there are two aspects to it.  The first would require the Minister, in making his or her nominations, to have regard to the need to have both men and women on the board.  I have no difficulty with this aspect of the amendment.  The Minister of the day would have latitude with three nominations to take into account the issue of the gender composition of the board.</P>
    <P>My problem is with the second aspect of the amendment which would place a statutory requirement on the Minister to ask other nominating bodies or persons to have similar regard.  I am advised, following careful consideration, that there is an inherent practical difficulty with this approach.  Each body or person concerned is enabled to make one nomination only.  It would be impractical to impose a legal obligation to have regard to the need to nominate both men and women in nominating one board member.  It would be a different matter if each nominating person or body nominated two or more members to the board.  I am advised that imposing a requirement that was impracticable could carry with it the danger of a subsequent legal challenge to the composition of the board.  I am sure everybody will want to avoid such a challenge.</P>
    <P>For practical and legal reasons, therefore, it would not be possible to impose the requirement comprehended in the second part of Deputy McManus's amendment.  At best, it would constitute no more than an empty formula.  At worst, it <Col N="670" /> could throw the entire process of the formation of the board into legal uncertainty.</P>
    <P>The amendment I have tabled is, effectively, the same as the first part of Deputy McManus's amendment.  For the reasons outlined it is impractical to legislate further.  I have been advised, however, that there is no obstacle to my raising formally the need for gender balance on the board of the Courts Service with all the nominating persons or bodies concerned.  I give an undertaking to the Deputies that I will take the opportunity to impress on those persons and bodies the need to have both men and women on the board.</P>
    <P>On a drafting point, I am advised that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;particular&rdquo;, requiring the Minister to have particular regard to the issue of gender balance, adds nothing of substance to the provision.  The word does not appear in my amendment.  I am satisfied my amendment reflects the importance we all attach to the gender aspect of representation on the board of the Courts Service.  I hope Deputies can accept my approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins's amendment, which was motivated by similar considerations, seeks to ensure the board of the Courts Service would comprise a minimum of 40 per cent female representation. Deputies accept that the issue of gender balance is not straightforward in the context of the board of the Courts Service and the way it is structured under the Bill.  Section 11 establishes the board.  As I explained on Committee Stage, in view of the composition of the board it would clearly not be practical to provide that a certain number or percentage of members must be men or women as this would be a matter over which the Minister of the day would not have control.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for tabling the amendments. I sincerely hope they can accept, in the context of the proposed structure of the board, the amendment I have tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the Minister's response in relation an amendment I tabled in good faith, although I welcome the fact that he has accepted the first part of the amendment.  I have no problem with the idea of taking out the word &ldquo;particular&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In relation to the board, the Minister can make three nominations.  He accepts that under the Bill he will have an obligation to have regard to the need for gender balance in making those nominations, which make up a small part of the total membership of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the second part of my amendment constitutes an empty formula.  I do not accept this.  I do not accept that a Minister asking nominating bodies to have regard to a fundamental policy principle to which all parties in the House subscribe is without meaning.  It is an important principle which should not be disregarded in relation to the totality of the Bill.  I do not believe the principle of enabling women to reach equality applies to politicians only. Responsibility lies with a much larger spectrum, <Col N="671" /> including bodies and organisations such as the Judiciary, the Bar Council, the Law Society of Ireland and ICTU.  Everybody has to play their part if we are to ensure true equality.  If these amendments had not been tabled the Minister would not have brought forward proposals concerning gender balance.  Despite the genesis of the Bill, whereby an extremely important female judge has done a magnificent job, the principle of gender balance would not have been enshrined in it.  My amendment has been emasculated &mdash; when I tabled it I made it clear it was modest and did not reach the 40 per cent which is desired and which should be a matter of course due to the large number of judges included in the Courts Service.  However, this does not negate the importance of the principle.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that under the provision set out in the amendment he will &ldquo;ask&rdquo; each nominating person or body to have similar regard.  Is it possible to be more modest? Initially he said that what I am seeking cannot be done and then that, legally, it should not be done.  However, notwithstanding this, he said he would do so in any event but not through the Bill.  The Minister said he will ask nominating bodies to have due regard to such provision, but at the beginning of his speech he said this would not be possible as only one nomination is made.  This is not logical.  If it is not possible to do so through legislation &mdash; if it is a request rather than an imperative &mdash; it makes no sense to do so outside it.  I do not accept this as I know he can ask the nominating bodies to make such provision.  This is the way such things are done and people can be conscious of their responsibilities in ensuring equality.  The Minister has an obligation, as a member of a Government which is presumably committed to the principle of equality, to live out that obligation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that such a matter should not be provided for in legislation.  I have a difficulty as I am not a member of his Department and am not familiar with his legal advice.  However, it is inconceivable that a Minister could be prevented from approaching nominating bodies to a board he has established with a reasonable request. Who can set conditions for organisations, or at least ask them to consider the manner in which they make such nominations, if the Minister cannot? It makes no sense that the Minister charged with introducing a Courts Service, who has drawn up the Bill and has specified those who will be members of the service in terms of individuals and the nominating bodies, cannot ask them to take on board the fact that 51 per cent of the country's population has a right to fair representation. Have we arrived at a point where the Minister's response is feeble, conservative and out of keeping with the response he gave on Committee Stage?  At that time he indicated that far from seeing my amendment as radical, which it clearly is not, he could improve it.  He has improved on it in one regard, namely, by taking <Col N="672" /> out the word &ldquo;particular&rdquo;.  I am all in favour of plain speaking and support this deletion. However, he has taken out an important aspect concerning the principle of equality, emasculating my amendment by not allowing the Minister, who has the authority and the democratic mandate, to ensure the Courts Service board is based on sound principles, including that of equality for women.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he personally felt very committed to the principle of equality. However, the necessary political commitment on this issue is lacking.  The Minister is over reliant on the caution and conservatism of civil servants. I have no problem with them doing their job but the Minister also has a task in ensuring fair play. He should do what is modest and reasonable by ensuring the Bill provides that not only will the Minister give due regard to the fact that 51 per cent of the population is female, but that he will expect and request nominating bodies, which have an equal duty to respect the gender balance, to take cognisance of that balance and ensure it is reflected in their decisions.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> It is incomprehensible that a Minister and a Department with responsibility for ensuring gender proofing, balance and fair play in representation of State boards should totally disregard the requirement they impose on others in the drafting of this fundamental legislation. I had the pleasure of sitting in Cabinet for over two years during which time I saw a rigid insistence in relation to every board having a minimum 40 per cent female representation.  I pay special tribute to the Minister's predecessor, Mervyn Taylor, who was most assiduous in insisting that the 40 per cent minimum representation was honoured in the composition of every board.</P>
      <P>It appears that the Department with responsibility for policing this provision has taken no cognisance of the likely fallout in terms of gender imbalance in drafting this Bill.  The Minister spoke of the inherent practical difficulty in relation to this matter.  Such a difficulty has been created by the Minister and his Department in the formulation of the Bill.  It is not necessary to be a mathematical genius to figure out that 40 per cent of 17 is seven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning the composition of the board, the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court are men.  The other positions provided for include a judge of the Supreme Court elected by the ordinary judges of that court; a judge of the High Court elected by the ordinary judges of that court; a judge of the Circuit Court elected by the ordinary judges of that court and a judge of the District Court elected by the ordinary judges of that court.  In each case a near male monopoly has responsibility for nominating a member.  There is a strong possibility that without my intervention and that of Deputy McManus the Courts Service Board would be all male. <Col N="673" /> This would have happened without any regard to the obligations of the Constitution, Article 41º of which clearly includes a strong protection of the family.  The courts are dominated by family law cases where women are victims of violence and where children find themselves in unfortunate domestic circumstances which ultimately must be sorted out through recourse to the courts.  Family law cases, marriage breakdowns, child custody orders, barring orders and so on constitute the daily business of the courts of this land.  Yet, no provision has been made for any representative of a family to be appointed to the board.  It should surely have been a fundamental aspect of drafting the Bill that at least one place would have been reserved for a representative of the welfare organisations which do such wonderful work.  Such a person would have knowledge and practical experience of the welfare of women and children.  There is not even a token aspiration to that effect in regard to the composition of the board.</P>
    <P>I tabled amendment No. 9 in regard to the 40 per cent female representation objective simply to focus on this issue.  One had only to take a cursory glance at the board's composition to see it was virtually impossible for women to be represented on it.  What really galls me is that there does not seem to be even a minimal acceptance of the point made by Deputy McManus in amendment No. 8.  The amendment seeks that a Minister shall use his or her discretion to advise the various nominating bodies of the requirement for gender balance and shall urge them to give practical expression to it by seeking to ensure that at least some of the people nominated by them are females.  The Minister has simply watered down what we thought was a commitment given on Committee Stage to accept the spirit of what Deputy McManus was trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>In his amendment No. 7, the Minister informs us that he shall, in making nominations under subsection (1), have regard to the need to ensure that membership of the board includes both men and women.  Can the Minister not advise the learned judges of the Supreme, High, Circuit and District Courts and any other organisations that, in view of the fact that the courts of the land now deal with so many family law cases involving women and children, it is fundamental they have cognisance of the requirement to seek to ensure that some gender balance is achieved?  The Minister makes the point that it is not possible to enshrine the concept any more solidly than he has done in view of the fact that there is no provision for two representatives from the various nominating bodies.  Why was something as fundamental as that not taken into consideration in drafting the Bill?  I recall that during my time as Education spokesman, two Bills were introduced to regulate the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges.  It was enshrined in the legislation that there would be two representatives on the various boards, at least one of whom would be a woman.  In that way, whether <Col N="674" /> the representatives were drawn from students or academic staff, there was no problem in ensuring that the 40 per cent gender balance minimum requirement would be met.  The Minister and his Department are responsible for rapping other bodies over the knuckles and insisting on the implementation of the law.  It is incredible that the Minister and the Department, who are supposed to be vigilant, without any prodding or probing from the Opposition, in ensuring that minimum gender balance requirements are met, should themselves totally and absolutely disregard them.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about empty formulas and his party is certainly expert on those.  For a Minister with responsibility for equality to dismiss the intention contained in the amendments tabled by Deputy McManus and me as an empty formula sounds very hollow indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of the comments made by the two previous speakers.  I suspect that some of the difficulties the Minister finds himself confronted with are related to the composition of the board.  It seems there is provision for an inordinate number of legal people on the board.  As Deputy Higgins pointed out, the type of legal people involved means that the objective of attaining anything approximating the 40 per cent requirement becomes exceptionally difficult.  It may be possible in theory to appoint seven females because of the way in which the board is weighted but the Minister is faced with difficult options given that the presidents of the various courts are, at present, males and are likely to remain overwhelmingly so for the short-term future.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus's amendment is very modest. As far as I can see, the Deputy is simply seeking that the Minister would request each nominating body to have regard to the necessity to have a board, the membership of which is made up of women and men.  That seems to be very basic indeed.  I am not a lawyer but I have great difficulty in understanding the legal advice which the Minister obtained although I am sure it was obtained in good faith from highly qualified and learned legal experts.  However, I do not understand why a request as basic as Deputy McManus's would create problems down the road.  I urge the Minister to reconsider his position on this matter.  It seems likely that, in practice, females will be grossly outnumbered on the board and that is highly undesirable.  I will not reiterate the arguments made by the previous speakers on the objectives and policies involved and the wonderful paradox of a Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform leading a fairly well structured attack on equality.  That is a curious anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The spirit of the Deputies' amendments is very worthwhile and I am very disappointed that the Minister seems to be digging his heels in on this matter, particularly in the case of the amendment tabled by Deputy McManus which seems very <Col N="675" /> straightforward and which I would not have expected him to have difficulty in accepting.  I accept the objectives of the amendment tabled by Deputy Higgins and his point in regard to the seven people.  That goes back to the fundamental structure of the board and is an issue which should have been considered previously but unfortunately was not.</P>

      <P>I have listened carefully to the Deputies' comments.  Deputy McManus asked why I am not committed to gender balance. My own late mother was a member of Kerry County Council for more than 20 years from 1965 onwards when it was neither fashionable nor usual for women to be involved in political life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the need to have gender balance and that is why I accepted the first part of Deputy McManus's amendment. The difficulty with the amendment relates to the second part in regard to the formulation of the Courts Service.  The facts are that every Government for some time now has accepted the need for gender balance and that there should be at least 40 per cent representation of women on State boards and agencies in so far as that can be realised.  The difficulty involved in this instance is that many of the positions, which are set out for membership of the Courts Service, are those currently held by men who, in turn, become <i>ex officio</i> members of the service.  For example, the Chief Justice or a judge nominated by him is an <i>ex officio</i> member of the board.  The effect of Deputy McManus's amendment is that I should ask each nominating person or body to have the same regard as I would have to the need to achieve gender balance.  What would be the legislative effect of the Minister of the day asking a nominating body to have regard to that?  It could not achieve anything directly because it is merely a request.  If the request were put into a statute, I am advised by my legal advisers that it could leave the composition of the board open to a legal challenge for the reason I outlined.  I said I would ask the nominating bodies to have regard to the need for gender balance as an administrative matter, but there are legal difficulties in imposing a requirement in relation to a nomination of one person, having regard to the desirability of appointing both genders.  It could leave the composition of the board open to the possibility of a legal challenge because we would be making something a statutory imperative which in practice could be said to be impractical.  It does not arise as a matter of practice because it would not be a statutory imperative if one were, as a matter of administrative function, to ask the nominating bodies concerned to have regard to the question of gender balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McManus was mischievous in suggesting <Col N="676" /> I was trying to say this was an empty formula. I am seeking to achieve precisely the same objective as she, but my difficulty is that the legal advice available to me suggests firmly that if I were to accept the second part of her amendment, it would leave the composition of the courts service open to legal challenge which might be successful.  That is not desirable when the same objective can be attained by way of administrative function.  Is Deputy McManus worried that the next Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not ask the nominating bodies to have regard to gender balance? On my own behalf and that of my party, I assure her that whoever holds the position in Fianna Fáil will do that.  She may have difficulties with other parties on that and if she does she should take it up with them.</P>
    <P>We cannot enforce the 40 per cent rule on gender balance in the Courts Service because people are going on to this board in an <i>ex officio</i> capacity.  By virtue of positions they hold, they will automatically become members of this board and if they did not hold those positions they would not be qualified to do so.  It is true that many of the major positions in our courts are held by men &mdash; from the Chief Justice down to the presidents of the lower courts.  There is no woman acting as president.  When I raised this matter on Committee Stage Deputy McManus said that will change and I would be delighted to see it.  If and when it changes the composition of the Courts Service in respect of gender balance service will axiomatically change.</P>
    <P>I guarantee I will ensure that regard is had for gender balance when making ministerial appointments. I am in a position to empower myself to do that by way of statutory imperative.  Unfortunately the position is different in so far as <i>ex officio</i> membership of the board is concerned. There is no point pretending the position is otherwise. Deputy McManus is seeking to make a request a statutory imperative.  Apart from the question mark over that, surely it must be obvious to everybody that when the nominating bodies are nominating only one person it leaves the entire position open to further questions.  The best I can do from a legal perspective is to request the nominating bodies to have regard to gender balance as an administrative function and I will do that.  I sincerely hope members of other parties, who may hold this position, will do the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I am sorry if I have discommoded the Chair but I will be brief. In response to the Minister's question on the possible effect of this amendment, I remind him we are living in a world where only a handful of women exert power and influence.  Our Judiciary and political system are dominated by men.  I am sure the Minister's mother was a pioneer, but we have not progressed very far since her time on the county council.  There is an imperative to ensure that when we have the capability to bring about equality we should do so.  That imperative was never greater than with a Minister with responsibility for equality.  The Minister said it would create legal difficulty to have regard to this imbalance, but I remind him nominating bodies will need to have regard to whether person being considered for nomination is professionally competent, available, able to articulate requirements and various other considerations in deciding on a nomination.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he can have regard to gender balance on an administrative but not on a legal basis.  I do not accept that.  The Minister has made a bags of this Bill in a way that is deeply disturbing because of his role as Minister with responsibility for equality and law reform.  He stated that he as a Fianna Fáil Minister will live up to his obligations in this regard.  This Fianna Fáil-PD Government absorbed responsibility for equality and law reform into the Department of Justice.  If it had not been for the Opposition, the Minister would have done nothing to ensure there was a female voice in the Courts Service.</P>

It provided that in the event of the appointment of up to four additional members to the board, one only would be appointed from each of the specialised panels and in the event of the appointment of up to eight additional members to the board, no more than two would be appointed from each of the panels.  Two small drafting changes were required to the amendment in the interest of clarity and on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman.  I have, therefore, put down this amendment.  Neither of the small changes affects the thrust of the Deputy's amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister intends to appoint two additional members only to the board.  It is unlikely that more than three additional members would be appointed.  If it became necessary to increase the board membership to the extent envisaged in the amendment, which would result in a possible 14 member board, it would be necessary to revise the structure of the board to ensure it could continue to work efficiently.</P>

During that debate, I offered to furnish my legal advice on this amendment to the Minister of State and I have done so.

Decisions of the board are scrutinised by lawyers and are often the subject of judicial review.  It is extremely important, therefore, that every aspect of planning legislation should be crystal clear.  Unless there is a compelling reason for not including this amendment &mdash; one could argue it is a belt and braces approach &mdash; it should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I welcome this modest proposal. It does not seek to fundamentally alter planning law but to expedite the planning appeals process by the appointment of additional members to An Bord Pleanála.  I deeply regret that on the issues articulated on Second and Committee Stages, unfortunately not on Report Stage, on the interim appointments, the Minister did not see fit to allow for the appointments to be made from the existing panels rather than from his own Department. On Committee Stage I argued that it would be wrong in terms of the principles of the Bill to move outside that nominating procedure.  It would also weaken the core of expertise available to his Department if senior officials were seconded for a period of time to An Bord Pleanála. I would have welcomed the Minister's reflection, <Col N="681" /> having had time to think about the arguments put forward on Committee Stage, but, alas, it was not forthcoming.  Perhaps even at this late stage the Minister will comment on that matter.</P>
      <P>A great amount of fundamental reform is needed in the planning process and that is being done in parallel with this enactment.  I look forward to a comprehensive Bill on planning in the not too distant future to correct the many anomalies which we have identified, some of which we have tried to graft on this Bill but were deemed to be inappropriate graftings for this measure.  I hope we will have an early opportunity to consider the planning system at local authority, planning authority and appeals level.  I hope, particularly in the light of significant growth in planning, construction and planning appeals, a comprehensive planning measure will be before us shortly to bring relief to the many people affected by the various anomalies identified during discussion on this Bill and in the committee on the environment and local government, which has a role in reviewing legislation on the planning side.</P>

      <P>I wish to comment on Deputy Howlin's amendment, debated fully on Committee Stage, which proposes that the interim appointments should be made from existing panels.  That would be highly impractical for the reasons I outlined on Committee Stage, and I have not changed my view since then.  It would not facilitate the immediate appointment of persons to the board, necessary to achieve the objective of enabling the board to deal expeditiously with the increase in planning appeals that are now before it or that may come before it in the future when it is deemed that the size of the board needs to be increased to deal with substantial and immediate increases in appeals.</P>
      <P>The large number of appeals reflects the growth in activity in the economy, which is welcome. It is important that everything possible is done at legislative level to facilitate growth, and this Bill is necessary to enable An Bord Pleanála to meet its targeted objective of deciding at least 95 per cent of planning appeals within the four months period.  That target began to slip in 1996 and was not met in 1997.</P>
      <P>The measures to enable interim appointments to be made immediately by the Minister from his own staff or the staff of An Bord Pleanála are practical.  Deputy Howlin's suggestion that the appointments be made from existing panels would not allow for immediate appointment because people would have to extract themselves from other jobs and would be appointed for perhaps only three or four months in many cases. That would not be attractive for them and would not achieve the objective of immediately increasing the number of board members of An Bord Pleanála.</P>

    <P>This Bill will assist applicants for planning permission and the construction industry whose output is greatly affected by the efficient operation <Col N="682" /> of the Planning Acts.  Delays have often been identified as a cause of additional costs, where money has been invested and construction work cannot commence until full and proper permission has been granted.  We are seeking to do everything possible to provide for efficient operation of the planning system so that unnecessary costs are not incurred on projects.  The Government is concerned about the increased cost of private houses.  This may help to alleviate to some extent one of the many factors which contribute to the high cost.  There is not one obvious cause but a myriad of effects result in high demand.  By making the planning procedures more efficient we are helping to improve supply.  The Bill will prove very useful and, I hope, very effective in achieving that objective.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the recommendation from the Commission of the European Community, pursuant to Article 109j of the Treaty establishing the European Community done at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957 (as amended by the Treaty on European Union done at Maastricht on the 7th day of February, 1992), concerning the fulfilment by Ireland of the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency.</P>
      <P>The reason I put down this motion is to provide Dáil Éireann with the opportunity to discuss Ireland's prospective participation in economic and monetary union at the outset on 1 January 1999.  EMU is one of the most significant economic events of this century and it is only proper that we should have the opportunity to discuss it again before the next major decisions are made at European level during the first weekend of May.</P>
      <P>The people of Ireland decided by referendum in 1992 that we should participate in EMU if we qualified and the Government is resolved to give effect to that decision.  Following the Commission recommendations last week, we are now very well placed to be confirmed as one of the countries which will be part of this most historic development in European integration on 1 January next. In accordance with Article 109j(1) of the EC Treaty, the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute are required to report to Council on the progress made in the fulfilment by the member states of their obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union, EMU.  On the basis of these reports, the Commission is required to submit separately to Council a recommendation as to which member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> These reports examine whether there has been a high degree of sustainable convergence among member states and this is assessed primarily on the basis of progress made by member states in fulfilling each of the four convergence criteria of Article 109j(1), namely price stability, government budgetary position, the observance of the normal fluctuation margins of the exchange rate mechanism and the durability of convergence as reflected in long-term interest rates.  In addition, the compatibility between national legislation, including the statutes of national central banks, and the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks is examined.  Deputies will be aware that these two convergence reports, with the recommendations of the Commission, were published last week on 25 March.</P>
    <P>The publication of these reports and recommendations is the first step of the procedure set out in Article 109j which will lead to confirmation by the Council, meeting on 2 May 1998 in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, of which member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency. Based on the two convergence reports, the Commission recommendations to the Council are that the following 11 member states are suitable to enter into the third and final stage of EMU on 1 January 1999: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Finland and, of course, Ireland.</P>
    <P>Denmark and the United Kingdom are exercising their opt-outs and Sweden and Greece are judged by the Commission not to have fulfilled all the relevant criteria.  As the next step, the European Parliament meeting on 29-30 April will deliver an informal opinion to the ECOFIN Council based on the convergence reports and the Commission recommendations.</P>
    <P>On the basis of these reports and on the recommendation of the Commission, the ECOFIN Council meeting on 1 May will assess for each member state the fulfilment of conditions for the adoption of the single currency and formulate its recommendations to the Heads of State or Government.  The European Parliament meeting on the morning of 2 May will then deliver its formal opinion to the Heads of State or Government who will meet that afternoon to confirm which member states will participate in EMU from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition to having the Commission and EMI convergence reports, I considered that it would be important to have an assessment of Ireland's convergence from the Central Bank of Ireland. This report was published yesterday and arrangements were made to have it laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Central Bank's report also concludes that Ireland meets the four convergence criteria concerning price stability, Government budgetary position, exchange and <Col N="684" /> interest rates.  The bank states that membership of EMU offers Ireland the prospect of stable economic conditions, based on price stability.</P>
    <P>In terms of legal compatibility, the EU Commission and the EMI convergence reports found that, following the enactment of the Central Bank Act, 1998, which was debated in the House some weeks ago, legislation in Ireland is compatible with the requirements of the treaty and the ESCB statute.  The Central Bank report also states that &ldquo;Central Bank legislation is now fully compatible with the requirements of the Treaty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The EMI report notes two so called imperfections, which will not, however, jeopardise the overall functioning of the ESCB at the start of Stage III.  These are not substantive, nevertheless appropriate adjustments of a drafting nature can be made when a suitable opportunity arises.  The EU Commission report includes no reference to imperfections.</P>
    <P>In relation to convergence among member states generally, the Commission recommends a total of 11 member states as fulfilling the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro.  In the words of the Commission, convergence is now an established fact in Europe.  Member states have made great progress in bringing their economies closer together and have demonstrated a revitalised commitment to controlling inflation and placing public finances on a sounder footing.</P>
    <P>I recognise that concern has been expressed about the sustainability of the performance of some member states, a concern reflected in the views of the European Monetary Institute that further budgetary consolidation is warranted in some member states.  However, it is the objective independent assessment of the European Commission, which is the guardian of the European treaties, that these 11 member states fulfil the necessary conditions, in accordance with the treaty.  That assessment is based on the convergence reports of the EMI and the Commission which, under the treaty, examine the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence.  In the context of the decisions to be taken at the beginning of May, it is my intention, therefore, to support the Commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the effects, both negative and positive, which EMU is likely to have on the Irish economy were analysed in detail by the ESRI in its study, The Economic Implications for Ireland of EMU, published in July 1996.  This report concluded that membership of EMU would, on balance, be economically advantageous even were the UK to remain outside.  The net benefit to the Irish economy from taking part in EMU, without the UK, was estimated by the ESRI to be an additional 0.4 per cent of GNP on an annual average basis over the medium term, allowing for possible shocks to Ireland arising from the UK's non-participation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> The ESRI also looked at potential but unquantifiable effects of EMU participation.  It concluded that some of these, such as the increased attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for foreign direct investment, could be substantial.  The ESRI's conclusion was endorsed by the National Economic and Social Council in its report, European Union: Integration and Enlargement.  NESC found no reason to revise its long-standing position that Ireland's strategic interest lay in full economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>In relation to our long-term strategic interests, it is necessary to view EMU membership in the context both of past long-term economic performance in other member states and of the appropriate medium to long-term future strategy for Ireland, while at the same time taking account of the short-term challenges that may arise.</P>
    <P>In summary, the case for Ireland joining EMU from the outset is stronger than ever, given the remarkable convergence that has occurred among the 11 potential EMU participants which is sustainable into the future, assuming that appropriate stability orientated policies are pursued by them.  This is confirmed by the EMI, Commission and Central Bank convergence reports and the Commission recommendations.  Taken together with the economic assessments that have been made by the ESRI and the NESC, it is clear that Ireland's long-term strategic interests lie in joining EMU from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>However, EMU brings with it certain responsibilities to ensure that we can sustain our excellent economic performance into the future.  Despite our very low inflation to date, inflationary pressures in the economy, if left unchecked, could cause severe damage to our future potential.  This is widely recognised here in Ireland and is a concern to which I have referred in the past.  It is also a concern at EU level and is reflected in the reports of the EMI, the Commission and the Central Bank of Ireland.  It is important, therefore, that we act appropriately and prudently to ensure future balanced and sustainable development of our economy.  It is against this background that the recent revaluation of the ERM central rate of the Irish pound must be seen.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, on 14 March 1998 it was agreed that the central rate of the pound would be revalued by 3 per cent against other ERM currencies, from DM 2.41105 to DM 2.48338. The new central rate of the Irish pound is broadly in line with its recent market rate.  This revaluation was agreed unanimously by our European partners, who recognised the determination of the Irish Government to adopt the mix of economic policies best suited to ensuring price stability on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>The decision on the revaluation was taken with a view to ensuring that our economic success continues in a balanced and sustainable way.  The communiqué issued in Brussels on 14 March refers to three elements of Ireland's economic and budgetary policy stance: the revaluation <Col N="686" /> itself, our budgetary policy in 1998 and 1999, and the Central Bank's intention to continue its present monetary policy orientation which is aimed at price stability.</P>
    <P>These three elements of policy taken together make up a coherent and prudent policy stance in view of the challenges facing the economy.  One of these challenges was the risk of a significant increase in inflation, particularly in 1999, because of our rapid economic growth, prospective lower interest rates in EMU and the overall currency depreciation of recent months, even in circumstances where the current strength of sterling is not sustained.  We needed to avoid adding to these pressures by a further fall in the currency to our previous ERM central rate of DM 2.41. This was especially so because of the threat that significantly increased inflation would pose for the current Partnership 2000 agreement, as well as the negotiations on the next wage agreement.</P>
    <P>The European Commission convergence report forecasts that the personal consumption expenditure, PCE, deflator will rise by 3.3 per cent and 3.5 per cent in 1998 and 1999, respectively.  These forecasts represent a worse case scenario and are not directly comparable with the consumer price index figures.  This is because the PCE does not take account of movements in mortgage interest rates which is a significant omission in the case of Ireland where interest rates are expected to converge to lower European levels over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Commission used the PCE for cross-country comparability purposes and because the more generally used EU harmonised index of consumer prices does not have historical data which would provide a longer perspective.  In its spring forecasts, the Commission actually predicts consumer price inflation of 2.8 per cent and 3.1 per cent for Ireland for 1998 and 1999.  These figures are quoted in the European Monetary Institute Convergence Report.</P>
    <P>The CPI is a broader and more representative measure of changes in consumer prices and is, of course, the measure used in the context of Partnership 2000.  While I do not see the need at this stage to revise my budget forecasts for CPI inflation of 2 per cent in 1998 and 2 per cent in 1999, I do not want to understate the risks to these forecasts of inflation which currently exist.</P>
    <P>Having considered the inflationary risks that lie ahead, I decided the most prudent course of action was to bring the ERM central rate of the Irish pound broadly into line with its recent market rate.  In making this decision, the needs of the economy were taken into consideration and I had to strike a balance between inflation concerns on the one hand and competitiveness considerations on the other.  The short-term advantages for some sectors were balanced against the need to counter inflationary risks for the economy in general, including those sectors.</P>
    <P>The new central rate broadly confirms the <Col N="687" /> recent market level of the Irish pound against the Deutschmark.  Therefore, assuming that ERM central rates form the basis for EMU entry rates, this new higher EMU entry rate for the Irish pound of DM 2.48338, compared with the recent and current exchange rate in the market, will not result in a worsening of the Irish pound value of EU payments, nor will it make our exports any more expensive.  It should also be noted that Irish producers have received a gain in competitiveness from the depreciation of the currency over the past 12 months or so.</P>
    <P>Assuming that ERM central rates will be the basis for EMU entry rates, I accept as a general statement that the revaluation of the Irish pound's ERM will mean that, compared with the situation of entering EMU at DM 2.41105, the Irish pound value of EU payments, including agricultural payments, will be about 3 per cent lower and our exports will be 3 per cent more expensive.  However, this negative impact on EU payments is just one of a wide set of foreign exchange flows which will be affected by the revaluation.  For example, annual debt servicing costs will be lower in Irish pound terms than they would have been if there had been no revaluation. In any case, it should be remembered that any short-term gain in competitiveness there might have been from entering EMU at DM 2.41 would have been eroded if the risk of higher inflation were to materialise.</P>
    <P>Similarly, any gains to farmers and others could have been quickly eroded if the lower value of the Irish pound had resulted in higher inflation. It should also be remembered that the exporting and agricultural sectors will, like the rest of the economy, also benefit from the convergence of interest rates across member states participating in EMU by the beginning of 1999.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to focus on what some see as the negative aspects of the revaluation in isolation from the benefits of a less inflationary environment from which those in receipt of EU payments will also gain.  The purpose of the revaluation was to provide a more stable and balanced economic and business environment which would make the challenges ahead more manageable by lessening the threat of inflation.  I am confident that the recent revaluation was a balanced and appropriate response to the challenges that lie ahead.  Taken with the expressed intentions on domestic economic policy, it places Ireland in a strong position to participate successfully in EMU, and will facilitate the continued sustainable development of the economy.</P>
    <P>The communiqué issued following the revaluation of the Irish pound signalled my decision to hold strictly to the tight expenditure targets set out in last December's budget and hence to allow the general Government surplus &mdash; already pitched at 0.5 per cent of GDP &mdash; to increase in line with any unanticipated revenues this year. The communiqué also noted my resolve to propose a budget for 1999 having as its primary <Col N="688" /> objective the continuation of low inflation.  This approach to budgetary policy will help to secure the medium-term sustainability of our economic growth.</P>
    <P>This decision regarding the conduct of budgetary policy in 1998 and 1999 is fully in accord with the commitment contained in the Economic Background to the budget last December to run budget surpluses when the economy is doing well. Prudent management of the public finances has helped underpin our strong economic performance. Low budget deficits and a rapidly declining debt ratio have helped secure the stable low inflation and interest rate environment which has proved so conducive to strong economic and employment growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council in a recently published report, &ldquo;Private Sector Investment in Ireland&rdquo;, highlighted the key role played by reduced macro-economic uncertainty in the economy in stimulating strong investment growth in recent years.  As I stated many times, the final decision on the pre-announcement of the bilateral exchange rates between the currencies that will participate in the euro area will not be taken until the first weekend in May.  However, it is widely expected that these bilateral exchange rates will be based on the ERM central rates which will become effective on 1 January 1999, at which date one euro will become equal to one ECU.  In line with the Treaty on the European Union, and because the ECU is a notional EU currency which contains elements of currencies which will not participate in the euro, the setting of the conversion rates against the euro can only take place on 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>Our strong competitive position in recent years stems from a strategic framework built upon, <i>inter alia</i>, the foundations of a consensus approach which brings the social partners into the national goal-setting arena, sound fiscal and economic policies pursued by successive Governments and a long-established investment in education.  This is now translating into strong employment growth, a continuous decline in unemployment and increased national resources to tackle social priorities.  Competitiveness is a multifaceted concept. While a purist might be inclined to list the many factors involved, as a man who prefers to home in on the core issues, I am indebted to the National Competitiveness Council for its succinct definition, namely that it boils down to &ldquo;success in markets that delivers a better standard of living for all&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The social partnership process is one of the strengths of the economy in addressing the challenges of EMU.  The preparation of the economy for entry to, and participation in, EMU was a vital consideration for the social partners in the negotiation of Partnership 2000.  The continuation of the social partnership process and the negotiation of an appropriate successor to Partnership 2000 will be essential in ensuring Ireland's successful participation in EMU.</P>
    <P>The competitive challenge of EMU will require <Col N="689" /> an intensification of the flexibility and problem-solving approach displayed by the Government and the social partners over the past decade.  Partnership 2000 also provides an explicit review mechanism in the case of a disturbance to Ireland's international competitiveness in EMU. In this regard, the Government, IBEC and ICTU have agreed to meet in the near future, in the context of Partnership 2000, to accelerate the preparation for the competitive impact of EMU.</P>
    <P>Enhanced competitiveness will be important in determining the economy's capacity to successfully accommodate economic shocks.  Provided we maintain our competitiveness, disturbances can be more readily absorbed by appropriate adjustment to domestic costs and prices, leaving long run competitiveness unaffected.  The use of interest and exchange rates as economic instruments to deal with shocks which are particular to Ireland will, however, no longer be available in EMU.  This means that if there are any shocks in the future, which are particular to Ireland, the adjustment process will have to be assisted by a combination of fiscal policy, pay policy and structural reform.</P>
    <P>Monetary policy will be the responsibility of the European System of Central Banks which, for this purpose, brings together the Central Bank Governors of the euro-area member states and the Executive Board of the European Central Bank.  The treaty guarantees the independence of the ESCB; it cannot receive any instructions from either member states or the European Institutions. The primary objective of the ESCB is to maintain price stability, an important objective which will facilitate growth and employment generation in the years ahead.  Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the treaty requires that the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to its objectives.</P>
    <P>In this context, arrangements for dialogue between the ECB, Council and the European Parliament are provided for under the treaty.  The issues arising from the establishment of the European Central Bank were recently debated at some length in the House in connection with the Central Bank Act, 1998.  I will not, therefore, repeat them and will instead deal with the other aspects of EMU relevant to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The success of our response to any economic shocks will depend to a large extent on how well the economy has been prepared in advance to cope with such an eventuality.  Structural policies for the development of Ireland's competitiveness, as well as prudent budgetary policy and appropriate pay developments, will be critical to these preparations.  The reduction in policy options in macro-economic terms which EMU will bring will also heighten the importance of factors such as skills, costs, infrastructure and quality.</P>
    <P>The work of the National Competitiveness Council, established under Partnership 2000, will provide a basis for developing appropriate medium-term policies in this area.  Also important <Col N="690" /> are the maintenance of competition in product markets and the development of suitable infrastructure &mdash; both &ldquo;hard&rdquo; or physical infrastructure and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; infrastructure such as public services and the skills and knowledge base.</P>
    <P>A key concern of many Irish firms is how sterling will perform against the euro once our entry rate has been determined.  The sterling issue is important but we must be careful not to overstate its importance.  When analysts talk about a sterling shock they are, for the most part, talking about a sharp fall in sterling from its equilibrium level.  Sterling is currently well above what most commentators, including the Governor of the Bank of England, consider to be its equilibrium level.  Sterling would have to fall a very long way before it could be considered to represent an economic shock.</P>
    <P>The Government is not, however, ignoring the need to prepare for the possibility, no matter how remote, of problems for Irish industry as a consequence of sterling falling significantly below its equilibrium level.  Consultants have been appointed by Forfás, under the auspices of the EMU Business Awareness Campaign, to examine the implications for Irish industry of the UK remaining outside EMU.  I understand the consultants' report has been received by Forfás and that it has identified a wide range of actions in the fields of finance, marketing, distribution, etc. that firms could consider as part of their contingency planning.  These actions will be summarised in a document to be included in a Forfás information pack prepared as part of the EMU Business Awareness Campaign to be widely distributed in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the practical preparations being made for the changeover to the euro.  I am glad to say that preparations are going well.  My Department has responsibility for co-ordinating the preparations of the Irish public administration and has a key role in helping the rest of the economy to prepare itself for the changeover.</P>
    <P>Private and public sector representatives were centrally involved in the preparation of the national changeover plan, the second edition of which I published in January.  The plan outlines the arrangements that will be made across the public sector, as well as by banks, building societies and the Irish Stock Exchange, to facilitate the changeover.  The plan also shows the designs for euro notes and coins, including the design for the Irish face of euro coins.  An appendix to the plan describes the changeover work being done by various public bodies and trade and professional associations and lists contact points for further information.</P>
    <P>All Members of the Oireachtas received copies of the plan so I do not propose to describe it in detail.  The plan is available from my Department and from Forfás, including the Internet. However, I should draw attention to the statement in the plan that, assuming the European Council confirms during the first weekend of May that Ireland fulfils the necessary conditions for <Col N="691" /> entering EMU, a currency changeover board will be established after the European Council's decision, in order to oversee the detailed implementation of the changeover, including the areas of public and consumer information.  The euro changeover group is expected to provide the nucleus of this board.</P>
    <P>The EMU Business Awareness Campaign being run by Forfás has been very successful in providing information for businesses about EMU and the changeover to the euro.  The campaign has produced an excellent information pack, of which over 30,000 copies have been circulated. Two radio advertising campaigns have been run and a summary leaflet has also circulated to employers in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners. Over 140,000 copies of this leaflet have been distributed.  Forfás has also drawn up a short leaflet specifically for small and medium size enterprises and over 60,000 copies of this leaflet have been distributed.  Forfás will continue its activities for 1998 and plans to issue further documents on issues such as information technology and a guide for retailers.</P>
    <P>With the proximity of EMU, the national information programme will be extended to provide information on the changeover to the euro aimed at the needs of the general public.  This programme will be co-ordinated by my Department in conjunction with the European Commission and the European Parliament offices in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Government recently approved the drafting of the Economic and Monetary Union Bill, 1998 to cater for the other legislative changes necessary for the introduction of the euro from 1 January 1999.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure a clear and comprehensible framework in Irish monetary law following the introduction of the euro; to remove incompatibilities between Irish monetary law and the legal framework for the use of the euro; and to give effect to enabling provisions within the legal framework, for example in relation to the redenomination of outstanding debt.  The Bill is also designed to facilitate companies which wish to redenominate and renominalise their capital structure in euro even before the final changeover to the euro on 1 January 2002.  It is intended to have the Bill enacted by summer 1998.  In preparing it, my Department is consulting with the European Monetary Institute, the European Commission and interested parties in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the single currency, the euro, represents one of the most important economic events in the history of the State and an important phase in European integration.  The establishment of the euro will yield significant benefits for the Irish economy as part of the wider European economy.  A permanently fixed exchange rate will consolidate the gains already achieved through the Single Market.  The euro will allow for the full advantages of the Single Market to be obtained due to higher price transparency and greater competition.  EMU will <Col N="692" /> enhance overall economic efficiency and stability within the euro area, boosting the sustainable rate of output and employment growth and creating a truly single market of some 288 million people.</P>
    <P>Successful participation in EMU will require an intensification of the flexibility and problem solving approach displayed by the Government and the social partners over the past decade.  Structural policies for the development of Ireland's competitiveness, as well as prudent budgetary policy and appropriate pay developments, will be critical.  I am certain that the Irish people and their Government will face those challenges and opportunities imaginatively and successfully.</P>
    <P>Ireland is well placed to participate in EMU from the outset as reflected by the positive recommendation from the EU Commission.  I am very pleased to commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we are having this debate but I am somewhat disappointed at the way in which it is being treated.  I note that there is not a single member of the media in the Press Gallery.  The Minister is shrugging his shoulders &mdash; that is probably par for the course &mdash; but for once I would like to see the spotlight on the Minister. I do not like to see him suffering from the loneliness of the long distance runner.  One of my principal concerns is that there is a need for greater public awareness of what we are about.</P>
      <P>I am a little disappointed with the Minister's speech in view of the inflationary threat which I perceive as being one of the greatest difficulties currently confronting the economy.  That is recognised now but it should have been recognised much earlier.  The issue of the exchange rate with sterling needs to be explored further and I will touch on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue not mentioned by the Minister &mdash; perhaps it is irrelevant but it is looming on the horizon in many EU member states and throughout the world &mdash; is the question of the millennium bug and the effect that will have on this major changeover.  If we talked about the millennium bug with any seriousness a few months ago we would have been laughed at, but when I see people like Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, taking a personal interest in the issues that will arise on the millennium, it is time to sit up and take notice.  I raise that matter in the context of this debate because of the enormous changeover in fiscal, monetary and currency terms we are embarking on and I wonder about our preparedness for that changeover from the point of view of technology.  The central issue in the debate concerns the recommendations from the Commission for the fulfilment by Ireland of the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency.  I am glad we are taking note of that recommendation which I endorse.  It is a tribute to all Governments and political parties in this decade that the conditions that enable us to be recommended by the European Commission have been met so well.  I should point in particular <Col N="693" /> to the performance of the rainbow Government, which was in power until June 1997, in setting up the economy in such a way as to achieve this recommendation.  However, all the political parties have contributed.</P>
    <P>When I first came into politics different political parties and members within political parties were convinced of the benefits to the economy of huge borrowings.  The &ldquo;Martin O'Donoghue&rdquo; theory, which was adopted by the Fianna Fáil Government at the time, was that the way forward was to borrow and to force up unnecessary employment in semi-State bodies.  That madness afflicted this country for quite a number of years, and it took a long time to overcome it and eliminate its effects from the economy.  Fortunately there is now, and has been, a common determination to ensure that sensible economic policies are followed.  We have done that in the context of inflation &mdash; there is a question in relation to that which I will come to later &mdash; and in terms of reining in our debt with the GDP ratio coming down considerably year by year until we are virtually within the 60 per cent prescribed by the Maastricht Treaty.  All those who have been involved in it politically deserve a pat on the back.  That is not to forget those who have been involved on the administrative and support side, particularly those in the Department of Finance who have been giving very sensible advice for quite some time.  I spent a while in the Department of Finance and I have the feeling that they had previously been giving sensible advice which, at the time of the madness of which I spoke, might have been ignored.  Credit is due to everybody for putting us in the situation where we have this recommendation.</P>
    <P>Not being the Opposition spokesperson on Finance but having had to stand in at short notice for my colleague, Deputy Michael Noonan, who is at present dealing with important issues regarding National Irish Bank at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, perhaps I can look at these issues with a greater degree of objectivity than an insider who is dealing with them week in and week out.  That is why it is natural, as somebody attempting to quickly come to terms with the issues, to focus on what I initially thought was a huge information deficit. On considering it further, I would say that it is not really an information deficit but a communication deficit.  There is no doubt there are reams of information available on this issue, and much effort has been made at business level to try to prepare people for the change which the Minister has rightly described as the single most important economic event in the history of the State.  I endorse that view.  This is a momentous event which requires a momentous effort to ensure that everybody fully understands and is fully aware of its implications.  In some ways this changeover will have more significant long-term implications for our future than the discussions taking place in Belfast on the peace process.  That is why I am concerned about the communication deficit. <Col N="694" /> While credit is due to IBEC, Forfás etc., for their efforts, my concern is for ordinary citizens.  The general public are ill-informed.  Merely having a paper available does not ensure that the information reaches the general public.  I note in this regard that there is an intention to formulate a national information programme, which I support. There is a great need for that and the sooner it is done the better.  I would like to see a detailed plan of campaign being put in place as quickly as possible.  Let us not forget the need for briefings for the media, the politicians and the councillors. There cannot be too much effort on this front.  I urge the Minister and the Government to consider a well focused plan of campaign as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am very much in favour of EMU.  I am a committed European.  I believe our place is at the heart of Europe.  My views in that regard were shaped as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and, for a short time, as Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  From the political point of view, I have no doubt that our future is at the heart of Europe.  From the economic and monetary point of view, I am similarly committed.  That is not to say that we should not be alive to the danger and problems, and that brings me back to the issue of inflation.  I am usually concerned about the threat of inflation.  I am also cognisant of the fact that because of monetary union the instruments that will be available to us nationally in future will be far more limited. There are questions the Minister has to answer in this regard, taking into account the recent past, say, the last six months.  Six months ago we had a booming economy which the Government inherited from the rainbow coalition.  That is not a political point.  The point is that we had a booming economy and the Government knew that.  It also knew, or should have known, the gathering strength of sterling and the impact that would have from the point of view of imported inflation. That changeover has been taking place over the past six months, but the Government knew that when it was formulating its proposals in the last budget.  The Government also knew that our interest rates were higher than European rates, and knew that at some stage during 1998 our interest rates would fall.  From nearly every point of view, falling interest rates are welcome.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to establish a post of Deputy Attorney General in view of the report of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security which makes this recommendation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans at present to establish a post of Deputy Attorney General. Deputies may recall that the report of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security published in February 1996 was referred to the Constitution Review Group for consideration by my predecessor, Deputy John Bruton.  The review group, it will be recalled, had issued a provisional report on the Office of the Attorney General in January 1996 and it was in that context that the select committee report was referred to the review group.  The then Taoiseach, in reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 1 and 2 on 27 February 1996, informed the House that it would be prudent to await consideration of the matter by the review group.</P>
      <P>In the event the final report of the review group did not recommend the creation of a post of Deputy Attorney General.  I acknowledge that it did recommend that the Constitution should expressly permit delegation of the Attorney General's functions to another senior lawyer with the approval of the Taoiseach.  I look forward to receiving the views of the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution on this in due course.</P>
      <P>The new management structure for the public service, introduced under the Public Service Management Act, 1997, provides that the authority, responsibility and accountability for the management functions are with the administrative head of a Department or office.  Section 2 of the Act provides a mechanism to enable the Attorney General to be included under the terms of the Act.  I understand that the Attorney General is completing the process of consultation within his office at the moment and will decide in the near future about consent to the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Does he agree that there are three issues associated with the operation of the Attorney General's office and its accountability to the Dáil?  The first is the office's efficiency, the second is the staffing of the office and the third relates to the times the office has been obliged, due to the scarcity of legal advice, to go outside for advice it does not have internally.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle has already ruled that I cannot pursue certain questions because under Standing Orders I am not allowed access to the content of the advice proffered to the Attorney General on different occasions.  However, I feel I am entitled to ask how many times since 26 June the Attorney General's office has felt it necessary to go outside for professional legal advice.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware of this question as it was previously disallowed.  A competent brief would have the answers.</P>

      <P>I had information on this matter last week but the question was ruled out of order.  I had the number of times the Attorney General went outside his office for advice because the question related to the cost of that advice.  I have no difficulty in giving such information. Difficulties arise from the way the Deputy framed that question due to the breakdown of the advice.  This can only be done in order, and the files, which are kept in the office of the Attorney General, would have to be broken down in a certain way.  The office cannot break down the files in that way, but I will furnish the other information to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is whether a Deputy Attorney General is needed.  The Taoiseach's reply is no. Does the Taoiseach not agree that one is necessary because the Attorney General's office has been obliged, since 26 June, to go outside the office for legal advice on a number of matters?  I can restate the question that was disallowed by the Ceann Comhairle's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer a question the Ceann Comhairle has disallowed.  There is information available that I can give to the Deputy, but the suggestion that a Deputy Attorney General would make it unnecessary to go outside the Attorney General's office for advice is a nonsense. There are 22 legal assistants and barristers, 11 parliamentary draftsmen, solicitors, barristers and three full-time contract draftsmen, 73 solicitors, 47 law clerks including some on contract and one legal assistant assigned to the Attorney General himself.  If those people do not have the information, one more individual, a Deputy Attorney General, is unlikely to change the situation dramatically.  One would still have to go outside for information.</P>
      <P>I know the Deputy does not mean to do so, but by focusing on 26 June he is suggesting that this has happened only in the life of this Government. My information is that this has been a regular occurrence since the Office of the Attorney General was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  However, because a practice has prevailed in the past does not necessarily mean it should prevail in the future.  Will the Taoiseach give the names of the legal counsel outside the Attorney General's office who were requested to give advice in relation to one item &mdash; matters related to the Tribunals of Inquiry Act, 1921?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the Taoiseach's reply to the question that was allowed, which relates to the possibility of establishing the post of Deputy Attorney General, and of his experience in Government, does he believe it is necessary to enhance the political and legal advice available to the Attorney General?  I am not casting any reflection on the merits of the current Attorney General and I would not wish that inference to be taken from this.  Previous Attorneys General have also sought legal advice outside the office. In the light of the Taoiseach's experience, does he agree a political post of Deputy Attorney General is desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for outlining clearly that he is not casting any reflection on the current or past Attorneys General in this regard.  As in the case of any other office holder, when the Attorney General is absent someone else has to make decisions.  The senior legal assistant is nominated to make decisions when the Attorney General is absent.  They tend to ensure that one of them is in the office at all times.  In effect, therefore, the senior legal assistant acts as Deputy Attorney General.  In the absence of the Attorney General I would automatically deal with the senior legal assistant.  We do not want to give the impression that there is nobody to deal with the functions of the Attorney General in his absence.</P>
      <P>While the report of the review group did not recommend the creation of a post of a Deputy Attorney General, it recommended that the Constitution should expressly permit delegation of the Attorney General's functions to another senior lawyer.  An all-party committee is examining this issue.  The matter raised by the Deputy is still under review.  The question of whether the senior legal assistant should be designated those responsibilities &mdash; a view put forward in the earlier document &mdash; is still open to discussion by a committee of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in the past five or six years the Office of the Attorney General has become the political cockpit of successive Governments and that the Attorney General has frequently been a surrogate target for the Government?  This was certainly my experience during the last Administration. Does he agree it is one of the most dedicated offices in the State and that its staff work very hard?  Does he also agree it would be a great relief to Attorneys General if they were afforded a platform whereby they could talk about their work in the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Does he agree, therefore, that future Taoisigh should consider the appointment of the Attorney General as one of the Taoiseach's 11 nominees to the Seanad, so that he or she could have some interchange with Members?  Furthermore, does he agree that, in the case of legal advice, the relationship between the Attorney General and the Government is privileged and <Col N="699" /> that the public cannot gain access to it?  Finally, does he agree the question of legal advice is a matter of judgment rather than science and that, therefore, Attorneys General should not be unduly sensitive if their legal advice is criticised? Legal issues, of their nature, can be the subject of different opinions and people should not be concerned if others do not agree with their advice in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of the points raised by the Deputy.  I agree with the thrust of the Deputy's comments about the demand on the office and the level of work and activity in which it is involved.  Most Government matters are central to what is going on in the Attorney General's office.  It is central to dozens of issues that arise every week that may not be in the public domain.</P>
      <P>I could not give a simple yes or no answer to the question about whether the Attorney General should be a Member of the House.  However, I have often considered it unfair that he cannot respond in a comprehensive manner to matters which, for one reason or another, are not always reflected properly in the House or in the public domain.  They have followed the practice of not entering dialogue in this House or elsewhere.  The committee recommended an amendment to the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act passed under the stewardship of the Government of which the Deputy was a member. The Attorney General is answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of the general administration of his office, which allows him to answer on those matters.</P>
      <P>Most people are sensitive to criticism.  I do not believe Attorneys General are concerned about people criticising their legal advice.  They work extremely hard and leave another career to take up the office.  However, I am not saying they do not work hard in the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I have known the past five or six Attorneys General fairly well on a work level.  They are more concerned about criticism which implies their legal advice is given to the Government to assist it.  I do not believe any of them have done that.  They certainly did not do it on the occasion when I and some colleagues were victims of circumstance.  I do not believe it is fair for anyone to say they did.  They are most sensitive when anyone suggests that.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the total sum available in the 1998 Estimates for his Department and the Attorney General's office for commissioning outside legal advice; his views on the arrangements which should obtain in expending this money; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8033/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1998 Estimate for my Department does not contain a specific provision for commissioning outside legal advice.  There is, however, a general provision of £310,000 for consultancies commissioned by my Department from which costs of legal advice, if arising, would be paid.  The bodies under the aegis of my Department would pay any legal costs from their financial allocations in Vote 3, including costs for outside legal advice, if arising.  Specific provisions for costs of this nature would not be identified in the normal course.</P>
      <P>Public procurement guidelines, such as tendering procedures, are applied to consultancies. This is inappropriate, however, where legal advice is sought on a confidential basis.  All legal fees are evaluated as appropriate to the level of service provided before payments are made. Where minor costs arise the evaluation is undertaken at official level.  Otherwise costs are evaluated by the Attorney General or Chief State Solicitor.</P>
      <P>In the 1998 Estimate for the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, a total of £5.55 million is available for general law expenses and fees to counsel.  The amount comprises £3.45 million for fees to counsel and £1.8 million for general law expenses in the Vote of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and £0.3 million for general law expenses in the Vote of the Office of the Attorney General.  The amount voted to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor almost entirely relates to costs of litigation, for example, legal costs awarded as a result of litigation, witness expenses and payment of fees to experts, such as medical consultants, engineers, etc.  Similarly the amount of £3.45 million for fees to counsel provides for the payment of fees due to counsel engaged for litigation on behalf of the State.  It would also meet the cost of legal opinions.  The funding for general law expenses in the Vote of the Office of the Attorney General includes the legal costs associated with the swimming inquiry.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor have developed procedures for the engagement and payment of fees to counsel which take into account the fact that the offices have no control over the timing of legal cases and requests for legal assistance. These include sanction by the Attorney General and the Department of Finance as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply.  He stated the Offices of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor <Col N="702" /> had arranged procedures whereby advice is obtained.  Why do those procedures not involve any element of competitive tendering?  If the services of a medical doctor, an architect, a quantity surveyor or others were required, there would be some element of competitive tendering.  Will the Taoiseach indicate why this is not the case when the Attorney General seeks legal advice from eminent senior or junior counsel in the Law Library?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume there is no competitive tendering in these matters.  I am unsure whether there is competitive tendering on them in the courts generally.  I assume Attorneys General would seek advice on an urgent basis and would try to obtain the best advice they can, so the normal procurement procedure of seeking three tenders and making a decision would not be feasible.  However, Attorneys General have been trying to take account of what was stated in this House about enormous fees and have tried to negotiate a capping arrangement.  As the House will recall as regards one inquiry, there was a short delay while the Attorney General attempted to negotiate such procedures.  While it is not tendering as the Deputy outlines it, Attorneys Generals are now trying to facilitate a more cost effective regime when costs are likely to mount up, something which was not done in the past.</P>

      <P>Could the Taoiseach outline the thinking of this and previous Governments on this?  If accountants and consultants are covered by the rules for competitive tendering set out by the Department of Finance and with which every former and current office holder is acutely familiar, why is it that legal advice is exempt?  My question relates to the money allocated for external advice.  Since the Government has declined to appoint a Deputy Attorney General and must seek external legal advice, why is it that in so doing it chooses to disregard the normal practice and legal requirement in every other sphere of competitive tendering for the procurement of professional advice?  Why is it that in the pursuit of external legal advice, competitive tendering is not engaged upon?</P>

      <P>When dealing with cases, Attorneys General will always try to get the best legal advice.  If three similar people can offer such advice, it is a matter for them to decide who to use and that is correct.  Normally, they use people in whom they have confidence and who they believe can do a capable job.  I am sure the Deputy would not object to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a Deputy Attorney General, I do not believe he or she could fulfil the role currently served by external legal advice.  It might be the case if he or she had a different background or experience or if they had been working in commercial law or some other area with which the <Col N="703" /> Attorney General was not familiar.  However, such advice is likely to be available from the staff in his office.  The Attorney General would only seek external advice when he believes he requires expertise or professional advice not available within his office.  In those cases, I believe Attorneys General are taking greater account of the costs.  They are not immune to the criticism in the national media and in this House of the legal fees in various tribunals in recent years.</P>

From whom did the Attorney General seek advice and what was the cost given that the official advice from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was that such legal advice was not necessary?</P>

      <P>Progress reports on the implementation of Partnership 2000 are produced quarterly by the Partnership 2000 secretariat in co-operation with all Government Departments and social partners.  The primary purpose of these progress reports is to facilitate the monitoring and review of the operation of the partnership agreement.  In future, I will arrange to have the reports, when finalised, laid before the House.</P>
      <P>In accordance with commitment 11.8 of Partnership 2000, the monitoring procedures for Partnership 2000 were reviewed following the NESF report No. 16 entitled, A Framework for Partnership &mdash; Enriching Strategic Consensus through Participation.  The Government announced on 19 December 1997 its decision to reconstitute both the NESC and the NESF on a statutory basis.  It is my intention to bring forward legislation later this year and in the interim both bodies will continue to operate on a non-statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the two bodies have been revised to ensure their activities are fully complementary.  The membership of both bodies has been changed to reflect more fully the various strands of the social partnership process.  Nominations for membership of NESC and NESF have been received from each of the social partner pillars and I expect both bodies will meet in the near future.</P>
      <P>The next quarterly Partnership 2000 monitoring meeting will take place on Monday, 27 April 1998.  Items on the agenda for the meeting include discussion on the sections of Partnership 2000 dealing with enterprise, jobs and small business, and agriculture and food.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to lay these reports before the House.  I was surprised to read a newspaper report which indicated the Government had failed to achieve an increase in participation from disadvantaged students at third level and as a Member was unable to get access to those reports.  Clearly those reports were being made available to the media but not to the Oireachtas.  That is a significant improvement.  Will the Taoiseach comment on the apparent dramatic failing in relation to attracting students from disadvantaged backgrounds to third level?  The figures suggest an increase of only 50 whereas my recollection was that each year there was to be an increase of 500. At the next Partnership 2000 monitoring meeting on 27 April will the Taoiseach consider adding to the agenda the whole issue of house prices?  The reality is that if house prices continue to spiral, the basis of partnership will be broken.  A person on the average industrial wage is not eligible for supports from public bodies either for public <Col N="705" /> housing or shared ownership and cannot possibly hope to purchase a house in the present housing climate.  This will be a serious problem in relation to the long-term survival of Partnership 2000.  At his initiative will the Taoiseach put on the next agenda of the monitoring group the question of addressing this issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To go into detail on either of those matters would not be in order except to say that the participation level over the years from the socially excluded areas or areas where the demographics indicate there are high levels of unemployment and social exclusion had, traditionally, been extremely low.  These are areas with which the Deputy and I are well acquainted. There are a number of initiatives in which the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, Minister of State, Deputy Kitt and the Minister for Education have been actively involved.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has tried to give further encouragement under a range of measures.  The Deputy will be aware of a number of the initiatives, on which they have answered questions recently.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the social partners have, as he has done, highlighted the issue of house prices.  The Bacon report will be available within two weeks and will be discussed here and elsewhere within the social partners.</P>

Is there an organic link between the relationship between NESF, NESC and the Cabinet subcommittee on drugs on social exclusion?  If not will he agree that such a relationship is desirable?</P>

      <P>Consultations with both bodies on their essential remit are completed.  I do not think draft legislation was considered, but certainly the structure, the remit, the distinction between the two bodies and the terms of reference of the two bodies have been set out so that both can follow their brief without duplication. NESC would continue to produce strategic studies as it has done in the past 14 or 15 years while NESF has been involved in the ground issues. Both remits are being discussed in detail with them, not in terms of legislation, but certainly the make up of the bodies and the distinctions between them.  Is the Deputy suggesting that draft heads of a Bill be considered?</P>

      <P>On the basis that the two bodies are part of the whole partnership body, it would be a nonsense to allow that to happen but I shall check the position.  The remit, structure and participation of both bodies was examined prior to Christmas.  I shall check on whether there are outstanding issues.  On the question of involvement of the organisations with the task force, the National Economic and Social Forum has been analysing the programme, Partnership 2000.  As far as Partnership 2000 is relevant, there is a direct link.  If it was not for something in Partnership 2000 there would probably be no link.  The chairperson of NESF has been anxious for a number of years, as have successive Governments, to ensure that agencies which are assisting any of the pillars, particularly the pillar of social exclusion, play a close role.  She has called most of the organisations in this area to the NESF to put their views and have a direct input to its reports.  That has proved useful in the past few reports.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the NESF and NESC have worked very well on a non-statutory basis which affords them a degree of flexibility and a capacity for organic growth? What is the point of putting them on a statutory basis which will build in the sort of rigidity into their membership which we have seen, for example, in the Seanad vocational panels where organisations which have virtually ceased to exist are represented and have nominating rights?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to give too short an answer but the Deputy raised this matter in the House in the autumn.  I took the line that this was the direction in which these organisations had been progressing for some time.  They were into a system in which there was an understanding with them that they were evolving and being placed on a statutory footing.  There is an argument in what the Deputy is saying about flexibility. That argument is proved in so far as NESF has changed quite an amount since it was established. However, this process has already moved on apace under this and the previous Administration. People in these organisations, and those who are a party to them, believed in this process. I have since raised these issues.  However, those involved in these organisations wish to see them placed on a statutory footing.  If that is the way we are to proceed it should not stop this House ensuring that we build in flexibility through the legislation.  I must remind Deputy Bruton that this process began while he was Taoiseach.</P>

I wish to return to the point I raised earlier concerning the relationship between the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Exclusion and Drugs and the NESF and NESC. Unless there is an organic link between these bodies and the policy decision makers in Cabinet one will find many gaps emerging in how Government deals with the issues.  These arise as a result of Partnership 2000 and many other initiatives and require urgent attention.  I raise this matter because it has been brought to my attention that the Shanty group in Tallaght made an approach to the Taoiseach's Department concerning a project it wished to promote which crossed many Departments.  The group was told that the Cabinet sub-committee does not take direct representations on specific projects.  I understand why this is the case but there is a requirement for a mechanism whereby groups can access the decision making process in a simple way.</P>

This evaluation <Col N="708" /> will try to ensure that the many agencies in the 13 local drugs task force areas spend the money in the best way.  We are also evaluating whether the service which is being provided is having an effect.  I believe it is but it must be properly evaluated.

These institutions wish to create a life of their own rather than provide a service.

      <P>The talks are at a crucial stage as we seek to reach agreement on the terms of a comprehensive settlement by the deadline of Thursday, 9 April. The parties and the Governments are meeting intensively in both bilateral and round table format with the able support of the independent chairmen and will be continuing to do so over the next week.  Despite the differences which still exist between the positions of the participants on a number of key issues, I continue to believe that, if there is sufficient political will and imagination, an historic settlement is achievable.</P>
      <P>The Government is making every effort to ensure this goal is reached.  Ultimately, however, the participants and the constituencies they represent can only support an agreement if it addresses all issues of concern to them in a balanced and comprehensive fashion.  What is required is a settlement which brings about fundamental change and a new beginning in all the key relationships.</P>
      <P>The need to demonstrate the primacy of politics and to face down the enemies of peace and agreement was underscored again last week-end by the brutal and obscene murder of Cyril Stewart in Armagh which I condemned at the talks no later than two days ago in the strongest and most unequivocal terms.</P>

      <P>I join the Minister in condemning in the strongest terms the murder of Mr. Stewart.  I hope the discussions bring about a cessation to this madness.  Will the Minister agree that far from contributing to resolving the existing problem the idea of having referenda every five years on the status of Northern Ireland will perpetuate it even if, as seems unlikely, some time in <Col N="710" /> the future the people of Northern Ireland vote to join with the Republic?  If this precedent is set, presumably further referenda would have to be held every five years to allow them to opt out again.

      <P>It arose from a reasonable question put to the Taoiseach in Ballyconnell where he addressed the Anglo-Irish Interparliamentary Union.  The Taoiseach said in response that it was not part of the talks.  The Deputy asked whether provision should be made for regular polls.  Provision is made in the Northern Ireland Constitution Act, 1973, for polls of this kind.  While I share the Taoiseach's view that a continuing mechanism to test opinion from time to time would be necessary, it would not be helpful, as the Deputy properly pointed out, if such polls were conducted on a frequent basis.  The first priority must be to ensure all the institutions and arrangements established in a settlement are bedded down and work to their full potential for the benefit of all.</P>

We will do everything we can to ensure public support for any reasonable outcome to the discussions.

      <P>It did not come from the top of the Taoiseach's head.  Provision is made in the Northern Ireland Constitution Act, 1973, for polls of the kind the Taoiseach was contemplating.  He did not consult with me.  He would have had to anticipate the question which was an appropriate one put by a journalist who was seeking information. I am deeply grateful to the Deputy for wishing all the participants in the talks process every success.  The prize is immense.  A positive outcome will settle the problem on the island of Ireland for generations to come.  I am deeply grateful to the parties opposite for their continuing support for what we all seek to achieve in the name of peace and Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Government has yet to finalise the wording of possible amendments to <Col N="711" /> the Constitution which might be proposed in the context of an overall agreement.  No specific texts have yet been tabled for discussion in the negotiations. We have consistently made it clear, however, that any amendments will be consistent with the various commitments and undertakings made by us in the Joint Declaration and Framework Document.</P>
      <P>We have also made it clear that we will only be prepared to propose amendments in the context of a balanced and comprehensive overall agreement which brings about fundamental change and a new beginning in all our relationships.  It is first the Oireachtas and then, decisively, the people who will decide whether to approve any proposals we may make.  The Government will offer amendments to the Constitution in appropriate circumstances and the people will then decide.</P>

      <P>We are working on the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth draft of the proposed amendment.  The Taoiseach has given an undertaking to consult with the leaders of the Opposition parties when the final draft is available.  It is intended to amend Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. The ratification Article, Article 29, would also require to be amended.  People outside the family of Fianna Fáil are equally concerned about Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. The House will be kept informed.  More particularly, the leaders of the main political parties will be contacted when the draft has been finalised.</P>

    <P>I assure the Deputy that the date of the referendum has not yet been decided.  It has been suggested that the referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam should be held at the same time as the proposed referendum on the Constitution in the event of a satisfactory conclusion to negotiations on Thursday next.  I am subject to the collective decision of Government, but I would like to see both referenda being held on separate days.  The Treaty of Amsterdam is complex and complicated and I do not think it would do justice <Col N="712" /> to what we seek to achieve to add further complex and complicated issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My official visit to the People's Republic of China from 24 to 28 February enabled me discuss with the Chinese leadership a wide range of issues concerning both bilateral relations and international developments.  In the course of my visit I had extensive discussions with the then Prime Minister, Mr. Li Peng, and the then Foreign Minister, Mr. Qian Qichen.  I also met four vice-Ministers responsible for trade and industry.</P>
      <P>The visit, which took place on the eve of a major congress in China and in the immediate aftermath of a decision by the EU Council of Ministers to increase dialogue with China and intensify efforts to improve human rights in that country, provided the opportunity for very useful exchanges of views as well as achieving concrete results.</P>
      <P>In all my discussions the issue of human rights figured prominently and I made clear our concerns on this score.  I informed the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of the most recent developments in the EU, especially with regard to the decision of the Council of Ministers not to table a draft resolution on China at this year's session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Much still remains to be achieved in the context of human rights in China.  Several developments have taken place over the past year which have given rise to hopes for improvement. Among the positive steps which have been taken by the Chinese authorities are: resumption of the EU-China human rights dialogue &mdash; since last October three substantive meetings between the two sides have taken place and a package of practical measures to assist the development of human rights in China is being put together in this context; the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, has been formally invited to visit China and I understand that she will be doing so in September; the prominent political dissident, Wei Jingsheng, was released from prison last November; the Chinese authorities last year granted access to the UN working group on arbitrary detention; China has signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and has just recently indicated its intention to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Furthermore, China has agreed to the holding of the first ever EU-China summit meeting which is due to take place in London tomorrow.  I understand that the question of human rights in China will be a significant issue at that meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evident that, taken together, these changes <Col N="713" /> reflect a greater willingness on the part of China to maintain a dialogue on human rights issues. However, the fact that Ireland and other states will not be tabling a resolution on China at this year's session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva does not preclude us from doing so next year if circumstances change.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wish to be aware that my meeting on 25 February with the then Foreign Minister, Mr. Qian Qichen, was perhaps the most substantive during my official visit to China.  In addition to the question of human rights, I raised a wide range of issues with him including trade relations, Hong Kong, the Asian financial crisis, prospects for the Asia-Europe Meeting, or ASEM, which will take place in London next week, the situation in the Korean peninsula and Tibet.  I had detailed talks on the question of Tibet and the Foreign Minister did not resile from my robust intervention.  I furthermore took the opportunity to brief him on the situation in Northern Ireland.  Some of the issues on which progress has been made will be the subject of further discussions at a meeting in London later this week between the Taoiseach and the new Chinese Prime Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the new view of the EU General Affairs Council is that the best way of advancing the cause of human rights in the People's Republic of China is not to move the annual human rights motion at the UN but to pursue the route outlined?  Will the Minister say on what premise such a sea change is based?  Why do the Minister and the other Ministers of the General Affairs Council believe this new approach will be more beneficial in terms of improving human rights in China?  Has the decision more to do with the breakdown in solidarity and the fact that some member states saw a greater advantage in pursuing their trade needs than in pursuing human rights in the traditional manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason for us adopting this position in relation to the resolution was outlined in my response to the question.  As far the Government is concerned there has been no policy change in relation to human rights in China. Our objective remains that of highlighting the abuse of human rights where it occurs and to take appropriate action on a bilateral basis and at multilateral fora such as the UN Commission for Human Rights in Geneva to secure improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year no draft resolution was put forward by the EU, although Ireland cosponsored one with some of our partners.  We made it clear that our approach to a possible draft resolution at this year's session was dependent on positive action by China in a number of specific areas.  My reply outlined the action to date taken by China in the light of which we do not intend cosponsoring a draft resolution this year.  Our EU partners are adopting a similar position.  However, this does <Col N="714" /> not preclude us from doing so next year if circumstances change.  I think this is the proper approach in the context of what myself and others seek to achieve in China and of megaphone diplomacy. The Chinese authorities should be given an opportunity to take action.  We can also see whether some actions already taken are empty gestures or movements in the right direction in the context of human rights.</P>
    <P>We are not happy with the regrettable human rights situation in China.  The Chinese authorities should be given an opportunity to improve human rights in the context of what they are doing, the manner in which they have received people such as myself and the manner in which they are prepared to explore ways of improving such rights.  This does not suggest our policy has changed.  If the position in China does not improve we will revisit the matter next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that Denmark, which moved the motion, was treated harshly in terms of trade contracts which they had with China and that this buckled the knees of other Foreign Ministers who felt that if they did not fall in line their countries would be treated in a similar manner?  Will the Minister ensure that the General Affairs Council keeps this matter under review and takes the most effective course of advocating proper standards of human rights in China, irrespective of the threats made against EU member states regarding trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the Deputy's point of view.  He is correct and I promise that as long as I am at the General Affairs Council I will keep the matter under constant observation.  I made a number of strong interventions on that subject and other issues concerning human rights at the Council.  Human rights abuses do not only relate to China.  Human rights abuses have become almost endemic throughout what might be described as the &ldquo;civilised world&rdquo;, for want of a better description.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>whether he supports the imposition of further economic sanctions on Serbia as a means of pressurising the authorities to cease their repressive actions in Kosovo.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8280/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the situation in Kosovo and the violent incidents which have arisen there since the end of February.  Together with our EU partners, we have condemned unreservedly the violent repression of peaceful expressions of political <Col N="715" /> views, including peaceful demonstrations, by the Serb authorities as well as the use of violence and terrorism by the ethnic Albanians to achieve political ends.  In our statement of 2 March, we called on the parties to exercise restraint and to resolve the situation through dialogue.  However, the cycle of violence continued in early March leading to a large number of deaths, including those of women and children.</P>
      <P>I will outline the steps being taken by the international community with our support to attempt to defuse the immediate crisis, bring about full respect of human rights in Kosovo and prevent overspill effects in the neighbouring countries.  In spite of the insistence of the Belgrade authorities that Kosovo, as an integral part of Serbia, is an internal issue in which the international community cannot interfere, it is absolutely clear that the abuse of human rights in Kosovo and the threat to peace and security in the region are matters of direct and legitimate concern to the international community.</P>
      <P>In fact, in recent weeks a number of international bodies have been seized of the issue.  In addition to the involvement of the EU, which I will describe, the United Nations Security Council yesterday adopted a resolution on the issue and there has been detailed consideration by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the OSCE, which has appointed Mr. Felipe Gonzalez, former Prime Minister of Spain, as special representative of the Chairman-in-Office. Mr. Gonzalez has also been mandated by the EU to act as its special envoy.  In both cases, the brief of Mr. Gonzalez not only covers democratisation matters but has been expressly extended to include Kosovo.  I understand that confidence-building measures for neighbouring states, Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, are under active consideration in NATO, among other institutions.</P>
      <P>On 5 March the President in office of the EU, Foreign Minister Cook, encountered considerable resistance in Belgrade to any international involvement.  In response to this negative reaction and also to appeals from the ethnic Albanian leadership for international involvement, the Contact Group of Foreign Ministers, which, in addition to four EU states, includes Russia and the United States, was convened on 9 March.</P>
      <P>The Contact Group called for negotiations between the sides, a range of actions by international agencies and the introduction of a certain number of sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, accompanied by a warning that further measures would be taken if the Belgrade authorities did not take immediate action to end repressive acts in Kosovo and enter into genuine dialogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Conference, comprising the 15 EU member states and the Commission, together with the 11 applicant states, had its inaugural meeting in London on 12 March at summit level. The Taoiseach and I fully supported the decision <Col N="716" /> of the conference to maintain strong pressure on Belgrade.  At the informal meeting of the EU Foreign Ministers in Edinburgh on 13 and 14 March, which I attended, it was agreed that immediate action be taken within the EU to implement these sanctions.  A common position of the Union, providing the legal base for implementing these measures was adopted by the Council on 19 March.</P>
    <P>The sanctions cover four areas: an embargo on arms sales, which in effect confirms an existing prohibition in the case of the EU and which now through the Security Council resolution adopted yesterday is extended to all states; a ban on the sale of goods which could be used in internal repression or for terrorism; a moratorium on government-financed export credit for trade and investment, including government financing for privatisations in Serbia, and a ban on visas for senior FRY and Serbian representatives responsible for repressive action by FRY security forces in Kosovo.</P>
    <P>The question of further sanctions will be considered by the international community if the present unsatisfactory situation persists and if the FRY authorities refuse to comply with its demands.  They have been told that they must control their security forces, ensure that they refrain from the use of force against innocent persons and act in accordance with internationally accepted standards.  The FRY authorities must also enter into a genuine dialogue and negotiations with the ethnic Albanians, also known as &ldquo;Kosovars&rdquo;.  It is equally important that extremists on the Albanian side should not be allowed to undermine the work and role of Dr. Rugova and his associates, who pursue the course of non-violence. It is furthermore important that people sympathetic to the Kosovar cause should not be misled into supporting advocates of violence, namely, the so-called Kosovar Liberation Army.</P>
    <P>Against a generally grim background, I should point out that the signing of an agreement on 23 March by the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians to implement finally the measures of the Education Agreement of 1996, which had its origins in Rome and which will allow the ethnic Albanian students to return to state educational facilities, does provide a small beacon of light.  A further positive element is the constructive attitude being shown by neighbouring countries to date.  Were this co-operation not present, any overspill from Kosovo might set off an incalculable and disastrous chain reaction among some or all of them.</P>
    <P>It is now incumbent on the political leadership of both sides to enter into negotiations without preconditions.  They should do so with urgency and particularly in order to use to the full the time available before the next meeting of the contact group.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday, 25 March, the Contact Group, meeting in Bonn, while considering that the Belgrade authorities had made an insufficient response to their demands of 9 March, deferred a decision on the imposition of further measures <Col N="717" /> for a period of four weeks.  Since then, and in order not to leave Belgrade in any doubt about the EU's approach and seriousness of intent, the EU Council of Ministers last Monday underlined that the measures set out in its common position of 19 March would not be lifted, and that others would need to be considered unless the requirements specified by the contact group were met in full.</P>
    <P>The resolution of the United Nations Security Council adopted yesterday, which substantially endorses the approaches set down by the contact group, the EU and the OSCE, is an indication of the determination of the international community to make progress on the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the four sanctions referred to will not have the same effect as economic sanctions?  I am aware that economic sanctions can affect innocent people and I certainly do not want to suggest that the EU should inflict any pain on innocent Serbian people.  However, will the Minister inform the House whether economic sanctions are being considered as a reserve or fall back situation if the four sanctions he outlined are not effective? Does the Minister agree that the Serbian President Milosevic leads an administration guilty of thuggery and bullying and that the only thing which thugs and bullies understand is to be confronted with their actions?  Does the Minister agree that the success achieved to date in the former Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, has been brought about simply because people stood up to President Milosevic?  Is it the intention of the international community, particularly the UN, to ensure this continues to be the case in future?  Do Ireland and the EU have a contingency plan in regard to Kosovo?  It seems to me that of all the regions in Europe, it is the one which has the greatest potential for explosion and it seems quite possible that we could anticipate a possible further genocide in the region.  I would like to know whether contingency arrangements have been put in place by the EU and the Irish Government in terms of humanitarian aid and peace enforcement should such an eventuality come to pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that economic sanctions should be the last resort because, as is the case in Iraq, the direct result is that ordinary people suffer. They are being considered but I would counsel caution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the thuggery of Mr. Milosevic, it is well known that he is a bully.  Bullies are cowards, regardless of the profession or trade they <Col N="718" /> pursue, and they remain cowards.  This individual has done terrible things, to say the least, and he must and will be confronted.  The attitude of the General Affairs Council meeting in Edinburgh, which I attended and to which I contributed, indicated a strong will and intention, particularly on the part of the four representatives on the contact group, to stand up to this individual.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to contingency plans.  If the Security Council, at the request of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, authorises an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo and if Ireland were asked to contribute, the request would be considered.  Personally, I have no objection to such a force if it was proposed and agreed to by the international community and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  However, it is unlikely.  The difficulty is that Milosevic and his cohorts are not co-operating with the international community.  They see the efforts of the United Nations, the EU and others to take a legitimate international interest in Kosovo as interference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the priority attached by the Government to observance of human rights, we have been active on a wide range of issues where violations of rights have been involved.</P>
      <P>We met the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Robinson, and discussed a wide range of shared human rights concerns with her on a number of occasions since 11 November last, when the Minister of State and I met the High Commissioner in Dublin and offered our full support, and that of the Irish Government, in her efforts to promote universal human rights standards throughout the world. That message has been reiterated on a number of occasions since then, for example, on 27 November last when the Minister of State had a detailed exchange of views and information with the High Commissioner in Geneva and, more recently, when Mrs. Robinson came to Dublin to give the keynote address at the inaugural NGO forum on human rights in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, on 7 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have taken account of the concerns expressed by the High Commissioner in our efforts to promote and protect human rights at EU and UN level, particularly in the context of the UN Commission on Human Rights, the 54th <Col N="719" /> session of which is currently taking place in Geneva.  I will briefly outline our priorities for this session of the commission, of which Ireland is currently a member.  The issues with which we are concerned have a broad thematic and geographic spread.</P>
    <P>We are taking the lead in sponsoring resolutions on, first, the human rights of persons with disabilities and, second, the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance and of discrimination based on religion.  Ireland was the first co-sponsor of a resolution on the total abolition of capital punishment.  This reflected the support given by us to this important initiative in recent years.  It is envisaged that this year's resolution will be adopted with an increased level of support.</P>
    <P>With our European partners, Ireland will sponsor resolutions on human rights in Iran, Iraq, Burma, Nigeria, East Timor and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, among others.  We also actively support the efforts of the High Commissioner to extend the mandate of the UNHCHR office in Colombia for a further year. The EU Presidency will express, on behalf of the member states, our common concern about human rights violations in a number of other countries, including Afghanistan, Belarus, Bhutan, Burundi, Cambodia, North Korea, Turkey, Rwanda, Kenya, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and the western Balkan states.</P>
    <P>The European Union will also note the important developments which have taken place with regard to human rights in China.  These developments are the subject of other questions I am answering today.  It is worth mentioning, however, China's acceptance of the principle of universality and its growing integration in the UN human rights system, such as the signature and proposed ratification of the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights and its announced intention to sign the international covenant on civil and political rights.  These represent important advances.  The release of Wei Jingsheng, the continuing dialogue on human rights with the EU and the forthcoming visit of the High Commissioner are further encouraging signs.  Ireland, with its EU partners, views the current session of the commission as an opportunity to encourage further constructive engagement between China and ourselves on human rights issues.</P>
    <P>The situation in Algeria is particularly worrying and the EU is working in tandem with other concerned countries to arrive at an approach which offers the best possibility of bringing to an end the barbaric killings in that country.  Discussions are continuing on how best to achieve Algerian agreement to early visits by the UN special rapporteurs on torture and extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions.</P>
    <P>It now appears likely that the commission will adopt a declaration on human rights defenders. This would represent the culmination of 13 years' <Col N="720" /> work by the international community.  Its adoption, which will be welcomed by all those active in the field of human rights, is a most fitting way to mark the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Building on what is achieved at the current session, Ireland will intensify its efforts to promote the observance of human rights standards worldwide. In partnership with EU member states and other like-minded countries, and in close co-operation with the office of the High Commissioner and other UN agencies, we will continue to voice our concerns and to work for concerted international pressure to achieve the elimination of human rights abuses wherever they occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister envisage the possibility of establishing an ongoing mechanism within the EU or the UN whereby a more dramatic response might be made to the human rights abuses to which the High Commissioner referred?  The abuses continue indefinitely.  To what degree can Ireland, as an EU member state, and the United Nations respond in a way which will have a more immediate impact on the perpetrators of such abuses than is the case at present?  I am conscious of the difficulties that exist in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  There appears to be a terribly slow response internationally to human rights abuses.  If there was quicker response, there would not be so much abuse.</P>
      <P>However, we are involved in an initiative which might be of interest to the Deputy.  Ireland has worked and continues to work for the establishment of an international criminal court which will constitute a powerful and impartial instrument of justice in the field of international humanitarian law.  Ireland supports the early establishment of an independent and effective court and will be represented at the United Nations diplomatic conference being held in Rome from 15 June to 17 July 1998 to finalise and adopt a convention on the establishment of the court.</P>
      <P>The court relates to human rights crimes. Whereas the list of crimes which fall within the jurisdiction of the court has yet to be finalised, there appears to be widespread acceptance that it should be given jurisdiction to deal with crimes of exceptional gravity and depth.  Most states, including Ireland, agree that the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and exceptionally serious war crimes should come within the remit of the court. The importance of the establishment of the court is that it will be a valuable instrument in ensuring that those who commit such crimes, many of which represent serious breaches of human rights, cannot do so with impunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy would welcome that development.  I agree there is a problem in this regard, as one can see in cases such as Algeria and East Timor, where there has been trouble <Col N="721" /> since 1976.  There have been developments in East Timor in the recent past but they are not acceptable by the standards of what we seek to achieve, which is the recognition that human rights abuses occur and the need to ensure that human rights abuses, wherever they occur, come to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of great satisfaction to me that we have further significant increases in Ireland's Official Development Assistance &mdash; ODA &mdash; budget for 1998.  Expenditure on the programme this year is expected to reach a record £137 million or 0.32 per cent of GNP.  The budget increase will permit not only an expansion of the programme but also, and more importantly, qualitative change and improvement.  This relates to all elements of our programme including multilateral assistance, bilateral assistance to the priority countries for Irish aid and other bilateral assistance.</P>
      <P>Specifically with regard to Ireland's role in development projects the Irish aid programme has concentrated on priority programmes of co-operation with six countries in Africa, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.  In 1998 the allocation for the priority countries programmes is £43 million, 33 per cent more than the level for last year.  Ireland is now well on the way to becoming a medium-sized donor to the countries concerned.  We have become increasingly involved in initiatives with the partner governments and with other donors to improve and make more efficient the overall aid effort in the countries concerned.  A case in point is the development of a coherent sectoral approach to aid allocation.</P>
      <P>The essential focus of the Irish aid programme is on the eradication of poverty through meeting basic needs such as access to primary health care, clean water supply, food security and basic education. In addition there is particular emphasis in each of our priority countries on helping to create the right environment to ensure development activities can be continued by the relevant communities and authorities.  This means that we place great importance on fostering democracy, respect for human rights, gender and social equity and capacity building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to our spending on priority country programmes there are smaller programmes of assistance in other countries, chiefly South Africa, the Palestinian territories, Zimbabwe and Sudan.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, visited South Africa briefly over the period coinciding with St Patrick's Day.  The Irish aid <Col N="722" /> programme in South Africa continues to focus on the needs of disadvantaged communities with priority attaching to the sectors of human rights and democratisation, capacity building, education and training, health and rural and community development.</P>
    <P>Irish aid continues to respond as speedily and effectively as possible to humanitarian crises.  In the past six months assistance to the amount of £3.6 million went to alleviate the effects of natural disasters and conflict-related emergencies. The El Nino phenomenon has had a devastating effect in terms of drought or severe flooding in a number of countries and support has been given to vulnerable groups in, for example, Tanzania, Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Honduras and the island of New Guinea.  Ireland has also played its part with the international community in meeting the urgent food needs of the people of the Democratic Republic of North Korea.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately large numbers of people continue to suffer because of conflict and war and support has been channelled to those in need in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Angola.  In addition, we continue to meet the basic humanitarian needs of genocide survivors and returned refugees in Rwanda.  In societies recovering from conflict, Irish aid finances rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes and projects.  A total of £4 million was allocated to this type of assistance in 1997, mainly in Bosnia, Rwanda and countries such as Angola and Somalia.</P>
    <P>Humanitarian mine clearance is a priority in a number of countries if people are to return to normal lives as quickly as possible and Ireland is supporting demining programmes in Angola, Cambodia and Chechnya.</P>
    <P>There are also significant developments in relation to the other components of our bilateral assistance.  New guidelines aimed at strengthening the partnership with non-governmental organisations were introduced in 1997 on a pilot basis. Based on experience with their implementation, revisions are currently taking place in consultation with NGOs with a view to enhancing their effectiveness and consolidating the partnership.</P>
    <P>In addition to the human rights and democratisation focus within the individual priority country programmes, there has been a sizeable increase in the budget for support for human rights projects in other countries, from £0.868 million in 1997 to £1.25 million this year.  This substantial increase will enable us to expand our activities in this area in this year of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response and congratulate him on the increase in funding in 1998.  Is the Minister satisfied the money is going to the area of need and is used efficaciously?  What mechanism is in place to ensure that is done?  Will the Minister outline how the projects or relief operations are identified and prioritised?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his question. The 1998 budget for the priority countries, the six countries to which I have referred, is: Ethiopia, £12.4 million; Lesotho, £4.4 million; Mozambique, £5 million; Tanzania, £9.8 million; Uganda, £6 million and Zambia, £5.8 million.  Distinguishing between good intentions and good results, on the outcome achieved as a result of Irish aid expenditure, no stone is left unturned in finding ways of increasing programme impact. There is a rigorous programme evaluation of all expenditure.  The development sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Irish Aid Advisory Committee help to sharpen our policy approaches.  We consult constantly with other donors, NGOs and, most importantly, people from developing countries. There is an ongoing effort to make our programmes conform to the best practices and guidelines of the development assistance committees of the OECD.</P>
      <P>Ireland, with our EU partners, has taken a strong human rights position, for example, in the governance of Zambia.  We repeatedly expressed deep concern about the state of emergency imposed following the attempted coup in October 1997 and urged that it be lifted as soon as possible. That is an example of a constructive approach to democratisation and the democratic nature of the country to which we subscribe.  We are entitled to make a call in that regard and have done so, particularly in regard to the position in Zambia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the position in Ireland, will the Minister agree it would be justified to spend some of the funding assisting those from the countries he has named and others to overcome the racism they experience here and to equip those who are repatriated to go back to their countries in a condition that enables them to take up useful employment?  Not all the money must be spent in the jurisdiction of those countries; some of it could be spent on the citizens of those countries who continue to suffer while resident here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as much a question of money as an attitude of mind.  Given that we experienced a huge emigration problem, particularly during the famine years, we must take account of our obligations to people who are the victims of abuse and lack human rights in their own countries, who are refugees because of lack of democracies in their own countries.  Our attitude of mind, however, should not stop us from helping countries, for example, as I outlined in response to Deputy Callely's question.  We have an absolute obligation to ensure refugees are here legitimately.  We are entitled to examine their bona fides and, having done that, we should warmly welcome them.  It is our attitude of mind that should change, and that should in no way interfere with our overseas aid programme as <Col N="724" /> outlined in part in response to Deputy Callely's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of an outbreak of racism &mdash; I am not attributing it to any Member &mdash; among the public in that quite racist comments have been made?  As I walked towards my home last night I met two men who made their point in a fashion which was not unreasonable, but the content of what they had to say was.  As regards humanitarian aid, does he agree we should think not only in terms of assisting citizens in their home states but also citizens who are suffering here?  Perhaps we might use some of this humanitarian aid to promote greater racial co-operation and understanding between communities.</P>
      <P>There is potential for a serious problem in this city given some of the comments I have heard and which have gone unchallenged.  I am not talking about comments made by politicians but by some of our so-called sober citizens.  Such comments are alarming and something must be done to ensure we use the opportunity to promote understanding and good communal relations between citizens and those visiting here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Where possible, we should be able to integrate these people in our society.  Like the Deputy, I condemn racism in any form as it is a manifestation of a prejudice based on ignorance. I speak on behalf of the Government when I condemn it without reservation.  On funds being made available to the six priority countries in Africa, if people believe they are not welcome in those countries and come to this country, we should make additional funds available to them to ensure they are made welcome if they are here legitimately.  Our diaspora is spread far and wide throughout the world and we should reciprocate in kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>On the six priority countries to which the Minister referred, will he forward a breakdown of how the finance is being spent?  Is it being spent on long-term projects and what beneficial results will arise from such projects or is it a short-term emergency response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>These are long-term projects and not a response to an emergency.  I would be glad to give the Deputy a breakdown of the amounts which go to each project.  We have been successful in helping these countries with such projects on a long-term basis, and long may we continue to do so.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the answers I gave to Priority Questions Nos. 11 and 12.  If there is agreement by next week's deadline of 9 April, it should be possible to hold referenda both North and South in May.  We would certainly wish referenda to be held with no unnecessary delay.  As the Deputy will be aware, there are various constitutional and statutory requirements to be met, in particular the need for a period of at least 30 days to elapse between the passage of a referendum Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas and holding a referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended to hold two referenda on Articles 2 and 3 and a separate question on acceptance of the agreement?  The Minister has expressed a personal view that he would prefer these referenda to be held separately from that on the Amsterdam Treaty.  I also believe that, on balance, they should be held separately because there will be confusion about sovereignty issues which will arise in the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty and those on Articles 2 and 3 and the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy on the latter question; we are <i>ad idem</i> on that.  On the question of the final peace package, in the South only Articles 2 and 3 will be put to the people in one package and the question will be asked on its own in the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the thinking, if any, on the funding of such referenda in the light of the McKenna judgment?  Is it his view, as it is mine, that the process proposed for the Amsterdam Treaty is inadequate in that an independent commission will present the case for and against it, that there is likely to be much passion involved in the debate on Articles 2 and 3 and that parties which support the agreement should be able to campaign effectively on these issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We are bound by the McKenna judgment and, to a greater or lesser degree, by the Hanafin judgment.  I agree the referendum on Articles 2 and 3 will be emotional for some people and that the funding arrangement would in no way obstruct the Deputy or Government Ministers in letting their views be known on the direction or position which they would urge the people to take on Articles 2 and 3 in the event of an amendment based on a peace package.  There is the difficulty which the Deputy pointed out and which will have to remain because we are bound by the Supreme Court decision.</P>

      <P>I would appreciate receiving a copy of that note.  The Minister will be aware that I do not support this idea of a referendum commission because we would have to fund arguments for and against the outcome of the Northern Ireland process and it was a mistake to introduce it in relation to the Amsterdam Treaty. On the proposal which presumably will be put to amend or delete Articles 2 and 3, what will happen if the referendum north of the Border is not carried?  Will the wording allow for something to happen in the event of agreement north of the Border?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the recommendation from the Commission of the European Community, pursuant to Article 109j of the Treaty establishing the European Community done at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957 (as amended by the Treaty on European Union done at Maastricht on the 7th day of February, 1992), concerning the fulfilment by Ireland of the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash; (Minister for Finance)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating the adoption of the euro which has been described as one of the most important economic events in the history of the State.  This is why I focused before the debate was adjourned on the information deficit and the need to close this gap.  This matter must be tackled quickly.  The Minister referred to the four convergence criteria.  I do not criticise him for the language he uses as he must be careful, but he referred to the observance of the normal fluctuation margins of the exchange rate mechanism and the durability of convergence as reflected in long-term interest rates.  The public does not understand such language and the Government must take up the task of translating it and communicating it to the public.</P>
      <P>Last year a booklet was issued on the euro. One of the rhetorical questions posed in the booklet was: &ldquo;I could lose money if banks and shops cheat in converting from my currency to the euro&rdquo;.  The answer given was: &ldquo;Don't worry, there will be plenty of price charts around to enable you to check on conversions&rdquo;.  How definite would those who compiled the booklet be on this point post-NIB?  God bless their naivety and innocence pre-NIB that there was no problem with shops or banks cheating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with the more serious issue of inflation and the reduction in the number of instruments available to the Minister to cope with <Col N="728" /> this.  This is a matter of serious concern but it has not been dealt with adequately by the Minister. The headline in today's edition of <i>The Examiner</i> states: &ldquo;Bank to stop interest rate cuts before EMU begins&rdquo;.  The Central Bank sees the dangers of inflation.  The Minister's approach to this issue has been incorrect and far too cavalier.  He said he does not see any need to revise his budget forecast for CPI inflation of 2 per cent for this year and 2 per cent for next year.  Is he aware that the Governor of the Central Bank disagrees with him as of last week?  The Governor of the Central Bank is talking about a rate of inflation for the current year which is more than one-third higher than that forecast by the Minister and reiterated in his speech.  The Government has adopted a head in the sand approach to this problem, to which it contributed.  The Government knew last December that we had a booming economy and that the strength of sterling would lead to imported inflation.  It also knew that interest rates would be reduced.  The Governor of the Central Bank stated in his report that everything possible will be done to prevent interest rates being reduced before the end of the year.  However, there will be convergence at the end of the year. While one can delay the inevitable, it will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I criticised proposals in the budget, wearing my social affairs hat, because they focused on greed rather than need.  I thought at the time that they were wrong from a social point of view, but it is now clear that they were also wrong from an economic point of view because they fuelled an overheated economy.  I am referring to the substantial cut in the top rate of tax and the halving of capital gains tax.  This was like throwing petrol on an economic fire.  We have already seen the consequences of this in the ISEQ index which was approximately 3,700 before the budget and is now zooming towards 6,000.  It is 5,250 today and I bet it will hit 6,000 before the end of the year.  This represents an increase of more than 50 per cent in the value of the Stock Exchange and it is largely related to the reduction in capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>To use a cliché, house prices are going through the roof.  This has been contributed to by the budgetary measures.  One may ask what is the problem with this.  While the increase in house prices does not feed directly into the CPI, it will affect it indirectly as workers who cannot afford to buy a house will press their unions for more wages so that they can do so.  This increase is very dangerous to the economy in an indirect way and it has been contributed to by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal with this matter properly in his speech.  Having contributed to the present problem, the Minister did not set out any policy for dealing with it.  He did not even refer to the Central Bank's forecast for inflation which is one-third higher than his forecast.  The delay in the interest rate reductions will affect mortgage holders.  However, this option runs out at the end of the year.  What will happen after that?  Will there be cuts in expenditure?  I have seen no commitment <Col N="729" /> by the Government to do this.  Will tax cuts be deferred?  The Minister should tell us his policy in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal in sufficient detail with the impact on our economy of sterling remaining outside EMU.  This is exceptionally important from the point of view of inflation.  The exchange rate is 81p at present and my advice is that it will go even lower.  The pressures in the UK will be such that the Government there will have to change its policy.  This will be to our benefit, but it is outside our control.  What steps is the Government taking to react to the impact of sterling fluctuating against the punt and euro?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his revaluation of the punt.  This is like looking at the entrails of a goose and trying to decide what is best.  I do not criticise him for this, but perhaps his decision was taken too late.  While he probably adopted the right approach, experts differ and the economy suffers. I am not an expert on this matter and while the Minister probably made the right decision he should have made it earlier.  A report in a major newspaper says that the Minister was forced to make a decision.  However, one would think from his speech that it was a carefully considered approach.  Is it true that the revaluation was forced on us by European institutions?  If so, the Minister should be up front and tell us.  It is not proper that we should be given an impression which may be false.  This newspaper &mdash; I think it was <i>The Sunday Times</i>&mdash; has a reputation for accurate reporting.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on that.</P>
    <P>The next question concerns the millennium bug and one might ask what that has to do with the euro.  The Minister did not refer to this matter but it is important because we are making a major change which will have an impact throughout our economy.  Ultimately it will have an impact on the changeover of our currency and that will affect all our computers as well as machines which deal in cash, including public telephones, yet we have not taken this millennium bug into account.  The UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said this problem should be treated as a civil emergency.</P>
    <P>It seems we are keeping our heads in the sand over this issue.  If there is a problem we should face up to it but by ignoring the problem the Minister is doing a disservice to the country.  The changeover coincides with the new millennium and the problems of the millennium bug.  How are we to have a smooth, effective changeover if we are confronted with this problem?</P>
    <P>The Minister should deal with this issue which he does not seem to recognise.  When the leader of my party, Deputy Bruton, raised this matter in the Dáil yesterday the Taoiseach reassured everybody by telling us the matter was being dealt with by the central unit in the Department of Finance, the same Department which drafted the Minister's speech for today's debate, yet the problem was not even mentioned in that speech.  One wonders whether that particular loose end will be tied up by the Minister in his reply to this debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> Another issue of policy that has not been touched on is the question of the future of the euro and our policy in that regard.  It might be said that we are a small member state and that we will not have a major influence on that but we should at least know what we want.  According to some reports the euro may be a soft currency.  We all worked on the basis that the Germans would only agree to the introduction of a hard currency such as the deutschmark, but political considerations overcame economic considerations and we now find that the Belgians and the Italians are in the club despite the fact that they do not qualify according to any strict interpretation of the Maastricht criteria.  I am not making a complaint.  Politically it was probably the right thing to do but we should at least face up to the consequences of that political decision which may be that this hard currency, which would compete with the dollar and the yen in the global currency markets, is not what we thought it would be.</P>
    <P>I do not want to ring alarm bells but it is important that questions are asked and addressed.  Will we ignore this problem?  Will it be a problem for us if the euro currency is relatively soft as opposed to the hard currency to which we hitched our wagon?  I am concerned that we are allowing ourselves to be the victim of circumstances.  I fully realise that in European circles we do not have a loud voice but we have a voice and we are listened to if we have something to say.  We cannot have anything to say, however, if we do not have a policy and we cannot have a policy unless we are aware of the problems. I am concerned that in regard to a number of important policy issues the Government does not seem to realise there are questions to be addressed and, therefore, it does not have the policy options to deal with them.</P>
    <P>In general I support EMU and look forward to seeing the euro in circulation.  Despite the fact that I am a committed Europhile I am not starryeyed. Decisions will be made at European level in the broader interests of Europe.  Some of those decisions may not necessarily be in our best individual interest.  From the point of view of the development of EMU and the institution of the new currency, it is important that we are aware of the problems, that we calculate our best policy options and endeavour to achieve those objectives.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Government is drifting headlong into the new system carried by a tide of public support but not appreciating the rocks in the channel.  The Government will be unable to take the necessary evasive action to avoid those rocks and in some instances, as in the case of inflation, may contribute to hitting them.  That is why I do not have complete confidence in EMU and in transferring over to the euro.</P>

      <P>European monetary union is probably the single most important economic development in this country since the end of protectionism in the l950s and early l960s.  It is probably <Col N="731" /> the single most important political development in this country since the establishment of the State and certainly since our accession to the then EEC in l972.</P>

It could and should provide the foundation for economic and political stability and growth but it carries within itself the seeds of potential disharmony and inequality.  EMU is an economic challenge but, above all, it is a political imperative.</P>
      <P>Europe has been the centre of much that was both good and bad in the 20th century.  We have provided an unprecedented standard of living for most of our people.  We have developed social provision &mdash; health, education, housing and employment &mdash; to a level not known before in recorded history.  Yet at the same time we have twice sown the seeds of our own destruction in wars which saw the deaths or dislocation of a huge number of Europeans.  That capacity for good and evil still exists and we need look no further than Yugoslavia today to see just how fragile democracy and indeed civilisation can be.</P>
      <P>It is worth remembering and repeating that the political imperative behind the establishment of the then Coal and Steel Community in the l950s was to prevent the recurrence of war.  It is important, even in the l990s, that we in Ireland who have never directly experienced war should acknowledge the centrality and the relevance of that guiding principle.  It is important also that those of us of my age group and younger, who never lived through the war much less experienced it directly, should acknowledge that we too have learned the lessons of European war and are determined to do what little we can to ensure it never happens again.</P>
      <P>I visited Auschwitz concentration camp as a student in the late l970s.  I worked in Munich at the time, one of the first beneficiaries of the first generation of Irish students to benefit from the free labour market in the European Community. I remember seeing the two stark words on the monument to the dead in that camp which are &ldquo;Nie Wieder&rdquo;&mdash; never again.  Those two words are the overwhelming and powerful imperative for the further and deeper political integration of the European Union.  That integration must not be based just on a desire to prevent war but on a desire to create a safer, more stable, democratic, tolerant and prosperous Europe where all our citizens can rejoice in their cultural diversity and prosper in an economic interdependence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is always a risk of getting carried away with the ideals of politics, but I wanted to state that stark political commitment because some of what I say later may sound a little sceptical.  Let me then make it clear and even starker that I and my party are committed to greater political integration of the European Union.  I and the Labour Party are committed to economic and monetary union.  However, there is also an obligation on those of us in this House, and in particular those <Col N="732" /> of us in Opposition, to highlight some of the difficulties ahead.  We cannot enter into this great economic challenge with our eyes closed to the dangers.  Inasmuch as we can identify those dangers in advance, we may be able to avoid the worst at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The economic argument for EMU is powerful and persuasive.  In the words of the Commission report, EMU will &ldquo;revitalise the European economy and the single market, foster investment, boost business competitiveness, benefit consumers and savers and make life easier for citizens where both work and travel are concerned&rdquo;. If all, or even most, of this were true, the case for EMU would be unanswerable.  The truth is that some of it at least is wishful thinking and some of it is based on the unambivalent hope that the mere repetition of such extravagant aims will become a self-fulfilling prophesy.  This latter point is not unimportant.  If we have learned anything from the last three to four years, we have learned the importance of confidence in the business of currency exchange.  When I first learned economics I was told the demand for currency depended on the demand for goods and services. In recent years we have seen the greater importance of capital movement in determining the exchange rate.  These movements and speculation generally have in large part, but by no means always, reflected the economic fundamentals of a particular country at a particular time.  However, in the run-in to EMU we have seen an increasing amount of speculation for the sake of it.  We have even seen a measure of speculation which is clearly intended to disrupt the whole process of monetary union.  What is remarkable about the experience is that so far this year there has been none of the speculative turbulence which many people had envisaged.  At this stage it seems quite probable that we will get through to the end of April, and perhaps even to the end of this year, without any significant degree of turbulence in the financial markets.  The reason is clear.  The markets now accept that EMU will happen.  Confidence has been boosted by the political determination of member states and the Commission to complete the project.  The individual currencies are retaining their value because the markets are convinced that they will ultimately enter the single currency at about the central rate.</P>
    <P>Confidence is also paramount for the future of monetary union.  If Governments are confident, if the markets are confident, the currency will work and will be a hard currency, and the chances of success will be immeasurably improved for that. Clearly the Commission is conscious of this factor in drawing up the report.  Both reports, the Commission report and the EMI report, read like propaganda documents.  While neither is entirely uncritical, it is quite clear that both institutions see it as their primary role to bolster confidence in the new currency.  This is hardly surprising, but it does mean that we have to read the documents very carefully in order to identify the sceptical notes.  For what it is worth, I believe there is every <Col N="733" /> chance that the euro will develop the dynamic and the dynamism which is required to produce the level of investment and growth which we want.  In a sense, this is a major point that the sceptics missed.  They assumed that all decision-making would continue as heretofore.  They assumed that everybody would continue to behave as heretofore in making their decisions. There is every reason to believe that the new paradigm which monetary union represents will develop its own dynamic in a way which is likely to be positive for most if not all in the Union.</P>
    <P>Of course, monetary union will only work if the prerequisites are in place.  In identifying the prerequisites, the Maastricht Treaty set out five primary criteria &mdash; price stability, interest rate convergence, debt to GDP ratio levels, current budget requirements and ERM membership.  In principle, adherence to these convergence criteria was meant to signal the convergence of European economies.  It was also meant to indicate whether a particular economy was suitable for inclusion in the euro zone.  The criteria were developed with a large input from Germany and, in particular, from the Bundesbank.  The criteria chosen were the economic fundamentals most easily influenced by Government action.  They were and are all essentially monetary criteria.  If one wanted to be cynical, or perhaps just honest, one could also say that the criteria were developed so as to exclude some countries in particular.</P>
    <P>In one way I am happy that the Germans effectively got it wrong.  I believe monetary union will be more solidly based if it is broadly based.  Given the extraordinary efforts made by the governments of the Mediterranean countries, it would be inconceivable at this stage that they could be excluded from monetary union.  However, there is a very real problem relating to the criteria which are of particular relevance to Ireland.  The criteria do not cover growth rates and they do not cover employment or unemployment rates. Ireland's growth rate is way out of line with that of almost all of the other member states.  In addition, our rate of long-term unemployment is way above average.  These two indicators, and in particular our growth rate, put us at a point of the economic cycle which is radically different from that of most of the other member states.  In that important sense our economy is not currently convergent with that of the core states, notably, Germany, France and the Benelux countries. Most of the other countries are only now developing real growth rates, having gone through a period of little or no growth since the mid-1990s.  By contrast we experienced GDP growth of near to 10 per cent last year following an average of 7 per cent over the previous three years.  The lack of convergence represents a real problem for Ireland.  Our interest rates are currently 2.5 per cent above German rates.  As a result of the Asian crisis it now seems unlikely that German rates will rise any further between now and the end of the year.  As a result, Irish rates will have to come down at a time when <Col N="734" /> lower rates are at best appropriate and at worst dangerous.  This is only a portent of things to come.  It is likely that interest rates in the future will be decided to suit the core economy.  Even if the rates are set based on a weighted assessment of the periphery and the core it is still possible, if not likely, that Ireland will end up with rates of interest that are simply inappropriate to our state of economic development and in particular to our rate of economic growth.  It is vitally important that we put in place mechanisms to ensure that the needs of the economy are respected and understood when it comes to making these important decisions.  It is important that the channel of communications between ECOFIN and the European Central Bank should be as strong as possible.  It is important that the Euroex Committee should develop in a way which makes it possible to develop a coherent European policy on matters within the competence of the Union.  It is also important, in so far as it is possible, that Ireland should be represented directly or indirectly on the governing board of the European Central Bank.</P>
    <P>An obvious problem for Ireland arises from the decision of the UK Government not to proceed to the third stage of monetary union.  A great deal has been written about this in recent months, not least in the ESRI assessment and some commentaries written on foot of that assessment.  It is strange in a sense that the greatest cause of concern is not the current weakness of the Irish pound against the pound sterling but rather what may happen when sterling inevitably begins to fall.  It is almost inevitable that the UK will eventually join the euro zone.  It is likely that business in Britain will choose to do much of its business with the rest of Europe in euros, if not immediately then certainly over time.  It is also likely, for example, that the euro will begin to circulate in the peripheral regions, such as in Northern Ireland, perhaps at a very early stage. All of the pressure from business, finance houses and, ultimately, the general population will be in one direction.</P>
    <P>If all goes well, I would be very surprised if the pound sterling were not brought within the euro zone before the year 2005, certainly within a ten year period.  The accession of Britain will make life much easier for Ireland, but a great deal depends on the rate at which the pound sterling accedes.  Given the experience of Nigel Lawson in the late 1980s, it seems highly unlikely that any British chancellor would not guard against the danger of entering at too high a rate.  In many ways this decision is in the lap of the gods, and it is well beyond our sphere of influence.  All we can do now is position ourselves as best we can and hope for the best.  In that context I support the decision of the Government to increase the central rate by 3 per cent against all other currencies. The only surprise is that that decision was not taken earlier.  We all know the decision was taken to send a message and to strike a balance between taking competitive advantage and signalling <Col N="735" /> our intention to fight inflation.  It was also taken with an eye to future reduction in the value of sterling.  The Minister will know I made this argument at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service weeks before he went to Brussels to seek permission for this from the Commission. It is self-evident that I endorse the Government's decision on 14 March.</P>
    <P>We will feel the loss of important instruments almost immediately.  There is some argument about how important instruments such as the power to set the exchange rate, to revalue or devalue and the power to set interest rates have been.  Some argue we did not make best or much use of those instruments in the past, but it is clear that they will not be available in future.  This means that we will have to develop other instruments, the most obvious being fiscal policy.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's contribution. It was clear that signals were sent from Brussels that the December budget was regarded as excessively proactive and inflationary.  I would be interested in the Minister's response to this. Were we effectively told by Brussels that he had given away too much money and stoked the economy to the point where there was a risk of overheating and the brakes should be applied?  If so, the Minister should admit it clearly.</P>
    <P>We must develop other mechanisms also, and in doing so we must look to the social partners. Partnership has been an extraordinarily important part of the success of the economy in the last ten years.  The Commission report states that unit labour costs in Ireland have reduced in the past four years.  A fair amount of that relates to improved productivity, but it is also clear that workers have given away a great deal and contributed in no small way to the economy's success. It is also clear that the willingness of workers in particular sectors to continue to endorse the Partnership agreements is wearing thin.  At least one of the reasons is that they do not see the benefits of the agreements reached in Government Buildings on the workfloor.  It will be necessary to have a flexibility in the Partnership arrangements in future which has not been there heretofore.  For example, if particular sectors experience difficulties with competitiveness, there will be a need for a mechanism to address that at the level of the individual firm and nationally.  On the level of the individual firm we must look at alternative ways of remunerating workers.  It will be impossible to convince workers to take real cuts in wages and we will have to look at other means by which they can be remunerated.  I refer to employee shareholding schemes and profit sharing schemes.  Congress has been to the fore recently in proposing that these schemes should be elaborated and extended into far more sectors of the economy.  Individual workers and work-forces must have a stake in their company and a say in how it is run.</P>
    <P>In this context we could benefit from looking at how the Nordic countries organise their industrial <Col N="736" /> relations.  In pre-Partnership times we took too much from the adversarial industrial relations of the United Kingdom, which would be largely our tradition.  However, we would benefit greatly from looking at German and Nordic methods.  It is normal for particular industries and firms there to have works councils and, in private industry, worker directors.  Channels of information exist between workers and employers there that do not exist here.</P>
    <P>There are also significant implications for the banks and capital markets.  There is no reason in principle why one should not be able to write a cheque on the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank or even National Irish Bank and get it cashed in a German bank.  I hope a clearing mechanism to enable that to happen will be put in place rapidly. It would make EMU far more meaningful not just to the average business customer but to the average tourist.  There is also no reason in principle why capital markets should not be unified, which will be greatly facilitated by the advent of new technology.  There should be no reason why one cannot buy or dispose of shares on the Irish Stock Exchange which were hitherto available only in Frankfurt, Paris or London.</P>
    <P>I was interested by a reference in the Commission report to the further economic integration which is clearly envisaged by the Commission. It mentions the possibility of further development on employment and tax.  The reference to tax is interesting and the Minister should expand on it.  There are dangers to Ireland in greater harmonisation of the tax regimes between individual countries.  There is already some harmonisation of VAT and we are told that there will have to be some harmonisation of corporate taxes.  The Commission seems to envisage future harmonisation of income taxes.  We must approach this area with great care.  We have little control over our economy as things stand and after 1 January 1999 we will have less.  However, if we give up control of fiscal policy we might as well give up sovereignty over our economy altogether.</P>
    <P>Employment is the single economic criterion which is most important to individual citizens of the EU.  Whether they have a job, how they are remunerated, etc., are the most important things to a citizen.  One would be forgiven, however, for looking at EMU and thinking that employment was an adjunct or postscript to it.  The monetary criteria are central to it and employment seems to be a factor which comes in at the end.  The Amsterdam Treaty was an effort to redress the balance.  It puts employment at the centre of the economic criteria of the Union.  At the Luxembourg summit targets for employment and training were set out by the Ministers for Finance and heads of Government.  I am interested in hearing how the Minister for Finance sees those criteria and targets applying to Ireland.  It is important that those criteria and targets be given real teeth and do not remain mild aspirations we can disregard if we do not need them.  If EMU is to have <Col N="737" /> a real impact on ordinary citizens, they are extremely important.</P>
    <P>Employment plays no part in the Stability Pact, which was negotiated by Deputy Ruairi Quinn while Minister for Finance in December 1996.  It was a feat of negotiation, but there are inherent dangers in it for Ireland.  No account is taken of our infrastructure, which is relatively underdeveloped by European standards.  No allowance is made for capital spending in assessing whether a country has exceeded the allowed deficit.  It would have been useful to make such a provision, as the lack of a provision which allows us to spend money on infrastructure, irrespective of our current budget situation, is a problem.  Combined with the withdrawal of Structural Funds over the next seven years, this means that we must look to alternative means of funding infrastructural development in years to come.</P>
    <P>The Minister was right when he said that we would have to look at alternative ways of doing this.  My party has no problem with looking at public-private partnerships to fund infrastructural development in the future.  The time is ripe to consider these possibilities, as we are no more than six or seven years away from having to implement them.</P>
    <P>The central prerequisite for the implementation of EMU is the completion of the Single Market.  In principle this is 80 per cent complete; the Commission report states that only 20 per cent of the legal instruments required for completion need to implemented by individual countries. However, this does not tell the full story.  For example, in the construction of motorways here, it is not uncommon for such projects to be offered in pieces to allow local contractors to apply and to have a reasonable chance of being successful. However, if the construction of an entire motor-way was open to public tender a competitor from abroad would be more likely to be successful. There are ways and means to subvert the Single Market and we have not been shy in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of consumers that the Single Market is completed and that the additional impetus of EMU comes into play as soon as possible. However, while acknowledging the potential advantages for consumers, there are real threats to the competitiveness of producers, manufacturers and service providers.  In two or three years' time, if not sooner, producers and service providers will experience competition from other sources.  Much larger foreign companies will be competing in the same market and be in a position to offer goods and services at more competitive prices.  We are well positioned to cater for such a shock, but we must be prepared for it. IBEC should make its members aware that such a shock is imminent.</P>
    <P>It will be difficult to create a single labour market in Europe.  We speak different languages and skills are transmitted in different ways in different countries.  Another difficulty has arisen in recent times.  Most of the European Union is cover by <Col N="738" /> the Schengen Agreement, but Ireland has not signed up to it.  On my return from New York after Saint Patrick's Day I noted that the passport control system is much more diligent than it used to be.  I can only assume this renewed vigour of passport control is because we want to exclude people of particular racial origins and reduce the number of people applying for asylum status here.  If that is the case, it is deplorable.  While acknowledging the constraints that exist in terms of a common travel zone with Great Britain, we should seek to adhere as far as possible to the Schengen Agreement.</P>
    <P>EMU is an enormous project and the dice have been effectively cast.  While there will be significant challenges which we are well positioned to meet, we must be aware of the potential difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate. EMU is a natural progression from the formation of the European Economic Community.  There were originally six members but that has increased to 15 and a number of other countries have applied to join.  As time progresses business practices in banking and so on have converged across borders and the question of tax harmonisation has also been discussed in great detail throughout the Community.  It is only natural, therefore, that we should move towards economic and monetary union in the next few months.</P>
      <P>It is important that every country should meet the relevant qualifying criteria.  They have not been met by the 11 countries that are likely to join.  Political considerations were taken into account.  I hope some of the countries that do not qualify will not go back to their old practices and cause hassle in the future.  Controls must be strictly enforced so that the process can continue.</P>
      <P>A report published by the Bundesbank on 27 March stated that Ireland is one of only five European Union member states that has achieved a fiscal position that can be unreservedly classified as sustainable.  The five states include the United Kingdom and Denmark, both of whom have decided not to join, and Finland, Luxembourg and Ireland.  Dr. Helmut Kohl and leaders of the other countries know that, from a political as well as an economic point of view, EMU is vital.  Membership offers us the prospect of stable economic conditions.  While there will be inevitable hiccups, it will give us increased access to a larger market and there is a possibility that interest rates will be reduced in the immediate term, although it is questionable whether such reductions will continue in the medium to long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are an exporting nation and unless we can export at lower cost in future we will not be able to maintain the current level of employment and growth.  We will also fail to produce extra jobs for those coming on to the labour market.  A common currency will reduce the cost of exports as well as the paperwork involved when goods are <Col N="739" /> crossing borders.  The ESRI estimates that, even without the UK joining, the EMU will add 0.4 per cent to our annual GNP rate.</P>
    <P>Many companies from the Far East and the United States want to set up here because of our educated English-speaking workforce.  They want to get into Europe and perceive us as the ideal country to do that.  The main problem for us is providing workers to take up the jobs on offer. That is a change from 1987 when we had to make significant cutbacks while unemployment soared. Fortunately, things have moved in the opposite direction and I hope we will be able to maintain the level of prosperity that currently exists after we join EMU.</P>
    <P>One fear which has been expressed over the past number of months concerns inflation and the housing market was mentioned as an inflationary pressure.  The European Commission has expressed fears that there will be inflationary growth which will bring the level of inflation above acceptable limits.  However, we have heard that warning before but it has not happened. Economists cannot understand why inflation has not increased nor can they tell us when it will happen, which makes a change.  They do not know what to say and one takes a certain sadistic pleasure in that.  However, the Minister for Finance has seen there could be a problem and has wisely revalued the punt.  One of the main reasons was to ensure inflation would not stunt economic growth.</P>
    <P>Another worry exercising the minds of many, especially those exporting to Britain, is how sterling will perform against the euro.  The stability pact should allay their fears that the British will competitively devalue sterling because they cannot do it under the terms of that pact.  Sterling's re-entry to the ERM should also allay fears because it will restrict the range within which it can appreciate or depreciate in value.  It should also be explained that Britain must deal with the 11 EMU countries and normal economic checks and balances will ensure it cannot do whatever it wants for its own benefit.  The Bank of England has also undergone change to make it more independent which should allay fears that the British Government will run the bank on a political basis.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe express doubts about the wisdom of the Government and how it was tardy in making a decision on revaluation. I remember his predecessors expressed great doubts in 1987 when the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, and the then Minister for Finance, Mr. MacSharry, made a deal for Structural Funds in Denmark.  The outgoing Government at the time stated we would receive £4.5 billion and not a penny more or less.  I believe we received £5.5 to £6 billion.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, stated we would receive £8 billion after a meeting in Edinburgh.  He was also derided.  People said we would only receive £5 billion and that he was an idiot to state otherwise. By next year, we will have received £8.5 billion. <Col N="740" /> The doubts expressed on this occasion about revaluation and its detrimental effects can be put in the same category as those recorded in the history of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>As regards EMU, I believe we have moved in the right direction and that we have prepared properly for it.  Previous Governments, including the last coalition of Democratic Left, the Labour Party and Fine Gael, have all realised that this is the proper direction in which to move as it copperfastens our continued economic growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The excuse or pretext for this debate is the 3 per cent revaluation already announced.  Since that was the thrust of the argument advanced by a number of us over a period in this House, it would be churlish to do other than welcome it.  The Minister stated that it was agreed the central rate of the Irish pound would be revalued by 3 per cent against other ERM currencies, from DM 2.41 to DM 2.48, and that this new central rate of the Irish pound is broadly in line with its recent market rate.  In so far as any of us can be prescient in these matters, I broadly accept that that is right.  Deputy Michael Ahern traced the history of this.</P>
      <P>On previous occasions, I have dealt with my party's view on this question, the most recent being the debate on the Central Bank Bill.  I do not want to cover that territory again except to say that my party is committed to greater European integration, that the single currency is a major step in that direction and that there is, therefore, no reversing of engines at this stage.  I accept it is an historic decision.  The Minister refers to it as one of the major economic decisions of the century.  Some people say it is the biggest step we have taken since the Act of Union.  Either way, it is a major decision.</P>
      <P>It has been announced that 11 countries meet the convergence criteria and Ireland is included among those.  At the end of this month, we can expect an opinion from ECOFIN on the convergence criteria and the progress towards the objectives set down.  Towards the beginning of May, the European Parliament will deliver its opinion and the timetable is set out accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of that timetable was yesterday's report from the Central Bank and its assessment of the convergence criteria.  I believe the Minister's speech was significantly informed by that assessment report which I received yesterday and which is published today, although I have only read his speech now as I was not present when he delivered it.  The document from the Central Bank deals at some length with the four criteria of price stability, Government budgetary position, exchange and interest rates and sets out its assessment of Ireland's performance under each of these headings.  There is no doubt that it is a picture of boom and bloom.  I will come back to that issue later.  I do not think anybody in the debate so far has referred to the fact that whereas we are competing to declare those congenial statistics and that picture of boom and bloom at the same <Col N="741" /> time as it is the statistical case, there is a serious and endemic problem of poverty and long-term unemployment in this and other member states. Ojective evidence is now reaching the level of scholarship that shows that the gap is widening at the same time as these congenial statistics.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go back over the arguments on the euro and so on as I have taken previous opportunities to put my party's view on the record.  However, the rate at which we enter the Euro must take account of the underlying credibility of our economic performance.  The Irish entry level should not be dictated by what will probably prove to be an illusory and short-lived rise in the price of sterling.  There may be problems in the short and medium term but we must make a judgment call in the expectation that sterling will ultimately enter and at that stage the instrument of exchange rate policy in adjusting competitiveness will no longer be available to us. The editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> today referred to the fact that the value of sterling continues to rise. For some considerable months people have predicted that sterling will fall but it has not fallen yet.  I accept that poses certain problems for some sections of industry in the interim but it also provides certain opportunities.  We have to make a judgment call and get on with it.</P>
    <P>On another occasion I dealt with whether this economy would hitch its wagon to the star of Britain or to the wagon of the leading European countries for the future.  That is the philosophical question on which we have made up our minds.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister deal with the article which appeared in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 29 March, on the revaluation which has occurred?  I do not know whether the Minister availed of the opportunity to do so in his opening speech, but if so it is not contained in the formal text, so far as I can see at a glance.  That article claimed the Minister did what he did because he was forced to by our European partners.  The Minister ought to use the opportunity of this debate to clear up that issue one way or another.  Is it the case that our European partners decided to force our hand &mdash; I notice there was unanimity among our European partners on the question of the revaluation of three points &mdash; but from whom did the initiative come?  Previously, I thought the Minister gave the impression that he took the initiative.  I do not know whether he did but either way he should respond to that question so that we are clear on where we stand.</P>
    <P>I referred to the assessment by the Central Bank of the convergence criteria in the context of Ireland's participation in EMU and to the fact that it is a picture of boom and bloom.  I have an alternative summary which, in three sentences, reads: Thankfully for Ireland the assessment of Ireland's funding needs [this is in terms of Structural Funds post 1999] will be based on the country's level of GDP compared to the European average over the period of 1993-5 [this is known as the reference period].  Then Ireland was 88 per cent of European GDP, well over the 75 per cent <Col N="742" /> threshold necessary to qualify for Objective One but not as much over as the latest figures indicate of 103 per cent.  In the case of Cohesion Funds where the requirement is to be under 90 per cent of gross national product, Ireland was just under 90 per cent GNP during the reference period but has since then risen above 90 per cent.  That is in keeping with the presentation from the Central Bank which is almost &mdash; with a possible caveat entered because of the fear of inflation &mdash; an unmitigated picture of boom and bloom.  Whereas that may be the case, I draw the attention of Members to another report published recently, the most recent report from the European Observatory on national family policies.  This is an annual report, reference authored on this occasion by John Ditch, Helen Barnes, Jonathan Bradshaw and Majella Kilkee, entitled Synthesis of National Family Policies.  It is interesting that this report, which is up to date, used a number of other poverty indicators to compare child poverty in the different countries of the European Union. Other speakers have dealt with this question in terms of employment, unemployment, the phenomenon of endemic long-term unemployment and the fact that the employment here is predominantly that of low skills and no skills.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the related question of child poverty, the findings of the report, which take into account the new indicators, are as follows. Using a set of 14 indicators to measure child poverty, Ireland was in the poorly performing end of the European league on most counts, coming second from the bottom in the European Union in four instances.  Children in Ireland were twice as likely to live in a household without a car as the European average &mdash; 26.2 per cent compared to the European average of 13.7 per cent.  The problems of debt were high for Irish households with children &mdash; 81.1 per cent of Irish households reported housing costs to be a burden compared to the European average of 68.3 per cent.  Only 1.1 per cent of Irish households with children reported receiving a housing subsidy compared to the European average of 11.2 per cent.  Some 37.6 per cent of Irish households with children reported that debts from hire purchase were a burden compared to the European average of 22.4 per cent.  Ireland's debt figures were the highest in the Union.  Some 36.4 per cent of Irish households reported that they had difficulty in making ends meet compared to the European average of 24.8 per cent and 53 per cent of Irish households with children said they could not afford a holiday away from home compared to the European average of 35.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The report states that in some areas Ireland compared better.  For example, under housing indicators, Irish households with children were better than the European average in respect of household space, an absence of leaking roofs or damp walls.  Irish households with children also scored better than the European average in staying warm in the home, their ability to buy new <Col N="743" /> clothes, their ability to afford to eat meat, chicken, fish and so on.</P>
    <P>One has to look at the comprehensive picture. On the one hand we were set a hurdle in terms of the convergence criteria.  We have heard how remarkably and strikingly well we have done in achieving those criteria.  However, in terms of the grander project of European integration and the ideal of the European Union, there is serious endemic poverty and unemployment cheek by jowl with that great wealth, performance and economic stability.  This is the great challenge for the EU in the immediate years ahead.  It is also the great challenge to the euro.  Undoubtedly there will be strains for the reasons we have traced at the Finance committee and in this House on the debate on the new Central Bank Bill.</P>
    <P>One idea touched on but not discussed much was the question of the Central Bank reserves and to what purpose it is intended they should be put.  The cost of our subscription, if I may call it that, to the European Central Bank is of the order of £400 million.  The question arises as to what we do with the remainder.  It seems that unless there is a transfer of resources to the areas where long-term unemployment is clustered in terms of investment in training and giving people some skills and hope we have a serious problem within the EU, notwithstanding the very propitious circumstances with which we have dealt.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated the Central Bank report also states that Central Bank legislation is now fully compatible with the requirements of the treaty.</P>
    <P>I am sure this is the case.  The meeting we had this morning with the Governor of the Central Bank on an aspect of this problem would seem to give rise to some questions about the Central Bank legislation.  It would be foolish to pretend that this is a matter which only preoccupies domestic citizenry.  It is likely that our trading partners and others are watching our performance.</P>
    <P>There are questions about the Central Bank legislation.  The 1971 Act was enacted prior to EEC membership.  It was the 1989 Act which caught up with the play.  Whereas the Central Bank would seem to have quite wide powers, it is fair to say that its preoccupation is with prudential rather than supervisory preoccupations. Should we persist with the unitary structure as distinct from the dual structure in the US and Germany?  The Bundesbank has the prudential role of protecting the currency and so on but the consumer dimension is the responsibility of a different office.  Similarly, the US Federal Reserve has the prudential responsibility and the consumer dimension is handled by a different office.  We went half way in terms of setting up the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. Under the Consumer Credit Act I introduced in 1995, which became law in 1996, the Director of Consumer Affairs for the first time has explicit functions in terms of monitoring and approving <Col N="744" /> bank charges.  However, he has no major role in the area of interest rates.  The question arises as to whether we beef up that office and give it a consumer dimension and let the Central Bank do what it does best separately and distinctly.  Time does not allow me to go into this in any detail. The Central Bank interprets section 16 of the second banking directive concerning confidentiality in the most extreme manner possible.  The bank takes an absolutist interpretation of the confidentiality imposed as a consequence.  This might also need to be looked at.</P>

      <P>Ireland's full and final entry into EMU is only nine months away.  Judging by the level of public and political debate on this issue, one would think it is nine years away.  There has been strong support for our participation in EMU from all sides of the political spectrum and from business organisations, farmers and trade unions. However, that support has tended to be somewhat unquestioning.  It is vital that we use the remaining months before entry to tease out exactly what membership will entail in both political and economic terms and what kind of policy responses will be required to meet the challenges of monetary union.  On balance, EMU will be good for business, investment, jobs and Ireland. Once economic and monetary union becomes a reality we can look forward to lower interest rates, reduced transaction costs and a more stable business environment.  This will create a favourable climate for exporting industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a consistent supporter of Irish involvement in Europe since the initial referendum campaign in 1972.  It is heartening to see that many of those who opposed our entry at that time have converted to the cause of European integration.  So much so that there is now no real opposition to Irish entry into EMU within the mainstream political system.  The situation is different elsewhere, particularly in Britain, which has been riven by clashing attitudes to Europe. There is enormous division in that country, and in the Conservative Party in particular, towards this question.  Some of the most passionate debates of this century in the House of Commons took place on EMU.  Including your good self, Acting Chairman, there are five Deputies in the House and no one from the press.  That is a measure of the passion that we hold for what is going to be, perhaps, the most important step Ireland will take in terms of ceding its sovereignty. This is a far more important step than joining the EEC in 1972.  That step was reversible and was not as all pervasive as this.  This is irreversible. That is what we have been told and I can see why.  What Irish Government will be able to back out and announce on a particular day that the following week it will withdraw the euro and issue Irish Government paper instead?  What speculation would there be against that Irish Government paper in the circumstances?  It is, therefore, an irreversible step.  The Germans see it as such.  If it is for them, it certainly is for us. <Col N="745" /> Life inside EMU will not be plain sailing, especially while Britain, regrettably, is outside it. There will be times when our exchange rate or our interest rates are either too high or too low and we will not be able to do anything about it. It is vital, therefore, that the Government takes concerted action to make the economy as competitive as possible.</P>
    <P>Improving competitiveness will mean reducing tax rates, business costs and the power of State monopolies.  The Government has made an impressive start in that direction.  The decision to cut personal tax rates in the budget was wise and those cuts will have a beneficial effect on the labour market.  They were criticised by the parties opposite but, strangely enough, there has been no commitment to reverse them nor, I venture to guess, will there be.</P>
    <P>The halving of capital gains tax was also a wise move.  I approved of it at the time and I approve of it now.  Not alone will it encourage job creating investment it will also bring in more money to the Exchequer.  Capital tax receipts for the first two months of 1998 are up 53 per cent on the same period last year.  Any decision to reverse the rate cut would result in a large loss of money to the Exchequer.  It is no great wonder that those opposite who criticised it are unwilling to commit themselves to reversing it.</P>
    <P>Most heartening of all has been the progress made in the area of privatisation and deregulation. For five years the Labour Party kept privatisation off the political agenda.  For five years we fell behind our international competitors, all of whom were heavily committed to privatisation and deregulation.  During last year's general election campaign Deputy Broughan, who speaks for the Labour Party on enterprise matters, described my party's commitment to privatisation as a slash and burn policy.  Ten months on Deputy Broughan is proclaiming the virtues of privatisation. There seems to have been much slashing and burning in the Labour Party's policy department last weekend.  I hope the hypocrites will have the decency to acknowledge who was right all along.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that a comprehensive rationalisation and restructuring programme is to be implemented in Telecom Eireann and that the company will be floated on the Stock Exchange next year.  All this should have happened years ago.  It is a great pity so much time has been lost and Irish business and consumers have had to pay over the odds for their telecommunications services for so long.  How many new, high quality jobs might have been created over the last five years if Government had adopted a liberal, pro-consumer policy in the telecommunications sector instead of trying to protect an inefficient, over-staffed and costly State monopoly for as long as possible?</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will go the whole hog and move immediately to demerge Cablelink completely from the clutches of Telecom Eireann.  As a member of Government eight <Col N="746" /> years ago, I fought hard to prevent Cablelink going under the control of Telecom Eireann.  I lost out in that debate but the real losers were telephone consumers.  Telecom Eireann effectively abused its majority stake in Cablelink to frustrate the development of real competition in telecommunications.  It is essential Cablelink is sold without delay to an independent operator which will invest in the company and develop it into a real competitor for Telecom Eireann.</P>
    <P>The process of privatisation and deregulation must not stop with Telecom Eireann.  It must stretch across the State spectrum.  The interests of the consumer, whether private or business, must come first.  The onus must be on those who claim that a State undertaking should not be privatised to prove their case.  Unless they do so its disposal should proceed, whether by outright sale or floatation on the Stock Exchange that is starved of stock and real investment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Innovative thinking is also needed in the area of infrastructural development.  Despite improvements in recent years, our national transport infrastructure is still hopelessly inadequate by European standards, particularly where roads are concerned.  We know that our access to EU Structural and Cohesion Funds will decline over the next decade due to our growing prosperity. Equally, our ability to fund infrastructural development via Exchequer borrowing will be limited by the EMU Stability Pact.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that our road development programme needs to speed up, not slow down.  The policy implications are clear: we must move towards the private funding of public infrastructure that is now essential.  This idea has worked successfully in many countries.  In Britain, the new Severn Bridge, opened two years ago at a cost of £300 million, was funded by the private sector.  At home, the East Link and West Link bridges in Dublin are vital links in the national infrastructural chain.  Both were built with private money.  There are many gaps in the primary road network which could also be filled in this way and remunerated by tolls, if necessary.  We must be much more open to the concept of private sector funding.  Otherwise, we will not be able to put in place the transport infrastructure a modern, exporting economy requires.  Roads are infinitely more important than railways.</P>
    <P>Entry into EMU will be one of the biggest and most dramatic changes ever experienced by the economy.  For us to prosper, workers, business and the Government will have to respond to that change in an innovative and imaginative manner. This will be particularly true in the area of social partnership.  Once inside EMU we will be exposed to the full volatility of sterling.  In the past when sterling fell in value against our currency we used devaluation to restore our competitive position.  From 1 January next that option will no longer be available to us.  It is not available even now in the lead-up to EMU.</P>
    <P>In the new situation much of the competitive pressure will fall on the labour market.  The key <Col N="747" /> word in economic jargon is &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;.  In plain man's language, that means that workers in individual companies will have to take up the slack.  I am not convinced the full implications of this have been taken on board by politicians, the unions or businesses.  We will have to develop mechanisms at the level of the firm that will enable companies in the traded sector of the economy to cope with sterling volatility.  One option may be a pain sharing and gain sharing approach.  This would mean that workers may be required to take pay cuts when times are bad but would have the opportunity of sharing in the company's success when times are good.  Clearly, there is much work to be done before this becomes a reality.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of social solidarity. EMU will impact differently on the public and private sectors.  Those in the public sector stand to gain from low inflation and low interest rates. There is little downside involved for them.  For those in the private sector on the other hand, EMU could pose considerable risks unless Government pursues the appropriate policies to protect their interests.  It is extremely important that growth in Government spending is kept under control.  There has been dramatic growth in public spending over the past five years and 40 per cent of it is accounted for by increases in the public service pay bill.</P>
    <P>We will need tight control of spending so that taxes can be cut to boost competitiveness and preserve and create jobs in the exposed sector of the economy.  This means that any new partnership programme will have to include measures to control the public service pay bill.  That will pose a real test of social solidarity for all concerned and one which will have to be faced up to, even though they have chosen not to up to now.</P>
    <P>The debate, such as it was, as to whether we should enter EMU is effectively over but real debate on our policy options within EMU has still to get under way.  With just nine months to go it is high time that happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We should reflect on what is involved in the Commission determining that Ireland has fulfilled the criteria necessary to participate in the adoption of a single currency.  It is important that we have fulfilled these criteria, not only externally in that it allows us participate in the creation of a single currency, but also domestically. Like Deputy O'Malley, I think the domestic implications need to be carefully considered in the same way that the external implications and the implications for our relations with the UK must be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not enough attention has been paid to the fact that the prospect of participation in the single currency and EMU has been an important motivation for the policies which have led us to fulfilling the criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty. Those criteria constitute legitimate and appropriate objectives for any Government.  They concern <Col N="748" /> price stability, sustainability of the Government's financial position, currency stability and low long-term interest rates.  All these issues are important not only for our participation in a single currency or for the ability of our products and services to compete on international markets, but also for our ability to provide services to expand employment, achieve social goals which can be affected or determined by Government action, maintain sustainable levels of current public expenditure and sustain the level of public investment required for projects which are not capable of being met by or suitable for private investment.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of what Deputy O'Malley said about private participation in the provision of public infrastructure.  It must be noted that there are many areas of public infrastructure where it would be difficult to perceive the involvement of private investment.  I am glad much attention is being paid by the Government and interest groups to the fact that there will be so much pressure on public finances to support necessary infrastructural investment in areas not appropriate to private participation that we should develop private participation as far as possible.  This involves expenditure and must be done in the most rational manner possible.</P>
    <P>This is illustrated in the report of the National Competitiveness Council, &ldquo;The Competitiveness Challenge&rdquo;, which shows a number of areas where such considerations will be important.  For example, the report states that &ldquo;a reduction in the tax wedge will have important incentive effects in encouraging take-up of employment, and in reducing upward pressure on wages across the economy.  &rdquo;.  The council is saying we must restrict as far as possible the Government's appetite for current revenue to maintain the competitiveness of our production system, thereby ensuring the employment of people on a sustainable basis.  The report goes on to state that &ldquo;competition in utilities has to be encouraged as this will be the best way of bringing down costs to business&rdquo;.  There is more to it than this, as effective competition in utilities which brings down costs must not be supported by public expenditure.  This means real competition on the basis of utilities funded by the market.  Funding by the taxpayer would result in a loss of the effects of competition.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Labour Party on arriving at the position it has in relation to competition and the funding of the required investment in public utilities.  It arrived at this position with some difficulty last weekend, some ten years later than it should have.  Nevertheless, the conversion of sinners is always welcome.</P>
    <P>Other matters listed as important by the National Competitiveness Council include considerations of the strength of the Irish enterprise sector, especially through close attention to costs, quality and innovation.  This is a signal that public expenditure must be such as to allow leeway for the enterprise sector to pay attention to costs, quality and innovation, none of which can be got <Col N="749" /> right if there is an excessive bite by the State into their operating revenues and incomes.</P>
    <P>The council also speaks of research in the context of science, technology and innovation.  Its report states that we must ensure adequate funding continues to be available for science and technology after the current round of Structural Funds in 1999.  There years after this date the amount of money we receive will begin to decrease.  We must leave room in the public capital programme, from the resources we have, for adequate funding in this important area.  The council states that we should &ldquo;reallocate an additional £12 million in Structural Funds in 1998 for the industry R&amp;D scheme&rdquo;.  It suggests that &ldquo;additional resources are required to improve the standards of science in primary and secondary schools, particularly to fund teacher training in this area&rdquo;.  It advocates an &ldquo;increase in support for basic research in third level colleges from £2 million per year at present to £6 million per year&rdquo; and that &ldquo;financial support for post graduate research students needs to be increased&rdquo;.  It goes on to make the following proposals in the area of economic policy stating that &ldquo;economic management and exchange will have to prepare for reduced structural funding, the possibility of inappropriate interest rates and a slowdown in GNP growth&rdquo;.  I find it wryly amusing to see a reference to &ldquo;inappropriate interest rates&rdquo; because I recall a time when all we had were inappropriate interest rates which were too high.  Now, all our pundits think that lower interest rates than those which we have would be inappropriate.  That is quite a turnaround.  The Competitiveness Council also states that:</P>
    <P>Government borrowing should be reduced whenever conditions are favourable, as they are now.  The overall burden of taxation should be lowered in order to assist the development of enterprise.  As a consequence, public expenditure growth must be restrained to meet the need to reduce taxation and to eliminate borrowing.</P>
    <P>Those are all very interesting and apposite statements and reinforce the need to ensure that, having achieved the Maastricht criteria, we should continue to adhere to them.  They offer the best guarantee that we will be in a position to sustain the provision of essential services, that we will be able to sustain the necessary level of public investment and that we will, therefore, be able to continue to contribute to employment growth in this country.</P>
    <P>For the sake of completeness of argument, I should make the point that observance of, and adherence to, the criteria would be important to us even if we never joined the single currency.  In fact, it would probably be even more important if we did not join.  However, that is only a hypothetical situation and one which need not concern us.</P>
    <P>It is important to reflect on the roads which Ireland has had to travel to get to the point where <Col N="750" /> it could be determined that we satisfied the criteria. Deputy O'Malley spoke about this and was around during the period I will speak about. There were occasions when he was not very helpful in moving along the road.  The process began under the Government of former Taoiseach, Garret Fitzgerald, in 1981 when the current Leader of the Opposition, Deputy John Bruton, was the Minister for Finance.  The process continued during the period 1982-86 when I had the honour of being Minister for Finance.  It continued during 1987, when the principal Opposition party, Fine Gael, took a rather unprecedented view of its approach to economic policy.  It was a matter of great regret to me then, and one which caused some delay in bringing about Ireland's economic health, that Deputy O'Malley and his colleagues in the Progressive Democrats did not have the guts to participate in, or support, the macroeconomic policies being followed by the then Government under the Minister for Finance, Ray McSharry.</P>
    <P>All the actions taken during that period constituted a labour of great pain.  I was often reminded of the Duke of Wellington's comment &ldquo;hard pounding gentlemen&rdquo;.  That was a time of hard pounding but that pounding was needed to ensure that we could get our public finances into a sustainable position and could have confidence in planning forward to arrive at the condition in which we now find ourselves where we can participate with confidence in the single currency.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised, not merely in this country but in other member states, about what member states might have had to give up to conform to the Maastricht criteria.  That question has been raised in France and Italy as well as in this country.  It has been suggested that the provision of social services and adequate levels of remuneration in the public sector are being sacrificed on the altar of the single currency.  Those concerns miss the point because the experience of fashioning economic policy since 1981 to meet the criteria shows that we cannot be confident of being able to continue enlightened policies in the social areas or public sector on a sustainable basis unless, and until, our finances are in the kind of shape required to conform with the Maastricht criteria.</P>
    <P>The criteria are, in many ways, essential pre-conditions for economic and employment growth. I have no doubt that the states which will participate in the single currency will experience an increment in overall growth and employment over and above what would have been the case if Ireland decided not to join.</P>
    <P>Concern about growth and employment levels necessarily lead us to adopting these criteria.  I disagree to an extent with the view expressed by Deputy McDowell when he said, with some seeming disapproval, that the Maastricht criteria do not cover growth and unemployment rates.  That is true but the criteria must be applied so that Ireland is in a position to contribute with confidence <Col N="751" /> to the future development of growth rates and the future expansion of employment.</P>
    <P>As far as the operation of the system itself is concerned, there has been, and still is, an ongoing debate in this country about what we can expect. Some of the debate seems to be based on a false statement of the comparisons which should be made.  Many of those who are sceptical or unconvinced about the case for a single currency compare the current economic situation with that which will prevail if Ireland enters the single currency and the UK does not.  That is not the comparison which should be made.  We should compare the situation as it would be if Ireland and the UK did not enter and that which would prevail if Ireland joined and the UK did not.  When speaking about the difficulties Ireland will experience with sterling, people seem to overlook the simple fact that those difficulties would arise in any event.</P>
    <P>It is arguable that a single currency which includes the punt may render sterling a shade less volatile than if Ireland did not enter.  Those who argue that we should stay out because they worry about sterling should really reflect on what that means.  If Ireland stayed out and sterling were to appreciate, are those people saying we should apply the kinds of policies which would be required to drive up our exchange rate against all other currencies to maintain pace with sterling? They are not because such policies would be anathema to them.  Are they saying that, in the event of sterling depreciating, we should follow the kinds of policies which would be required to push our exchange rate down against other currencies simply to maintain a given relationship with sterling?  They are not, and it would be folly on Ireland's part to do either of those things.</P>
    <P>A fear expressed in some quarters is that the changeover to a single currency and its new denominations will lead to covert attempts by people involved in various businesses to secure a hike in their prices.  The myth is that on the last occasion Ireland did anything like this with its currency, the conversion to decimalisation in 1971, there were price increases.  There were not. The evidence from the period of two years prior to and two years after decimalisation shows no blip in the trend of consumer price inflation.  It did not happen.  Of course, there was rounding up and rounding down of prices, but ultimately they cancelled each other out.  In the preparation programme both at European Union level and at national level for this conversion there are stronger measures to ensure there will be no hidden price increases that would give rise to a blip in inflation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the progress being made in the national changeover plan.  The last version of the plan was produced by the Department of Finance in January.  It is impressive and reads the needs.  However, I wish to be assured that a more vigorous approach is being taken to ensure that firms throughout the country <Col N="752" /> apply it.  If they do not, they will find themselves in a great deal of bother in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity presented by this motion to address a number of issues concerning the move to the third and final stage of EMU.</P>
      <P>The convergence reports from the European Monetary Institute and from the Commission demonstrate that outstanding progress has been achieved by member states towards the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence since the beginning of the second stage of EMU in 1994.  The extent of this achievement is reflected in the fact that the Commission has recommended that eleven member states, including Ireland, should participate in EMU from 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>It is clear that EMU will entail both opportunities and challenges.  It will increase the efficiency of the Single Market through the elimination of the exchange rate risk and improved transparency and competition.  It will also provide a new environment of price stability and sound public finances.  These will, among other things, reduce the uncertainties that impede investment decisions and should, therefore, provide a solid basis for future growth and employment generation.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has already referred to the fact that Ireland's strategic interest lies in joining EMU from the outset.  He also made reference to the 1996 ESRI report on the economic implications for Ireland of EMU. This report found that membership for Ireland would, on balance, be economically advantageous for Ireland even if the UK were to remain outside the single currency zone.</P>
      <P>In a recent newspaper article, one of the editors of this report, Terry Baker of the ESRI, examined the current situation in order to assess if the conclusions of the report could still be found to hold true.  In relation to external shocks, Mr. Baker concluded that the risks are now thought to be considerably lower than they were in 1996 for three reasons: an increase in the number of prospective EMU participants, a massive appreciation of sterling and a fundamental policy shift by the UK government in favour of eventual membership of EMU.</P>
      <P>However, the use of interest and exchange rates as economic instruments to deal with shocks which are particular to Ireland will no longer be available in EMU.  This means that if there are any shocks in the future which are particular to Ireland, the adjustment process will have to be assisted by a combination of fiscal policy, pay policy and structural reform.  In this context, Mr. Baker pointed out that the room for manoeuvre has increased significantly with the further strengthening of the public finances since 1996.</P>
      <P>It might be useful to quote Mr. Baker's summary of his reflections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> .the risks attached to EMU entry have diminished significantly since mid-1996, while some of the risks that would be faced had Ireland opted to delay entry to EMU have tended to increase.  With hindsight, it appears that our 1996 assessment underestimated the advantages of initial entry.  The balance of risks now seems to confer a clearcut and substantial benefit to Ireland from the decision to join EMU at the outset.</P>
    <P>The report from the Central Bank on Ireland's convergence, which was published yesterday, also acknowledges that substantial progress has been made on convergence and that this is true of all countries aspiring to participate in EMU from the beginning.  The bank goes on to state: &ldquo;It is reasonable to anticipate greater convergence when the single currency is established.  The single market and currency will promote further the process of integration and real convergence, and this should, over time, lessen the risk of major shocks affecting individual countries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank report points out that, having experienced the consequences of instability in the past, Ireland's recent economic performance reflects the benefits of prudent, stability-oriented policies.  Inflation and the general Government deficit have averaged 2.5 per cent and 1.9 per cent of GDP respectively over the past decade.  This period has been characterised by generally moderate wage increases that have been conducive to employment increases.  The bank states that this recent economic performance provides a solid base on which to ensure that Ireland continues to meet the objectives of low inflation and a balanced Government budget in the long run.</P>
    <P>The Commission's convergence report includes a detailed assessment of the impact of the cyclical economic factors on the budgetary performance of all EU member states.  The Commission concludes that Ireland's underlying or structural budget was in broad balance last year, in accordance with our own forecast.  For 1998 it forecasts that our structural budget balance will be unchanged, indicating that the macroeconomic impact of last December's budget was broadly neutral.  The EMI report draws attention to the significant underlying improvement in the Irish budgetary position in recent years which, in its opinion, may reflect a lasting structural move towards more balanced fiscal policies.  I assure the House that the commitment to stability-oriented policies is reflected at the EU budget council, at which I am the Irish representative.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the communique which was issued following the recent revaluation of the Irish pound.  It signalled his decision to hold strictly to the tight expenditure targets set out in last December's budget and hence to allow the general Government surplus, already pitched at 0.5 per cent of GDP, to increase in line with any unanticipated revenues this year.  The communique also noted the Minister's resolve to propose a budget for 1999 having as its primary objective the continuation of low inflation in <Col N="754" /> Ireland.  This approach to budgetary policy will help secure the medium-term sustainability of Ireland's economic growth.  The decision regarding the conduct of budgetary policy in 1998 and in 1999 is fully in accord with the commitment contained in the economic background to the budget last December to run budget surpluses when the economy is doing well.</P>
    <P>The case for Ireland joining EMU from the outset is now stronger than it ever was given the remarkable convergence that has occurred among the eleven potential EMU participants, which is sustainable into the future assuming that appropriate stability-orientated policies are pursued by them.  This is confirmed by the EMI, the Commission and the Central Bank convergence reports and the Commission recommendations. Taking these with the economic assessments by the ESRI, the recent review by Terry Baker and the NESC, it is clear that Ireland's long-term strategic interests lie in joining EMU from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>Social consensus has played a central role in supporting these achievements over the last decade. Wage moderation under the terms of successive partnership agreements has helped to secure strong non-inflationary growth with significant gains in employment and living standards in the economy.  The substantial improvement in economic performance over the course of the l990s has been reflected in the state of the public finances, which in turn has provided the fiscal flexibility for significant reductions in taxation. Hence, those in employment have seen large increases in their take home pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised the importance of the social partnership approach to addressing the challenges of EMU and I endorse this.  The competitive challenge of EMU will require an intensification of the flexibility and problem solving approach displayed by the Government and the social partners over the past decade.  The Partnership 2000 agreement also provides an explicit review mechanism in the case of a disturbance to Ireland's international competitiveness in EMU. The Government, IBEC and ICTU have agreed to meet in the near future, in the context of Partnership 2000, to accelerate the preparation for the competitive impact of EMU.  Enhanced competitiveness will be important in determining the economy's capacity to successfully accommodate economic shocks.  Provided we maintain our competitiveness, disturbances can be more readily absorbed by appropriate adjustment to domestic costs and prices, leaving long run competitiveness unaffected.</P>
    <P>The strengthening and deepening of the single market in the context of EMU will have implications in terms of our competitiveness.  Indeed, even without the advent of EMU, the forces of global competition would have been increasing relentlessly anyway.  However, my focus is on the consequences of EMU in particular.  EMU will see the opening of a new chapter in terms of opportunities for Irish-based business.  We all <Col N="755" /> now realise that as a small, open economy we are particularly dependent on international trade. Given the small size of the domestic market, the quest for profitable sales growth sooner or later forces most businesses into the export market.</P>
    <P>In the euro area, we will see exchange risks eliminated, transaction costs greatly diminished and greater ease of access generally to a huge market.  Moreover, the greater transparency of prices within the euro zone should, given our relatively lower price levels, help us to win new markets.  It is essential, therefore, that Irish-based industry, indigenous or foreign-owned, should seize this opportunity and exploit it to the fullest extent possible.  In this regard, it is important from the point of view of Irish companies to be aware that, simply as a matter of good management, large firms across Europe are likely to change over to the euro early in respect of their international business.  UK firms with a European market may well do the same.  Such changes could provide a significant competitive opportunity for smaller Irish firms.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, private sector preparation for EMU is, like all issues of competitiveness in the marketplace, primarily a matter for the individual companies themselves.  Forfás is co-ordinating the Government's EMU business awareness campaign. This widely publicised campaign is working well and considerable progress is being made on making companies aware of the issues which deserve attention in the context of their individual operations.  Special attention is being paid to SMEs, which are perceived to have particular needs.</P>
    <P>There is need for all interests to appreciate the extent to which we will operate in a very different environment from 1 January 1999.  Our membership of the single currency is not simply a technical transition; it is a move to a new and more challenging environment.  In this respect, I acknowledge the important work already under way in the private sector, primarily in the financial sector, in spreading the message of the need to prepare for EMU.  The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has explained the role of the Department of Finance as regards the Irish economy's preparations for the changeover.  On 1 January 1999, the euro will be introduced in cashless form and I expect that a number of big businesses in particular will start to use the euro from that date.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, mentioned the national changeover plan which, among other things, sets out what the public sector will do to facilitate the use of the euro from January 1999. Briefly, the public sector will accept payment in euro, as well as in Irish pounds, and will generally make payment in euro where a supplier presents an invoice in euro.  The Revenue Commissioners have a key role in supporting Irish business through the changeover.  Revenue have made it clear from an early stage that they will accept payment of any tax in euro as well as in Irish pounds.  Revenue will also accept returns and declarations <Col N="756" /> in euro from companies and for self-assessed income tax.  In addition, companies may file their accounts with the Companies Registration Office in euro and tenders for public contracts may be submitted in euro.  Any banking service required in euro will be available in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This degree of certainty from key sectors in the economy allows the business sector to put their plans for the changeover on a sounder footing, knowing exactly what facilities will be available. Of course, it is still up to firms themselves to make sure they are ready for the euro.  EMU and the changeover to the euro will have a practical impact on business.  All businesses need to sit down and take stock of what EMU and the euro will mean for them.  Business can start by looking at the short leaflet that Forfás has produced for small and medium enterprises or SMEs.  The leaflet aims to get those involved in business of any size thinking about how EMU might affect their business and seeks to highlight the operational areas they should look at.</P>
    <P>Firms are urged to nominate a member of staff to take charge of the changeover process and to carry out a business impact analysis to identify the challenges and opportunities presented by the new business environment.  Business should then look at the potential impact on key business functions. Will EMU open up new markets for them? Will it mean increased competition?  What will increased price transparency involve for them? When should they change over their company accounts to euro?  I have already said they can file company accounts in euro from 1 January 1999. This does not, of course, mean that companies have to change their accounts into euro, or that they will have to keep dual accounts.  Businesses can continue to keep their accounts in Irish pounds until 2002.  Businesses also need to consider when their customers and suppliers will be changing over.  They should also look at when their competitors will be changing over, and whether this makes any difference from their point of view.</P>
    <P>Another major area that business need to consider is their computer operations.  For the euro, business should look at each operation that handles money and financial data and see how it may need to be adapted.  Before companies make any new investments, they should see if the new equipment will handle the euro.  They should also develop a timetable for handling the changes they identify.</P>
    <P>Staff training is also very important.  All businesses need to see what training their staff will need in areas like invoicing, cash handling, accounting systems and customer inquiries.  When businesses have looked at these operational areas, they should draw up a plan for the necessary changes, setting out what needs to be done, when it needs to be done and who will do it.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the euro will impact on business at an early stage, which is why I have gone into some detail about what businesses need to do to <Col N="757" /> prepare themselves.  Of course we have not forgotten the need to alert the general public to the changes for them.  I am satisfied the necessary structures are in place to ensure the future balanced and sustainable development of our economy and, therefore, I support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>A good friend of mine rang me a couple of weeks ago and told me that following discussions in his local pub he was a little concerned about the view held by the group that the banking system, while claiming that it would lose much revenue due to the cessation of currency changing, still welcomed our entry to EMU.  He said he felt it difficult to visualise the banks welcoming something that would lose them money and the only conclusion he could draw was that not all was right in the state of Denmark.  There is much confusion among the general public about our entry to the EMU.  A large number of people are concerned that the value of their money will decrease rapidly.  One man commented that it will be similar to the decimal changeover when the pound decreased from 240p to 100p.</P>
      <P>Whatever excuse economic commentators have for being out of touch with the general populus, we as politicians have none.  There should be a realisation that the vast majority of people know virtually nothing about the single currency other than that the design of our notes will change sometime in the near future.  Recent referenda have shown that most people do not read detailed economic or political comment and a very small minority study Government advertisements.  It will be interesting to see if the body that has been given the task of informing the public about the Amsterdam Treaty can come up with imaginative ideas.</P>
      <P>I often feel that a 20 second clip in Molly Malone's bar depicting Miley's difficulty in grasping change, both literally and metaphorically, would be more informative than many of the economic or political discussions we will have in the months ahead.</P>

      <P>Recent events have shown that bank statements are not read closely.  Surely the sight of the euro on the page will not assist the TAM ratings, but the onward march will continue and lack of knowledge will be no barrier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the EMU?  The European Union is committed to forming an economic and monetary union.  The monetary union in this case is a group of countries, one of which is Ireland, that will use the same money.  A vital step in this process is the permanent locking of exchange rates between the <Col N="758" /> various currencies and stability in this regard can be assured only by the merging of national monetary authorities.  The final step will be when national currencies are replaced by a single currency by the year 2002.  Economic union means there will be no formal barriers to trade and payments or the movement of labour and capital among member states.  Some commentators believe economic union should involve a harmonisation of all economic policies and this may well evolve as all members will be subject to virtually the same economic conditions.</P>
    <P>There are two main principles behind the establishment of EMU, political and economic. The establishment of EMU should assist Europe in becoming more closely integrated politically. There is a desire for the lead player, Germany, to be at the centre of a Europe which is westward oriented and many of its close neighbours welcomed this development as their histories show they have suffered greatly due to instability in their relations with that country.  If Ireland can assist in this process, it should do so.</P>
    <P>While predicting the economic future is a dangerous occupation, economic benefits should accrue from EMU.  On the lower scale, there will no longer be currency change charges and one of the main advantages will be the ending of exchange rate uncertainty in cross-border trade and investment.  While it is not applicable to Ireland at present, the commitment to price stability should assist in the control of domestic inflation.</P>
    <P>There will, however, be economic costs.  The changeover in terms of the physical money and operating systems requiring change, will place a burden on many in the short term.  Certain events could lead to major difficulties with the system. A repeat of the 1970s oil crisis or something of the magnitude of the reunification of Germany in 1990 would cause a major strain, the result of which we will not know unless and until it occurs.</P>
    <P>There will be a new European Central Bank, the operations of which are defined in a protocol to the Maastricht Treaty.  It is envisaged this bank will be free of political pressure as it sets monetary policy.  Fears have been expressed about Irish entry without our main trading partner, Britain. However, staying out of EMU is likely to result in higher interest rates and an unstable exchange rate.  While it would be preferable for us if sterling were included in EMU official trade statistics show a sharp reduction in dependence on Britain in the past 25 years.  Entry into EMU is, in some ways, entry into the unknown.  There will be uncertain times ahead.  However, if the political will holds fast, we should be better off in EMU than out of it but, ultimately, the market will decide our fate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate EMU and wish to make a few salient points.  It is necessary that people are informed about a move which will affect our economic future.  The difficulty I have with this debate is <Col N="759" /> that the ordinary people, to whom Deputy Timmons referred and whom Deputy Joe Higgins says he represents, do not know what is going on, and I am not sure if the ordinary TD knows either.  As a graduate in economics, I find it difficult that I cannot explain the advent of EMU in simple terms.  Pragmatism is wonderful and I understand why the powers that be in Europe see a single currency as the way forward.  It is a move towards federalism, something which the main political parties accept.</P>
      <P>A number of questions, however, must be asked, given the political happenings in Germany where Chancellor Kohl, who has been the main negotiator and instigator of EMU and the federalisation of Europe, seems to be in political difficulties. While I would not write off his chances of being re-elected Chancellor of Germany, what effect will it have on the progress of EMU if he is not?  These issues must be thought out.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about small businesses.  I read a pamphlet from IBEC on the euro currency countdown which stated that about 47 per cent of small businesses in Ireland are prepared for the advent of EMU and believe it is a positive move. However, many small service industries do not know what will happen and have not put measures in place to help them deal with EMU. There will be job losses in this area.  The Government should establish a forum to explain to businesses in simple language what will happen. When EMU occurs in 2002 many small businesses will find themselves in difficulty.</P>
      <P>Another question we must ask is, how important is it for Ireland that Britain joins EMU. I suppose if one put a number of economists in a room, none would come up with the same answer. It will cause some problems but it is difficult to know what they will be.  It would be better for this country if our main trading partner joined EMU at the same time.  That is another question which we must consider.</P>
      <P>I hope the Government, in its wisdom, will consider establishing a committee or structure to explain the theory behind EMU and the pragmatisms which will occur over the next two years.  I hope this debate will be the start of many on this issue because people are not fully aware of the significance for us of entry into a single currency. It is a positive move and a single currency is the only way to bring about political promotion of a federal Europe but we need more debate and information and we, as legislators, and the Government should do all we can to inform people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add the following to the motion, after &ldquo;currency&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;; and that this House further recognises that the meeting of these qualifying conditions should not immediately be followed by this country entering into a monetary union, until <Col N="760" /> a full and proper consideration is given to the likely impact of such an action.  &rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a sensible amendment.  Sweden, Denmark and Britain have adopted a wait and see policy, which is exactly what we should do.  It is clear the Minister will have the support of the majority of the House which is evidence, if further evidence is needed, that the Green Party is the only real Opposition Party.  My party has voiced its opposition to EMU from the very beginning.  We have tried, in particular, to highlight the folly of participating in EMU without Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister maintained that the public voted for EMU at the time of the Maastricht Treaty. This will be news to many people as the clear impression given at that time was that we were voting for the euro loot, the famous £8 billion or £6 billion, depending on one's interpretation.  It is a safe bet that if one conducted a vox pop or more scientific survey one would discover overwhelming ignorance of the consequences and implications of EMU.  I have carried out an informal survey and most people are ignorant about its consequences.  They believe all that is involved is that member states will have the same currency and this will come in very handy when they return from holiday in Spain and Italy as instead of having loose peseta or lire in their pockets they will have euros which they can spend at home.  That is their understanding of the single currency.  The loss of control of monetary policy does not seem to have impinged on the consciousness of people. They have been kept in blissful ignorance.</P>
    <P>The creation of EMU is largely a political project. This has been admitted by many Deputies on both sides of the House.  The project is driven by the attempt to turn the European Union into a quasi federal European superstate, possessing one of the two key features of statehood, its own currency.  This is to be followed in due course by the second key feature, a European army and a police force.  As Helmut Kohl said in 1992, a European army and a European police force lie at the end of the road to European Union.  Helmut Kohl would like to see himself as a modern day Bismarck and he is a key proponent of the single currency.  Those pushing the single currency believe it is the glue of a political union which would otherwise disintegrate.  However, the huge pressures caused by EMU will lead to the disintegration of the Union.  There is already evidence of this in France and Germany where there has been civil unrest because of the huge increase in unemployment.  As a result of further centralisation and disempowerment, we will witness the rise of extreme elements in Europe which will necessitate the need for a unified army and police force.  We already witnessed strong arm tactics at the time of the signing of the treaty in Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>The key question is whether an economic and monetary union can work in Europe.  The Minister and Opposition parties argue that it will bring certain benefits and consolidate the internal market. They also argue that we will attain a uniform <Col N="761" /> rate of inflation and there will be a reduction in transaction costs and uncertainty between participating states.  However, Ireland's inflation rate is set to rise.  Lower and more uniform inflation and interest rates can be achieved if countries espouse similar monetary and fiscal policies.  We do not require a single currency to do this.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that, despite the adoption of a single currency, a country's credit rating still affects the cost of borrowing.  The essential point is that we are surrendering irrevocably the instruments of monetary policy.  Those who are proposing this are the very people who told us during the currency crisis of 1992-93 that we could not and should not devalue.  However, common sense prevailed and we devalued.  Luckily, we had not abandoned our control over exchange rates at that stage.  It is interesting to note that in conventional economic terms we have not looked back since.  The years 1994-8 are the only ones in the history of the State when we followed an independent exchange rate policy and allowed the currency to float.  This has been an essential element of the Celtic tiger phenomenon and the high growth rates of 1994-98.</P>
    <P>Between 1921 and 1979 our exchange rate was tied to sterling at par.  From 1979 to 1993 we tied ourselves to the DM within the ERM.  This is a case of if it aint broke why fix it.  If our economy is doing so well why are we jeopardising it?  Our booming economy is overheating and soon it will be ablaze.  Instead of dampening down the flames the Minister and his advisers, supported by the Opposition parties, are pouring petrol on the fire.</P>
    <P>The revaluation was like a wet sponge and what we really needed was a fire brigade hose. The last thing we need is lower interest rates, but this is what other European countries require as they emerge from recession.  There is very little we can do about this as we do not have control over monetary policy.  In all likelihood we will face a recession in late 1999, caused by increasing inflation.  Labour costs will rise and our exports will become less competitive, exports will fall, economic growth will slow, there will be less inward investment, unemployment will rise and tax revenue will decline.  What will the Government do?  It will be constrained by the stability pact so it will have to choose between higher taxes and lower spending.  That is the likely scenario. The Minister's speech did not inspire confidence. He failed to address adequately what the country will do in the case of an asymmetric shock.  He simply said: &ldquo;The adjustment process will have to be assisted by a combination of fiscal policy, pay policy and structural reform&rdquo;.  He went on to make the interesting point:</P>
    <P>The successful participation in EMU will require an intensification of the flexibility and problem-solving approach displayed by the Government and social partners over the past decade.  Structural policies for the development of Ireland's competitiveness as well as prudent budgetary policy and appropriate pay developments will be critical. <Col N="762" /> This seems to echo the response of Mr. Hans Tietmeyer, President of the Bundesbank, in March 1996.  He said that in the event of an asymmetric shock the countries in the monetary union must, on a point of principle, be responsible for themselves, for achieving the necessary flexibility through internal measures.</P>
    <P>What he meant is that one is on one's own: this might be an economic union but it is not a fiscal union and there will be no fiscal transfers.</P>
    <P>The famous ESRI report refers to &ldquo;labour market adjustments&rdquo;.  All these terms are euphemisms for wage cuts.  As Deputy McDowell rightly said, workers will not accept wage cuts.  What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;appropriate pay developments&ldquo;?  He told us that Partnership 2000 provides an explicit review mechanism in the case of &ldquo;disturbance of Ireland's international competitiveness in EMU&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have the highest regard for Dr. John Fitzgerald who has compiled many enlightening reports, particularly on the &ldquo;polluter pays principle&rdquo;, ecotaxes, etc.  However, on this occasion he has allowed political prejudice to distort his judgment and got it wrong.  Mr. Frank Barry of UCD has got it right.  According to his analysis, if there is a 15 per cent fall in sterling and wages do not fall there will be a sharp drop in manufacturing employment of approximately 22,000 and a drop in service employment of 44,000, giving a total of 66,000 jobs.  Even if wages fell by 5 per cent we would still have a loss of 42,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>One third of our trade is still with Britain.  I have argued for many years that we should expand our trade base through the teaching of languages in schools.  People need to speak a language if they want to market a product.  This has not happened and the sad reality is that one third of our trade is with Britain, one third is with countries in the euro zone and one third is with America and other countries.  It is clear from the above figures that it is absurd to enter EMU without Britain.  Has the Minister read Mr. Barry's analysis and, if so, will he comment on what he said?  Have the Labour Party and Democratic Left read Mr. Barry's analysis?</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell stated that if there was a fiscal union we might have to close up shop.  How can we have an economic union without a fiscal union?  Where are the historical precedents for that?  There are none.  Deputy Rabbitte made a Freudian slip in his contribution when he said Ireland was concluded when he meant to say Ireland was included.  We will be concluded if we enter EMU and if we do not have a sensible approach such as that adopted by Sweden, Britain and Denmark.</P>
    <P>This is the biggest decision this country has taken, as Deputy O'Malley rightly said, yet there is no passion, insight or interest.  There is only apathy.  I believe we have given up the ghost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their participation in the debate and their many interesting and constructive comments. <Col N="763" /> While the decision as to whether Ireland will be part of this next step in European development was made by the people in 1992, it is important that we as public representatives engage in the debate so that all the issues can be aired and, as far as possible, public awareness is raised.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have expressed their concern about the lack of coverage of the extensive discussion of EMU in this House, in debating these and related issues in the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and during the debates on the Central Bank Bill.  Perhaps the contributions in this debate may be more fortunate. I will attempt in the brief time available to respond to as many as possible of the various comments made by Deputies.</P>
      <P>The movement of Europe towards full economic and monetary union and the adoption of a single currency, the euro, is not simply a question of how any particular country or interest can gain an immediate benefit or how they would be affected by any immediate cost.  It is a quantum leap, as it were, in the construction of a European Community based on peace and prosperity. Deputies, including my Government colleagues, have spoken eloquently about this aspect of EMU, particularly in the broader political context. I would like to reiterate the long-term strategic and economic rationale for Ireland's long-standing commitment to European integration.</P>
      <P>It is in this context I must reject any opposition to the motion I put down.  In the first place the question has been decided by the people in a referendum when the vote in favour was 70 per cent. I do not intend, as Minister for Finance, to pursue a course that contradicts the clearly expressed view of the people.  Furthermore, if we are considered to fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency, it is not open to us to act as if we had an opt-out.</P>
      <P>Nobody is pretending there will not be challenges in EMU but we have to think of these in the context of what life would be like for any EU member state which remains outside EMU, particularly a small country like ours whose prosperity and growth fundamentally depend on trade and access to overseas markets.  There are those who say we should wait and see.  They express the fear that in various ways Ireland is not ready to be part of a European economic and monetary union.  In that respect I refer first to the views of the European Commission.  One of the fundamental roles of the Commission is as guardian of the European treaties and it is a role that is not taken lightly.  It is the recommendation of the Commission that Ireland fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency, a recommendation based on both its convergence report and on the report prepared by the EMI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More generally, it is clear that Ireland is ready to take part in economic and monetary union. The third stage of EMU will begin on 1 January 1999.  Most of the EU will take part.  Already the <Col N="764" /> rest of Europe and the world are getting ready to deal with this new economic entity as well as the new global currency.</P>
    <P>Irish business is well placed to compete in the euro zone.  The performance of firms in Ireland in the European and international markets is clear proof of that.  Obviously we must continue to build on their achievements.  We may be fit but we must strive to be fitter.  The social partnership framework, and particularly the work of the National Competitiveness Council established under Partnership 2000, provides the basis for ongoing improvements to our competitiveness. That framework for partnership is a significant comparative advantage for Ireland.  I must therefore ask the House to reject Deputy Gormley's amendment to the motion.</P>
    <P>Deputies expressed their concern about inflationary pressures and some comments were made also about the revaluation of the Irish pound's ERM central rate.  I addressed this question in detail when I commended the motion to the House.  I do not propose to repeat myself unnecessarily.  I have outlined already the measures being implemented by myself and the Central Bank to ensure Ireland's impressive track record of price stability is preserved.  The adoption of a package of measures is the best way to achieve that objective.  I am confident that the approach adopted by the Government and the bank is the most appropriate one to ensure continued price stability while maintaining balance and sustainable growth.</P>
    <P>The revaluation of the central rate of the Irish pound is an important element of Ireland's overall economic and budgetary policy stance.  This policy stance will help to ensure that our economic success continues in a balanced and sustainable way and will put Ireland in a strong position to participate successfully in EMU.  Deputies will not disagree that there was risk of a significant increase in inflation and that we needed to take action to address this risk.  I am confident that the revaluation, taken together with our budgetary policy and the Central Bank's intention to continue its present monetary policy, will put us in a good position to meet the challenges facing the economy.</P>
    <P>This revaluation was an appropriate response to short-term inflation possibilities in the economy as an element in a balanced package of policy responses.  Taken together with the expressed intentions of our budgetary policy in 1998 and 1999, and the Central Bank's monetary policy orientation, it will ensure that Ireland continues to be in a strong position to participate successfully in EMU.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised matters relating to the European Central Bank.  Many of these issues were discussed at length in the debate on the Central Bank Bill, 1998, but I would like to respond to some specific points.  In relation to accountability, the various provisions protecting the independence of the ECB which have been incorporated in the Irish legislation apply only to the Central <Col N="765" /> Bank and its Governor's role in monetary policy. Arrangements for the accountability of the Central Bank in a supervisory role will not be affected.  The Governor of the Central Bank will continue to attend, if so requested, before a select committee of the Oireachtas and furnish to that committee such information as it may request having due regard to the independence of the bank and the provisions of the treaty.</P>
    <P>We are on the threshold of one of the most momentous changes in the Irish and European economies.  Our participation has received support across the range of Irish opinion including the social partners, the vast majority of public representatives and the people.  Our priority now is to ensure that we respond to the challenges and make the most of the opportunities open to us. The recommendation of the European Commission is that we are ready, a view widely shared in Ireland and elsewhere.  That view is also endorsed by the Government and I ask this House to respond by supporting the motion.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe asked about the difference between the forecast for inflation made by the Central Bank in its report and my Department's forecast at the time of the budget.  The forecast of 2 per cent made in December was based on standard assumptions in relation to exchange and interest rates.  This forecast will be revised, as usual, in the course of the year in the light of developments.  An updated forecast will be published in the mid-year economic review and outlook. However, price developments so far this year have not undermined my confidence in the budget's forecast for 1998.  The consumer price index has risen by 1.7 per cent in January and 1.8 per cent in February, while the latest year on year figures for manufacturing output home sales show no change.

      <P>I express my unqualified support of the logical and measured response of the Minister to Deputy Upton's Bill.  It is a pity Deputy Upton and his colleagues did not adopt the same pragmatic approach in presenting the case for a review of the licensing laws.  This Bill is blatant <Col N="766" /> political opportunism.  The Labour Party must be running out of worthwhile issues to promote.</P>
      <P>Up to June last year the Labour Party had spent most of the 1990s in Government, first with Fianna Fáil and then with Fine Gael and Democratic Left as part of the rainbow coalition.  During all that time the vintners' representatives and others were actively lobbying for change in the drink licensing laws which were as anomalous and impractical then as they are today.  During those years Deputy Upton had many opportunities to speak on various issues.  He regularly availed of them.  Unfortunately, he did not speak in any depth on the matter under discussion.  Neither did he avail of any opportunity to introduce a Private Members' Bill relevant to the trade.  It was not on his or the Labour Party's agenda at that time.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice at the time rightly referred the whole issue for a complete review to a subcommittee of the Select Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, that is, the committee on Security and Legislation of which I am a member.  That subcommittee has specific terms of reference and its brief would embody not only the times pubs should open and close but also the complete maze of laws governing the licensed trade, which are vast and complex.</P>
      <P>The Deputy would be well advised to have a rethink and, even at this late stage, withdraw his Bill.  This would be in line with what I know to be the wishes of the majority of Members.  I also venture to say that a decision to do so would be welcomed by trade union members in the licensed trade.  I am advised that their members have very strong reservations about certain provisions of this proposed legislation.  It is a pity the Deputy did not seek the views of this important body.  They made their submissions and they are entitled to prior consultation on matters of vital importance to livelihood and conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>In a few short weeks a seminar will be held, cosponsored by the Department of Justice, Equality and law Reform and the Dublin Institute of Technology. It will investigate and debate matters relevant to the proposed legislation which will be brought before the House.  Knowledge gained from the input at this session will have a major bearing on the issues in question in the House today.  We will have the benefit of a diversity of opinion on a wide variety of points which could have a crucial impact on proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>As others said last night, the Deputy is jumping the gun.  He is presenting his Bill to the House prior to exploring the multiplicity of matters which will be affected by his proposals, and there are many.  Grabbing headlines should not be the motivation in the presentation of legislation.  I would have a less critical view if the Deputy had shown the same enthusiasm for change during his membership of the rainbow coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many matters to be debated in the context of the introduction of the Bill which are relevant to the licensed trade.  There are changes <Col N="767" /> with which I do not agree.  One is that it would become legal to open pubs on Good Friday as proposed by Deputy Upton.  I see no significant financial reason for opening on that day.  Neither do I see it contributing to a tourism boom.  I strongly oppose a move in this direction because of the religious significance attached to this very important day.  This proposition would offend many.  It may be trendy to undermine and erode core Irish values.  Some people would like to do away with time honoured customs and beloved traditions associated with all that is best in our society.  They are entitled to their views, but I am entitled to mine.  I see no merit in this suggestion.</P>
    <P>We must take note of and debate the requests for the amending of closing hours.  This is currently being done by the committee of which I am a member.  Over 57 submissions have been made to the select committee.  Detailed observations were made by individuals and by the Vintners' Association, Bord Fáilte, the Hotel Federation, the Restaurant Association, RGDATA, the Wine and Spirit Association, IMRO, Irish Dance and Entertainment Industry, the MANDATE trade union, chambers of commerce, the Law Society, the Bar Council, the Garda Síochána, the Road Safety Association, Mothers Against Drink Drivers and many more. The above groups are a sample of the diversity of input from the general public and from law enforcement and professional bodies.  Can we dismiss their detailed submissions without carefully considering the merits and demerits of their separate views?  I think not.</P>
    <P>Opinions were expressed on matters relevant to many aspects of the trade including pub opening and closing times, bar extensions and drinking up times, off-licences in their own premises, in supermarkets or filling stations etc., tourism in the context of the sale of liquor in restaurants and the sale of food in pubs, hotel licences, theatre licences, special exemptions licences, transfer licences, underage drinking, identification cards, noise pollution, etc.  The list is as long as my arm. These are all relevant to the reform of licensing hours.  Are we to support a Bill which precludes discussion on most of those items?  I advise not. We owe it to all who made contributions to the select committee to ensure that their valuable submissions are discussed and evaluated.  We must afford concerned parties a hearing when they have taken the time and trouble to put pen to paper on matters relevant to themselves and the public.  We do not have a God-given right to determine public opinion.  We must listen as well as legislate, and we must be advised by our committees and committees of this House.  We should not set up bodies and committees to examine issues if we will not allow the public the democratic right to a hearing as is their right.  If we allowed this approach to prevail, Oireachtas committees would lose their credibility and the difficult and painstaking work of all future Oireachtas committees would be undermined.  That would be <Col N="768" /> a heavy price to pay for blatant political opportunism.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his express concern to ensure ample debating time on the whole issue.  We cannot legislate on one aspect of the licensed trade without considering the impact on the overall scene.  We must use the consultative process.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to support the Minister's position and to know that Deputy Flanagan, the very able chairman of our subcommittee, has indicated that Fine Gael will also support the Government position tonight when, for the first time, I will be voting with Fine Gael.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I too support the Minister's position.  The number of opinions should not be an excuse for delaying legislation.  This area must be examined, and we are examining it at present.</P>
      <P>There is an argument for extending opening hours.  The development of this industry and of European law indicates there is a need for new licensing laws.  Bar extensions and the preparation of food must also be looked at in the European context and in the light of what consumers require.  The majority of consumers want longer opening hours but they also want the grey area of bar extensions and food preparation dealt with by legislation.  The abolition of Sunday closing from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. seems sensible, but opening pubs and clubs on Good Friday is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The critical part of this and any future legislation in the area relates to off-licences.  There are off-licences in many major stores, and these should be governed by clear laws.  Off-licences are a cause of worry to parents because much under age drinking starts with young people getting older friends to purchase drink for consumption elsewhere.  There are similar problems in supermarkets.</P>
      <P>There are many submissions on this subject that will have to be taken into consideration.  Off-licence activity should be monitored and curtailed. The concept of identity cards should also be addressed.  Education in relation to drink is not dealt with in this Bill, and that has to be part of an overall package to confront the social problems caused by drink.  Parents and various organisations are demanding such a package and we must respond.  I support the Minister and hope we do not have to wait too long for detailed legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time.  Members have lacerated Deputy Upton for his Bill, but I compliment him.  No matter how flawed a Bill is, it takes a certain amount of work before it can be introduced.  I agree with some aspects of the Bill, though there is much I disagree with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate comes at an opportune time.  A <Col N="769" /> committee of the House is discussing this matter, but there is public unease about this.  There seem to be different opening hours in different counties. If we are to believe the newspapers some western counties have to serve last pints a little earlier than the rest of us.  Any changes brought in will have to be balanced and uniform.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton's Bill suggests extending opening hours to 12.30 a.m. throughout the year.  The present closing time of 11.30 p.m. is too early, particularly during the summer.  People work during the long summer nights in rural areas and not long after entering a pub they are asked to finish. There is something special about getting a drink after closing time, and almost any person who takes a drink &mdash; there are a good few in this House &mdash; cannot say they have never had a drink in a public house when they should not have had. It is part of Irish culture.  Forbidden fruit is always sweetest.</P>
    <P>I support the abolition of Sunday closing.  It places unnecessary restriction on publicans. There has been tremendous growth in sports on television, particularly on the Sky channel.  Football matches are a regular feature of Sundays and many people like to have a few drinks while watching the game.  By 2 p.m. it may be only half time in the game and customers will be asked to leave.  It is the same for GAA matches in the summer. I cannot see why this should be tolerated.  I await the outcome of deliberations of the committee dealing with this.</P>
    <P>Another provision of Deputy Upton's Bill allows pubs to open on Good Friday, but I am totally opposed to this.  There has been a trend in this area in the recent years; another example is the move to get rid of the Angelus bell, though it lasts only 60 seconds.  Pubs are asked to close on only Christmas Day and Good Friday every year, even if they do not all close.  There is a tradition that people change a little, perhaps through spiritual intervention, when it comes to Good Friday, and we should allow that day to remain special by leaving the pubs closed.</P>
    <P>The debate revolves around how much regulation of the area is needed.  I doubt that two Deputies would agree with all that is in this Bill but the area needs change and there must be greater consultation.  The consumer is an important part of this process but has not been mentioned much so far.  Consumers, pub owners, hoteliers, restaurant owners, owners of off-licences and club bar managements represent different enterprises which compete for this trade, and before imposing major changes we should consult them.</P>
    <P>I would have serious reservations about asking bar staff to work longer hours.  They already work very unsociable hours.  When most people finish work they can go home and spend the evening with their families.  Pub staff go to work when others are going out to enjoy themselves and many of them do not finish work until 1 a.m. If opening hours are extended, bar staff will have to work longer hours or publicans will have to <Col N="770" /> introduce a shift system.  In any event it will increase the cost of drink.  When the price of the pint increases by 20p to 25p to facilitate this change, the punter might take note.  Radical changes are necessary in the licensing laws and, while I welcome this debate, there should be greater consultation with interested parties before any decisions are made.</P>
    <P>The state of the toilets in some public houses is disgraceful.  Butcher shops have come under great scrutiny from the health authorities in recent years.  It would be no harm if they spent some time visiting public houses to inspect their toilets. Many publicans could clean up their act in that regard and adhere to certain standards.  However, the majority of publicans keep their premises in good order.</P>
    <P>Underage drinking has become very common. In almost every town there are particular pubs where the young people drink.  While it can be difficult to determine someone's age, the identity card is not utilised to its fullest.  There should be a big clamp-down on underage drinking.  There is nothing worse than seeing 15 or 16 year olds drunk in the street after being served alcohol in a public house.  Publicans have responsibilities as well as rights.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the subcommittee publishing its recommendations in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the fact that this issue has come before the House, I would have preferred if Dr. Upton had waited until the subcommittee published its recommendations. The Bill is worthwhile in so far as it turns the spotlight on our licensing laws and, as a third generation publican, I welcome the opportunity to address the issue.  In the past I blamed previous legislators for bringing inadequate legislation before the House.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that a subcommittee of the House is engaged in a broad review of our licensing laws. Unfortunately, the Bill ignores the subcommittee's consultative process which has been taking place for some time.  The Deputy should have waited until the committee had carried out its work before introducing the Bill.  I am satisfied the subcommittee has consulted all the interested parties, but I do not believe all the necessary groupings were involved in the preparation of the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the subcommittee invited submissions from the various vintners groups as well as other groupings involved in the licensing laws. I recently attended the Laois vintners AGM at which vintners stated they were satisfied their submissions to the subcommittee were being examined as part of the overall review.  I am sure they were alarmed that this Bill was introduced before all the submissions were made.  The views of the trade, the public, the Garda Síochána, the unions and all other interested groups should be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the work of the subcommittee, in particular my fellow townsman, Deputy Flanagan, <Col N="771" /> who is chairman.  I also thank the subcommittee of the previous Dáil for its work.  I appreciate this is a complex issue and I thank the Minister for the position he has adopted.  The licensing laws date back to 1833 and comprise 50 Acts.  I also compliment those who made submissions to the subcommittee.</P>
    <P>A number of changes have taken place in the public house trade.  I recall, in particular, the change in Sunday evening licensing laws.  Until recently public houses closed at 10 p.m. on Sundays and there were the usual fears and complaints about the extension to 11 p.m. The one hour extension has not brought about great social upheaval.  Publicans are a responsible group of people and, having campaigned vigorously for extended hours, I am sure they will control their premises.  Some years ago &mdash; before my time &mdash; public houses remained closed on St. Patrick's Day.  While the rest of the world drowned the shamrock the Irish pubs remained closed. However, as a result of submissions from the various interested groups, public houses were allowed to open on St. Patrick's Day.  It is now a family day out and the pre-parade drink is common practice.</P>
    <P>Over the years publicans have actively aided and abetted our tourism industry.  The tourist visit to Irish pubs is a regular occurrence.  Various drink companies highlight the potential attraction of visiting Irish pubs and I would also venture to say it has meant extra profits for publicans.  Many pubs now serve food, which has also helped the tourism industry.  This has come about because publicans have invested in their properties.  The extra cost involved in extending opening hours will be met by the publican's family.  Most of the high level of service we hear about in the country pub is offered by the publican, his spouse and family.  The extra hour would not be considered a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I support most of the issues in the Bill, but as a publican I am opposed to any change in the laws for Good Friday or Christmas Day.  I would have preferred if Deputy Upton had waited until the subcommittee submitted its recommendation. However, I am pleased the issue is being highlighted and I was delighted to hear the Minister's comments yesterday evening.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Upton for presenting this Bill.  As I am sure all Deputies will appreciate, regardless of whether they agree with the content of the Bill, it is always a major achievement for an Opposition Deputy to bring forward a Private Members' Bill, given the scant resources available, the time needed to carry out research and the necessary consultation with legal <Col N="772" /> advisers and interested parties.  I realise this Bill has had a long gestation and has been prepared with great care.  Deputy Upton has a long history of interest in the quality, type and opening and closing times of licensed premises in Dublin and throughout the country.  He is acutely aware of the impact restrictive opening and closing hours of licensed premises have had on our economy. He has often commented on the antisocial nature of late night drinking and the consequent problems of young people spilling out on to the streets having consumed three or four pints very quickly.</P>
      <P>The Bill recommends reasonable and responsible reform of the closing and opening times of licensed premises.  The proposed 12.30 a.m. closing time would harmonise the winter and summer closing time difference with the retention of the 10.30 a.m. opening time.  Deputy Upton's Bill also proposes the abolition of the much abused holy hour and an end to the mandatory closing of licensed premises on Good Friday.  It is fair to say that customers of all licensed premises and clubs and the tourism industry, especially in Dublin, Cork and other urban centres, would benefit greatly by the changes proposed in the Licensed Premises (Opening Hours) Bill.  These proposals would also provide a more sociable ambience for consumers enjoying a late evening drink.  In an age when the customer is king, we cannot continue to refuse to accept the wishes and the needs of the consumer.</P>
      <P>Throughout history the management of alcoholic drink has proved to be a difficult issue. In the 19th century, there were massive crusades against alcoholism led by Father Matthew. Thomas Davis, one of the great men of 1848, in his <i>Nation</i> newspaper, identified abuse of drink as, perhaps, the Irish nation's greatest social weakness.  Families and homes throughout the 19th century were wrecked and the ugly evil of domestic violence and abuse of wives and children was nothing short of barbaric.</P>
      <P>Throughout most of this century, the State has wrestled with the management of alcohol as one of the two social drugs of choice.  In more deprived areas, the abuse of alcohol in the past exerted a destructive influence on the lives of families and a major component of poverty in such areas has been the huge proportion of family income spent on alcohol.  The current licensing laws and opening hours have undoubtedly contributed to making the control of alcohol abuse more difficult and for this reason particularly I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Upton noted that a decade ago, the then Minister for Justice, Gerry Collins, abolished some of the most archaic remnants of the administration of social drinking.  However, the current licensing laws clearly need further reform. Irish society has changed immensely for the better over recent decades and a more mature attitude to alcohol has developed among most of the population.  As noted last night, the Irish population ranks about midway in the EU table of <i>per capita</i> alcohol consumption which is well below <Col N="773" /> that of countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the countries of central Europe, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic.  The percentage of adults who do not drink alcohol is, at 24 per cent, well in line with the OECD average.</P>
    <P>The old boorish and sexist elements of drinking are also buried at last.  Male only bars have been eliminated.  It is not too long ago &mdash; just over a decade &mdash; that it was common to see women being refused a drink in male only bars in my constituency.  The general convivial and community nature of social drinking in recent decades, especially in the past ten years, has, with good food supply, turned many pubs into the key community facilities of the district.  One of the hostelries in my constituency, the Baldoyle House, made history a few years ago by providing a cre che for parents enjoying Sunday lunch.</P>
    <P>Much remains to be done.  The far better social atmosphere provided by the sale of food with drink is something we need to encourage.  It is astonishing that Dublin, with one third of the country's population, has less than 10 per cent of the drinks licences.  A proliferation of smaller, proprietor run, community public houses, preferably with good food available most of the day, should be encouraged by legislation.  It is also imperative that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Competition Authority should prevent the massive Guinness Diageo multinational from taking complete monopoly control of the drinks distribution business by absorbing United Beverages.</P>
    <P>The modest reforming measures in the Bill will improve the current outdated and inappropriate opening hours.  The proposed year round closing time of 12.30 a.m. will end many of the current irregularities and offer a more civilised choice to customers.  It is well known the current system of granting late night exemptions has made a mockery of the legal opening hours, and Deputy Upton's estimate of 500,000 exemptions over the past decades shows how the current system of seeking exemptions has been circumvented by proprietors trying to make it a more humane system.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the tradition in recent years whereby the public like to go out to the local pub for a late evening drink, but because of opening hours, especially during winter, there is usually a frantic rush by most drinkers to finish their last drink.  For drinkers with visiting tourists, there is the added embarrassment of loud, monotonous calls to drink up plus the strategic opening of large doors to freeze drinkers out of the bar.  The seriously negative impact of this behaviour on our tourism industry is self-evident and should be addressed.  In Dublin's northside, many of my constituents have noticed the mass evacuation of young drinkers from bars at approximately 11.30 each weekend night.  Many of these young drinkers, having clearly thrown back a number of drinks very quickly, totter out on the footpath to frantically search for a taxi into town to continue their social evening.  The Bill should <Col N="774" /> contribute to a more mature facility for these young people.  One of the most welcome provisions in section 8 is that it permits the courts to extend or restrict opening hours in accordance with local needs, including those of the tourism industry and for local celebration.  It allows the population of a residential district to petition the court to restrict opening hours in the event of customers behaving badly or creating a serious nuisance in the neighbourhood.  One of the most important changes which even critics of the Bill have welcomed is the ending of the so-called holy hour on Sundays.  This recognises the positive changes in society, such as the family Sunday lunch and the crucial importance of the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I am aware Deputy Upton has consulted widely with the MANDATE trade union and workers in the licensed trade.  It is critical the workforce should not be adversely affected in an already difficult and demanding job.  Working hours are long already and bar staff need a wide range of skills to cope with a diverse range of consumers in a social situation.  A large part of the Bill, sections 9 to 19 rightly sets out the rights of bar workers in the extended opening hours.  Section 11 states employees are not obliged to do added work time without their consent and section 12 states an employee who opts out of such work cannot be discriminated against.  Employees carrying out such work will be entitled to holiday time within the following week and to be paid overtime of at least time and a half.  In section 14, employers must give four days' notice of added work time and employees in return must give three days' notice.  It is heartening Deputy Upton has included a right of appeal by an aggrieved employee to a rights commissioner if he or she believes his or her rights under the Bill have been breached.  The commissioner may order the offending employer to pay compensation of up to ten weeks' salary to the employee.  The provisions of Part II are comprehensive and offer a valuable protection to employees with the operation of the new hours.</P>
    <P>The Licensed Premises (Opening Hours) Bill is well conceived and well researched legislation which offers important reform in Irish social life. A similar approach by other countries such as Scotland and New Zealand has had beneficial civilising effects in those countries.  Many of the elements to which I referred, such as the mass evacuation of pubs at 11.30 p.m. by young people and the consequent noisy streets, have been addressed by similar reforms in Scotland.  On balance, it is legislation which the Minister should adopt.  I am sure it will be equally successful as those of Scotland and New Zealand.  I commend the legislation to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> I thank Deputy Broughan for sharing his time.  I compliment Deputy Upton for bringing forward this legislation.  Despite all the controversy surrounding it, Fine Gael will support it.  As Deputy Moloney stated, the number <Col N="775" /> of people anxious to participate in this debate exemplifies the high degree of interest in the issue, the central role of the pub in Irish life and the fact that there is a cross-party consensus on the long overdue need to radically reappraise and amend pub opening hours.  Consolidating legislation is needed which deals in a comprehensive fashion with the area of liquor licensing.  After that is in place we need a uniform enforcement of the law instead of a total variation in standards &mdash; rigid application in some areas and literally no application in other areas.  The present system, based on a series of laws put in place by various Acts, is a shambles.  Reference has been made to the founding Act of l833.  There are also the Acts of 1835, l836, 1845, 1854, 1855, 1860, 1862, 1863, 1864, 1872, 1874 and l877.  In the 20th century there are have Intoxicating Liquor Licensing Acts from l902, l909, l910, 1924, 1927, 1943, 1946, 1953, 1960, 1962, 1981 and 1988.  It is no wonder there is confusion, in relation to the body of law governing the liquor trade.  Many of the Acts build on the preceding Acts by reinforcing or strengthening them in some manner.  For example, section 13 of the Licensing Act, l872, introduces a penalty for the publican who permits drunkenness or any violent quarrelsome or riotous conduct to take place in his premises or who sells any intoxicating liquor to any drunken person.  Section 14 of the 1872 Act introduces a £20 fine for any licensed person who knowingly permits his premises to be the habitual resort of, or place of meeting of, reputed prostitutes whether the object of their resorting or meeting is or is not prostitution.  He shall, if he allows them to remain there, or remain longer than is necessary for the purpose of obtaining reasonable refreshment, be liable to a penalty not exceeding £20 for the first offence and £40 for a second and subsequent offence. These penalties are doubled in section 30 of the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, l924.  Section 10 of the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871, provides that every person who occupies or keeps any lodging house, any beer house, public house or other house or place where intoxicating liquors are sold, or any place of public entertainment, or public resort who knowingly permits or knowingly suffers them to meet or assemble there, or knowingly allows them to deposit goods therein, having reasonable cause for believing them to be stolen, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquors Act, l988, deals with the sale of intoxicating liquor to those under 18 years of age.  Section 34 of the same Act prohibits children unaccompanied by parents or a guardian to be on a licensed premises. The law prohibits the granting of exemptions on Saturdays.  The result is that hotels all over the country which run various functions, including dinner dances on Saturday nights, are technically in breach of the licensing laws if they serve one drink past midnight or if members of the public are on the premises after midnight consuming <Col N="776" /> alcohol, bought on the premises, prior to that hour.  In such a farcical situation the vast majority of sensible gardaí have had to turn a blind eye. The nonsense of this is further highlighted in that the same premises, which cannot get an exemption on Saturday night-Sunday morning can get an exemption on Sunday night-Monday morning without any difficulty.  Senior citizens who must exit from the pub at 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. on a Saturday night are met at their home doorstep by their teenage grandchildren who can be served in discos, night clubs and clubs until the early hours of the morning.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thorough and painstaking work being undertaken by the sub-committee of the Joint Committee of Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, of which Deputy Flanagan is chairman, in sifting through the mountain of legislation and evaluating the written and oral submissions.  They have done tremendous work in preparing the ground for this debate which will resume after Easter and for whatever legislation will eventually emerge to bring in a sensible regime to govern this area.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the problem of teenage drinking.  There is no doubt that there is an orgy of teenage drinking.  When first-year students of 12 and 13 years of age arrive at post primary schools on a Monday morning smelling of stale alcohol fumes and visibly hungover it is time to examine and reappraise the situation. Unfortunately that is the position in virtually every post primary school in the country.  There is no doubt the law on under age drinking is being disregarded in most cases.</P>
    <P>There is also the other side of the coin, parental responsibility.  The performance of parents in this regard is scandalously negligent.  There is absolutely no point in expecting the State to be the moral parental guardian if parents have not sufficient interest to insist on their offspring being in at a reasonable time.  I am not talking about midnight or 12.30 a.m. If they do not collect them, do not know their means of transport home, do not check their condition, do not know at what time they arrive home they are guilty of criminal negligence.  If children know there are no boundaries, no limits, no parental checks and no parental interest, who can blame them if they decide to indulge?  The streets of urban and rural Ireland at 3 a.m., 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. every Sunday morning are littered with bottles, beer cans, bodies, vomit, urine and blood.  These young people are the mirror of the so-called modern Ireland of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>Parents are not being fair to their children by not establishing and insisting on limits.  I do not know where we went wrong but I ask what has happened to the basic requirements of parental maturity and responsibility.  I am a former teacher and taught until 12 years ago.  At that time it was the norm that teachers attended secondary, vocational, comprehensive and community school graduation balls.  It was <i>a sine qua non.</i>  Nowadays teachers are not invited and, if they were so <Col N="777" /> invited, would decline because of the embarrassing performances that inevitably take place and which have become part of the graduation ball scene.</P>
    <P>The present splurge of teenage drunkenness is serious and is wreaking havoc on society.  The rack and the ruin has yet to be seen in many cases.  The combination of under age drinking, late drinking and takeaways where people disgorge from discos and dance halls at 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. means that many of the streets in rural Ireland have become no-go areas.  Many senior citizens are no longer able to enjoy peace and quiet in the tranquillity of their homes.  We have a major public order problem which is fuelled to a large extent by uncontrolled under age drinking.</P>
    <P>The law has a role.  I do not want to pre-empt the steering committee's recommendations in its report.  It is clear that sensible consolidating legislation is required.  People will argue it should be <i>laissez faire,</i> that pubs should be allowed to remain open for as long as they wish.  They cite the United States and the European situation in support of same.  For some reason in the whole area of alcohol consumption we have yet to come of age as a nation.</P>
    <P>I agree with the argument for extending the hours.  However, there is something in the Irish psychology to indicate that if the opening hours are extended to 1 a.m., people will not arrive in the pub until 12.45 a.m. If the opening hours are extended to 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., people will not arrive in the pub until 1.45 a.m. or 2.45 a.m. I do not know the reason but that is the reality.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to enforce all the laws uniformly.  It is impossible to understand the present selective purge in relation to the strict enforcement of the licensing laws in the four counties of Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Clare.  I have no problem with enforcing the law rigidly across the board.  However, I understand that for this zero tolerance additional Garda personnel are not required.  It is a case of sending an unequivocal message to publicans in these counties that they must close on time.  The corollary of this message, and the policy which is in contrast to it, has to be that after hours drinking is tolerated in the other 22 counties.  This selective application of the law is what happens in totalitarian regimes.  The law must have national application or else it should be scrapped.  What is happening is unfair and, perhaps, unconstitutional in that the principle of fair and even-handed enforcement of the law is being flouted.</P>
    <P>An argument is put forward to extend the licensing laws from the point of view of tourism. I do not agree with this.  I have a theory that most tourists like to go to bed early and get up early to avail of whatever is on offer from the tour companies.  The majority of pubs would get very few tourists hanging around at 11 or 12 o'clock at night.</P>
    <P>I support the spirit of this Bill but the concerns of MANDATE are genuine.  There is an erosion of professionalism in the bar trade as witnessed <Col N="778" /> by the fact that very few apprentices are doing the three year Dublin Institute of Technology course.  There is a major danger that extending the licensing hours will lead to growing casualisation, double-jobbing and a further development of the black economy.  I appreciate that Deputy Upton has tried to redress this in sections 9 to 19.  However, far more dialogue is needed with MANDATE.  There is obvious abuse.  Some floor staff are being paid £5 per night in Dublin to work from 7 p.m. until 1 a.m. This indicates how the black economy is thriving in the trade.  I urge the Government to give serious consideration to the Bill.  I support the broad thrust of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking in support of the thrust of the Bill.  I congratulate Deputy Upton for bringing it forward and keeping the pressure on for modernisation in this area.  Three years ago I was asked to present the Pub of the Year contest.  Having said a few words on the role of the pub in Ireland, the quality of food, cleanliness and the value to tourism I could not think of anything else to say. I then spoke of how the licensing laws were out of date and the world fell in on top of me.  I was verbally slaughtered by everyone with the exception of Paddy Murray in <i>The Star.</i>  MANDATE also came down on me and trade unionists said how dare I fool around with their hours of work. They were inveterately opposed to it and so on. The mothers of ten also had a field day denouncing me.  It is amazing that three years later we are on the verge of legislating to bring the law out of disrepute and into some kind of synch with modern developments.  Notwithstanding the Minister's rejection of the Bill, we will introduce such legislation in the lifetime of this Dáil.</P>
      <P>I fundamentally challenge the notion that if more drinking time is available people will drink more and we will become a nation of drunkards. It is like saying that if there are too many days of sunshine in the summer people will not come back from St. Stephen's Green at lunchtime because it is so congenial and the weather is so fine.  The amount that one drinks does not relate to the duration of the licensing hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very dark side to drink.  However, people who have a problem with drink will have such a problem whether the licensing hours are as they are or as proposed in the Bill.  I do not believe the arguments I was subjected to at the time.  I received some pretty horrific charges in letters.  Some were genuinely intended such as those which claimed that it would cause more mayhem on the roads and more people would be killed.  I do not believe this.  There is an arguable case for the opposite.  There is a practice, especially in Dublin, of disgorging people onto the streets at the same time and bringing in traffic laws which say that they should not drive but should get a taxi or public transport.  However, public transport is either finished or unavailable and a person cannot get a taxi because everyone is looking for one at the same time.  We are supposed <Col N="779" /> to believe this is a contribution to road safety but I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>Many other jurisdictions have extended their licensing hours and have not gone to ruin.  Everyone has not become alcoholic because there are longer drinking hours.  The argument has been won and it is a question of looking at the detail. I have no firm views on the detail.  I would settle for an hour's extension on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and an end to the holy hour. People should accept that the holy hour ended in practice a long time ago.  I do not know of the wisdom of including Good Friday in the Bill.  This may cause offence to some people.  It is a special day in the religious calendar and some people would feel it ought not be included and perhaps they are right.  However, the thrust of the Bill is right.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Higgins said but I do not agree with him on tourism.  There are different categories of tourist.  It is an important industry and there is no doubt there is a kind of tourist who is utterly perplexed by our licensing laws and who wishes to have the facility to drink after a show or going to the theatre and so on. From the point of view of tourism as a huge money spinner and the role it plays in this economy, we have to deal with this issue.  We should not confuse this with lager louts who pay us an occasional visit because they get 20 per cent more for their pound sterling now than they did a short time ago.  One can bet that people who wish to come here and act the lager lout will do so whether one calls a halt to drinking at 11 p.m. or midnight.  This argument does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>There have been objections to this Bill from trade unions.  Deputy Higgins raised a number of considerations which are uppermost in the minds of MANDATE.  Deputy Upton has gone out of his way in Part II to try to provide for the rights of workers in the industry being protected and that is right and necessary.  Proper rostered shift work will be introduced.  That is what is required and it is capable of being negotiated with those who are doing well in the business at present.  The trade union in this area is strong.</P>
    <P>If I had time, I would say a few words about the question of licensing, another issue with which I was concerned in the past.  I congratulate Deputy Upton and I am sorry the Government is unable to accept his Bill.  I hope it will bring forward its own Bill as early as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the stance taken by the Minister and the Government which is opposed to the Bill, the thrust of which will probably be dealt with in future legislation.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, there is a need for change but this should occur only in the context of a total review of the liquor licensing laws.  Deputy Rabbitte mentioned that when he made similar suggestions three years ago the roof fell in on top of him. <Col N="780" /> Providing for an extension of opening hours only, as suggested by Deputy Upton, is the wrong approach.  It should form part of an overall package.</P>
      <P>This issue is being examined by an all-party committee to which I have recently been appointed under the chairmanship of Deputy Flanagan to whom I pay tribute.  It is the committee's intention to present a package of measures within the next few months based on the outcome of its review of the liquor licensing laws.  I hope the Government will then be in a position to introduce changes which reflect the social changes in society to which the Minister and other speakers alluded.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister intends to hold a seminar on 24 April.  This will give all those involved in the industry and the many groups which appeared before the committee an opportunity to make their views known.</P>
      <P>There are some aspects of the Bill with which I fundamentally disagree.  I do not agree with the proposed changes in relation to Good Friday, that public houses should be allowed to open at 10.30 am on Sundays or remain open for an extra hour on Sunday nights.  We should not go down this road, although an exception could perhaps be made in the case of bank holidays and so forth.  I have had the opportunity to express my views on these matters at the committee.  As far as I am aware, consumers are not demanding that public houses should be allowed to open at 10.30 a.m. on Sundays.  There is limited demand in relation to Good Friday.  I would adopt a much more restrictive approach.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, everyone has a view on this subject.  There is a need to strike the correct balance.  Issues such as alcohol abuse and the way we approach drink are a source of great concern to many people.</P>
      <P>Under-age drinking is a major problem throughout the country.  It has social implications. The by-laws relating to parks in the Fingal County Council area have had to be changed. Each park has had to be cleared of its shrubbery and trees due to anti-social activity.  This is a sad reflection on society.  I am aware from contributions at the committee that the problem is not confined to north County Dublin.  The committee has many ideas on how it should be approached. The sale of alcohol in off-licences and supermarkets and the enforcement of the law by the Garda Síochána must be addressed in the review.  To cherry-pick a few ideas from previous reports is the wrong approach.  Perhaps Deputy Upton will indicate what response he received to his proposals in recent weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because people's habits have changed and there is greater competition in the market I agree with Deputy Upton that there is a need for change and that the consumer is entitled to expect some changes to be made in the law after a period of ten years but many view the extension of opening hours as a negative development.  As I said, I hope this will form part of a package of <Col N="781" /> measures to be introduced by the Minister later this year following the completion of the review of the liquor licensing laws.  The package should address under-age drinking and the hours at which people leave public houses located in neighbourhoods.  The issue of education should also be addressed, while the provision relating to the holy hour on Sundays should be placed on a proper legal footing.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the Bill are welcome and I hope they will form part of future legislation. While I am not in favour of a blanket extension of opening hours, the towns in my constituency are developing, in conjunction with the local authority and the Dublin Tourist Board, a marketing strategy to attract tourists to the region. To this end I am in favour of flexibility in the law in terms of extended opening hours.  It is premature to deal with this Bill and the Minister is correct to oppose it.  I hope to take part in the sub-committee's review of the liquor laws and in bringing forward proposals for comprehensive legislation to deal with all the issues pertaining to the licensing and liquor laws.  I hope the Minister will introduce comprehensive legislation in this session.</P>

      <P>We knew this matter was going to come up for discussion over the coming months, but it is being debated sooner than expected.  Deputy Upton has jumped the gun in introducing this Bill.  I was not part of the committee which discussed this issue and which will be reporting within a number of months.  It would have been proper to wait for the committee to produce its considered views.</P>
      <P>Last night somebody said we are all experts when it comes to licensing laws and everybody has their own point of view.  I was secretary of a sports club for seven years and I thought I knew something about legislation governing clubs, pubs and restaurants and the associated hassle and difficulties, including going to court to get extension licences, providing menus, etc.  I remember gardaí coming to see a sample meal on the night of a function.  Chicken and chips and a few peas was not enough and we got into big trouble over it.  I do not know what is happening now, as some pubs stop serving shortly after 11 o'clock while others remain open until 1.30 a.m. with no evidence of food.  I am confused about the type of licences people have and wonder whether they are enforced or regulated.  The matter seems to be fudged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know or care whether people drink in tourist areas until 5 o'clock in the morning, be it in Temple Bar, Bray seafront, Howth, Salthill or anywhere else.  However, there is a huge distinction between pubs in such places and ordinary suburban pubs.  The Bill proposes a closing time of 12.30 a.m. This is excessive.  It has some merit when applied to Friday and Saturday nights in <Col N="782" /> some areas, but there is no justification for it in ordinary suburban pubs from Monday to Thursday. Most people have to get up in the morning and do a day's work.  There might be an image of people down the country staying up all night &mdash; I do not know whether they work all day. However, allowing people who have to get up by 8.  a.m. for work drink until 12.30 a.m. or 1 o'clock is uncalled for, unnecessary and would be damaging. There might be some merit in such a closing time for Friday and Saturday nights.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton has included a clause about geographic location.  This is vital as there may be some pubs in Dublin which I would allow open until 12.30 a.m. on a Friday or Saturday night but there are others I would not and which are already causing huge problems.  The Bill speaks about the courts making decisions.  The courts have power under existing legislation to remove licences but this does not appear to happen.  Pub owners always manage to get court decisions in their favour.  Any provision for pubs opening late even one night a week would require a new system with local input, perhaps involving local authorities, to deal with such matters.  A publican will hit the roof if this matter is mentioned as he will say that the licence is as valuable as anybody else's, but extension of the laws will require the introduction of two types of licences, namely, one under which pubs close at 11.30 p.m. and one which provides for opening after that time.</P>
    <P>Many pubs are no longer small places with up to two dozen people drinking in them.  Some are located in the middle of residential areas and have music, etc.  They cause huge hassle to neighbours. We all like the idea of a pub staying open late when we are in it, but we must consider the people living adjacent to it.  Any provision for extensions will have to distinguish between different types of licences, although I do not know how this can be done.  Leaving it up to the court to consider or cut back on opening hours if there is anti-social behaviour on an ongoing basis is not sufficient.  The legislation must enshrine a different system from the outset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we congratulate Deputy Upton on introducing this Bill as it has sparked a debate on an issue close to the heart of most people.  We are talking about the opening hours of something which has become a national institution.  It is important when dealing with such matters not tamper too much with them.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to the fact that the economy has benefited from tourism, but we must not turn the economy or the country upside down to facilitate the demands of tourists who are allegedly seeking longer opening hours, similar to those on the Continent.  A distinct society and ethos has developed around pubs which must be protected rather than interfered with.  Part of the attraction of Ireland is the crowded, busy pub full of conversation.  We should be careful before meddling with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Others, including the Minister, have pointed <Col N="783" /> out that this matter will be dealt with by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security which is considering a number of different options.  I understand some of Deputy Upton's suggestions, including the retention of the ordinary opening hour of 10.30 a.m., the extension of opening time during weekdays in summer and winter and the abolition of the holy hour, form part of the recommendations of the committee.  It is important that the industry be consulted in relation to these proposals.</P>
    <P>I oppose all-night drinking.  For some reason it is fashionable to believe that all-night drinking will make the job of the Garda easier.  I do not believe this is true, but rather that it would worsen the situation.  We should solve any existing problem of drink driving at a criminal level by imposing heavier penalties and liberalising the hackney and taxi industry in order that people can be carried from pubs at relatively low cost.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary to develop other licensed outlets in the context of restaurants, nightclubs, etc.  However, the character of the pub should be protected for a number of reasons.  In my constituency publicans are very involved in the community through subsidising football teams and in encouraging a myriad of social contacts.  This should be encouraged.  The issue of subjecting publicans to the rigours of competition law, upon which I understand the Competition Authority will soon be reporting, should be raised.  Sponsorship is not a normal activity but it is one which is of great importance and forms part of our social life.  The rigorous rules of competition law should not be applied to publicans.  A broadening of the licensing laws would not necessarily be helpful either.  Problems have been experienced in the past with drug barons laundering money through various outlets.  If we over-liberalise the issuing of pub licences, similar problems may be experienced. We must be cautious about this issue as it impinges on our character as a nation and on our ability to attract tourists.  I welcome Deputy Upton's measure and he is to be applauded for opening up this debate but we should wait for the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to come up with recommendations after it has consulted the industry.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my remaining time with Deputy Cooper-Flynn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it is somewhat opportunistic of Deputy Upton to introduce the Bill at this stage.  The Deputy is a member of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security which is dealing specifically with this issue.  I understand that Deputy Flanagan is carrying out <Col N="784" /> a great deal of research on this issue and is contacting all interested parties about it.  The committee will present a report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which will I hope be debated here in the Dáil.  While I recognise that this issue needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency, it was not appropriate for Deputy Upton to jump the gun by introducing the Bill before the report was produced.  I am sure his colleagues on the other side of the House are disappointed he did that.</P>
      <P>I regard this Bill as a direct response to the needs of the west of Ireland.  Nothing major has happened in regard to licensing laws for the past 30 years with the exception of some tinkering in the early 1990s.  Essentially our licensing laws have remained unchanged.  All that has happened is that a pilot scheme has been set up in the west of Ireland by the Garda who strictly enforce the legislation as it currently applies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support zero tolerance. The Garda in County Mayo and other western counties strictly enforce the legislation.  I fully support that.  It is inappropriate that uniformed gardaí are responsible for clearing pubs.  That is not their job and I can understand why they would be infuriated at being forced into such a position over the years.  It is appropriate that this issue has been thrown back into the political domain and that we, as legislators, have been asked to do something about it.  The correct way of doing that at this time is for Deputy Flanagan, as the chairman of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, to present his report and recommendations to the Minister.  The issue can then be thoroughly debated in this House.</P>
      <P>Current pub opening hours are out of date and completely out of synch with other European countries.  While I recognise that the issue of alcohol abuse is of great concern to many people, people who abuse alcohol do so well within the current opening hours.  The extension of opening hours will not alter that.  There is a need to extend licensing hours, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays throughout the entire industry.  This issue is also of relevance to our tourism industry.  An unusual situation prevails in County Mayo at present where 14 and 15 year olds can be out until two or three o'clock in the morning attending night-clubs but the rest of us are obliged to be tucked in our beds by midnight.  Given the nature of my job, if I want to go out socially, I unfortunately tend only to be able to get into these kind of late night establishments.  I would prefer not to spend every night sitting at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the correct consultation process occurs on this issue.  There are a number of people concerned about it, not just those directly involved in the industry.  Members of the general public also hold very strong views which have been outlined to me by callers to my constituency <Col N="785" /> office.  Every person has an opinion on this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton stated that he would like pubs to stay open until 12.30 a.m. each day.  There is not a need for that although I would like to see a 12.30 a.m. closing time on Friday and Saturday nights.  I am not totally happy with the idea of pubs being open on Good Friday.  In the past, members of my family have owned public houses and the Good Friday closing allowed them an opportunity to wash the curtains if nothing else. That probably does not happen often enough in many public houses, judging by the bad condition in which some are kept.  However, many of the modern premises are a credit to their owners.  I do not think it is too much of a sacrifice to ask anyone to close a pub on Good Friday and Christmas Day.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the overwhelming view to come from this discussion is that we fully support the action of the Garda in enforcing the current legislation.  I am confident, having listened to the Minister earlier today, that he will give the report of the select committee serious consideration and will deal with it as a matter of urgency in the interest of all of those in our community who stand to benefit.</P>

Pubs, clubs and hotels should all be obliged to close at 1 a.m. The Government and the Minister for Finance will find other ways of raising any revenue which might be lost.  People in Westport, Castlebar, Aughagower, Drummin, Cushlough or even Knock are forced to leave pubs at 11.30 p.m. and go to discos or night clubs.  I live beside a hotel and it is almost impossible to get any sleep on Saturday or Sunday nights.  People coming out of the night clubs still think they are dancing and continue to dance on people's cars and lawns.  In America people go out at 8 p.m. and come home at 11 p.m.</P>

It seems beyond doubt that the State has failed in its responsibility of care.  I am informed this woman has been suffering from a serious psychiatric condition.  The State agencies were unable to deal with her psychiatric disorder at a medical level or through the various types of social supports they administer and control.  Ultimately the problem was allowed to come to a crisis point which resulted in this woman being jailed for trespassing with intent to steal on 23 February this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full dimensions of the State's failure to deal effectively with her difficulties are illustrated starkly by what happened following her committal to Mountjoy.  When committed there on 23 February and on some subsequent date it was necessary to hold her in a padded cell for her safety.  It seems outrageous that was the best the State could do to cope with a citizen who is suffering from a serious psychiatric problem.  Subsequent to her detention in a padded cell in Mountjoy she was transferred to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  I have been advised by her family that it now appears likely she will be released from Dundrum and returned to Mountjoy.  The family are deeply concerned that subsequent to her return to Mountjoy she will, as happens in the case of most prisoners who <Col N="787" /> are released, be returned to the community without the necessary social and medical supports.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to contact the agencies which deal with people, like this woman, who have a multiplicity of problems.  I ask him to ensure that this woman will receive the necessary housing, medical and other social supports as her former residence was burned out and it is now impossible for her to return to it.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure she will be housed in circumstances appropriate to the condition of someone who has a multiplicity of problems, including underlying psychiatric disorders.  It is essential all necessary action is taken to prevent the vicious cycle of social problems, psychiatric difficulties and ultimately a prison sentence from recurring.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for raising this matter on the Adjournment. As he will be aware, the provision of services at the Central Mental Hospital is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance. I understand the board has six beds in the Central Mental Hospital dedicated to female prison transfers. Until the last six to 12 months those beds satisfied the needs arising most of the time. However, there were occasions during this period when the Central Mental Hospital has not had the capacity to meet the needs of Mountjoy Prison. Additional accommodation has been provided by the board of the hospital to cater for the increased demand and the board expects this will ease the situation.  The person to whom the Deputy referred was transferred from Mountjoy Prison to the Central Mental Hospital on Wednesday, 23 March 1998 and I understand from the board there are no plans to transfer this person at present.</P>
      <P>I advise the Deputy that my Department is currently in discussion with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Eastern Health Board with the aim of improving the level of psychiatric services provided to the prison population.  Arising from those discussions measures are currently being taken to enhance the consultant forensic psychiatrist input into Mountjoy prison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of serious questions demand answers about the manner in which environmental health officers and the Eastern Health Board dealt with the salmonella outbreak which resulted from the sale of contaminated food in a butcher's and delicatessen shop in Dundrum in my constituency.  The Minister for Health and Children should inquire into why it took almost a full week from the date samples were taken from the shop for those samples to be tested and analysed and the results obtained to confirm that products sold in that shop were <Col N="788" /> responsible for customers contracting salmonella. Having taken samples from the shop on 20 March, the health board should, within 48 hours, have known whether the products sold by the shop were definitely responsible for the outbreak that occurred.  It should not have taken from 20 March until 27 March for this to be confirmed.</P>
      <P>An explanation should also be sought as to why no public warning or alert was issued to inform the general public of the possible dangers to ensure that any product purchased from this shop that had not yet been consumed was disposed of. The shop closed on 27 March.  No public announcement of any nature was made by the health board until around 6 p.m. on Tuesday, 31 March.</P>
      <P>The primary duty of the health board in such circumstances is to the consumer.  It is scandalous that while the health board dithered and failed to issue any public alert we now know that a further 26 people contracted salmonella.  That is not the final number and it may emerge in the coming days that a large number of people who reside in or visit my constituency of Dublin South and shop in the Dundrum area have been so affected.  It is essential to ensure that if at any future date a similar outbreak occurs, the results of testing are obtained more speedily and, where such results prove positive, a public warning is immediately issued.  Consumers are entitled to this type of protection.</P>
      <P>While the Minister for Health and Children cannot be held responsible for the failures of the Eastern Health Board, he does have a duty to ensure that the health board properly fulfils its functions.  He also has a duty to give greater priority to the publication and processing through this House of a food safety and quality authority Bill than has been given by the Government to this measure to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further essential public interest issue that must be addressed concerns the capacity of the State laboratories, currently serving the Eastern Health Board, to monitor high risk food outlets that operate within the board area and to undertake essential testing.  It is my information that in the whole of the Eastern Health Board area there are, what can be described as, 4,367 premises regarded as high risk which supply food products. Microbiological testing is funded through the Department of Health and Children and I am advised that the laboratories which serve the Eastern Health Board area are provided only with sufficient funding annually to take and test a maximum 1,050 microbiological samples annually. To ensure food safety and consumer protection, it is essential that at least one sample is taken from every high risk outlet annually within the health board area and within each other health board area similar samples should be taken from such outlets for testing and health monitoring purposes.  That requires a quadrupling of the capacity to test samples taken and a quadrupling of the current funding provided to the laboratories, which is grossly deficient. <Col N="789" /> This is an issue for which the Minister is directly responsible and any inquiry conducted into the events concerning the salmonella outbreak in Dundrum should also consider whether the delay in obtaining the testing results derives from the State's laboratories lacking the capacity to speedily conduct the testing and analysis required.</P>
    <P>Ordinary people who shop in Dundrum are incredulous that it took so long for the health board to issue a public health warning.  Not only my constituents but the entire country is entitled to an assurance from the Minister that immediate action will be taken to ensure that any future incidence of food contamination produces a speedier and more consumer orientated response. I am seeking an inquiry within the Department, not a tribunal or elaborate inquiry mechanism. Lessons must be learned from the manner in which the health board dealt with this issue and the delay on its part in issuing the public alert that was so badly needed at an earlier stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of regret to me, as Minister of State with responsibility for food safety, that there should be any incidence of food borne disease such as that which occurred in south County Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on everyone who comes into contact with food to be aware of the importance of food hygiene and to invoke the highest standards at all times.  This applies equally to those involved in the production and manufacture of food and food products, those involved in the sale of food and to the end user &mdash; the consumer. Cross-contamination such as that which appears to have occurred in this case should be, and is, preventable and it is important that we all play our part in ensuring that the food we eat is safe to eat.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in close contact with the Eastern Health Board to establish the facts of this incident and the position is as follows.  On l9 March last, the Eastern Health Board was notified of three cases of salmonella.  Interviews with the patients concerned identified the premises of Midland Meats, Dundrum, Dublin 14, as a possible source of the infection.  An Eastern Health Board environrnental health officer inspected the premises on 20 March and took five food samples for examination.  The proprietor of the premises was informed by the environmental health officer of the situation and of the serious health implications of salmonella.  Two of the five samples were subsequently confirmed as positive on 27 March.</P>
      <P>Samples taken from Midland Meats on 20 March were sent to the microbiological laboratory in Cherry Orchard Hospital on the morning of 21 March, but were not dealt with until the morning of 23 March, apparently due to lack of staff.  The Eastern Health Board has advised that the procedure used takes up to five days and the first results were not available until 27 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> On 24 March environmental health officers made a second inspection of the premises and made detailed recommendations on the steps to be followed in relation to structural and operational hygiene.  On 25 March, an environmental health officer made a further visit to the premises specifically to carry out staff testing.</P>
    <P>Laboratory results received on 27 March confirmed the presence of salmonella in the food samples taken from Midland Meats.  During a fourth visit to the premises on this date, a further four food samples were taken, one of which tested positive.  The proprietor was informed that previous samples had tested positive.  On a fifth visit to the premises, also on 27 March, environmental health officers conveyed to the proprietor the seriousness of the situation and indicated that they believed there was sufficient evidence available to warrant an application to the court for a closure order.  At that stage the proprietor indicated that he would voluntarily close the premises. The proprietor also agreed to meet environmental health officers on the morning of Monday, 30 March, to make arrangements for supervised remedial action.</P>
    <P>During the weekend of 28-29 March environmental health officers continued their investigations into affected members of the public.  The situation was also continuously monitored by the Eastern Health Board's infection control team. On 30 March environmental health officers took swabs of food contact surfaces and equipment and made arrangements for the detention of the remaining stock on the premises.</P>
    <P>On 31 March an environmental health officer visited the proprietor to secure his consent to the destruction of the balance of the stock.  Also on that date, the Eastern Health Board issued a press release advising members of the public not to eat food purchased from Midland Meats and announcing a helpline to assist with queries or concerns.  To date there have been 18 laboratory-confirmed cases of salmonella typhimurium. Three food workers in the premises of Midland Meats have also tested positive.  A total of six cases were hospitalised.  Following the establishment of the Eastern Health Board's advice helpline, approximately 300 calls were received of which about one third indicated symptoms of food poisoning which might be linked to the Midland Meats premises.  Further investigations, including laboratory testing, are being undertaken to confirm any connection with this outbreak.</P>
    <P>With regard to the time involved in analysing samples for infectivity, I understand from the Eastern Health Board that the first samples taken from the premises of Midland Meats were sent for analysis on the morning of Saturday, 21 March.  Analysis took place at the Eastern Health Board's microbiological laboratory in Cherry Orchard Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the board that the procedure used to confirm the presence of salmonella typhimurium can take five days from the date of <Col N="791" /> receipt of the sample.  I am, however, concerned that there was some delay in analysing the samples in this case and I will contact all health boards to impress upon them the importance of dealing urgently with all samples that might relate to food borne illnesses.</P>
    <P>With regard to information for the public, I am advised by the Eastern Health Board that the necessary control measures were put in place on 20 March and there was no evidence to suggest that these measures were not effective until 31 March, when the results of the analysis of the second batch of food samples became available.  I am concerned that there may have been some delay in alerting the public and I will contact all health boards in this regard also.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that there should be incidents such as this.  It does, however, highlight the need for the highest standards in food hygiene.  There is a moral as well as a legal obligation on those involved in the production of food and food products to ensure that the highest standards possible obtain and that the end product is fit for human consumption.  Consumers are entitled to assume that the food they buy is safe to eat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me and my colleague, Deputy Penrose, to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Persons applying for a PSV licence must, under section 34 of the 1963 Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, give a written undertaking that they will be available to work as a driver of a public service vehicle for 40 hours per week.  Until recently, the Garda Síochána interpreted this provision in a manner whereby many people with full-time jobs were able to sign this undertaking, even though the gardaí knew they would only work for a few hours per week.</P>
      <P>Recently, however, the gardaí, on instructions from the Garda Commissioner's office, have refused to issue PSV licences to persons who have full-time jobs.  This is causing major problems for many taxi owners, particularly in provincial towns such as Athlone and Mullingar.  However worthy the concept of only giving PSV licences to people who are unemployed or have only part-time employment, the nature of the taxi business, particularly in provincial towns, is that about 75 per cent of the week's business is carried out on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.  This means that taxi drivers do not have the wherewithal to take on full-time drivers and, recently, have had great difficulty providing a service to the public. The provision of taxi services in provincial towns has made a dramatic difference to the service available to the public and is worthwhile.  Any curtailment of that service is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of other licences issued, there is usually a maximum rather than a minimum working time involved.  For example, with a licence to <Col N="792" /> drive a lorry, a person may drive for only a certain number of hours per week.  In the case of other licences, people may work for no more than a certain number of hours rather than setting a minimum time.  It is ironic that a licence to drive a bus, which carries greater responsibility, carries no restriction in terms of minimum hours of work.  The same criteria do not apply.  I call on the Minister to amend the regulations and alleviate the difficulty, particularly for taxi drivers, in providing a service to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity to make a contribution on this important matter which is causing great anguish and concern among taxi owners and taxi operators in towns throughout provincial Ireland, particularly in Mullingar, County Westmeath.  A small public service vehicle in layman's terms is a taxi, hackney or minibus.  Each such vehicle intended for use as a small public service vehicle must be approved by the public service vehicle inspector for the area in which the business is based and must be included on the taxi or hackney licence under which the relevant business is operated.</P>
      <P>The regulatory position underpinning application for and renewal of licences to drive a small public service vehicles is to be found in Regulation 34 of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicle) Regulations, 1963, as subsequently substituted by the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1970 (S.I. 200 of 1970) which were subsequently amended by the 1977 regulations found in S.I. 111 of 1977.</P>
      <P>It appears that the Garda authorities have commenced to interpret the regulations in a different manner from that which heretofore applied. Under the current interpretation of the foregoing regulations, such renewals will no longer be granted.  What this in effect means is that any persons who wish to work as drivers of taxis, hackney cabs and minibuses are required to be available for work for a minimum of 40 hours per week. This will create a major crisis for drivers of such taxis and hackneys, and indeed for owners-operators of such vehicles, as there will not be sufficient full-time drivers available to compensate for the widespread loss of such licences.  This will have serious adverse consequences for the livelihoods of the taxi owners-operators and for the general public who have relied upon an excellent and efficient service provided by taxis and hackneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We pride ourselves on inculcating in citizens a deep respect for our laws.  Taxi owners-operators fulfil their role admirably in many facets, but especially in providing transport to people who wish to enjoy a drink in their local pubs and who, in obeying the drink-driving laws, require transport back to their homes.  As somebody who comes from a rural area, I am deeply appreciative of the level of service afforded by these operators in such areas where there is virtually no public <Col N="793" /> transport system.  These operators also provide a means of conveying children to school and transporting people for hospital treatment.  As I understand it, there is currently no power available under the current regulations to classify drivers as part-time drivers so as to permit their business to operate to maximum efficiency, which would in turn permit appropriate rest hours for the owners-operators where the business is capable of utilising another driver but is not of sufficient capacity to employ such a driver on a full-time basis.</P>
    <P>The difficulty being encountered can be readily dealt with by simply amending the existing regulations. I will put forward a short amendment, although I am not paid for drafting, but I will try to help the Minister in any way I can.  I respectfully suggest that the form of undertaking which is required to be completed in Appendix B of the regulations be amended to include therein that the form of undertaking to accompany the application would read &ldquo;Application For Full-Time or Part-Time Licence to Drive Small Public Service Vehicles&rdquo;, and thereunder include the following as an addendum to the present undertaking, which incorporates a part-time licence as follows: &ldquo;I hereby undertake that in the event of a part-time licence to drive small public service vehicles being granted to me pursuant to section 34 of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicle) Regulations, 1963-70, I will be available as a part-time driver of a small public service vehicle for not more than 24 hours in each calendar week (subject to statutory holiday entitlement) and that I will not so drive more than 8 hours per day in any three consecutive days and not more than 24 hours in any calendar week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to accede to that reasonable request for a new category which can be designated as a part-time licence-holder.  That would overcome the difficulties being experienced by those who provide this important service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McGrath and Penrose for raising this issue.  Small public service vehicles provide an essential component of the overall transport options available in the State as a whole.  Taxis operate generally in the urban areas and have quite a defined role.  They are an integral part of the public transport service and provide an immediate on street door to door service which in many areas complements the mass transport services provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  Hackneys operate in all parts of the country and provide a range of different services. Certainly in rural areas they may be the only alternative to private transport, which of course may not be available to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation and licensing of both taxis and hackneys and their drivers is controlled through the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 1998.  The Garda Commissioner is <Col N="794" /> empowered under the regulations to grant licences to people for the purpose of driving taxis and hackneys.  The regulations provide that the commissioner may determine the form and manner of applications for such licences.  When applying for licences applicants must submit to the Garda a written undertaking that, if the licence is granted, their services will be available as a driver of a small public service vehicle for at least 40 hours in each week and that in any period of three consecutive days they will not so drive for more than 11 hours a day.</P>
    <P>Within the parameters set out in the regulations, decisions in relation to the grant or refusal of small public service vehicle drivers' licences are a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I have no direct function in relation to such decisions.  Where a person is aggrieved over a decision to refuse a licence, he or she may appeal that decision to the District Court.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to the Department in relation to the application by the Garda of the provisions of the regulations in so far as they relate to the availability to drive of potential applicants.  While acknowledging that a decision in respect of each application is exclusively a matter for the Garda, the Department has asked the Commissioner for his observations in relation to the issue raised tonight.  On receipt of these the Department will give careful and urgent consideration as to whether there is need for an amendment to the current regulatory provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The effective prosecution of rape and sexual assault is an essential element in the elimination of violence against women.  Furthermore, from the victim's point of view, the way cases are handled throughout the criminal process is clearly of great importance.  Many women describe their journey through the legal system as adding painfully to the trauma of the original abuse.  Research shows consistently that women do not report cases of rape and sexual assault to the Garda for fear of being disbelieved, humiliated and embarrassed by inappropriate questioning, revictimised and traumatised by Garda handling of the report and through lack of confidence in the willingness or ability of the Garda to take appropriate action.</P>
      <P>In a criminal trial for a rape offence the entire prosecution is undertaken by the State.  The victim is regarded as the chief witness for the State and will be the first witness to give evidence on behalf of the State.  It is possible that she, as a witness, will not have met either the solicitor or barrister representing the State and she will not have had access to the book of evidence, which contains all other evidence to be presented at the trial.  She has no rights to direct what witnesses should be called.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality for victims in the present system is that the processing of rape and sexual assault <Col N="795" /> cases through the criminal justice system exacerbates rather than alleviates the devastating effects of the crime for the victim and serves to intensify the distress experienced by the complainants, thus producing an experience of revictimisation. Complainants report feelings of disempowerment and humiliation at their treatment throughout the process and incomprehension, betrayal and anger at the appalling attrition and conviction rates in these cases.</P>
    <P>The Rape Crisis Centre is strongly critical of the serious inadequacies of the present system which produces feelings of isolation, vulnerability and guilt in victims.  It has consistently argued that in the case of rape, sexual assault and other sexual offences, the fact that the victim is not represented by her own lawyer is particularly unjust as the victim is the only party to the trial who has no voice.  The particular circumstances of the crime of rape, its effect on the victim and her unique treatment throughout the criminal process must be taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>The achievement of justice for the accused should not and need not be incompatible with justice for the victim.  While it is the function of the courts to ensure the defendant's right to a fair trial, this must be balanced against the court's obligation to protect the rights of the complainant in a rape and sexual assault trial.  She is entitled to be kept fully informed at every stage of the process and to be treated with respect and courtesy by all those involved from the moment the report is made to the final outcome of the trial.</P>
    <P>Separate legal representation for complainants in rape and sexual assault cases could provide much needed support for complainants, render the trial process considerably less traumatic for them and contribute significantly to bringing about an increase in reporting rape.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women also recommended that rape victims should have separate legal representation and in our manifesto we gave a commitment to introduce such representation. I hope we are moving along that road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGennis for raising this important and topical issue.  The question of separate legal representation for victims of rape is a complex issue with constitutional implications.  It will be mentioned in the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences to which the final touches are being put and which I hope will be published within a few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the discussion paper is to raise issues that have not already been addressed in legislation dealing with sexual offences which has been enacted in the recent past.  These issues will be placed before the public for their comments and the response to them will be a backdrop to how we deal with them over the next few years. The discussion paper will not come up with the answers; it will pose the questions and set out the <Col N="796" /> arguments.  For that reason, I would not like to pre-empt the discussion paper by speculating on any of the issues raised in it.  The question of separate legal representation for complainants in rape cases is far from being a straightforward matter.</P>
    <P>The issue was raised by the 1998 Law Reform Commission report on the law on rape and because of the constitutional and other difficulties it saw in relation to the proposal, it recommended against separate legal representation. There has also been recent judicial reference to the constitutional difficulties that may attach to separate legal representation.  As I said, I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the forthcoming discussion on the issue.  I have an open mind at this stage given the legal complexities.  However, all the relevant issues will have to be carefully teased out with the legal advisers.</P>
    <P>While the question of separate legal representation remains under consideration, several measures have been taken in recent years to improve the position of complainants in rape cases in the criminal trial process.  The civil legal aid scheme has been extended to allow a complainant in a serious sexual assault case to consult a legal aid solicitor who may accompany the complainant into court.  That entitlement has been placed on a statutory basis in the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995.  Other statutory initiatives include the extension provided in the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, of the restrictions on the cross examination of a complainant on her or his past sexual history to all sexual assault offences.  Also, under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, the court is required in determining sentence to take into account the effect of the crime on the victim and to this end can receive evidence from the victim.  The jurisdiction to permit the receipt of such evidence is independent of both the prosecution and the defence and the evidence can be given in court with the assistance of a solicitor or counsel.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that the closing date for submissions on the discussion paper will be around the middle of the year and consideration of the many issues, including separate legal representation that will be raised in the paper will commence shortly afterwards.</P>
    <P>As the subject for discussion this evening has focused on the victims of rape in criminal cases, I have concentrated on that area in my reply. However, in a wider context, I am determined to fulfil a pre-election promise to ensure that all crime victims have available to them the support they need.  I assure Deputy McGennis that this more general issue will be addressed in the context of the new charter on victims of crime.  Prior to the general election we promised to produce, publish and implement this charter if returned to Government.  That is a promise I intend to fulfil and, accordingly, the charter on the victims of <Col N="797" /> crime is being prepared by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The situation in Algeria continues to give rise to very serious concern.  Although the death rate has fallen from the very high level of January during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan when there were a number of mass killings security remains bad.  In recent days there have been reports of renewed fighting between the security forces and Islamist insurgents.</P>
      <P>What has been happening is a matter of international concern and it cannot be treated just as an internal affair.  I have taken every possible opportunity to convey my views to the Algerian authorities, most notably during my visit to the country in December.</P>
      <P>Our concern is shared by our EU partners.  A ministerial troika from the European Union visited Algiers on 19 and 20 January.  However, it is clear that Algerian sensitivity over international involvement remains strong and the immediate opportunities for co-operation limited.  Although Algeria has refused to accept offers of humanitarian assistance, the Union has agreed that the offer of humanitarian assistance will remain on the table.</P>
      <P>With our EU partners, we have been urging Algeria to accept a visit by UN special rapporteurs. Its refusal to do so is very disappointing.  I am aware that the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, and Vice-President Manuel Marin of the European Commission have all reiterated the point that there is no evidence linking the Algerian Government to the massacres.  However, as long as Algeria does not allow for more openness suspicions will remain.  An early visit by UN special rapporteurs would be especially helpful in dispelling these doubts and we will continue to press the Algerian Government to accede to such a visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the recent visit to Algeria by members of the European Parliament helped to strengthen democratic institutions and to undermine those who seek political change through violence, greater transparency on the part of the Algerian Government and unhindered access for international organisations, NGOs and the media would also further strengthen democratic institutions. <Col N="800" /> We will persevere in the policy which we are pursuing &mdash; pressure on Algeria to ensure that respect for human rights is achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 23, 26, 62 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The Government wishes to see an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba.  We are working to that end in concert with our EU partners.  On 5 November 1997 Ireland with all our European Union partners voted in the United Nations General Assembly in favour of a resolution which called for an end to the embargo.  The General Assembly adopted the resolution with 143 votes in favour, three against and 17 abstentions.  The US Administration has been made fully aware of Ireland's concerns and that of our EU partners about the embargo and its extra-territorial effects.</P>
      <P>The Government, accordingly, welcomes the statement by President Clinton on 20 March which announced a number of openings in US contacts with Cuba.  These are primarily of a humanitarian nature.  President Clinton has made it clear that these measures are a response to the outcome of the Pope's visit to Cuba.</P>
      <P>The openings include moves to streamline and expedite the sale of medicines to Cuba by instituting new procedures that will facilitate more rapid processing of requests for licences for the export of medicines.  The US Government will also resume licensing humanitarian cargo and passenger charter flights to Cuba.  New licensing procedures will be instituted to allow for humanitarian remittances from US residents to their relatives in Cuba.</P>
      <P>On the question put by Deputy Barnes, Ireland applies no trade sanctions against Cuba.  The Helms-Burton Act, which was signed into US law on 12 March 1996, allows the US to take extra-territorial measures against companies or individuals trafficking in expropriated property from Cuba.  Following inquiries carried out by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it appears that no Irish company has been directly affected by this legislation.  President Clinton has continued to exercise his power to suspend certain aspects of the Helms-Burton Act, in particular Title III, which provides for US nationals to file suit against persons trafficking in expropriated property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the papal visit, more than one hundred prisoners of conscience have been freed by the Cuban authorities.  I hope that these releases will be followed by those of other prisoners, including the four members of the dissident working group, and the prisoner Jesus Chamber Ramirez, who was sentenced in 1992 to ten years in jail for &ldquo;enemy propaganda and disrespect against <Col N="802" /> government authority&rdquo;.  We have raised this important case in the European Union.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the implementation of the European Union's common position on Cuba in December last the EU General Affairs Council reiterated that the EU's objective towards Cuba remained the encouragement of a process of peaceful transition to pluralist democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as sustainable economic recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people.  Our twin objectives are to see an end to the US embargo against Cuba and also to see the Cuban Government make concrete moves towards pluralist democracy and respect for human rights in that country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 22 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains gravely concerned at continuing human rights abuses and delays in the transition to democratic rule in Nigeria.  With our EU partners we avail of every appropriate opportunity to support an early return to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our approach, which follows the relevant decision of the EU Council of Development Ministers on 28 November 1997, is particularly focused on the continued plight of Ogoni and other political prisoners and the unacceptable lack of due process in their cases.  The very strong support given by Ireland to the decision of that Council to extend the EU common position on Nigeria and its restrictive measures until 1 November 1998 was a direct response to such human rights abuses.  It followed our similarly strong support for the EU-sponsored resolution adopted at last year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.  As a direct result of that resolution, a UN special rapporteur on human rights in Nigeria, Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee, was appointed. <Col N="803" /> The Government will continue to urge the Nigerian authorities to co-operate fully with the special rapporteur and to allow him full access to political and other detainees.  With other members of the international community we will be reviewing his work and the situation in Nigeria at this month's 54th Session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
    <P>In a direct approach to the Vatican in advance of the visit of His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, to Nigeria on 21-23 March, the Union made known its relevant concerns, including about the situation in Ogoniland.  Among these were the continued detention of 20 further Ogonis for trial, recent actions by the security forces in the region and the whereabouts and health of Mr. Batom Mitee.  The latter's brother, Mr. Ludum Mitee, is the Acting President of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People whom Deputies will recall came to Dublin to brief the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs last February.</P>
    <P>As part of his ongoing efforts in relation to these matters, the Irish Ambassador in Lagos recently met and was briefed by the President of the Niger Delta Human and Environmental Rescue Organisation on human rights and environmental justice in Ogoniland and the Niger Delta. The concerns expressed by that organisation include the health and whereabouts of Batom Mitee since his arrest and the ransack of his property on 3 January, the deteriorating health and conditions reported in a letter received by the organisation from the 20 Ogonis being held in Port Harcourt Prison, the alleged killing by the security forces of a woman participant in the Ogoni Day procession at Bari on 4 January, repressive security responses and extra-judicial killings.</P>
    <P>Concern was also expressed at the briefing about continued oil spillages and gas fires in various parts of the Niger Delta.  The Government supports the view that multinationals should carefully consider the human rights and environmental aspects of their business operations.  There is also an onus on the Nigerian Government and regional and local authorities to do likewise and to ensure that the benefits of mineral extraction are conferred on the local population without human rights or environmental abuses.  The Government considers it important that multinationals involved in Nigeria should be aware of the strong position of Ireland and the European Union on human rights in Nigeria generally and in Ogoniland in particular.  I will, therefore, take steps to ensure that the Shell Corporation is made aware of our policy in this regard.  The approach of Ireland and our European partners in relation to Nigeria is based on two operational conclusions of the November Development Council, namely:&mdash; after six months &mdash; that is to say next <Col N="804" /> month &mdash; the Union will assess, at Council level, the situation in Nigeria on the basis of a report from the Presidency, and, if elections fail to produce a return to democracy and the rule of law in Nigeria before 1 October 1998, the EU will adopt further measures in addition to those adopted on 4 December 1995.</P>
    <P>These provisions are intended, <i>inter alia</i>, to keep the plight of Ogoni and other political detainees to the fore and reflect the particular significance which we attach to them in the overall context of human rights observance and democratic transition in Nigeria.  The Government will continue to support strongly, including at this month's 54th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, concerted international action which will lead to an early return to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 64 and 75 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the 1991 British census the number of people then living in Great Britain who were born in Ireland was 837,464 of whom 244,914 were born in Northern Ireland.  Because of the way the census was taken the British Office for National Statistics can provide statistical information relating only to first generation Irish people.  The Department of Foreign Affairs estimates that there are about two million Irish citizens, that is, people born in Ireland and their children, living in Great Britain.  It has been estimated that the number of people in Great Britain entitled to claim Irish citizenship &mdash; that <Col N="805" /> is, people born in Ireland and their children and grandchildren &mdash; may be as many as six million.</P>
    <P>Of the 837,464 first generation Irish people in Great Britain in 1991, 151,984 were under 30 years of age, 429,012 were aged between 30 and 60 and 256,468 were aged 60 and over.  A total of 56.4 per cent of the last category were female and 43.6 per cent were male.</P>
    <P>Statistical information on the residence patterns of Irish people in Great Britain or the number of them in receipt of social welfare allowances is not available from the British authorities.</P>
    <P>As I stated in response to another question from Deputy Kenny on 4 March, the Government is aware of the particular vulnerability of some elderly Irish people living in Great Britain.  The voluntary Irish organisations which attend to their needs are a priority for grant assistance from the DÍON committee through which Government assistance to Irish groups in Great Britain is channelled.</P>

      <P>The Government regards the enhanced and systematic protection of human rights as a key element in a comprehensive settlement arising from the all-party process.  This was set out clearly in both the Joint Framework Document and the Propositions on Heads of Agreement. The perception among large sections of the population that their basic civil and political rights were infringed contributed significantly to the instability over the years in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, at present, ongoing discussion in the talks process as to how the above commitments can be translated into practical effect.

      <P>The Government is aware of disturbing reports from Irian Jaya-West Papua that the Indonesian authorities are interfering with the activities of church groups and hindering the distribution of humanitarian relief supplies in the area.  The matter has been raised with partners in the European Union and an approach will be made to the Indonesian authorities should it be considered appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that humanitarian issues in Irian Jaya have been of concern since April last year.  The entire island of New Guinea, which is shared by Irian Jaya-West Papua and by</P>
      <P>Papua New Guinea, has been severely affected by drought which has led to widespread malnutrition. According to UN figures, an estimated 10 per cent of the population throughout the island have been affected.</P>
      <P>A number of international agencies have been working with the local population to provide humanitarian relief.  In particular, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs are running ongoing programmes throughout the island to meet the needs of the most vulnerable.  I understand from recent ICRC reports that the humanitarian situation of the population varies widely from region to region depending on the climatic conditions, altitude, remoteness of the province and local coping strategies. Aid agencies are, therefore, concentrating on providing the most appropriate help within each community, including emergency food aid distributions, medical care, food security programmes and the provision of safe water supplies.</P>
      <P>The Government has provided a total of £150,000 to support these programmes over the past four months.  The majority of these fund, £125,000, have been specifically earmarked for use in Irian Jaya.  The funds have been channelled through the UNDHA and the ICRC and I understand that both programmes are going well.</P>

      <Quest>when it is expected that the UN targets for overseas development aid of 0.7 per cent of GNP will be reached; the Irish ODA figure for 1998 as a percentage of GNP; if he will set a definite timetable for the achievement of the UN target; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The budget approved by the Government for spending on Ireland's official development assistance in 1998 will reach a record level of £137 million. This will be equivalent to an estimated 0.32 per cent of GNP.</P>
      <P>The resources available for official development assistance, ODA, have increased significantly in recent years.  Between 1992 and 1998, the budget has increased from £40 million to £137 million &mdash; a very substantial increase in money terms.  Expressed as a percentage of GNP, the growth has been from 0.16 per cent to 0.32 per cent &mdash; a twofold increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to maintaining a rapid rate of growth of ODA with a view to <Col N="808" /> achieving the target set out in the Government programme that ODA will reach 0.45 per cent of GNP by the year 2002.  The 1998 budget of £137 million is a first step on the way to meeting that target and it is hoped that the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP can be reached as soon as possible thereafter as economic and financial circumstances permit.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, the Government has taken or plans to take to promote the abolition of the death penalty worldwide in view of the resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 18 December 1997; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution on the death penalty which was passed by Dáil Éireann on 18 December last requested the Government to support the principles and objectives contained in the resolution of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. That resolution, which was adopted by the Commission during its 53rd session on 3 April 1997, calls on states which use the death penalty, and which are party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to consider ratifying the Second Optional Protocol, which is aimed at abolition of capital punishment.  It further urges such states to respect safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty and reiterates the conviction that abolition would contribute both to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>
      <P>The Dáil resolution also requested the Government to assume the responsibility of promoting, at both the Human Rights Commission in Geneva and at the UN General Assembly in New York, the adoption of a resolution which would create a universal moratorium on capital punishment in 1998.</P>
      <P>Ireland has used and will continue to avail of each and every opportunity to press for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide, both within the United States and Council of Europe frameworks, in concert with our EU partners.  At the 53rd session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1997, we laid particular emphasis on our belief that the death penalty, as a human rights issue, is a matter of legitimate concern to the international community, in line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993.  The resolution which was adopted enjoyed wide geographical support and was the first such resolution passed by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present session of the Commission, which commenced in Geneva on 16 March last, Ireland is once again taking a very strong stand in <Col N="809" /> favour of the total, universal, abolition of capital punishment.  Ireland was the first country to co-sponsor the Italian resolution this year, following a request to do so by the Italian delegation in recognition of our strong support for this initiative in previous years.  I understand that this resolution will be considered next Friday afternoon, 3 April, when it is likely to receive an even greater level of support than last year and be duly adopted by the Commission.  It is encouraging that, for the first time, all EU states will vote in favour, including the British delegation which had abstained in previous votes on the issue.</P>
    <P>In spite of some setbacks and disappointments, the trend towards suspension and abolition of capital punishment continues.  Nearly 50 per cent of the membership of the United Nations has now abolished the death penalty, either in law or in practice.  Furthermore, the UN Secretary-General reported to the Commission that, in the past year, two states had abolished the death penalty for all crimes, one had adopted a moratorium on its use and one had restricted its use.  In addition, a further two states had acceded to the Second Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  I believe that the concerted action at international level is now achieving results and that we are involved in a process which is at once progressive and irreversible.</P>
    <P>It is fitting that, in this 50th anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Commission on Human Rights should once again take a strong stand on this issue.  Ireland, as a current member of the Commission, will continue to take a leading role in the campaign for the universal abolition of capital punishment.</P>

      <P>I assume that the funding referred to by the Deputy relates to the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  This programme was established for a five year period from 1995 to 1999.  EU funding of 300 million ecu was provided for the first three years with provision for a review and refocusing of the programme for the final two year phase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Passport Office in Cork was first opened in January 1987.  It accepted and processed applications, referred them to the main Passport Office in Dublin and issued passports on behalf of the main Passport Office.  In October 1995 the Passport Office in Cork was upgraded to a full issuing office for persons living in Munster.</P>
      <P>The office has a permanent staff of 23 and in 1997 employed 18 additional temporary clerical assistants to deal with the increased demand during the busiest months.  A total of 65,017 passports were issued from the Cork office in 1997 in respect of which approximately £2.3 million in passport fees was collected and credited to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs operates a duty officer system whereby an officer is on call outside normal office hours to deal with urgent matters, including the issue of passports of restricted validity in genuine emergencies.  The duty officer is based at Iveagh House.  For security reasons an emergency passport service is not provided from the premises of either the Dublin or the Cork Passport Offices.</P>
      <P>A recent survey of emergency passport applications showed that just 16 per cent were from persons in Munster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the security implications of opening the Cork Passport Office after office hours, the limited demand for an emergency service and the fact that such a service for the whole <Col N="811" /> country is available at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin a separate emergency service in Cork is not warranted at this stage.  However, I will keep the matter under review, taking into account also what such an extra service would cost.</P>

      <P>The inaugural NGO Forum on Human Rights took place in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, on 7 March last.  Hosted by Deputy Liz O'Donnell, the Minister of State with special responsibility for human rights, the forum provided a unique opportunity for all those organisations and individuals actively involved in the field of human rights to share their collective knowledge and concerns with representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Government Departments and, indeed, with other members of the non-governmental sector.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Mary Robinson, the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, delivered the keynote address to the forum in which she spoke of the pressing need to continue the work of promoting and defending human rights throughout the world. She stressed, in particular, the important contribution made in this regard by NGOs.  The High Commissioner also noted that human rights had domestic implications for Irish society and that increased wealth went hand in hand with increased responsibilities, particularly with regard to disadvantaged groups such as refugees and asylum seekers and the homeless.</P>
      <P>This keynote statement was followed by a series of panel discussions which addressed some of the issues which are central to current domestic and international debate on human rights, development and democratisation.  There were six panel discussions in all, which were chaired and addressed by distinguished academics or activists in the field of human rights.  One such panel, which was the subject of considerable NGO and media interest, was devoted to the question of refugees and asylum seekers.  Following contributions from representatives of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the UN High Commission for Refugees and the Irish Refugee Council, this topic was comprehensively examined during an exchange of views between the panel and speakers from the broad NGO community.</P>
      <P>The other panels focused on women's human rights, the question of universality, the rights of the child, the role of NGOs and human rights and democratisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's Permanent Representative to the <Col N="812" /> United Nations in Geneva made a presentation to the forum on the likely deliberations of the 54th Session of the Commission on Human Rights, which subsequently convened on 16 March.  This presentation was followed by a wide-ranging question and answer session.</P>
    <P>The feedback which has been received to date from the many participants at the forum has been very positive.  I believe that this inaugural NGO Forum on Human Rights was a very successful initiative and one that has been welcomed by the NGO sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, O'Donnell, congratulated Irish NGOs for the continuing support which they give to the affirmation of human rights across a wide range of issues and she noted, furthermore, that &ldquo;a strong, vibrant and independent-minded NGO community is central to a properly functioning democracy.  Modern Governments can only be enhanced by strong links and regular dialogue with the NGO community&rdquo;. It was in recognition of these factors that the forum has been established as an annual event which, it is hoped, will act as a vital link between the Department and the wider non-governmental community.</P>

      <P>During the recent crisis relating to arms inspections, Ireland took the position that all diplomatic channels had to be exhausted before recourse to force could be countenanced.  The key role of the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, in resolving the deadlock has been recognised globally, and I pay tribute to him.</P>
      <P>The Memorandum of Understanding signed in Baghdad must now be fully respected.  The Secretary-General emphasised in his report to the Security Council that &ldquo;if diplomacy is to succeed, it must be backed both by force and by fairness&rdquo;. He warned that if the agreement were obstructed by evasion or deception, diplomacy might not have a second chance.</P>
      <P>With the UN arms decommissioning proceeding, the international community has the duty to alleviate the suffering of the people in Iraq from the effects of the sanctions in place on their Government since 1991.  Security Council Resolution 1153 provides for the supply of food and medicines funded by the sale of oil.  The amount of oil for sale was increased on 20 February to $5.26 billion per six month period.</P>

        <i>Political Matters</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  The Conference reviewed recent developments in the multi-party Talks.  They welcomed the general desire among the Talks participants to reach agreement in the negotiations before Easter, with a view to presenting an agreement for approval by referendum in the respective <Col N="814" /> jurisdictions during May.  The two Governments accordingly invited all the Talks participants, including Sinn Féin on their return to the Talks process, to join with them in the intensive work needed to achieve this objective.  Highlighting the historic opportunity available for a lasting and inclusive political settlement, they called on all delegations to build on the common ground identified so far and to work for accommodation and convergence on the outstanding issues.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Security Situation</i>
    </P>
    <P>4.  The Conference reviewed the current security situation with the Chief Constable of the RUC and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.

    <P>5.  The two Governments also paid tribute both to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the Chief Constable of the RUC for recent successes, including arrests and major finds of weaponry and explosives on both sides of the Border, and noted with satisfaction the continuing excellent co-operation between the security forces in both jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <P>6.  The Conference discussed the steps being taken by the security forces in response to the current terrorist threat.</P>
    <P>7.  The Conference considered the prospects for this year's marching season.  It noted the powers now conferred on the Parades Commission on foot of the Public Processions etc.  (Northern Ireland) Act as well as recent changes in the membership of the Commission.  It agreed on the importance of the Commission being in a position to command the support of both communities.  It recognised the need for the Commission to be seen to be fair and impartial and the potential, on this basis, for the Commission to make a significant contribution to the resolution of differences during this year's marching season.</P>
    <P>8.  The Conference discussed a number of prison issues, including sensitive individual cases of current interest, and further prisoner transfers. They noted that the British Government had now received the Narey report, which they intended to publish.</P>
    <P>9.  They also discussed the progress of the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill and noted the recent publication of two major consultation documents of relevance to the policing debate which is an essential part of the talks process.  They also considered a number of cases bearing on public confidence in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>10.  The Conference welcomed the British Government's recent decision to set up a new Tribunal of Inquiry into the events of &ldquo;Bloody Sunday&rdquo;. <Col N="815" /> The British Government will keep the Irish Government briefed on developments.</P>

    <P>
      <i>North-South Economic and Social Co-operation</i>
    </P>
    <P>12.  The Conference welcomed the extent of North-South co-operation under the respective European Structural Funds Programmes, including the INTERREG and Peace and Reconciliation Programmes.  The Conference also welcomed the extension of the latter programme into 1998.  Recognising the importance of continued North-South co-operation in the context of future programmes, both Governments renewed their commitment to increasing the level of co-operation where this was to the mutual advantage of both parts of the island.  They also underlined the economic value of North-South co-operation in the development of industry, trade and marketing, infrastructure networks, rural development and other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Matters</i>
    </P>
    <P>13.  The Conference agreed on the importance of steps to promote the Irish language and discussed a number of options which the British Government is actively considering.</P>

The Government's campaign in support of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will, of course, be conducted with full regard to the relevant Supreme Court judgments.  The Treaty contains provisions on a wide range of matters which will be of benefit to the citizen.  Members of the Government will be active in bringing these provisions to public attention and in advocating support for the Treaty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>I have already set out my answer to a priority question relating to my views on human rights in China following my recent visit there &mdash; Government policy on that important aspect of our relations with China.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My offical visit to the People's Republic of China from 24 to 28 February enabled me to discuss <Col N="817" /> with the Chinese leadership a wide range of issues concerning both bilateral relations and international developments.  In the course of my visit I had extensive discussions with the then Prime Minister, Mr. Li Peng and the then Foreign Minister, Mr. Qian Qichen.  I also met four vice-Ministers responsible for trade and industry.</P>
    <P>The visit, which took place on the eve of a major congress in China and in the immediate aftermath of a decision by the EU Council of Ministers to increase dialogue with China and intensify efforts to improve human rights in that country, provided the opportunity for very useful exchanges of views as well as achieving concrete results.</P>
    <P>My meeting on 25 February with the then Foreign Minister, Mr. Qian Qichen, was perhaps the most substantive during my official visit to China. In addition to the question of human rights, I raised a wide range of issues with him, including trade relations, Hong Kong, the Asian financial crisis, the prospects for the Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM, the situation in the Korean peninsula and Tibet.  I furthermore took the opportunity to brief him on the situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, concrete results covering the political, economic and cultural fields were achieved by the visit.  Some of the issues on which progress has been made will be the subject of further discussion at a meeting to be held in London later this week between the Taoiseach and the new Chinese Prime Minister, Mr. Zhu Rongji.  On the economic side, a meeting of the Ireland-China Joint Commission took place last week and I believe that this too will pave the way for increased economic relations and provide a boost to the level of Irish exports to China.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, on 23 March the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, announced the dismissal of the Russian Prime Minister and Cabinet.  The grounds given by the President related to the desire for a stronger performance by the Government in the economic area especially, in the social sphere.  President Yeltsin subsequently appointed Mr. Sergei Kiriyenko, former Minister for Fuel and Energy, as acting Prime Minister and on 27 March, formally nominated him for the position of Prime Minister. The nomination of Mr. Kiriyenko is now before the Duma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland welcomes President Yeltsin's emphasis on the fact that &ldquo;the dismissal of the Government does not mean a change of course.it is an effort to make economic reforms more energetic <Col N="818" /> and effective, to give them a political push, a new impetus&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Russia has realised significant achievements in political and economic reforms in a short period of time.  However, the difficult task of continuing to consolidate these achievements lies ahead. Ireland, together with EU partners, looks forward to working closely, in due course, with the new Government of Russia in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for meetings of the Committee of Ministers, the Council of Europe's decision making body, which comprises the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the 40 member states or their Permanent Representatives. The Committee of Ministers meets at ministerial level twice a year in Strasbourg.  In the case of Ireland these meetings have usually been attended by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, or in their absence by our Permanent Representative.</P>
      <P>Only one such ministerial level meeting has taken place since June 1997.  Ireland was represented at that meeting by our Permanent Representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council of Europe, as part of its programme of intergovernmental co-operation, has established twenty standing Conferences of European Specialised Ministers covering the various fields of activity of the organisation.  Since June 1997, meetings of six such conferences have taken place.  The 21st Conference of European Ministers for Justice took place in Prague on 10-11 June 1997 and was attended by the then Minister for Justice.  The 25th Conference of European Ministers responsible for Family Affairs took place in Vienna on 16-18 June 1997 and was attended by the then Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare.  The 19th Conference of European Ministers for Education took place in Kristiansand on 22-24 June 1997, the Minister for Education was represented at the conference by a senior official of that Department. The 11th Conference of Ministers responsible for Regional Planning took place in Limassol on 15-17 October 1997 and was attended by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with special responsibility for Housing and Urban Renewal. The 4th Ministerial Conference on Equality between Women and Men took place in Istanbul on 6-7 November 1997, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was represented at the conference by a senior official of that Department. <Col N="819" /> The 5th European Ministerial Conference on Mass Media Policy took place in Thessalonika on 11-12 December 1997, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands was represented at the conference by a senior official of that Department.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns that humanitarian aid to Burma may be diverted by the military regime there; and the steps, if any, he and his EU colleagues are taking to ensure that Burma receives humanitarian aid and that this gets through to the needy Burmese people.</Quest>

      <P>In accordance with the Common Position adopted by the European Union on 28 October 1996, all non-humanitarian aid and development assistance to Burma has been suspended.  This stance was adopted in response to the belief that such assistance was being diverted by the military regime currently in control there.</P>
      <P>Since then, the provision of humanitarian aid from the Government to vulnerable Burmese populations has focused on the large numbers of Burmese refugees outside the country.  These refugees include those along the Thai-Burma border who are largely from the Karen ethnic group and are being assisted by a number of international agencies, including Trócaire.  The Government provided a grant of £50,000 in May 1997 for Trócaire's work in this area.</P>
      <P>This approach is similar to that taken by the European Commission and our EU partners.  I understand that the European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has focused its aid on these refugees.  Almost 3 million ecu was dispersed by ECHO in 1997 for this purpose.  In addition, ECHO has given smaller grants to European NGOs providing humanitarian assistance to the victims of conflict within Burma; during 1997, these grants amounted to a total of 675,000 ecu.</P>

      <P>Our embassies co-operate closely with the many organisations catering for the needs of Irish communities abroad and, when required, give as much advice and consular assistance as possible to emigrants.  Voluntary groups which provide assistance to Irish emigrants in the United States and Australia receive financial support from the Vote for Foreign Affairs.  There is a provision of £169,000 for that purpose this year.  Similar support for voluntary organisations providing advice and help to Irish emigrants in Britain is available from the Vote for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the recommendation of the London-based DÍON committee.  The amount available for such grants this year is £613,000.  The Departments and Government agencies with responsibility for matters relating to emigrants and emigration are represented on the Interdepartmental Committee on Emigration which is chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Developments affecting Irish emigrants are monitored by the committee which also seeks to co-ordinate the activities of the Departments and agencies represented on it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>At the Luxembourg European Council, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union requested that the willingness of the Government of Cyprus to include representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community in the accession negotiating delegation be acted upon. The view of the European Council was that accession of Cyprus to the EU should benefit all communities, including the Turkish Cypriot community and help bring about civil peace and reconciliation on the island.  Ireland fully shares the Union's objective in this regard, which remains a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation on the basis of a comprehensive political settlement in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions. Progress towards accession and towards a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem will, in our view, naturally reinforce each other, and a political settlement would allow the provisions of the Accession Treaty to be implemented throughout the island.</P>
      <P>The Government of Cyprus has offered to include Turkish Cypriot representatives in its accession negotiating delegation.  The European Union has welcomed this offer, and Ireland shares the view that it is important to associate the Turkish Cypriot community with the accession process.  However, the Turkish Cypriot community has so far declined to take up the offer extended by the Government of Cyprus. The Presidency and the Commission is continuing to pursue contacts with the Government of Cyprus and the leadership of the Turkish Cypriot community, with a view to finding a basis for the participation of the Turkish Cypriot community in the accession negotiations.</P>

The efforts of Mr. Ross to persuade the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to set aside pre-conditions do not appear to have yielded positive results and he has now returned to Washington for further consultations with his authorities.</P>
      <P>Following the decision of the Israeli Government in February 1997 to extend settlements into Palestinian neighbourhoods of Eastern Jerusalem, and the failure to adhere to previously agreed redeployment deadlines, the confidence essential to momentum in the process has eroded.</P>
      <P>The European Special Envoy, Miguel Moratinos, and his team have been making an increasingly significant contribution to the search for mutually agreeable terms on issues outstanding from the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of September 1995 &mdash; for instance, the Gaza airport and industrial zone and safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank.  The European Union fully supports US efforts to bring about a resumption of negotiations.</P>
      <P>The process process must be given every chance and support to deliver a better future to everyone in the region.</P>
      <P>For my part, I wish to reiterate the Government's commitment to continue to work both bilaterally and within the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy and in the United Nations towards the objective of a comprehensive and enduring peace.</P>

      <P>I believe that all Members of this House will agree that every effort should be made to avoid a difficult marching season this year.  It is important that the people of Northern Ireland are spared the difficulty which has marked parades in recent years.  It is equally important that the outcome of the talks process in which we are all engaged is not threatened by a contentious and troublesome marching season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Governments have put forward views and proposals on the parades issue through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and we will continue to do so for as long as is necessary.  At the most recent <Col N="826" /> meeting of the Conference in Dublin on 5 March, I raised my concerns with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland about the prospects for this years marching season.  I also raised the negative reaction in the nationalist community to the appointments to the new parades commission.</P>
    <P>I met earlier this year with residents groups from the Garvaghy Road in Portadown and from the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast.  I am open to meeting representatives of these groups and other groups in the future, if requested, and if I feel it could prove helpful to resolving conflicts over parades.  The Parades Commission has the potential to play a useful role.  To succeed, it is essential that the commission approaches its task in an evenhanded way and is fair and impartial in its decisions.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I will be closely following this issue closely in the period ahead.  My Department will also continue to monitor the issue and to maintain contact with interested parties.</P>

      <P>The Government and its partners in the European Union are deeply concerned that the elections scheduled for 26 September in Cambodia may not be held in a manner that could be satisfactorily described as free and fair.  The attitude adopted by the Hun Sen regime towards the organisation of the elections and also the regime's relationship with the national election commission will clearly be crucial in this regard.</P>
      <P>The European Commission has allocted a total of 9.5 million ecu to provide electoral assistance and to supply and equip observers for the election process.  The Commission has established an office in Phnom Penh which &mdash; together with those EU embassies which are already located there &mdash; will be well placed to monitor events.  We have been assured that should the Commission representatives conclude that suitable conditions for a free and fair election do not exist, Commission funding will be immediately halted.  In such circumstances, widespread international acceptance of the results of any election would be unlikely.</P>
      <P>A positive development in the past two weeks has been the amnesty granted to the former first Prime Minister, Prince Ranariddh.  This should allow him to return to Cambodia and participate in the elections.</P>

      <P>The European Council, meeting at Luxembourg on 12-13 December, confirmed Turkey's eligibility for accession to the EU on the basis of the same criteria as the other applicant states.  While the political and economic conditions allowing accession negotiations to be envisaged are not satisfied, the European Council nonetheless considered it important to draw up a strategy to prepare Turkey for accession by bringing it closer to the European Union in every field.  The strategy included, <i>inter alia,</i> the development of the possibilities afforded by the EC-Turkey Association Agreement, an intensification of the Customs Union, implementation of financial co-operation and participation in certain programmes and agencies.  On 4 March the European Commission brought forward a communication to the Council of Ministers elaborating on the possibilities afforded by the strategy outlined at Luxembourg, and Council will be considering these proposals in the coming months.</P>
      <P>In addition, the European Council at Luxembourg invited Turkey to participate in the European Conference, which had its inaugural meeting on 12 March in London.  The conference was designed to bring together the member states of the European Union and the states aspiring to accede to it, with the objective of stepping up their dialogue and co-operation in areas of common interest.</P>
      <P>The European Council also indicated that strengthening Turkey's links with the EU depends on that country's pursuit of the political and economic reforms on which it has embarked, including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in force in the EU, respect for and protection of minorities, the establishment of satisfactory and stable relations between Greece and Turkey, the settlement of disputes by legal process, including the international court of justice and support for negotiations under the aegis of the UN on a political settlement in Cyprus on the basis of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turkey declined to attend the inaugural meeting of the European Conference, and has not &mdash; so far &mdash; responded positively to the proposals outlined in the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council.  The UK Presidency has been active in seeking to maintain an ongoing dialogue with Turkey, and we have fully supported the Presidency in its efforts in this regard.  Turkey is an important partner for the Union, and Ireland <Col N="828" /> believes that it is in the fundamental interest of both parties &mdash; the Union and Turkey &mdash; to further develop relations.  We would also wish to encourage Turkey to reflect further on the elements for enhanced co-operation outlined at Luxembourg, which we believe have considerable potential to deepen the relationship between the Union and Turkey.</P>

      <P>The current Lomé Convention expires in February 2000.</P>
      <P>The commission transmitted to the council on 29 January 1998 draft directives for the negotiation of a new development agreement with Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries to replace the current convention when it lapses.</P>
      <P>The commission has proposed negotiation of a general framework agreement with ACP countries by 2000 with regional economic agreements to be negotiated by 2005.</P>
      <P>Ireland supports this approach and will urge that new arrangements should fully safeguard the position of least developed countries; should at least maintain current market access for the ACP states and should be WTO compatible.</P>
      <P>Ireland will also support strengthening political co-operation with the ACP states and adopting development co-operation programmes to take account of the needs of the ACP countries themselves, especially the least developed.</P>
      <P>Ireland attaches great importance to the negotiation of a new Lomé agreement and will actively participate in negotiations to this end.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that with the coming into effect of the Amsterdam Treaty, probably early next year, certain changes in common foreign and security policy of the European Union will come into effect.  The treaty will determine the shape of the European Union's CFSP into the next century.  Ireland will continue to play a full role in the CFSP as it develops along the lines envisaged in the treaty.  The changes provided for in the treaty include a greater use of qualified majority voting, although it will remain possible for a member state in the last resort to block a decision; the wording of security-defence provisions in the Maastricht Treaty is revised somewhat; specific provision is made for the carrying out the Petersberg Tasks, operational expenditure arising from the implementation of CFSP will be carried in the union budget; the Secretary General of the council will become the high representative for the CFSP.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, 31 March, the intergovernmental conferences with the six applicant countries, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, and Cyprus, commenced.  Depending on progress in these negotiations, the next five years may well see the accession to the union of some or all of these countries.  This enlargement of the union to 21 states and extending the boundaries of the union further eastward may well have an effect on the focus of the CFSP.  Exactly what this effect will be is difficult to foretell, however, I am confident that Ireland will continue to contribute to the CFSP in as meaningful a way as it has to date.</P>

I see our policy of military neutrality as an important element of our foreign policy which is based on constructive and active engagement with the key international issues.  Ireland's policy of military neutrality has been in keeping with the desire of Irish people to see Ireland play a constructive and honourable role in international efforts to address the causes of conflict, to respond to international crisis and humanitarian disasters when they occur and to contribute to the efforts of the international community to manage and bring to an end such crisis.</P>

      <P>The Government, both bilaterally and in conjunction with our European partners, has availed of every appropriate opportunity to convey our concerns about an early return to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria.  These concerns have been conveyed both directly to the Nigerian authorities and at the UN and other appropriate fora.  Along with our union partners, we have also repeatedly expressed our willingness to engage in a dialogue with the Nigerian Government on these matters. However, such offers, including those made publicly by the EU Council of Foreign Ministers, have not been reciprocated in terms of a concrete dialogue to date.  In the absence of such a framework for dialogue the Government will continue to support strongly, including at this month's 54th Session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, concerted international action which will lead to an early return to democratic government and full observance of human rights in that country.</P>

      <P>I have not addressed the subject raised by the Deputy at EU level.  However, our EU partners are in no doubt about Ireland's commitment to EU integration.</P>
      <P>For 25 years, Ireland has been a full participant in the process of European integration.  We have benefited enormously from membership of the European Union and contributed constructively to its development.  Naturally, we would view with concern, therefore, any development which might call into question the process of European integration.</P>
      <P>In this connection the rules regarding application of the subsidiarity principle &mdash; which require that action by the Union is justified only where the objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved at national level and that they can be better achieved at Union level &mdash; are designed to ensure subsidiarity does not work against integration. This is particularly the case in relation to the Union's common policies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Treaty of Amsterdam contains general provisions which will permit a number of member states less than the full membership to avail of the institutions of the Union to organise &ldquo;closer co-operation&rdquo; between themselves.  These provisions are an acknowledgement that the member states of a future enlarged European Union might not all be able or willing to move forward together to greater integration in particular areas.  In this context, great care has been taken to ensure the application of closer co-operation or flexibility will not in future prove damaging to the coherence and solidarity of the Union.  This is reflected in a tight framework of rules to govern the circumstances in which the provisions for closer co-operation might be invoked.</P>

    <P>The promotion of renewable energy, including wind energy, is a priority of the Goverment's <Col N="836" /> overall energy policy as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  The third alternative energy requirement competition, AER III, launched in March 1997, seeks to increase the contribution of renewable energy resources by 100 MWe by the end of 1999.  This includes 90 MWe provided by wind energy.  The results of the competition will be announced in the coming month.  Currently there are seven wind farms in operation with an aggregate installed capacity of 50.6 MWe.  A further 10 MWe from two wind-farms will come on stream shortly.</P>

      <P>The criteria established to facilitate selection of area for reclassification as extremely disadvantaged were as follows: the areas must be already designated more severely handicapped, and should not extend beyond the boundary of the original MSH designation of 1975; there must be a high proportion of &ldquo;rough grazing&rdquo; land in the areas; the areas must be subject to extreme climatic conditions; to ensure homogeneity of physical characteristics and farming types, areas must be at least 20,000 hectares in extent.  All potential areas were examined for compliance with these criteria, and proposals were prepared which were formally submitted to the EU Commission on 9 October 1996.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the submission, the Commission raised the issues of conservation and overgrazing in connection with the REPS and special areas of conservation.  It is concerned to ensure proposals affecting the extension and reclassification of land in the disadvantaged areas do not have an adverse effect on areas which are being targeted by the REPS and SAC's as requiring special attention.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Commission has made it clear that discussions relating to overgrazing and conservation must be concluded before proposals affecting disadvantaged areas can be finalised.  I have been in contact with the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Franz Fischler, to impress on him the importance of finalising these issues, and I will continue to press for an early decision on the third tier proposals.</P>

    <P>At yesterday's meeting of the Council of Ministers in Brussels I told Commissioner Fischler and my colleagues in the Council that Ireland would be seriously and disproportionately disadvantaged by these proposals and that they were <Col N="839" /> therefore unacceptable to Ireland.  Over the coming months of negotiations I will seek radical amendments to the proposals so that Irish farmers obtain adequate compensation for price reductions and are not disadvantaged in comparison with their counterparts in other member states and the Irish agriculture and food sectors can make the maximum contribution to national wealth and employment.  I also asked the Commission to examine the implications of the Agenda 2000 proposals for the sheepmeat sector and to submit a report on these to the Council together with appropriate proposals.</P>

      <P>The national beef assurance scheme will be introduced later this year and will include a comprehensive animal identification and tracing system.  Many elements of animal identification and tracing, for example bovine tagging, registration of calf births, cattle passports, computerised animal location file, are already in place.  These measures are now being enhanced by the introduction of a computerised cattle movement monitoring system.  This system involves the collection of animal movement data electronically from marts, meat export plants, larger domestic abattoirs and live export points and the use of a paper notification system in respect of other movements.  The practical arrangements for implementation of this system such as installation of equipment, training, development of the necessary computer programs, etc, are well advanced.</P>

      <P>The person registered under the herd number quoted applied on 56 animals under the January/February 1993 special beef premium schemes.  He was paid £1,318.25 on 30 August 1994 for 25 of those animals, i.e. 15 livestock units, as he did not lodge an area aid application in that year under this herd number.  He was paid on a further four animals on 22 January 1997 when it was decided that an area aid application lodged under another herd number included his acreage and the inclusion of the further four animals combined with the 61 animals applied by the herdowner who lodged the area aid application did not exceed the overall 90 limit.  He was also paid extensification premium of £764.44 on 13 January 1997 on those 29 animals.</P>
      <P>The person named also applied under the special beef premium schemes on 58 animals on 3 March 1995.  He was paid £2,197.00 on 29 March 1996 in respect of 25 animals, i.e. 15 livestock units, as he did not lodge an area aid application under the herd number quoted in that year either.</P>
      <P>Difficulties have arisen in this case as to whether the herd number in question was being farmed separately from the herd number under which area aid applications were lodged in 1993 and 1995.  The situation is being examined at present with a view to ensuring that the terms and conditions governing premia payments are adhered to.  It is hoped to reach a decision on this matter shortly.</P>

      <P>The milk quota clawback measure was introduced in October 1996 in order to encourage non-active quota holders to re-direct their quota away from private land transactions and to offer it instead to the restructuring or temporary leasing schemes.  The quota is then available to small scale producers who have first priority status under both schemes.</P>
      <P>Quota becoming available as a result of clawback is added to the national reserve and is allocated to producers, free of charge, on hardship grounds or on a temporary basis on animal disease grounds.  An amount of 306,712 gallons of milk quota has been taken into the national reserve under the terms of the clawback arrangements.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed the operation of the clawback arrangements and because of the very significant increase in land transactions and the consequences for the restructuring and temporary leasing schemes, I have increased the level of clawback from 10 per cent to 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of course, that there are specific land transactions to which the clawback arrangements do not apply.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that any question of compensation arises in relation to the clawback.  Producers have a choice to enter into a private land transaction which is subject to clawback or to offer their quota to the restructuring or temporary leasing schemes which are not subject to clawback.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that Cavan has already benefited from decentralisation, with the location in Cavan town of 174 staff of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The current programme of decentralisation has yet to be completed.  Decentralisation raises a number of issues including its impact on the efficient delivery of Government services.  I am at present considering these issues and it is my intention to discuss them with my colleagues in Government.</P>
      <P>The NESC report entitled &ldquo;Population Distribution and Economic Development &mdash; Trends and Policy Implications&rdquo; provides a comprehensive description of the main characteristics and trends in regional settlement patterns in Ireland since the 1950s and also the wide range of economic and non-economic influences which have determined the evolution of these patterns over that period.</P>
      <P>The key influence of urbanisation on population stability and growth emerges strongly from the report's analysis.  However, it should be noted that the role of public policy in shaping settlement patterns at regional or sub-regional levels is limited by both economic and non-economic factors outside of the Government's control, for example, patterns of migration and private sector investment strategies.</P>

      <P>The question of establishing a system of statutory registration for designated health and social service professions has been under consideration by my Department for some time.  The groups concerned are social workers, physiotherapists, radiographers, chiropodists, care workers, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, environmental health officers, and medical laboratory technicians.</P>
      <P>However, despite various initiatives over recent years, great difficulties still remain in devising a scheme which would meet all the requirements of the various professions and which would provide for a system of self-financing self-regulation.  This issue is once again being examined within my Department at present, with other models for statutory registration being investigated in an effort to overcome the difficulties in question.</P>

      <P>The new hospital at Tallaght will incorporate the services currently being provided at the Adelaide Hospital, the Meath Hospital and the National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street.  In addition, acute psychiatric services currently being provided at St. Loman's Hospital will also transfer to Tallaght.</P>
      <P>The Meath Hospital, the Adelaide Hospital and the National Children's Hospital are voluntary hospitals and as such, the hospitals or their successor bodies, have full ownership of their sites.  When the services transfer to Tallaght, I understand that the hospital sites will be sold as the premises will no longer function as acute hospitals.  Since agreement was reached on the development of the new hospital &mdash; the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital &mdash; it has always been understood that the three constituent hospitals would close as acute hospitals once the new hospital is opened.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Eastern Health Board's Working Group on the South Inner City Primary Care Needs Assessment identified the problems likely to arise following the relocation of existing services to Tallaght.  It recommended the establishment of a primary care centre and the enhancement of general practice and community services in the south inner city, with the primary care centre acting as a central focus for the organisation and delivery of services encompassing the full range of health care and administrative needs for primary care services in the area.  The Eastern Health Board is currently examining a number of options for the provision of these services including the possibility of acquiring the Meath Hospital campus.</P>

      <P>Approximately 15,000 people residing in the United Kingdom receive payment of a benefit or pension from my Department. These payments include old age contributory pension, retirement pension, widows and widowers contributory pensions, invalidity pensions, disability benefit, maternity benefit and unemployment benefit.  The majority of these people receive a long-term social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>The level of benefits or pensions received is that which each recipient is entitled to under Irish social welfare legislation and, where appropriate, the European Union regulations on social security. There is no provision made in national legislation to pay persons resident abroad more than they are entitled to in Irish punts in order to compensate for currency fluctuations.  There is no such requirement either under the EU regulations.</P>
      <P>A system to compensate for currency fluctuations would be extremely difficulty to administer given the frequency of these fluctuations and the number of currencies in the EU.  Such a system would, in addition, have to include reducing payments in Irish punts when the Irish punt appreciated against another currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for such a system will no longer arise <Col N="852" /> for more EU member states with the advent of the single currency under economic and monetary union, although this will not apply to the UK for the present.</P>
    <P>Under the EU regulations on social security, EU citizens resident in the United Kingdom are eligible for income support on the same basis as UK citizens whose incomes fall below specified levels.  Recipients of Irish social welfare benefits, the value of which have fallen because of currency fluctuations, would be among these eligible categories.  In 1996 when the Irish punt appreciated significantly against sterling, people resident in Ireland with UK pensions were similarly eligible for payments under the appropriate Irish social assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department is also seeking to reduce the costs to pensioners living in the United Kingdom of having to change their payments into sterling by the introduction and extension of the electronic fund transfer method of payment.  Recipients of old age contributory pension, retirement pensions and widows and widowers contributory pensions are paid either by cheque or by means of electronic fund transfer, EFT.  Payments made by way of a fund transfer are in sterling while payments made by cheque are in Irish punts.</P>
    <P>While payments under EFT are determined by current exchange rates, the main advantage of this method of payment is that conversion commission charges are avoided.  In addition, encashment charges, often levied by banks and building societies when cheques are cashed, do not apply and payment is guaranteed as it eliminates the risk of cheques being lost or stolen in the post.</P>
    <P>At present some 7,000 social welfare pensioners in the United Kingdom have opted for this payment method.  All new recipients of these social welfare pensions, who are resident outside the State, have payment made by way of an electronic fund transfer.</P>

In that regard, comprehensive rules entitled &ldquo;Safety Conditions for Eectrical Installations and Equipment for Buildings and Areas containing Explosives&rdquo; have been drawn up and are applied in the case of licences issued by the Minister for such sites under the provisions of the Explosives Act, 1875, as amended.  The provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 are also relevant in this connection.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the Minister of the day to decide whether all the information available to him is such as to warrant the conclusion that applicants for naturalisation are of good character.  As in all situations where character assessments fall to be made, whether by Ministers or otherwise, a variety of factors may be taken into account, not all of which are necessarily the subject of records in my Department. While I am not in a position to say what the full range of considerations was at the time, I am advised that, in the case of those on whom information is currently available &mdash; I do not have information at this time on all of the persons concerned &mdash; the indications are that they are highly respected individuals of substance.</P>
      <P>I know that the Deputy will agree with me when I say that it would be most regrettable if his question had the effect of casting any doubt on the characters of people who do not deserve that result.  I am sure that nothing of this kind is intended.</P>

      <P>The person referred to in the question was transferred to Northern Ireland to serve the balance of his sentence under the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</P>
      <P>Prior to his transfer, the Northern Ireland authorities advised my Department that his sentence would be administered under the &ldquo;continued enforcement&rdquo; procedure in accordance with article 10 of the convention.  The Northern Ireland authorities are thus bound by both the legal nature as well as the duration of the sentence as determined by the sentencing state.</P>
      <P>The Northern Ireland authorities further advised that life sentence prisoners generally serve a period within the range of 10-20 years. Such prisoners in Northern Ireland normally have their cases reviewed by the life sentence review board for the first time at the ten year stage.  The criteria used in reviewing such cases are similar to those applied in the administration of life sentences in this jurisdiction.  Offenders in this jurisdiction who have served seven years or more of a determinate or indeterminate sentence, but excluding capital murder cases, may, if they so wish, have their cases considered by the sentence review group.  The sentence review group advises the Minister in relation to the administration of long-term prison sentences.</P>
      <P>The person referred to was the eleventh offender to be transferred to Northern Ireland since the convention was ratified here in November, 1995 with the passing of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995.  Similar criteria have been used in assessing all such applications for transfer under the convention to date.  It has also been established Government policy, in line with the humanitarian provisions of the convention, that all prisoners, whenever possible, should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families.</P>

    <P>In addition, in 1995-96 my Department commenced a pilot programme of special education services for children with autism.  The Department has commenced a review of this pilot programme. This review, which is expected to be completed by the end of the current school year, will provide a basis for the development of future <Col N="860" /> responses to the educational needs of children with autism.</P>

      <P>At present, my Department recognises nine outdoor education centres, OECs, operated by vocational education committees for the purposes of funding.  These are Garton OEC, County Donegal VEC; Achill OEC, County Mayo VEC; Petersburg OEC, County Galway VEC; Turlough OEC, County Clare VEC; Kilfinane OEC, County Limerick VEC; Cappanalea OEC, County Kerry VEC; Kinsale OEC, County Cork VEC; Ramsgrange OEC, County Wexford VEC and Birr OEC, County Offaly VEC.</P>
      <P>No additional outdoor education centres have been recognised by my Department pending a complete review of the outdoor education centres generally.  A group to review this matter was formed some time ago and its review is nearing completion at present.</P>
      <P>There are four established outdoor education centres administered by vocational education committees seeking recognition at present.  These are at Tanagh, County Monaghan, Lanesboro, County Longford, Baltinglass, County Wicklow and Newport, County Tipperary.  In addition, County Sligo VEC has a proposal to develop a property as an outdoor education centre and County Cork VEC is seeking the recognition of Schull sailing centre as an outdoor education centre.</P>
      <P>On receipt and consideration of the report of the review group, I will be in a position to consider the question of granting recognition to the unrecognised centres.</P>

      <P>Since 1996 the student support schemes have been extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states.  Prior to this, such grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In this context, following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying.  It was further agreed that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid, in all circumstances, would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the relevant country in which the student was studying, at the prevailing exchange rate.  Previously, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates.  Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continue to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates.  Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements.  I am satisfied that these arrangements are equitable and efficient.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in Northern Ireland without giving rise to an anomalous inequity <i>vis-a -vis</i> students studying elsewhere in the EU.</P>

      <P>The manager of the school referred to by the Deputy applied to my Department in November 1997 for grant assistance towards the cost of a range of capital improvement works at the school.  My Department examined the application and subsequently advised the school authorities that it was not in a position to approve funding for the proposed scheme due to the level of existing contractual commitments and available capital funding.</P>
      <P>In March 1998 my Department received a further application for grant assistance towards the cost of other improvement works at the school.  The local Office of Public Works has been requested to furnish a report on the proposed works.  When this report is received, a decision will be taken on the application in the light of the urgency of the works and available capital funding. I will keep the Deputy informed of developments.</P>

      <P>My Department's capacity to allocate additional child care assistant posts in any year is entirely dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand across the special needs area.  Where such posts do become available, they are allocated on the basis of priority of need.  In recent years, available posts have generally been allocated to special classes which cater for children with a severe or profound mental handicap.</P>
      <P>I am at present reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure that all available resources, including child care support, are deployed as effectively as possible.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of children with physical and sensory disabilities will be considered in this context.</P>
