      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has two Bills concerning the electricity industry &mdash; the Electricity Regulation Bill and the Electricity Supply and Reorganisation of the ESB Bill.  Is this legislation affected by reports of substantial claims for disease, related to the presence of asbestos in ESB plants?  Is the Government aware of potential problems with regard to liability there, which might affect the accounts of the ESB and, indeed, of other companies the Government might at some point wish to divest its interests in?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Health and Children announced changes in the drug refund schemes.  Did the Cabinet agree such changes?  Will the regulations to give effect to these changes &mdash; which basically involve an increase in the cost of drugs for people &mdash; be laid before the House in the normal way?  Is it possible for the Government to make time available for a debate on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter does not involve legislation.  If there is a change in the regulations it is an administrative matter within the Department. These matters were discussed by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated last week, these matters have not yet been agreed by the Government. However, if the House requires a debate on the report which is now being laid before the House, I will ask the Whip to see whether it can be fitted in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>On 2 December 1977 we discussed the deferment of the regional fishery board appointments for a year to allow for a comprehensive review of the Central Fisheries Board. I note there is no timescale with regard to the extension.  Could the Taoiseach clarify whether there is any deadline now as we have already allowed a year for the review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension was for a year, but it is hoped the matter can be finalised early in the new year.  There was no objection to the extension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week on radio the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív advocated the introduction of a tourist tax.  A week previously, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, said he rejected the principle of a tourist tax.  Could the Taoiseach clarify the situation?  Does he intend to introduce legislation or regulations to bring in this type of tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Government announced the establishment of the George Mitchell scholarship scheme.  The Government will contribute an endowment of £2 million to establish the scholarship scheme which will enable highly qualified American post-graduate students to attend Irish universities.  The legislation is necessary to enable the sum of £2 million to be paid into the fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  The scheme is named after Senator George Mitchell in recognition of his contribution to building lasting peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The fund will be managed and controlled in the United States by appropriate persons appointed by the Minister for Education and Science with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  These persons will carry out their functions in accordance with an agreement which will cover matters such as the control and management of the fund, criteria for the academic standards necessary to receive a scholarship and disbursement from the fund.  The agreement may also specify the universities or colleges in the United States from which a candidate may apply for a scholarship.  Any agreement made by the Minister must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the Minister should prepare an annual report on the operation of the fund and that a copy of the report, an abstract of any audited accounts of the fund and a copy of any auditor's report must be laid before the Oireachtas.  The Bill also provides that expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the legislation will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I apologise for my late arrival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great pleasure to introduce a Bill that marks an historic development in relations between the two traditions on this island and between Ireland and the United States.  The George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Bill honours a man who has contributed much to the cause of peace on this island, whose guiding hand was behind the British-Irish Agreement and who has helped to set our country on the road to a more peaceful future.  Simultaneously, it brings into existence a scholarship fund which will both enrich the lives of young people for generations <Col N="1196" /> to come and strengthen the already close bonds between Ireland and the United States.</P>
    <P>Everybody has heard of the Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University.  In almost a century of existence, it has allowed some of the world's finest minds to live the Oxford experience and to circulate in an educational ambit of which they might otherwise have been ignorant.  It has consistently proved itself of immense benefit to the individual scholar, Oxford University and to society.  Its prestige is unrivalled.  Former recipients include world leaders and some of the most eminent writers and thinkers of our time.</P>
    <P>I am proud to bring before the House a Bill to establish an Irish version of the Rhodes scholarship, the George J. Mitchell scholarship.  Once in operation, this programme will allow young American scholars to experience the Irish university system and to contribute their energy and talent to it.  The individual scholar and the Irish university system will benefit and the ties between Ireland and the United States will be further strengthened, while establishing a permanent reminder of the good works of Senator Mitchell on our behalf.</P>
    <P>George Mitchell has had a celebrated career not only as a senator and a lawyer but also as a peacemaker.  His was the guiding hand behind the British-Irish Agreement, the Mitchell Principles set the tone for that Agreement and the peace process in the North bears the stamp of his integrity.</P>
    <P>Through his efforts and those of General de Chastelain and Prime Minister Harri Holkeri, we have seen unprecedented change in the way our two traditions regard each other and themselves. We have seen Unionist and Nationalist come together at the table of government, the leader of Unionism standing side by side with the Taoiseach on the steps of Government Buildings and, most recently, Prime Minister Blair become the first British Prime Minister to address the Oireachtas.  These were historic moments, images without precedent in the course of Irish history.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland have endorsed the British-Irish Agreement as the only legitimate charter to guide and direct our efforts now and for the future as we seek to build a new agreed Ireland, North and South.  The voice of the people, spoken by the living representatives of the two great traditions of this island, has redefined Ireland.  Their collective verdict transcends not just the Anglo-Irish Agreement but the 1920-1921 settlement. The all Ireland vote, the first since 1918, has infused the 1937 Constitution with a new authority appropriate to the challenges and opportunities which are offered at the close of one century and the opening of another.</P>
    <P>It required people of vision to advance the North from 30 years of stalemate to a position of hope.  Visionaries on both sides of the political and cultural divide saw the opportunity for progress and, guided by Senator Mitchell's tenacity and perspicacity, have taken us to the cusp of a new era.  Uniquely, Senator Mitchell helped us to <Col N="1197" /> help ourselves and the people of Ireland, North and South, have every reason to be grateful to him.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we honour the good work of Senator Mitchell with the establishment of this scholarship in his name.  In the same way he helped us to seek the best in ourselves, this scholarship will reward the best, most rounded young people of their generations, cementing the bonds between Ireland and the United States.  It will also be seen as a declaration that we have learnt from the errors of the past and that we are prepared to embark on a new era of co-operation, both internationally and within Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill. Anybody who has had the privilege of knowing Senator Mitchell will be aware that he is truly a son of America, in the proudest tradition of that country.</P>
      <P>As he said in a recent speech, America is a country in which everybody has a chance.  There was no greater joy for him in his role as a federal judge than conducting citizenship ceremonies, occasions at which America welcomed the huddled masses, the people struggling to be free. He said the ceremonies were always emotional occasions for him because his mother was an immigrant from Lebanon and his father was the orphan son of immigrants from Ireland.  They had no education and worked hard all their lives at difficult and low paying jobs.  As a result of their efforts, he said, and more importantly due to the openness of American society, &ldquo;I, their son, was able to become the Majority Leader of the United States Senate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator Mitchell never lost sight of his inheritance from his parents and his country.  He has devoted many years and much of his talent to giving back much of that inheritance.  He also said in that recent speech:</P>
      <P>I was one of those who had a chance and I thank God for my good fortune.  Now, by an accident of fate in a way I did not seek or expect, I have been given the opportunity to help others to have a chance.  That they are in Ireland, the land of my father's heritage, is just a fortuitous coincidence.  That I am able to help, even in just a small way, is what matters.</P>
      <P>George Mitchell brought an immense range of talents to Northern Ireland and to the peace process. He had a calmness, a kindness and a tolerance for everybody, regardless of whether they were the Taoiseach of the day, the President or just an ordinary member of the public.  He gave everybody the same time and attention.  He brought what could be described as old fashioned virtues &mdash; courtesy and humility &mdash; to the process. These virtues appear to be outdated today but in George Mitchell we see how powerful they are in bringing people together, people who had been divided irreconciliably for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The virtue of patience brought him through tireless hours of talks which appeared to inch forward <Col N="1198" /> only to take strides backwards.  It took a man of immense spirit and talent to tolerate that process and always to emerge with his eye on the main objective, achieving peace and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Many people mistook George Mitchell to be somebody who was soft because of his gentle tones.  He was anything but.  Throughout his political career he was a man of immense tenacity, concentrating on issues of principle.  It is interesting to focus on the issues for which Senator Mitchell fought in the course of his career.  He fought for reform of the health system, social reform and environmental reform.  He saw the big picture and was not drawn into the petty squabbles of political debate.  He was able to marshall his resources and keep his reserves intact with an eye to the big debates in which he wished to make progress.  It was a tremendous compliment to Ireland that he was willing to give this country so much of his time and talent.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that when Senator Mitchell resigned his seat in the Senate, it was an immense surprise.  It was presumed that he was a shoe-in to the US Supreme Court which would have provided him with a job for life in secure surroundings. A good lifestyle beckoned.  Instead, Senator Mitchell was willing to trade it for the grim task he undertook in Northern Ireland.  He had only recently married and his wife was expecting their first child.  The choice of giving up such a comfortable life and turning his attention to reconciling the irreconciliable in Northern Ireland is an immense tribute to the qualities of George Mitchell.</P>
    <P>He was greeted on his arrival there with accusations of bias and boycotts.  There were immense difficulties which put him under personal pressure.  He did not flinch from the task before him because he had his eye on the goal that was to be achieved. There is no doubt that the path-breaking Mitchell principles he enunciated got all sides off the horns of a dilemma.  People had taken up stances on issues from which they could not easily back down.  His skill was to allow people to come back without losing face and to move forward.  Those talents have been of immense value.</P>
    <P>When speaking of awards, peace prizes and so on it is right that George Mitchell's contribution should not be forgotten.  He was the first person of the year who came from outside Ireland.  That in itself is a tribute to him.  He is a man with a big heart and has a solid determination to achieve.  It is fitting to honour him by establishing an educational scholarship.  It is right that a man who devoted so much of his career to trying to stamp out ignorance and fear in communities should be honoured by putting resources into an education system dedicated to doing just that.  It is education which can over time root out the intransigence and the bitterness that so many of us on this island have inherited.  It is fitting that an educational prize be used to honour George Mitchell's contribution.  I hope he will continue to come <Col N="1199" /> to Ireland and enjoy the real warmth which all of us in this House and beyond have for him.  I hope also he will have the opportunity to come with his son and sit in a Northern Ireland assembly to hear debate and discussion among parties that were for so many years irreconcilable and which saw only one way, the way of violence.  His legacy will be that he saw that the only way was the way of peace.  That is what drove him on throughout this period.</P>
    <P>I thank the Government on introducing this legislation and George Mitchell for his immense contribution.  I wish him well in all the other areas where he will apply his talents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Government on introducing this legislation.  On behalf of the Labour Party and in the context of this legislation I recognise the enormous contribution by George Mitchell to the British-Irish Agreement and his great input into thinking here.  He represents an excellent role model for students.  He demonstrates the equalities to which we should all aspire.  However, I have a number of difficulties with the legislation.  I do not mean to be negative but I make my suggestions in a constructive manner to the Minister.  The first two amendments I have tabled are of a technical nature while the other two deal with a more substantive matter.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 deals with the use of the word &ldquo;duly&rdquo;, in page 3, line 21.  Section 2 (1) states: &ldquo;The Minister shall duly establish, in the United States,.&rdquo;.  My legal advice is that the word &ldquo;duly&rdquo; is redundant, adds nothing to the Bill and the text would benefit from its deletion. Amendment No. 2 is of a more serious nature in that it deals with an aspect of international law &mdash; that a State cannot pass legislation for something to happen in another State without the consent of that State.  Section 2 (1) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall duly establish, in the United States, a fund which shall be known as the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund,.</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 21, subsection (1), after &ldquo;States&rdquo; I am seeking to insert the following: &ldquo;with the prior consent of the United States&rdquo;.  A State can pass extraterritorial legislation of this type only with the consent of the State in which the activity is being carried out.  The amendment will ensure the Bill complies and is seen to comply with international law.  I ask the Minister to examine that matter.  If his legal advice is contrary I am happy to accept it.  My legal advice is as I have presented it.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 relate to the type of institutions with which American students, who benefit under the George Mitchell scholarship fund, may become involved in Ireland.  As the Bill is drafted this is restricted to universities.  The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the Minister for Education and Science to establish a fund for the purpose of providing scholarships for citizens <Col N="1200" /> and nationals of the United States who are attending universities or colleges of higher learning in the United States..</P>
    <P>The students who can avail of the fund do not have to attend universities, they can attend other colleges of higher education.  I put it strongly to the Minister that we need to expand the list of institutions which can benefit under this fund in Ireland in the sense of students being referred to them.  The areas of study of the Irish School of Ecumenics are ecumenics and conflict resolution. Its academic base is growing rapidly in the context of a new arrangement it will enter into with Trinity College.  This institution deals with areas of study which are fundamental to those in which George Mitchell has involved himself.  American students should be given the opportunity to choose that institution when pursuing the type of study which will be funded under the new scholarship fund.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the institutes of technology have been omitted from the Bill.  It is extraordinary that a scholarship fund, being put in place to honour an American, George Mitchell, who has played such a huge role in bringing about peace in Ireland, is not to be applicable to the Border counties.  There are two institutes of technology in the Border counties, at Letterkenny and Dundalk.  Surely it is appropriate and necessary that institutes of technology in the Border areas be included among those prescribed in the Bill.  The whole sector should be involved. I represent the south-east region which has two institutes of technology, Waterford and Carlow. Both these institutes will be outside the scheme as proposed.  It further means the fifth largest city will be unable to participate in the context of students taking up their studies in third level institutions in Waterford.  There will not be an opportunity for American students to attend institutions in the midlands.</P>
    <P>The north-east, the north-west, the midlands and the south-east will, by definition, be excluded from participating in the scheme.  These exclusions are unjustifiable, particularly in the context of the growth of those institutions and their status.  If graduates from the institutes of technology seek to take up employment in the US, it will be important to use every means at our disposal to raise the level of their status to ensure that the qualifications they offer will take on a higher standing in that country.  This will happen if the Minister takes the route outlined in my proposal.</P>
    <P>Does he intend to take a proactive role in respect of the donations that can be made to the fund?  Will the organisation to be established in the US under the legislation be charged with playing a proactive role in terms of seeking finance or other assets to add to the fund to increase the number of people participating in the scheme?</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the George Mitchell scholarship fund and my party supports the Bill.  As stated earlier, George Mitchell is an <Col N="1201" /> excellent role model for young people because he portrays and personifies the attributes which are so important for a person intent on serving his community or other communities in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister take a more inclusive attitude with regard to the institutions in this country which will be allowed to participate in the scheme?  I accept the Bill may have been rather hurriedly produced and that this aspect may have been inadvertently overlooked.  Therefore, I will not make a political meal out of this point. However, the Bill will be better, more inclusive and more appropriate if the Minister includes the institutes of technology and the Irish School of Ecumenics among the institutions which can participate in the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I place on record my thanks and those of my constituents for the work done by Senator Mitchell during his protracted but fruitful stay in Ireland.  The work has been outstandingly successful.  I should go further and thank the President of the United States of America, Bill Clinton, for his work during the difficult negotiations on the peace process, the British Prime Minister, the Taoiseach and their predecessors, Mr. John Major and former Taoisigh, Deputies Albert Reynolds and John Bruton, the former leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, John Hume, Gerry Adams, David Trimble and former United States Ambassador to Ireland, Margaret Heckler, who all did outstanding work in difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement offers a new opportunity for peace in Ireland.  While progress will continue to be slow and difficult because of hiccups and setbacks, I am convinced the people want peace to reign on this island.  Their desire can be achieved.  The Minister correctly referred to the last all-Ireland vote in 1918 when an opportunity for peace was lost.  However, at that stage outside agencies could not participate to try to solve difficulties.  Without such participation and the efforts of George Mitchell and his partners, General de Chastelain and Harry Holkeri, difficulties would have again arisen on this occasion. However, their work proved successful.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a great tradition of success in the fields of literature and art.  However, it is not recognised for its success in the field of science. We have not laid claim to success in that area. When one considers the achievements made by the Earl of Ross and others in the development of the turbine engine and the telescope at Birr, County Offaly, in the last century, it becomes evident that Ireland has a tradition of scientific development.  We should place more emphasis on Irish people's achievements in that field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will benefit and learn from having American students visit her shores under the scholarship scheme.  I do not doubt that those students will also benefit from learning about our sports, culture and approach to life.  When they <Col N="1202" /> return to America they will be all the better for having some idea of the nature of life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I referred to science earlier because, if possible, the provisions of the Bill should be broadened to include institutions other than the universities. Bolton Street and Kevin Street Colleges of Technology, Athlone Regional Technical College and other colleges have played a positive role in allowing Ireland to expand its industrial base, nationally and internationally.</P>
    <P>We should investigate the possibility of making a reciprocal arrangement under the terms of the Bill whereby Irish students will be able to visit the United States.  Perhaps the Minister could discuss this matter with the American Ambassador and his US counterpart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  The name of George Mitchell will always rank highly in the minds of all Irish people. Senator Mitchell came on the scene at an important stage in the development of this island. I pay tribute to former Taoiseach Deputy John Bruton whose influence was vital in securing the appointment of George Mitchell.  In hindsight, Senator Mitchell's appointment was extremely important because he played a major role in the development of the peace process.  There were times during the talks when he wished he was elsewhere but he was persistent and showed vision, courage and great patience.  It is appropriate that his name should be associated with the scholarship fund.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the two traditions on the island.  There is a third tradition, those who want to live in peace.  We should pay tribute to the members of the security forces, North and South, who put their lives at risk and stood fearlessly in front of the gunmen and the bombers to preserve democracy on the island.  They are the real peacemakers, although politicians can also claim credit.  Without the security forces there would be no peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the value of the Bill and welcome it as a fitting tribute to the work done by Senator George Mitchell during the peace process.  He made a major contribution in inching the participants in the negotiations towards agreement.  He won the confidence of the majority.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Bill, the most fitting way of acknowledging his work would be to ensure the Agreement is put in place in its totality.  It is regrettable, despite the enormous progress made, that the various aspects of the Agreement which are waiting to fall into place are being held up by certain people who have adopted an implacable position on decommissioning.  It is an issue that must be dealt with.  It would be better to deal with it now rather than put it on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good Bill.  It is always of value for third level students to travel abroad to broaden their understanding of other societies.  It is unfortunate, however, that it is a one-way process, that <Col N="1203" /> students from the United States will be enabled to come here.  It may be a better procedure to allow Irish students to travel to the United States under the scheme.</P>
    <P>It would be of enormous value to enable students from working-class backgrounds to access the scheme.  There are enormous obstacles to participation at third level for those in working-class areas.  The participation rate is still extremely low.  The implementation and operation of the Bill should be examined to ensure it is not only those who are privileged who will benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appoint a person to manage the fund to which £2 million of taxpayers' money will be allocated.  How will the fund be managed? Perhaps the Minister should seek the approval of the House to appoint the person whom it is proposed should be put in charge of the fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  There was a broad welcome for the objectives of the Bill which acknowledges in an effective way the tremendous work done by Senator George Mitchell during the peace process.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the fund is to provide scholarships for American nationals attending universities or colleges of higher learning in the United States.  The Minister will be facilitated in reaching agreement with a number of parties on the establishment of the fund for which £2 million will be made available.  Private donations, particularly in the United States, will be sought.  It is a two-way process.</P>
      <P>There are other scholarship schemes which involve exchanges between Ireland and the United States.  A separate agreement was concluded recently with the University of Maine and the institute of technology in Maine for an exchange of two students per year between Ireland and Maine.  The Fulbright scholarship scheme also involves exchanges.</P>
      <P>Students in the United States will be facilitated to come here to conduct research.  This will be of benefit to the students themselves, the colleges concerned and ultimately the country in terms of the bonds that will be formed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 27, after &ldquo;an&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Institute of Technology or an&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I dealt with these amendments during my Second Stage speech.  I wish to briefly reiterate why the inclusion of the Irish School of Ecumenics and the institutes of technology would enhance this Bill and also help to raise the prestige of those institutions, not only in this country but also in the USA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This fund has been established to celebrate the contribution of George Mitchell to the peace process. Therefore, it seems extraordinary that the <Col N="1205" /> Border counties cannot, by definition, participate because the institutes of technology at Letterkenny, County Donegal and Dundalk, County Louth are excluded.  Sligo Institute of Technology is also close to the Border.  The north-eastern and north-western regions are excluded, as are the midlands and the south-east, which has two institutes of technology.  Our fifth largest city, Waterford, which I represent, is also excluded.</P>
    <P>The Irish School of Ecumenics, which is devoted to the study of ecumenics and conflict resolution, seems an appropriate institution to be involved in this fund.  I referred to the growing academic prowess of the institute in the context of co-operation with Trinity College.  This is a fundamental issue and I ask the Minister to agree to the inclusions of these institutions.  It does not go beyond that at this stage as the decisions to choose projects will be taken elsewhere.  If these institutions are excluded, they will never participate, which is my difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Shea's amendment.  We should relax the straitjacket of this provision on Report Stage.  Essentially it is an extremely elitist approach to selecting students to be supported by the fund &mdash; those with a high level of academic achievement who will be attending university.  This fund is being established to encourage research, to look at what is dividing communities and what can be done to study problems on the ground to break down barriers. There is no doubt that those with an academic background have a contribution to make in this area.  However, we must not have a scheme which from the very start rules out from participation those involved in community or voluntary work.</P>
      <P>There is a record of community conflict in the USA and there are people working voluntarily there who have established knowledge and expertise in this area.  We should open the fund to a wider range of participants, as Deputy De Rossa suggested, because of the nature of the subject matter.  We will be looking at community conflict, which does not tend to occur between university professors but at the heart of working class society.  The fund should be open to the participation of such communities.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could consider an amendment on Report Stage, which I know is following this Stage immediately.  We should not be looking at community conflict as a phenomenon to be studied by so-called &ldquo;experts&rdquo;, but as a subject in which those with first-hand experience could be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister not to reject the amendments out of hand but to come back to them on Report Stage.  I do not have the statistics to hand but I am reasonably sure that the access of young people from working class areas to third level education tends to be through institutes of technology.  I am not saying that is <Col N="1206" /> exclusively the case but the figures indicate it is predominantly so.</P>
      <P>It is a shame that such colleges should be excluded from this scholarship fund.  It is an issue which should be looked at seriously.  There can be no argument that the level of research or academic achievement in such institutes is less than that in traditional universities.  In fact, their application may be more practical in everyday life.  It is worth having a new look at how restrictive the current proposal is and considering the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the scheme is kept tight to a certain degree as it relates to American students coming to Ireland.  We are contributing £2 million, which cannot be spread everywhere to cover everybody involved in conflict resolution, such as community and voluntary groups.  That is not realistic and it would dilute the impact of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The university sector has been involved with the US-Ireland Alliance which led to the initial suggestion of the idea.  I have no principled objection to including the institutes of technology or the Irish School of Ecumenics as hosts for potential scholars.  We are not talking about people going to the US under this scholarship fund but rather about American students coming to Ireland to experience higher education, whether in universities, the institutes of technology or the Irish School of Ecumenics, which will be linking with Trinity College and already offers some post-graduate programmes on peace and reconciliation and conflict resolution.</P>
      <P>The level of post-graduate research in many institutes is not high.  However, that does not matter. Even if one student wishes to pursue a particular specialty which is only offered in an institute in this country, that should be facilitated. I accept the two amendments, without alteration.</P>
      <P>When President Clinton and Secretary Reilly came to Ireland, this was not the only initiative we decided to take jointly.  On Deputy Bruton's point, Secretary Reilly and I announced Project Citizen whereby the US will contribute up to $1 million over three years and we will provide matching funds to develop projects between children North and South.  They will come together and work on a civics project which might relate to local politics or issues pertaining to a given area.  That will get to the heart of the community conflict and the generation issue.  The young children of today must be freed of the myths and prejudices of the past.  The best way we can do that is through education.</P>
      <P>I am also working with Co-operation Ireland on significantly enhanced funding for their programmes of exchange between North and South. Recently, following British Secretary Blunkett's visit, we agreed additional funding for youth exchanges East-West and North-South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much happening in other programmes in conflict resolution, community relations and, above all, in greater familiarisation between <Col N="1207" /> young people on both sides of the island.  We can encourage that by facilitating their coming together more often.  Project Citizen is about encouraging contact in a more structured way than school exchanges, which involve students visiting each other.  There is a project at the heart of it.  Co-operation Ireland will be the implementing body for Project Citizen.  We have already had talks with Co-operation Ireland on that.  That, to a certain extent, takes care of those issues.</P>
    <P>Some of our universities had developed programmes on conflict resolution.  University College Galway recently launched a human rights centre.  There is no reason that an American student who is particularly interested in human rights, the bill of rights or that area could not come to visit Ireland or UCG to undertake some research study on human rights.  Likewise other universities, for instance, University College Cork, have developed programmes on youth and voluntary work.  There are now degree programmes on offer for people who want to become qualified in youth work.  The scheme does not exclude American citizens coming over here who wish to pursue some post-graduate study in the area of community and youth affairs, for example.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling Bill and a framework Bill. The Minister will work with the agreement of the parties in the US in terms of defining the broad parameters for the areas on which students can come to study.  The Houses of the Oireachtas will review the scheme on an annual basis.  A report will be compiled every year which must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that the Deputies can see how the scheme is working and what is happening within the ambit of the scheme.  It has potential to evolve and change, and we can come back to the House and amendment the Bill in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's acceptance of these amendments.  It is a forward looking decision to include the institutes and the Irish School of Ecumenics.  Obviously it will be a matter for the American students to opt for the choices which best suit their inclinations.  The Minister is to be congratulated for accepting the broadening of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall make regulations setting out the objectives of research to be supported by the Fund, the areas of study open for consideration, the priorities or criteria to be considered in selecting applications and such other matters as he or she considers appropriate, and shall lay those regulations before the Oireachtas for approval.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister will provide some guidance as to what sort of research and study should be undertaken.  The issue revolves around whether it should be a group which the Minister says he will appoint as he considers appropriate to manage and control the fund, or whether it should be the Minister who sets out certain &ldquo;objectives of research to be supported by the Fund, the areas of study open for consideration, the priorities or criteria to be considered in selecting applications and such other matters as he considers appropriate, and shall lay those regulations before the Oireachtas for approval.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We should decide here for what we intend this fund to be used.  By all means, we should hear the views, particularly of former Senator George Mitchell or the US Secretary of State, as to how they would like to see this develop.  However, we should not delegate this to some committee yet to be appointed, whose job is mainly to manage and control the fund not decide on the objectives.</P>
      <P>The objectives of this fund should be related to the sort of causes which Mr. Mitchell has advocated over his years of service.  They should reflect something of his bequest to us, both his passionate advocacy of reform in social and health areas, environmental areas and, most importantly, in the reconciliation of groups which are divided.  The latter relates not only to Northern Ireland as he worked in Yugoslavia before that.  He has a proud record in this area.  We should tailor make the sort of work to be a fitting memorial to what he has done over his career and what he continues to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I feel the need for this approach, where the Minister would set out some objectives in regulations as to the way we would move forward with this and the sort of criteria to be considered in selecting applicants so that there is some way in which the Minister rather than some fund managers in the US sets the tone.  This is a gesture by the Irish State to commemorate the contribution of Mr. Mitchell.  It seems to me more fitting that the Minister would devise this sort of formulation when he has had the consultations which undoubtedly will be necessary and then come back to the Oireachtas with his proposals. <Col N="1209" /> That would be a better way to proceed than the Minister's suggestion that these decisions will be made by a fund and then some time at the end of the following year an audited account and copy of the auditor's report will be laid before the House.  That is not a satisfactory approach to adopt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a two-way process from the beginning.  It has not been one side unilaterally dictating to the other.  I pay tribute to the US-Ireland Alliance which did much of the running early on in terms of the concept and the idea.  It is in the overall context of Irish-US relations.  Aside from the legal aspects of it, with which I will deal later, I would be reluctant to unilaterally impose regulations on the fund.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty consulting with Mr. Mitchell in terms of the broad objectives of the fund. We should not ring-fence it too much.  Mr. Mitchell probably would not want to ring-fence the areas of study and research which may be undertaken.</P>
      <P>Having accepted the previous amendments, we have identified the sectors.  These give a broad range for any American student who wishes to study or engage in research in any area.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's office has advised that regulations have no legal effect outside of the State whereas matters covered by an agreement would be legally binding on all signatories. Section 2(3) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall make, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, an agreement, with such person or persons, as the Minister considers appropriate, in respect of the management and control of the Fund, and such agreement shall provide, as may be appropriate, for all of the following:&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There follows a list from (a) to (f) and we will include, with my amendment No. 6, &ldquo;areas of study and research for which scholarships may be awarded under the Fund,&rdquo;.  That gives us a facility to work out the areas, if we so wish.  It is my intention that the areas should be as broad as possible.  That is the better way to proceed.  This concept came from a partnership approach and was jointly announced when Secretary Riley came here with President Clinton.  It would be wrong at this stage for one side to say it is going to put a provision in legislation whether the other side likes it or not.</P>

      <P>I see the validity in the argument the Minister made.  Clearly, we are talking about an agreement between two states. Therefore, we must have regard to its law and practice in the education area and, of course, it must also have regard to ours.  I still have a problem in that, as it stands, the organisers or managers of the fund are not accountable to this House.  They will dispense taxpayers money.  Will the Minister be answerable to this House on how that fund is managed and will he ensure it is run <Col N="1210" /> to the best standards?  The last thing we want is a fund established to honour a person who has made an enormous contribution to Irish society to become a matter of scandal.</P>

Section 5(1) states: &ldquo;The Minister shall annually prepare a report with respect to the operation of the Fund during the previous 12 months and shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo; Section 5(2) states: &ldquo;The Minister shall cause a copy of an abstract of any audited accounts of the Fund together with a copy of any auditor's report thereon to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo; The Minister is <i>per</i> the Act answerable to the House in terms of the conduct, operation and management of the fund.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, American students attend the Irish School of Ecumenics.  I visited there earlier in the year and met a girl from California, to the best of my recollection. There was a group discussion and I asked her what was the most important lesson she had learnt since coming here.  Her answer stayed with me because I learnt from it too.  She said when we apply ourselves to conflict resolution and look at a conflict, we find that the elements of the conflict are within ourselves and that we need to resolve those elements before we are best placed to apply ourselves to the other situation.</P>
      <P>I refer to a point raised by Deputy De Rossa and do so in the context of the discussions which will be held with Senator George Mitchell, who I suspect will have a considerable input into the shape this scholarship will take.  The position of disadvantaged students in the US should be looked at and the scheme should be tailored to ensure representation from disadvantaged groups &mdash; obviously, these will be graduates.  Unless extra provision is made in the fund, there may be people who would not be able to take up a college place to study or carry out research here. Without being prescriptive, the spirit of the fund and George Mitchell would be very receptive to this type of approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the spirit of what Deputy O'Shea said.  It is our intention that bursaries will be quite significant so that a person from the background the Deputy mentioned would be in a position to take up a bursary and that it would be sufficient to meet any of the costs a person would <Col N="1211" /> incur while staying in Ireland.  Senator Mitchell is a classic example of a person who came from a poor background and he acknowledged that when he accepted the freedom of Cork City last week.  He gave a remarkable account of his life and the difficulties he had.  The Senator paid tribute to the meritocracy ethos which we, on this side of the Atlantic, do not often acknowledge and which is strong in America.  He said American society was particularly open in facilitating him in his life's journey from a humble socio-economic background to the heights of the American political establishment.  He made that point very tellingly in speeches both at City Hall in Cork and at UCC.  The bursaries will be significant, will not be grant-in-aid whereby somebody must pick up the tab after that and will enable a student to come here without penny pinching.</P>

      <P>I am relatively happy with the Minister's explanation.  It is important that he remains answerable to the House and that George Mitchell has a role in shaping the type of work done because he is a man who, throughout his career, has proven to have distinctive priorities and principles to which he clings.  It is appropriate that they should inform the selection process and I hope the Minister will assure the House that George Mitchell's views will be very much at the heart of this process.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Facilities for the Disabled: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Theresa Ahearn on Tuesday, 1 December 1998:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P>(a) noting that Thursday, 3 December is European Day of Disabilities;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> (b) conscious of the fact that an estimated 140,000 people with physical and sensory disability have yet to achieve full social, economic and educational integration as equal, independent and participative members within the general community;</P>
    <P>(c) aware from Govemment-commissioned reports that this sector has been historically underfunded;</P>
    <P>(d) believing that there is an urgent need to address the legitimate demands of people with physical and sensory disability for a range of appropriate services, in particular day resource centres, aids and appliances and personal assistance services;</P>
    <P>(e) conscious that the Government and Dáil Éireann have welcomed the publication of a number of critical reports in this area, notably Towards an Independent Future and the Strategy for Equality, which between them contain several hundred recommendations about the rights of people with disabilities;</P>
    <P>(f) aware that the programme for Government and Partnership 2000 both accord significant priority to the needs and rights of people with a disability;</P>
    <P>(g) conscious that people with disabilities, their families, their carers and their advocates are concerned that these commitments will not be honoured in full;</P>
    <P>(h) believing that the current strong state of the Exchequer finances provides a unique and unanswerable opportunity to advance this programme;</P>
    <P>calls on the Government to provide additional capital and revenue funding to meet the target for implementation of the five year programme set out in the report, Towards an Independent Future, and in particular to provide £21.1 million in revenue funding in this year's budget; a commitment for the annual revenue funding and the essential capital funding to ensure full implementation of all recommendations in both major reports mentioned and to provide the essential allowances, resources and supports for carers.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognises the need for the further development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities and approves both the Government's commitment to put in place an enhanced level of service provision in line with the commitments outlined in the programme for Government and Partnership 2000 and the actions taken by the Government to date in meeting these commitments which include <Col N="1213" /> the provision of additional funding of £22.4 million.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Health and Children).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion before the House.  It is appalling that people with physical disabilities face hardship in their daily lives at a time when the Minister for Finance's coffers are bulging.  I hope we will see a positive response to our motion today.  It is not acceptable that people with physical disabilities are inhibited in obtaining work, travelling and in getting on with their daily lives.  There should be services to enable people with physical or sensory disabilities to live as independently as possible in the community. There was a successful personal assistant scheme in operation in Limerick.  I pay tribute to the Centre for Independent Living in Newcastlewest for the work it has done in that area. However, I do not accept it should be provided on the basis of a FÁS scheme.  A personal assistant can give people with physical disabilities the opportunity to have a quality of life almost comparable to that of people without a disability. Excellent people are employed on these FÁS schemes and they get great satisfaction from their work as personal assistants.  Many of them build up a relationship with the physically handicapped, which is of enormous benefit to them.</P>
      <P>We should congratulate the Irish Wheelchair Association for the work it is doing.  It has shown that 2,667 people do not benefit from day centre activities and that 1,248 are physically isolated from society. That is not acceptable in this day and age.  Some 1,150 people require aids and appliances and 1,375 require personal assistance with basic needs such as dressing and feeding.</P>
      <P>Last night Deputy Theresa Ahearn said the Minister for Public Enterprise gave Bus Átha Cliath money to extend its fleet.  However, despite the Government's stated commitment to improve facilities for the disabled, she did not ensure that the buses would be wheelchair friendly.  When taxi licences were given out, the Department insisted they should be wheelchair friendly.  It is amazing the same criteria does not apply in the public sector.</P>
      <P>Cystic fibrosis was not mentioned during the debate, although it is the most commonly inherited genetic disease in Ireland.  It occurs when a child inherits one defective gene from each parent.  I want to specifically deal with domiciliary physiotherapy, which is where a physiotherapist visits the house of a person with cystic fibrosis to administer physiotherapy.  This is important because it helps a person with cystic fibrosis to remain in reasonable health and to fight off infections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland, not the health boards, provides this service.  An integrated service, which includes physiotherapy, should be provided by the health boards to ensure equity, accountability and quality.  This <Col N="1214" /> service is not adequately supported by the health boards, with the exception of the Mid-Western Health Board which is drawing up proposals to ensure an integrated approach to physiotherapy management.  This is important in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.  The service is especially needed when a person is ill or requires assistance.  People with cystic fibrosis learn new techniques during these physiotherapy sessions.  It is essential, therefore, that health board services are made more accessible to people with cystic fibrosis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This is a timely motion because in a few hours the budget will be announced by the Minister for Finance.  The Central Remedial Clinic has submitted a request for an extra subvention of up to £5.9 million and a capital injection of £4.6 million.  The last Government provided £3.5 million for the physically handicapped.  Last year the Minister for Finance said that funding of up to £22.4 million had been provided to date under the commitments outlined in the programme for Government and Partnership 2000.  There was much publicity last year about the £20 million provided to the GAA over three years, but the Minister provided £22.4 million in one year for the physically handicapped.</P>
      <P>I refer to the campaign to secure basic services for 4,000 wheelchair users in the area of aids and appliances, resource centre places and personal assistant services.  I welcome the Minister's announcement of a £4 million once-off revenue grant for the provision of aids and appliances and other equipment.</P>
      <P>Two reports, Towards an Independent Future and Strategy for Equality, which were published in 1996, stated that the physical disability sector was way behind in terms of State support.  There are huge needs in the mentally handicapped sector, yet the physically handicapped sector received less State support.</P>
      <P>There is also a lack of facilities in primary schools.  There is an emphasis at present on an integrated education system.  There should be classroom assistants for children with physical handicaps.  Community employment schemes, in conjunction with FÁS, provide classroom assistants on a temporary basis.  Provision of computer equipment is also important for young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These issues apply not only to the Department of Health and Children but also to other Departments. I recently met representatives from the centres for independent living in Mayo, Galway and Roscommon.  They showed me a submission which they made to five Departments, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department <Col N="1215" /> of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The centres for independent living in these counties have struggled to maintain a reasonable service for the disabled over the past five years through FÁS schemes.  Some funding was provided by the Western Health Board, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>People who are helped by a personal assistant have referred to the fact that they are no longer prisoners at home.  They would have to live in a hospital if they did not have such help.  Many disabled people have been able to take up work and start making their own living through the help of personal assistants.</P>
    <P>Day resource centres are important because they provide activities and training and development for a few hours several days per week.  It can be regarded as a form of respite for the person with a disability and his or her carer.  The Irish Wheelchair Association, which has 60 branches nationwide, provides a substantial portion of this service and I commend it for its work. I know that £660,000 was provided this year for respite day care services, but there is a need for increased service provision in the area.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government spells out clearly the fact that disability is among the most important social issues facing Ireland.  For years we have paid lip service to assisting the estimated 140,000 people with physical and sensory disabilities to integrate and become fully functioning members of society.</P>
    <P>The announcement in July that the national disability authority is to be set up on a statutory footing is significant and legislation to establish the NDA is due before the Oireachtas soon.  That authority will be responsible for the research and development of standards for services and programmes for those with disabilities.  It will have a key role in providing expert back-up and support to the Minister in the development of policy on disability issues.  I welcome the work done in this area by the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking to this motion I am conscious that there is much common ground between all Members.  We have all been touched by the plight of those with disabilities.  Many people have had to live with disability within their own family circle and we are conscious that this is an appropriate time to debate their cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue has been highlighted by the nomination of Thursday, 3 December as European Day of Disabled People and it is right and proper that we pay tribute to the cause of the disabled today and on that special day.  It is also important to remember that when 3 December has come and gone, the disabled and their families and friends will still have to live with the harsh reality of physical and sensory limitations for the rest of <Col N="1216" /> their lives, and that, for them, every day will be the day of the disabled.</P>
    <P>We must continue to work and invest Government funding in a positive fashion to make the lives of the disabled meaningful and worthwhile. This is their entitlement and we must continue to promote their cause and meet the legitimate demands for the alleviation of their condition. We must provide the framework to ensure that, as far as possible, their needs are met in the areas of aids and appliances, personal assistance, day resource centres, respite and rehabilitation services, home support, transport services, funds for voluntary support agencies and additional occupational and speech and language therapists and physiotherapists.</P>
    <P>The Government has honoured its pledge to invest in these areas.  It has substantially increased the sums devoted to improving the lot of the disabled allocated by previous Governments and spent heavily on personal and social services. Government policy is in line with the thinking of the review group on health and social services for those with disabilities.  The title of that group's report, Towards an Independent Future, is in line with the thinking of the Minister.  His intention is to help those with disabilities to have as full and independent a lifestyle as can be afforded with the help of the Government.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the Government are committed to enhancing the lives and opportunities of the disabled.  We are determined to help them achieve independent living and community integration. This is in line with the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which identified the lack of a job income as the major cause of poverty among the disabled.  In meeting the challenge of equality, the then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on disability and carers, Deputy Mary Wallace, emphasised the importance of an overall approach to this issue.  She stated that when in Government, Fianna Fáil should prioritise certain issues concerning the disabled. These issues included: individual empowerment &mdash; each person must be given the opportunity to achieve full potential in the area of their choice; inclusion and transparency &mdash; all public agencies must develop a culture of openness and inclusive provision of support; where possible special support should be delivered through public agencies; valuing differences &mdash; we must accept and ensure that the need for support does not undermine an individual's selfworth and a person's right to equality.  Deputy Wallace also stressed that we must continue to monitor all legislative initiatives to eliminate bias against the disabled.  I commend the Deputy for her work as Minister of State.</P>
    <P>A vital support area for the disabled is provided by the voluntary sector.  We cannot ignore the massive and positive contribution given by these groups.  Over many years they have been active and generous with their time and money on behalf of those who need their help.  These groups have been under-funded for years owing <Col N="1217" /> to a fall-off in voluntary contributions and underfunding by the State.  This Government has addressed this matter and provided substantial sums to eliminate the accumulated debts of these excellent agencies.  We are anxious to get the maximum benefit from the time and dedication of these voluntary organisations.  To ensure that this is achieved, we must put them on a firm financial footing.  A total of £22.4 million has been provided by the Government which compares favourable with investments by the previous Government.  I am not saying this to score a point but these are the facts.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the Government's commitment to improving the lot of those with physical and sensory disabilities.  In the past there has been a chronic shortage of aids and appliances such as wheelchairs, artificial limbs, splints, hoists and so on.  This has caused the problem of long waiting lists for health board services.  This problem has been addressed by the injection of substantial additional funding and a once-off grant of £4 million.</P>
    <P>Day care centres for the disabled are vital for the provision of activities, training and development. In this regard I pay particular tribute to the work of the Irish Wheelchair Association which has a wide network of centres.  This association must be commended and recognised for the vital part it plays in the provision of services for the disabled.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the national disability authority on a statutory basis is a milestone in the fight for the recognition of the rights of the disabled. Legislation is pending to formally establish the NDA which will advise the Minister on policy development.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, on their outstanding performance in this area.  I support the Minister is his approach to this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Wallace on her contribution to this debate on the disabled and the focus she has placed on these issues since taking office.  I wish to concentrate on two practical issues.</P>
      <P>The disabled person's grant scheme has been of great assistance to a large number of people. However, the scale of the scheme is totally inadequate. The maximum grant available for a disabled person's house extension is £8,000. However, the average cost of such an extension in the Dublin Corporation area is about £25,000 &mdash; more than I paid for my house 20 years ago. Tenant purchasers, who are often on meagre incomes, find it impossible to provide a suitable extension for those in their care.  There is a huge shortfall to be bridged between £8,000 and £25,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent this morning trying to convince the Eastern Health Board to provide additional funding to help a 96 year old woman to be housed in modest accommodation in her daughter's house. However, I am afraid that they will still have to <Col N="1218" /> borrow from a bank or credit union and this is inadequate.</P>
    <P>The disabled person's grant scheme should be one of the areas addressed in any reworking of schemes which the Minister may be considering. A grant of about £12,000 would be just about adequate to help such people.  For example, someone suffering from multiple sclerosis in the Dublin area can get a grant of £1,000 from the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland and £8,000 from Dublin Corporation.  However, they will have to borrow the rest of the money.  The vast majority of people experience great hardship in order to bridge this gap.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the waiting time for wheelchairs. In the Dublin area there is an unacceptably long waiting period for appliances.  Even something as simple as a walking aid or a crutch seems to involve an enormous amount of red tape in the health board.  I do not know whether the problem is a lack of physiotherapists or qualified assessment personnel but there is a problem which needs to be confronted.</P>
    <P>Last week, I welcomed the introduction of low floor buses, of which there is now a number in the Dublin area.  It is essential that a large number of the new buses which are to be provided for Dublin have low floors and are accessible to wheelchair users.  Despite pressure not to do so, members of Dublin Corporation made the right decision to insist that all new taxis be wheelchair accessible.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State for her focused work and I look forward to working with her in highlighting issues relating to this matter.</P>

      <P>No matter how much money is spent on services for people with physical and sensory disabilities it will not be enough because of the extensive nature of the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues have been brought to my attention by my constituents and I know they affect people with disabilities throughout the country.  A pilot project providing personal assistants for people with disabilities has been operating very successfully in County Mayo for the past two and a half years.  Personal assistants have been appointed for 12 people with disabilities who have been able to get employment.  The scheme has enabled these people to contribute to society and has restored their self esteem.  The personal assistants are participants in FÁS schemes, but in April of next year most will have completed three years on FÁS schemes and will not be eligible for re-appointment.  Unless adequate funding is put in place the personal assistance scheme will come to an end and the 12 participants will suffer a change in lifestyle.  This is unacceptable.  I know the Minister of State met representatives of the Centre for Independent Living in September 1997 and said it was her objective gradually, as funds permitted, to increase the number of people receiving a personal assistance service until the target of 375 people was reached.  This figure was mentioned <Col N="1219" /> by the Centre for Independent Living as the number requiring the service nationwide.  It is important for the self esteem of the people concerned that this service is provided on a permanent basis.  Anything less is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country, 60 wheelchair centres provide a valuable social service for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  The resources provided for these centres are inadequate and a number of centres need to be improved in many ways.  For example, the centre in Belmullet, which serves between 30 and 40 people, is inadequate for their needs.  It is important that voluntary organisations and individual volunteers are given adequate resources to help improve the quality of life of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement that the National Disability Authority is to be placed on a statutory footing.  The NDA is responsible for research and the development of standards for services and programmes provided to people with disabilities. I welcome the fact that legislation to enable the authority to be established will come before the Dáil in the near future.</P>
    <P>An employment quota of 3 per cent for people with disabilities is enshrined in Partnership 2000. I welcome the establishment of a monitoring committee to ensure this quota is adhered to.  For many years we have heard much debate on gender issues.  We recognise the importance of enabling women to find their rightful place in society and of awarding women equal employment opportunities.  People with disabilities are entitiled to the same recognition.  It would be a very sad reflection on our society if we could not adhere to even a 3 per cent employment quota.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Health and Children of the £4 million which is to be spent on aids and appliances for people with disabilities.  This money is badly needed. However, the issue on which I focus is the need for a personal assistant to be appointed on a permanent basis to every person who needs one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on her achievements both as Minister of State and as Opposition spokesperson on equality matters when she carried out extensive consultations with people with disabilities and with those who provide services for them.  Her commitment to these issues was apparent then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large number of people with physical and sensory disabilities receive no services because they are not known to the providers of services. A number do not need any service or wish to avail of it.  The needs of these groups are wide and varied.  I am aware in my locality of people who provide an excellent level of service to various groups, including St. Joseph's School for Blind Boys in Drumcondra, the Irish Wheelchair Association in Blackheath Drive, Clontarf and the Central Remedial Clinic and the Centre for Independent Living in Vernon Avenue, Clontarf. <Col N="1220" /> I congratulate those who are involved in delivering services to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the review group and the health board co-ordinating committees are working to identify needs in this area.  I am happy to note that the review group has recommended that existing services be placed on a firm financial footing to provide a firm basis for future development. Groups which provide these services cannot do so on a loss-making basis, constantly unsure of their ability to continue.</P>
    <P>I have been actively involved in the Centre for Independent Living in my constituency and I have seen the benefits derived from it.  Similar benefits are being gained from the personal assistance service.  I have visited the Irish Wheelchair Association and I am aware of the personal assistance scheme being operated by that association. I acknowledge the need to develop this service and to give those who require it the facility of independent living.  I am pleased, the Eastern Health Board is active in this issue.  Regarding the problem with FÁS schemes referred to by the last speaker, where the three years for which personal assistants have been employed are coming to an end, thus causing serious difficulties, I urge the other seven health boards to follow the example of the Eastern Health Board to ensure the personal assistant service is provided.</P>
    <P>On the regulations governing tax concessions for disabled drivers and passengers I do not blame any specific Minister but the red tape in this area is crazy.  If people with a physical or sensory disability want to live independently, surely as a step along this road they should be encouraged to avail of a motorised vehicle, if they can. People follow the normal application process for the tax concession, but it is complicated by one item being missing from the first schedule of the medical certificate required to grant people the concession.  The onus to put it right is on the Department of Finance or on the Revenue Commissioners. Perhaps the Minister might pursue that issue.  It is a simple matter which can be easily addressed and would offer greater opportunities for many people.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic and pragmatic in enhancing the disabled person's grant scheme.  There is tremendous scope for addressing the headache of the waiting list for aids and appliances.  I do not understand why it is necessary for occupational therapists to conduct an inspection of people's houses as part of the application process.  It can be argued that people's homes vary and it is necessary to know what they are like in advance but surely there are certain aids the need for which can be clearly identified and for which there does not need to be a waiting list.  There is a huge potential in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to the debate.  Major advances have been made over the years in the manner in which society treats people with disabilities so that it is now ensured they are not discriminated <Col N="1221" /> against.  For too long they were ignored by society, so we have come a long way.  There is an estimated 140,000 people with physical or sensory disabilities and I commend the steps taken by the Minister of State in integrating them into society. A revamped Employment Equality Bill became law last June and is a major milestone in the protection of the rights of people with disabilities among others.  It has underpinned their access to and advances in employment and outlawed discrimination on the grounds of disability.</P>
      <P>Among the commitments fulfilled by the Minister of State since coming into office is that all disability payments are now above the rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. This gives a positive signal to all concerned that we are serious about the underprivileged. Another commitment delivered on is the six pilot projects which have been funded in line with the commission's report, four in the information area and two relating to cross sectoral planning for the delivery of services to the disabled, such as transport. Some £160,000 has been allocated to four of these projects while two have received £45,000 each.  It is the hope of the Minister of State and the Government that these pilot projects will develop a model of good practice in the community which will be repeated in other areas of the country.</P>

      <P>It is important in the budget today that the points made in this debate and generally by representatives of all sides of the House are taken on board by the Minister for Finance and other Ministers with direct responsibility for people with disabilities, be they physical, sensory or intellectual.  In a number of debates in the House in recent weeks, strong points have been made, not only by Opposition Members but by Deputies on the Government side.  I recall one point made that, if someone was a cow, a criminal or held a hurley in his left hand, he would receive more money than certain children with disabilities. That point was strongly made and we on this side of the House support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important in this time of plenty that the shortfall in funding for people with disabilities is addressed in an adequate way which addresses the unmet needs in society.  The Minister for Finance has a surplus in the current year of £1.4 billion and indicators suggest that will continue and may even improve.  This is obviously the result of good management by various Governments over several years.  However, this debate is wider than political points scoring and it does an injustice to the issue if it falls to that level.  It must focus on how people with disabilities can be afforded their rights as citizens.  The figure in the <Col N="1222" /> motion of £21.1 million is 0.15 per cent of the surplus in the budget for this year.  It is a tiny drop in the ocean of the large amount of money available to the Minister for Finance in today's budget.  I cannot emphasise enough the point that the unmet needs of people in society who are not doing well must be met from the relative wealth. Statistics show that people with sensory and physical disabilities are currently doing extremely badly.  Approximately 80 per cent of people with disabilities are unemployed in a time when unemployment figures are falling.  It is crucial when this excess money is available in the budget that we address these issues.</P>
    <P>A number of reports have been compiled in the area of disabilities and Towards an Independent Future is the most important in the context of today's debate.  It indicates a five year spending plan for the unmet needs and basic services of people with physical and sensory disabilities.  As indicated in the figures in the motion, there is a shortfall which needs to be addressed.  It comprises £12 million for the first year.  Some £2 million was allocated in the second which left a shortfall of £3.7 million.  There is also a shortfall in capital as opposed to revenue allocations for the first two years.  An allocation is also required for the third year, 1999.  Adding up those totals, a figure of £21.1 million is obtained.  That is only to keep pace with the aims set out in Towards an Independent Future.  It is crucial that requirement is met in the current year to keep pace with what is planned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement of the Minister for Health and Children yesterday of £4 million for aids and appliances.  However, that does not reach the amount required to meet basic needs. We have the second lowest debt in Europe, yet the Minister intends to use most of the surplus money available to pay off some of our national debt.  Some of that surplus money would be much better spent in meeting the unmet needs of people with physical, sensory or intellectual handicaps.</P>
    <P>In addressing this motion, two other important documents spring to mind, Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, which aims to tackle poverty and disadvantage.  For too long people with physical or sensory disabilities have been disadvantaged.  The lack of aids, appliances and personal assistants has prevented many people with disabilities from seeking employment. For many who have sought employment, disability unfriendly work places have prevented them from securing jobs.  Those who manage to move into the workplace face multiple obstacles from the minute they leave their houses in the morning.  The huge shortage of user friendly transport makes the journey to work a nightmare. The new bus fleet, comprising 150 new buses which will come on stream next year, will not be wheelchair accessible despite it being Fianna Fáil policy that all new buses should be wheelchair accessible.  That does not look promising for <Col N="1223" /> people with physical disabilities who have to try to get to work.</P>
    <P>Approximately 80 per cent of people with physical disabilities are unemployed.  Long-term dependence on social welfare payments means that most of them do not have savings and the cost of any extra activities, such as job seeking and participation in pastimes is a virtual impossibility. The definition of poverty laid out in the national anti-poverty strategy states that people are living in poverty if their income and resource materials, cultural and social, are so inadequate as to preclude them from having a standard of living, which is regarded as acceptable by Irish society generally.  As a result of inadequate income and resources people may be excluded and marginalised from participating in activities which are considered the norm for other people. For people with a physical or sensory disability, the debt of poverty is accentuated by the fact that they are not completely mobile and require assistance to undertake the type of tasks most of us do not even think about.  It has not been acceptable that people with physical or sensory disabilities have had to live in such poverty, but with our budgetary surplus there is an opportunity to address this position.</P>
    <P>The demands by lobby groups representing people with disabilities and the cost of fulfilling them have always been clear, but limitations on the Exchequer sometimes limited spending in the area of services and supports for people with disabilities. This excuse no longer exists.  We are in a position to implement key structural changes in terms of the services and supports available to people with physical or sensory disabilities.  In the spirit of Partnership 2000, investment in services and supports to people with a disability should where possible, ensure their maximum inclusion in society through paid employment.  For those who are unable to participate in employment, social welfare payments and care supports should be well above the cost of living and reflect the type of economy in which we now live.</P>
    <P>The role of personal assistants, in allowing people with physical or sensory disabilities to have a more participative lifestyle cannot be overstated.  Many people with a disability do not have an assistant, but for those who are lucky enough to have one there are also problems. Many assistants operate under the community employment scheme or the part-time job opportunities scheme, which is coming to an end. Under the community employment scheme, a personal assistant works a 19.5 hour week for a year.  As the year draws to a close he or she will have become familiar with the routine and the needs of the person whom he or she assists.  For the person with a disability the loss of a personal assistant can be very difficult.  It may mean the loss of a good relationship based on trust and understanding and such loss can prove to be a considerable setback.  It is essential to focus investment in the provision of personal assistants, <Col N="1224" /> with adequate training before they begin their work and that the value of their work is recognised in the economy through the provision of decent wages.</P>
    <P>Many people cannot avail of a disabled person's grant because they do not have the necessary finance to come up with the percentage of the amount they are required to pay.  I am speaking of those who own their homes or who are involved in a tenant purchase scheme.  It also seems to be the case that people can get only one grant from the local authority despite the fact that their needs may change over the years.  That point also needs to be addressed.  We have the necessary money to address the unmet needs of people with physical or sensory disabilities which have been quantified.  They must be met in this budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  This is the second time the Opposition parties and a number of independents have combined to force the Government to face up to its responsibility to people with a disability. For too long people with a disability have been ignored and marginalised.  Society has erected physical and social barriers that exclude citizens from taking their rightful place in the economic, social and cultural life of the nation. When the Minister for Finance announces the budget in a few hours, he will have in his gift an unprecedented opportunity to make a real and meaningful difference to thousands of families throughout the State.  He will have the opportunity to demonstrate to people with a disability that their rights will be taken seriously and to undo the harm caused by his Government's failure to invest in the five year plan outlined in Towards an Independent Future.  However, it seems likely that the Government will not avail of this opportunity.  During recent days the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Health and Children have not focused on the merits of this motion, nor have they proposed an adequate response.  The Minister has occupied his time by taking an axe to the drug refund scheme, shamefully inflicting severe cutbacks on those citizens who rely on the State to make a contribution towards the cost of their medicines.  In a time of unprecedented economic growth it is immoral that these cutbacks, which amount to a 30 per cent addition in the cost, should be made. Let there be no doubt that the changes to this scheme will obliterate a large part of the increases that many pensioners and others will receive in today's budget.  Yet again the most vulnerable members of society are being told to stand still while the wealthiest in society surge ahead comfortable in the knowledge that they are the people who will receive priority under this Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is also intent on telling people with a disability that they must take their place in the queue.  It seems content to force organisations and advocates of people with a disability to shake buckets in the street and rely on <Col N="1225" /> the charity of passers by to finance basic services. People with disabilities have rights and should not have to depend on charity to have them fulfilled. Neither should people who organise services for people with disabilities have to spend their time organising begging sessions in the street to finance services for people with disabilities. What good is the booming economy if the fruits of our recent success are not directed towards those who need it most?  Can the Government seriously stand over a position where people without basic aids and appliances are told to wait their turn while property speculators enjoy the lavish rewards that come with a halving of their tax liabilities.  Towards an Independent Future outlines a five year plan that would bring services for people with a physical or sensory disability to a basic standard.  It is a disgrace that the Government will cut back on the completion of that plan.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House calls for £21.1 million to be invested this year to ensure that the five year plan remains on course.  That is the bare minimum a Government should do in face of the dire needs of this sector and the historic underfunding that has blighted the lives of people with disabilities.  By refusing to accept this motion the Government is sending a clear message to people with disabilities, that their rights and their status in society will continue to rely on the charity of others and the Government will not pick up the tab.  That is cold comfort in the present situation.  In the face of such obvious wealth and the bulging Government coffers, this is little short of a disgrace.  I call on the Government today to end once and for all the necessity for people with disabilities and their carers to stand on the streets begging passers by for the money that is needed to finance the services they require.</P>

      <P>This afternoon, all will be revealed in the budget.  It has been the most exposed budget in the history of the State.  For the past few months we have heard about it morning, noon and night on television and in the newspapers, but how much in the budget will relate to this motion?  I am sorry to say it will be very little.  The people who have come to visit the House today would not hold up Dublin's traffic with a day of protest that would affect the business life of the city. They have little clout and it is a reflection on our society, with its booming economy, that such people do not have the basic necessities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my county of Longford, we have been waiting <Col N="1226" /> 11 years for a bus to transport disabled people.  The Minister of State should provide funding for such a bus service in County Longford. In rural areas where no suitable public transport is available, it is vital to provide transport for the disabled.  Many people, including parents, other family members and volunteers, devote their time and energy to help the disabled. This afternoon, the Minister for Finance should be in a position to provide the necessary funding.</P>
    <P>Of 20 applicants for wheelchairs in County Longford only two have been supplied, leaving 18 on the waiting list.  That is hard to believe when we hear about the booming economy.  The Minister of State has had a good record in office so far and I have every hope that the necessary funding will be put in place for the facilities these people are requesting.  I welcome those from my county who are in the Gallery.  They are only seeking the basic necessities.  If not now, when will they be looked after?</P>
    <P>In certain cases, the money required over and above the disabled person's grant cannot be found by the person concerned.  The disabled do not have the same scope as others to earn money. When the State can provide only two thirds of funding by way of a grant, where is the other third supposed to come from?  A disabled person cannot go out to earn money.  One hundred per cent grants should be available for disabled persons and I totally support those who have already called for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcomed the Minister for Health and Children's words yesterday when he seemed to accept the principle embodied in this motion, namely, that everybody with a physical or sensory disability is entitled to a range of appropriate services to allow them to integrate and participate as fulfilled members of society.  It would be churlish not to welcome the Minister's announcement which marks a beginning towards implementing the recommendations of the Barrington Report.  Even though this is no more than what is due and promised, it will be welcomed by all those to whom it will be of benefit. It offers them the beginning of a better quality of life in future.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity, however, that it has taken an Opposition motion on the eve of the budget to elicit a response on this issue in a country that has the highest growth rate in the world and which has a £1 billion surplus to set aside against accumulated debt.  No matter how well off we are, Governments always have to make choices between competing demands.  The Minister is well aware that budgetary priorities must be established, particularly when expensive medical technology can lead to one hospital eating up an entire health budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to providing ordinary facilities for the disabled, which will allow them to live with some dignity and guarantee them some access to a quality of life the rest of us take for granted, we have no choice.  They must have first <Col N="1227" /> call on all our expenditure, both in good times and in bad.  The right to full participation as citizens must and should transcend the economic cycle.</P>
    <P>Providing resources which allow full participation is not a matter of choice for a civilised society, it is a prerequisite.  In that context, I also welcome the Minister's announcement of the development of a database which will facilitate the planning of those services into the future.  The Minister should ensure on behalf of all of us that the funding announced yesterday is only the beginning &mdash; the first tranche of a planned and consistent programme to ensure the full implementation of all the Barrington Report's recommendations within a reasonable timescale.  The Minister also mentioned that full citizenship for the disabled is not just a health issue.  It must transcend all Departments and must be integrated into the policies, services and spending of every Department.</P>
    <P>Last week we discovered that buses purchased as a result of the State's biggest investment in public transport are not accessible to the disabled. It is a disgrace.  This was a major opportunity for the Minister of State to put her money where her mouth is.  The fact that the buses are not accessible to the disabled reflects a mind-set that does not consider access for everybody to be a priority. I bitterly regret it and I cannot express how much this matter has upset disabled people.  Mobility is the key issue for them because it guarantees access to education, work and a social life &mdash; all things the rest of us take for granted.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the fact that we are fortunate to have a culture of concern for the welfare of all our fellow citizens.  It is not, however, up to voluntary bodies to provide for the disabled.  For that, we look to Government. Concern and pity are not enough.  Thousands of families that include physically or mentally disabled members are looking with hope to the budget today.  I ask the Minister not to let them down again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the visitors in the Public Gallery.  This House is not the easiest place for those with a handicap or disability to gain access to.</P>
      <P>The review group highlighted quite a number of deficiencies as far as the disabled are concerned. I want to dwell on three points: first, the shortfall in services relating to therapy, day care, counselling and home support; second, the uneven geographical distribution of services; and, third, the inadequate co-ordination of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency, there is no home help service available at night for a 15 year old with muscular dystrophy.  The parents have to deal with this situation 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 52 weeks a year.  When I made representations to get them one night's home help to give them some degree of relief, the answer I received on their behalf <Col N="1228" /> was, &ldquo;Unfortunately at this time I am not in a position to offer you home help for the night time.&rdquo; Where is the Celtic tiger from the point of view of that family?  They have a right to an occasional night out or some relief from looking after a child who otherwise would cost the State an enormous amount of money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement last night of an increase in the allocation for aids and appliances.  In the case to which I referred, the health board did make facilities available but, unfortunately, only under pressure.  In another case, the sister of a 39 year old woman who has a serious illness and little home support, agreed, with the full support of her husband and family, to take her in.  She has been refused the carer's allowance although her husband is just a postman. Is this a situation where the Celtic tiger is even-handed?</P>
    <P>Money is needed not only to provide centres, but also to provide proper services at these centres in the long-term.  If these centres were not available, the people who use them would have to be looked after full-time by the State.</P>
    <P>In the context of geographical location, I have a neighbour, a ten year old child with cerebral palsy who, if he were living in the Dublin region, would have free access to many resources. However, living in Monaghan, it has been very difficult.  If a local group had not raised more than £50,000 to get him the care he needs, this child would not be in a wheelchair today but back in bed.</P>
    <P>We need to do more than talk about the millions of pounds being provided, we need to ensure it is targeted, to realise that the human beings about whom we speak have a right to the service and that the money is not all spent on administration but gets to the people who need it.  I know of a nine month old child with cerebral palsy who was fitted for shoes and other aids in September.  Given the allocation announced by the Minister, he may get what he needs before Christmas.  Otherwise he would not get them until after next year's budget, yet to reassess that child would probably cost as much as the items he needs if he had got them in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion today.  The rich have gained from the last two budgets.  It is the turn now of the people who need to be looked after, the people with disabilities.  In my constituency, Michael Corbett has done wonderful work through FÁS schemes.  However, given what the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Harney, is doing with the FÁS schemes, we cannot depend any longer on them.  We want money and personal assistants for people with disabilities.  People who come to my clinic have experienced a new quality of life since they got personal assistants.  They are independent and some have returned to the workforce. They are not depending on being put into homes to be looked after by the State.  They are out <Col N="1229" /> there doing their own thing and living in their own homes.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, is a good Minister, and she is doing her best.  She should do what Deputy Healy-Rae and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell did and tell the Government she will not take it any longer, that she wants money for those people in the Gallery today, that she wants them looked after.  If we cannot look after these people, who can we look after?  I am sick and tired of seeing the rich looked after all the time, of the tax breaks for people with five or six houses that Deputy Stagg spoke about earlier.  The people will support the Minister of State if she takes a stand on this and tells the Government she wants these people looked after once and for all.</P>
      <P>We are being told by Government every day about the amount of money it takes in taxes and the amount of money it has to spend.  Listening to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, over the past few months, one would think the Government would not be able to spend all the money it has.  I am telling the Government where to spend a few pounds.  It should put a few pounds into the activities of people like Michael Corbett and Séamus Thompson who are looking after people in wheelchairs.  The day should be gone when these people have to sit outside churches on a Sunday morning collecting a few pounds.  We have money in the State now and it is these people, not the rich, who should be looked after, because the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and join others in welcoming the many interested people who have come to the public Gallery to listen to this important debate. There is no doubt that people with physical and sensory disabilities have an entitlement to the rights and privileges which go with citizenship, and any barriers to that enjoyment should be removed.  Slowly but surely we are making progress in this area.</P>
      <P>The document An Action Programme for the Millennium commits the Government to ensuring that the needs of people with disabilities, their families and carers are comprehensively addressed through a wide range of measures in the health, social, leisure and sporting areas.  We are committed to a customer-focused health and social care policy.  Key health care areas are being targeted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures speak for themselves.  Some speakers on the opposite side of the House have been very fair in this debate.  Others have been extraordinarily unfair.  The document Towards an Independent Future was published in December 1996.  The Government at the time, most of whose Members have signed the motion before us, provided £3.5 million in its first budget in January 1997.  In the past 18 months £22.4 million has been provided by this Government.  Those speakers <Col N="1230" /> who have been unfair in their comments should compare what their Government provided with what this Government has provided.  The £22.4 million that has been provided to date does not include what will be announced in the budget. Nor does it include the Estimate figures for 1999. We are talking strictly about 1997 and 1998.</P>
    <P>Many people made poignant remarks about aids and appliances.  There is no doubt it is appalling to think that people cannot get basic aids such as wheelchairs, walking aids or crutches. This time last year we provided £4.3 million.  One million pounds was provided during the year, and an extra £4 million was provided yesterday.  That is a total of £9.3 million for aids and appliances. I hope people with disabilities, whether they live in Longford, Cavan, Meath or wherever, will at last be able to get basic aids and appliances.  The announcement made last night was welcomed by most independent observers.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the £22.4 million is over six times the amount provided by the previous Government in 1997.  That is just up to 12 noon today.  Any independent commentator would say the figures speak for themselves and are an indication of the commitment that is there.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, spoke last night about the detail in terms of delivery of services in the physical and sensory sector.  Let me summarise the position.  We are implementing the report Towards an Independent Future.  We are also putting in place exciting co-ordinating developments in this sector.  In the past it was quite an unco-ordinated sector, as most people in the sector would recognise.  The co-ordinating committees at health board level were put in place during this year for the first time.  They have had some success but greater partnership is necessary.  The concept behind the co-ordinating committees is a partnership approach between the health boards, the service providers and the people with disabilities in each health board region.  When the Minister allocates money, therefore, he does not determine the priorities for those areas.  They are determined in the eight co-ordinating areas and people with disabilities are involved in that decision making. Both the Minister and I stress the importance of that partnership at local level.  There is no point in pretending there are such committees if no real partnership is taking place.  We are anxious to progress the development of the committees in 1999 to ensure that the important decisions are taken in conjunction with people with disabilities in their own area and not at national level.</P>
    <P>The Government is also establishing the database which was the subject of favourable comment by contributors to this debate.  It is an important development.  There was also favourable comment about the national disability authority. It will be responsible for policy, research, standards and monitoring.  It will be a statutory body and legislation in that regard will be published next week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> One of the Deputies commented on unfriendly workplaces for the disabled.  That issue comes within the remit of the Employment Equality Act which was passed in June.</P>
    <P>It is important to be fair in any debate.  Last night the Minister, Deputy Cowen, outlined in detail what is happening in this area.  Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996, is the document to which everybody is working.  However, the Members who put down this motion only provided £3.5 million towards fulfilling its recommendations.  In the past 18 months this Government has provided £22.4 million for that area, excluding this year's Estimates or the budget provisions.  It is important to be fair about the figures and some Members of the Opposition were fair enough to acknowledge that progress is being made.</P>
    <P>I agree with the favourable comments on the aids and appliances announcement.  It is extremely important.  Millions of pounds can be put into a sector but it would be wrong if, at the end of the day, an individual could not get a basic aid or appliance.  Hopefully, yesterday's announcement will resolve everybody's worries in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about the Government's commitment to people with disabilities, particularly those with physical and sensory disabilities, and their entitlement to services.  The Government is committed to the basic principle that not only must the Department of Health and Children deliver on its service obligations in this regard but that all Departments must deliver on them.  There have been a number of successes, particularly in the Department of Education and Science with regard to children with autism and other special needs.  It is important to note that there has been a great deal of progress in all Departments in the past 12 months.  The legislation on, and establishment of, the national disability authority will make a difference as, obviously, will more funding of the sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGuinness wishes to participate in the debate and I will give way to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on her efforts on behalf of the disabled. However, that cannot take from our commitment to continue to examine our investment in this area.</P>
      <P>The bureaucracy that has become attached to funding in this area is horrific.  It has grown around every fund intended to be spent directly on the disability sector.  A passport for life is now essential and eligibility for the passport, once established, should be sufficient to qualify one to access all other funding mechanisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aids and appliances fund must be ringfenced in the various health boards.  In August, £100,000 was made available to the South-Eastern Health Board but little of it found its way to the people who needed it most.  Indeed, there is controversy about that.  Future funding should be <Col N="1232" /> ring-fenced and only made available directly to the people who most need it.  The allocation to the South-Eastern Health Board should be investigated to establish what value for money was achieved.</P>
    <P>The disabled person's housing grant is extremely low at £8,000.  It should be increased and the numbers on the waiting list for the grant should be reduced.  Perhaps the OT section and the reports needed for various local authorities should be investigated with a view to reducing the list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the only party leader to speak in this debate.  My reason for doing so is that in the programme for Government which was negotiated between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party in 1992, my party sought the establishment of a separate Department with responsibility for equality and law reform.</P>
      <P>I listened with respect to the comments of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the commitment of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; I think they are still there &mdash; to this issue. However, one of the first actions of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was to abolish the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  If there had not been such a Department, there would not have been a Minister with responsibility for this issue in the Cabinet.  If Mervyn Taylor had not been in Cabinet and argued for the commission which produced the report to which the Minister of State referred, this debate would not be taking place today.</P>
      <P>While I accept that the Ministers of State, Deputies Mary Wallace and Fahey, are sincere in their commitment to this issue, as are other Fianna Fáil Deputies, one cannot play first division football if one is permanently in the second division.  This is not a health or education issue and is certainly not a justice issue.  It is an equality issue, the inclusion of all citizens on an equal basis.  However, there is nobody at the Cabinet table in this Government to argue that case trenchantly, as Mervyn Taylor did when he was Minister.</P>
      <P>The Department of Equality and Law Reform was effectively abolished.  Talk to anybody working in the Department's offices on St. Stephen's Green and they will not claim they work in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Each claims to work in the Department of Justice.  The Department was effectively abolished even in the mentality of the Accounting Officer, the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amounts of money to which the Minister of State referred apply to aids and appliances in the first instance and do not address issues such <Col N="1233" /> as the core funding of the groups associated with the disabled.  The disabled simply want what I and the Minister of State enjoy, the ability to move freely around the State and the ability to freely exercise their rights as citizens notwithstanding the fact that they have a disability.</P>
    <P>By abolishing the Department of Equality and Law Reform, the Government undermined the independence which was partially accorded them by the previous Government.  I say &ldquo;partially&rdquo; because we had only started on this long road.  I acknowledge that some progress, albeit small, has been made by the present Government but it is not enough.  It is easy to compare and contrast what was spent by a previous Administration with what will be spent this afternoon by the current Administration.  Fianna Fáil is long enough in Government to stop looking behind and to look to the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will today announce, <i>inter alia</i>, that he will bank £1 billion to pay off the national debt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also a separate issue to do with respect and dignity for the people who have taken up the cause of people with a disability, the guarantee of core funding.  Such a guarantee would ensure they are not always humiliated into coming to the Government, cap in hand, seeking some type of subvention so their organisations can continue to do the work that is required.  That is not being properly addressed.  Given that the Opposition parties feel so strongly we have come together in a display of unity on this issue.  Our parties do not necessarily agree on many issues. Under this administration unlike under any previous Administration, resources are not a constraint. The sole constraint here is the political will to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate my support for this worthy and timely motion on behalf of people <Col N="1234" /> with physical and sensory disabilities.  I have no hesitation in putting my name to the motion because it serves to highlight the disgraceful neglect of thousands of people with disability, some of whom are the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society.  I hope the action taken by the united Opposition today will force the Government to provide the necessary funding for all the services: day centres, assistants and appliances which are essential to people with disabilities.  I know many of the people in need in my constituency, some of whom are virtual prisoners in their homes, because of the lack of services available to them.</P>
      <P>We all have a moral responsibility to people with disabilities and the opportunity exists now to allocate the necessary funding to reverse the neglect of decades.  A few weeks ago, I met members of the Irish Wheelchair Association, the national organisation of people with physical disability, in its headquarters in Clontarf.  I listened to their reasonable request and pledged my vote and support.  I pay tribute to those organisations and people who organised such an effective lobby and who, to press home their case last week, participated in the protest at the gates of Dáil Éireann.  I hope their efforts will be successful because justice and genuine equality are on their side.</P>
      <P>The last budget was one for the rich.  I hope today's budget will be one for the disadvantaged and for people with disabilities.  Motions such as this in Private Members' time, supported by all the Opposition parties, large and small and by the independent Deputies, is a most democratic way to utilise Private Members' time in support of people and issues neglected by Government.  I trust we will continue to co-operate in such a meaningful and non-partisan manner.  I will vote for motion 61.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish wheelchair mission statement is:</P>
      <P>The achievement of full social, economic and educational integration of people with disabilities as equal, independent and participative members in the general community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very important mission statement and sums up what all politicians should look at.  Sligo boasts one of the better resource centres, catering for about 120 wheelchair users in Sligo, north Leitrim and south Donegal.  However, greater funding is required to ensure all who wish to avail of the service can do so.  In the public gallery a constituent of mine lives in a Cheshire home on a temporary basis.  To live independently in the community she would need a personal assistant on a full-time basis.  Personal assistants are employed under the community employment scheme for one year.  Given the intimate nature of the work, once a person has got used to a personal assistant it is difficult to change after a year to another assistant who may not be as suitable. This is a matter which is causing unrest in many <Col N="1235" /> parts of the country.  Given the enormous resources from the EU for community employment schemes the Minister should examine this matter.</P>
    <P>The Sligo resource centre depends almost 99 per cent on a wheelchair accessible bus.  The 11 year old bus with a mileage of 360,000 has huge maintenance costs.  A new bus would cost in the region of £33,000.  I appeal to the Minister to provide the necessary funding.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the committees which work tirelessly on behalf of the disabled in Sligo and the greater region.  Given that an 11 year old bus which has a mileage of 360,000 is in use, some questions must be asked.  Given the commitment to Dublin Bus for 150 new buses I am astonished provision has not been made for people with disabilities. In reply to a question the Minister said: &ldquo;I understand from Dublin Bus that the floor level double decker buses are not currently readily available.  Models which may be suitable will shortly be in use in London&rdquo;.  An investment for 150 buses in Dublin is a ten year investment.  In this day and age a certain percentage of those buses should be user friendly for disabled people. From the Sligo perspective I appeal to the Minister to look seriously at the problems highlighted. Some people are prisoners in their homes.  Their freedom of movement and basic entitlements are infringed for no other reason than that they are people with disabilities.  In the budget, I appeal to the Minister to address some of the important issues which are of concern to many people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important motion. Deputy Tony Gregory and others who have contributed are correct in highlighting the fact that, as with the motion dealing with mental handicap two weeks ago, this motion which deals with physical and sensory disability has resulted in all the Opposition parties coming together, in the truly independent Independent Deputies coming together and saying the Government has got its priorities wrong.  From this side of the House there is a commitment to improve services for those suffering from physical and sensory disabilities, to facilitate them to the maximum possible extent to lead an independent lifestyle and enjoy a quality of life denied to far too many.</P>
      <P>We have heard much about money.  Figures have been tossed from one side to the other during this debate.  It is not all about money but money is crucial in ensuring the broad range of services necessary to allow people have independence and a good quality of life. In the context of the revenue spending, recommended by the report Towards an Independent Future, this Government has fallen short by £11 million to ensure the proper services are put in place.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on his visit to London on 27 November 1998.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25432/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I undertook three official engagements during my recent visit to London. The first was a visit to the Safe Start Foundation in West Hendon.  The foundation caters for the needs of young Irish emigrants in search of accommodation, training and jobs.  It does excellent work in the interests of our emigrants, and I was happy to have an opportunity to visit the foundation and see for myself the services they are providing.  I was met by Mr. Mahesh Singadia, Director of the Safe Start Foundation, and his fellow Directors Mr. Seamus McGarry and Mr. Tom Biesty.  Also present were the Leader of Barnet Council, Councillor Alan Williams and the Deputy Leader of Brent Council, Councillor Anne John.</P>
      <P>My second engagement was a visit to the Irish Studies Centre in the University of North London. I was invited to visit the centre by its Deputy Director, Dr. Sarah Morgan.  I met there a number of people, including Mr. Brian Roper, the Vice-Chancellor of the University; Mr. Jonathan Moore, Principal Lecturer in Irish Studies; Mr. Paul Sheehan, Subject Tutor for Irish Studies; Mr. Tomás Mac Stiofan, Lecturer on the Irish Language and Dr. Bronwen Walter.</P>
      <P>In the course of the meeting, I was given a detailed summary of a report entitled &ldquo;Discrimination and the Irish Community in Britain&rdquo;, by Dr. Mary Hickman and Dr. Bronwen Walter.  It contains a report of research undertaken for the Commission for Racial Equality in Britain.  The main findings of the research are that there is an extremely strong resistance to the recognition of the distinctiveness of Irish experience in Britain which results in a lack of acknowledgement of Irish needs and rights, but that at the same time there is a widespread, and almost completely unquestioned, acceptance of anti-Irish racism in British society.  The broad policy recommendations which the report makes include the need to make Irish issues more visible so that their existence and legitimacy is acknowledged.  Fundamental to this is the collection of accurate data so that the nature and scale of problems faced can be measured and change can be monitored.</P>
      <P>On the positive side, it was pointed out to me that the Irish experience in Britain is becoming more assured particularly as a result of the peace process, the success and high profile of some Irish writers and musicians, as well as by the success of the Irish economy.  This centre's contribution, through undertaking research and analysis into the issues which affect the Irish community in Britain, is of immense benefit in determining our policy objectives in relation to emigration.</P>
      <P>My third engagement was to launch a book entitled <i>Passion in Exile &mdash; 100 years of London Irish RFC.</i>  This book marks the centenary year of the London Irish Rugby Football Club which over the past century has offered a home from home for many Irish men, from both North and South, living in England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for all this information.  However, was not the principal purpose of his trip to attend a Fianna Fáil fundraiser <Col N="1243" /> in London?  What was the cost to the Exchequer of the trip?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The engagements I had included a Fianna Fáil function, which was a successful night.  I do not know if any money was made, I will tell the Deputy in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  The Taoiseach is not accountable to the House for that &mdash; he is for travel costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>These were engagements I was due to fulfil and I did so &mdash; I do not consider that as a cost to the Exchequer.  If I had only been attending the Fianna Fáil function I would have done what I have done in the past, which is to go on a scheduled flight paid for by the party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would advise the Taoiseach to keep these events separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a far more efficient use of my time if I can attend outstanding functions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that as a public office holder travelling, as he is entitled to, with all the facilities attributable to a head of government, that it is not wise for him to mix party political activity with that during overseas trips?  There is something of a conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not argue with Deputy Bruton as I do not ever want to abuse those facilities. However, if it was an issue, I would rather do it the other way around &mdash; to travel and still conduct my official duties rather than take separate trips.  I find it hard enough to get a free day in my diary as I am sure the Deputy did, to attend functions for his party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I kept them separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done very few.  This is the first function I have attended for the party outside the country this year, even though I have been asked to attend a number of them.  I have not followed the practice of previous Taoisigh, including Deputy Bruton, members of my party and his party, who hopped back and forth across the Atlantic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor did I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and will refer to his official response.  He met Safe Start, visited the University of North London and launched the book <i>Passion in Exile &mdash; 100 years of London Irish RFC.</i>  Both of us were Ministers in the Department of Labour in our political past. Was the Taoiseach convinced on the basis of the presentations made to him and the depth of the antagonism towards Irish people and those of Irish descent in the UK, of the necessity to <Col N="1244" /> increase the grant to DÍON?  If so, will we see that this afternoon?  Do I take it the Taoiseach is of the same opinion as I am, that the people who attended the Fianna Fáil function would be better off giving their money, discretionary and all as it is, to DÍON's activities in the United Kingdom rather than to the Taoiseach's activities in the Republic of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Quinn will be aware, many of these people make great contributions. A few nights ago I met members of the Mayo association which has done an enormous amount for the Irish and which is comprised effectively of Irish construction workers.  The association has three or four houses, which they paid for and renovated without funding from other sources, where the Irish live.</P>
      <P>I will not claim they are all Fianna Fáil supporters but many of them are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are Labour Party supporters among them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party councillors and representatives are strongly behind the Irish community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider a help line for isolated elderly Irish people in the United Kingdom is worthy of support given that there is a successful help line, which happens to be located in my constituency, staffed by senior citizens?  It provides a listening ear for Irish people in the Irish telephone area for the price of a local call.  Would it be worthwhile for the Government to fund, at a comparatively modest expense, such an operation to be staffed by people of Irish birth who live in Britain?  It would enable Irish elderly people to talk to other Irish elderly people in Britain if they feel lonely, and there are many in that situation. Does the Taoiseach consider this would be worthwhile given that I have already made representations on the matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly raise the issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I would not be against the concept because clearly these people are lonely.  The reason I included the piece in my reply is that the people who are working on this in the UK believe more research should be carried out in this area.  Of course there is the big issue of the census to try to find the exact position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the saddest things I have ever seen was retired Irish building workers sitting looking into the middle distance and not talking to their neighbours in a pub in north London. There is the sense of complete isolation in not being able to afford an air ticket to go home, not <Col N="1245" /> having relatives at home while living in an alien culture in Britain, and not being able to work because the only work they know is so physically demanding they cannot do it at their age.  These are a bereft generation of people whom we, as a nation, have let down.  We should do something for them now before it is too late and they have passed on to their eternal reward in the next world, where undoubtedly they will have a happier existence than they have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Seamus McGarry, who would be known to most Members for his long association with, and former chairmanship of, the Federation of Irish Societies, introduced me to many of the people described.  I also met the chaplain services which are involved in Camden Town and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong to say we have done nothing because in Camden Town much of the work was done by FÁS people with Irish people's money and money collected here by the Oblate Fathers in Dublin and other cities.  I want to pay credit to them and to the Mayo association.  Many of the other county associations give their annual dinner receipts to various housing trusts, but there are not many housing projects.  We need to foster greater collaboration between the Irish groups and the various councils such as Brent and Barnet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we could encourage Irish employers in Britain to pay their taxes and to protect their workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is clear, particularly from the 1950s and 1960s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>There was gross abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different regulations now.</P>
      <P>For at least the past 12 years for which I have responsibility for the Federation of Irish Societies or DÍON, the kind of initiative to which Deputy Bruton referred has taken place.  Clearly there is a requirement to do more.  Most of these people would have gone abroad in the 1950s.  These people, even when they get their proper welfare entitlements, still live a lonely existence in inner city areas.  We should give them any help we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met the EU Transport Commissioner, Mr. Neil Kinnock on Thursday, 19 November.  We discussed a variety of issues prior to his formal meetings with the Ministers for Public Enterprise and Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>I briefed him on the current developments in relation to the Northern Ireland Peace Process.  I outlined the importance of the Peace and Reconciliation Fund and the International Fund for Ireland and highlighted the valuable European and international context which they provided in terms of support for the peace process.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity to outline the background to the Government's decision to seek EUROSTAT approval for regionalisation and the need for further regional development in terms of infrastructure and the industrial base.  I also stressed the importance of regional airports and in that context raised the issue of duty free and the Irish Government's pursuit of a re-examination of the issue at EU level.</P>
      <P>I met Austrian Federal Chancellor, Viktor Klima, on 27 November as part of his tour of capitals in advance of the Vienna European Council.  We discussed a number of issues such as Agenda 2000, including Cohesion Funding, CAP reform and own resources; Northern Ireland; co-ordination of economic policies; and common foreign and security policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Agenda 2000, I pointed out that although we accept the inevitability of a <Col N="1247" /> reduction in receipts, the proposed transitional arrangements will affect Ireland more significantly than any other member state and the overall outcome must be an equitable one.  I emphasised once again that a key element for us continues to be the need to ensure adequate transitional arrangements under Objective One.</P>
    <P>I expressed our strong support for the Commission's view that participation in the single currency should have no implications for continued eligibility for the Cohesion Fund.  In our view there should also be provision for transitional arrangements for any member state which ceases to qualify as a result of any mid-term review in 2003.</P>
    <P>We also discussed in general terms the current proposals on CAP reform.  As I have indicated to the House previously, while we accept the broad thrust of the Commission's proposals, the proposals as they stand would damage the Irish agriculture industry and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>On the issue of own resources, I indicated that we are aware of the different concerns of our partners.  We agree with the Commission, however, that the net balance concept fails to take account of the wide ranging benefits that accrue to member states from Union membership and participation in the Single Market particularly. I stressed once again that we are totally opposed to national co-financing of CAP expenditure on direct payments.  It would do little to address the position of net contributors, while placing a cost burden on some of the less prosperous member states with a high dependency on agriculture, who can least afford it.</P>
    <P>I have not received an agenda as such for the European Council in Vienna, but I expect the work to centre on the issues I discussed with Federal Chancellor Klima.  I have not as yet received a response from Prime Minister Jospin of France to my recent correspondence on duty free.</P>
    <P>I am meeting German Federal Chancellor Schroeder in Bonn on 15 December.  The meeting is part of my round of bilateral meetings with the other EU heads of state or Government in advance of the conclusion of the Agenda 2000 negotiations.  I expect our discussions to focus on ways to progress the key issues under Agenda 2000 as considered at the Vienna European Council the previous weekend.</P>
    <P>I am currently considering conducting an official visit to the Middle East from 17 to 21 January of next year.  However, it is not appropriate to announce such a visit until all aspects of the itinerary are agreed with the relevant parties.  At this point, it is likely that, if the visit goes ahead, I will visit the Lebanon, Israel and Palestine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of proposals to introduce new common taxes for the European Union to provide own resources to the Union in addition to value added tax and contributions from member states?  What is the Taoiseach's view on the wisdom of having, for <Col N="1248" /> example, a carbon tax as one of the own resources of the Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the discussions and proposals.  I indicated our position, that there is a need to co-ordinate national taxation policies consistent with the principles of subsidiarity and within the terms of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>However, the energy tax will come forward not at the Vienna European Council but some time in advance of the Cologne meeting or the special meeting in February or March.  Many countries are in favour of an energy tax.  It was tried some years ago but it came to nought.  There has been little discussion among the heads of state on it but I envisage that we will see some formulation of an energy tax in the early months of 1999 emanating from ECOFIN.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the past two days the European Commission issued statistics on inflation figures for the euro zone which indicate that Ireland has the highest rate of inflation in the euro zone at 2.6 per cent as against an average rate of inflation of 1 per cent and rates as low as 0.5 per cent in France? Is this a matter of concern to him in view of the requirement for monetary stability in the euro zone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We must always be very conscious of price stability.  It is and has been for several years an anchor to our economic policy.  We must be very careful not to do anything which unnecessarily pushes it up but we are still within the range.  Looking to the next few years, we need not be over worried about the figures but we must be conscious of them all the time.  A few years ago we were the lowest or the second lowest in the Community.  It did not create a great stir one way or the other in terms of people's perceptions nor will this create a great stir as long as we keep within the Maastricht criteria.  We should always do our utmost to keep inflation at the lowest level as it would not be prudent to do anything which would drive it upwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that Ireland not only has the highest rate of inflation in the euro zone but that the rate of increase in Irish inflation is also the highest in the euro zone, increasing from 0.8 per cent to 2.6 per cent today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton will recall the early headlines of the economic gurus in our society at the beginning of this year all forecasting that we would hit 6 per cent in mid year and that we would be unlikely to get out of it.  There was a national consensus on the reviews.  I remember doing a programme at the beginning of the year at which there was unanimity among the experts who shared that programme with me that we <Col N="1249" /> would surpass 6 per cent before midsummer's day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not join that consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy did not.  There was no other politician on the programme.  I am glad we know a little more about these matters than those in full-time employment giving reviews on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach meant permanent employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, permanent employment. Having said that, price stability must remain one of the key anchors of Government policy in the long-term.  I cannot see a time when that will not be the case.  While our rate is high, the Deputy will agree that we have the highest level of economic growth and employment.  It is inevitable that there would be some increase.  Some increases have been brought to my attention in recent months in some sectors of the economy.  I cannot see the justification for these increases.  I have raised the matter but I have not got a satisfactory answer to why these price increases were implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that had it not been for the indecision of his Minister for Finance in failing to signal to the markets the rate at which Ireland would enter the euro, the punt would not have fallen against the value of sterling and that consequently we unnecessarily imported many inflationary pressures in the first quarter of this year, which have happily gone?  I share his perspective that we are now looking at a lower rate of inflation in the future than that which would have been forecast this time last year.</P>
      <P>My Question No. 5 relates specifically to the Taoiseach's correspondence with the French Prime Minister on duty free sales.  Bearing in mind the meeting which took place in Brussels yesterday, the optimistic statements being made by the person who has no responsibility for the matter, his colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, and the fact that the Capet report produced by the French which suggested a five year phasing out of duty free facilities appears to have received some support from a number of countries, what is the Taoiseach's impression as to the prospect of duty free facilities being phased out on a gradual basis as distinct from being eliminated from June of next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got direct reports from the meetings of the past two days but some brief reports.  Perhaps I will get detailed accounts tomorrow.  I discussed this matter on 13 July with Prime Minister Jospin.  At that stage, no real effort was being made by anyone other than ourselves to get this debate going.  Prime Minister Jospin told me he would act on the basis on the Capet report.  I stated in this House on two or three occasions that I supported that initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> Since the German elections Chancellor Schröder said he would honour his commitment.  I believe I read that statement here two weeks ago in a reply to Deputy Quinn.  I raised the issue with the UK at the meeting last week and I am grateful that after putting the case to him Prime Minister Blair has indicated his support.  It is the first time the UK has come on board and that is directly related to our efforts.  Other countries have also come on board.</P>
    <P>I have said before that people need to be mindful that the Commission, whatever its views on the matter, does not see duty free facilities being in place in the long-term and would totally resist it.  Its belief is that any border taxes would be an affront to the Single Market.  I have never argued against that but advocated giving the sectors in the industry and the duty free area generally an opportunity to adjust.  This applies not only to the private sector companies involved in duty free and their staff, about whom I would be more concerned, but also to regional airports which have not got together to deal with this situation. Although they should have done so, the reality is they have not and this is a problem elsewhere as well.</P>
    <P>We must endeavour to convince the other countries.  I will turn my energy, as I did at the beginning of the year, to the Nordic countries where duty free facilities on ferries rather than in airports are an issue.  It is extraordinary that those countries have not come on side.  Rather than jumping up and down, we need to redouble our efforts as regards those countries.  We have moved from a position of having one country and maybe a second on side to having six or possibly seven.  We need to move on the bloc of Nordic countries which would place us in a very strong position.  That is where we should apply our energies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that what is required is a commitment from the Commission to undertake a study of the employment consequences of the instant elimination of duty free sales across the EU?  Will he indicate &mdash; he did not do so in response to a previous question &mdash; whether he raised this issue with President Santer or Commissioner Monti?  The German Presidency cannot put this issue on the agenda unless there is some degree of support from the Commission.  Will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that at the forthcoming heads of government council meeting in Vienna he will actively seek to have the Commission put in place a report on the employment or unemployment consequences of the instant abolition of duty free facilities next June?  In the context of the conclusions of such a report, will he seek to get some form of phased derogation along the lines set out in the Capet report?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad people are revisiting the issue.  I was told in the House a few months <Col N="1251" /> ago that I should forget it so I am glad the situation is changing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised these issues with President Santer on numerous occasions, particularly at the meeting I had with him when he addressed the Seanad a few weeks ago.  The Commission's view is that if member states want to revisit this issue in sufficient numbers, it will be put back on the agenda but unanimity will be the rule.  I would not like to see it on the agenda of the first meeting of the German ECOFIN Council as some work needs to be done between now and then.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question on the study is more appropriate to the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for Finance who have been involved.  I understand the Commission commissioned a study and brought forward some of its conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The row in the Transport Council was about the way the study was formulated and the fact it was not just about the employment issues but about how it would cover the fiscal issues.  I will continue to raise it tactically and I will work with those countries which are driving it forward.  Whether we do it in Vienna, we will continue to operate with the countries in favour of trying to get this maintained over a period of time as we have in recent months.  The best we will achieve is an extension. The idea of overturning it altogether went off the agenda a long time ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the serious income situation facing the farming community? Is he further aware that if the Agenda 2000 proposals, to which he referred in his reply, are implemented, virtually no form of agriculture would be profitable, in the sense of a person being able to make a living from the marketplace, without reliance on cheques in the post?  What is his perspective on the future for farming in Ireland?  What type of future does he see for farmers in light of the Agenda 2000 proposals and the financial framework within which these must be negotiated, which is a limit on overall EU expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We opposed the Commission's document of 18 March because it would hit this country far worse than anywhere else, particularly in the beef and milk sectors which represent 4 per cent of GDP.  The Commission's proposal would be devastating for our resources.  If that gained a foothold in the Commission and the European structures, it would create great difficulties.</P>
      <P>Our concerns and our position have been outlined at several Agriculture Council meetings and we will continue to outline them.  I outlined them with President Santer recently and at all meetings I have had with heads of state during 1998. Detailed discussions will start immediately after Christmas.  Discussions are ongoing in the Commission, but we will have a tough battle to try to change this decision.</P>
      <P>I know Deputy Quinn will take credit for some of the decisions changed by Chancellor Schröder. However, he has set out a different position on agriculture, which is not good for Irish agriculture. In this case we must work closely with Mr. Jospin and our French colleagues.  I have raised these issues with Mr. Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, and others, but we will have great difficulties in this regard.  It will take long and tough negotiations to change what is proposed and to get a good deal for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that any young person considering farming as an occupation is facing a continuous drip of bad news, which indicates there is no future in this business? Does he agree that this is a genuine crisis not so much for existing members of the community who must live their lives out as farmers, but for young people who want to become involved in farming and that it will continue to be so as long as this industry is constantly under the threat of an ever worsening political situation as a result of the way the EU is doing its business in terms of farming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that is not the case and that young people continue to become involved in agriculture, although the numbers are declining. <Col N="1253" /> We must try to get the best deal we can for them.  We must help them in restructuring the agriculture industry.  While the farming bodies are trying to deal with a difficult year, they are also putting forward some constructive suggestions on how to restructure agriculture in the future. There is a reduction in the number of full-time farmers and an increase in off-farm incomes.  We must try to deal with the changes as best we can.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton is correct about Europe. The Common Agriculture discussions at the GATT round are not showing a bright future. However, we must negotiate with the hand we have been dealt and we have made clear our position. There is a unity of purpose between the various farming bodies, the Government, Departments and agencies.  They are working together to try to negotiate the best position for agriculture from 2000 to 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that the Taoiseach in his initial reply stated that he has not yet received the final agenda, although it is just less than ten days away from the summit in Vienna under the first Austrian Presidency.  I presume he has a fair idea of the agenda because these matters do not fall from the sky.</P>
      <P>Apropos the Agenda 2000 discussions and the necessity to have these put in place by March of next year, does the Taoiseach recognise that, given the fact that all forms of economic activity within the European Union have opened up to market economic pressures, whether it is industrial or service production or financial services, agriculture has no divine right to be protected from that form of market activity to which the Fine Gael Party in particular is wedded?  Will he outline his view to the House on the apparent anomaly where 80 per cent of the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy price support system go to 20 per cent of farmers?</P>
      <P>If we are looking at a transition from a command economy price support system for output to a market driven price support system, we must separate serious problems of rural depopulation and the need for people involved in agri-business to have access to genuine markets.  Because of Ireland's unique dependency on agriculture &mdash; I am not just talking about farmers in the field but about workers processing the produce of farms, whether in creameries or meat factories &mdash; how does the Taoiseach intend to protect the needs of the agri-business sector on the one hand and deal with the problems of rural depopulation on the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Those questions are nearly as broad as the last ones, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. While I do not have a formal agenda, the issues I raised will be discussed.  Chancellor Klima was with me early on, but he is moving around this week.  I assume the issues I mentioned will be discussed along with perhaps some common foreign and security issues.  I have continually stated that the resources should be more evenly spread.  We will not get the resources if we do not adopt that approach.  I would not feel comfortable arguing <Col N="1254" /> that we want to save Irish agriculture while resources are given to fund less than one fifth of agriculture.  I have made it clear to farm leaders and others that I will not get any support from the Commission, not to mention other countries on that basis.</P>
      <P>People would be ill-advised to ignore Commissioner Fischler's statements that he sees an opportunity in the restructuring of agriculture. The one area he favours is the development of properly structured, rural development policies. That is the way to go, considering this in its broadest sense.</P>
      <P>The Government and the farming organisations have linked themselves to a number of those proposals.  I see merit and a good opportunity for negotiating on that basis.  It is a better arrangement.  I have already stated that this involves a sizeable part of the economy.  The milk and beef sectors comprise 4 per cent of GDP and they are extremely important to farmers and related industries.</P>
      <P>The European Commission is trying to give positive advice.  There are negative areas, such as own resources, but we should take the opportunity to try to build on these positive areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Cabinet handbook sets out the steps to be taken by Ministers in formulating, obtaining Government approval for and presenting legislative proposals to the Houses of the Oireachtas. However, I do not consider that it is possible to make a general rule on publication of the type of reports to which the Deputy refers.  Such reports will be received on a diverse range of issues and I am satisfied that each should be the subject of separate consideration.</P>
      <P>In principle, all useful material should be available to assist Oireachtas Members in considering proposed legislation.  However, it is ultimately a matter for each Minister to decide on publication of such reports having weighed up the considerations involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since early summer, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who is perhaps legislatively the most challenged Minister with a spectacular failure rate as regards delivery against promise, has been systematically quoting on the airwaves from a partial report he received from the SMI, known colloquially as the Leahy report, on proposals for changes in the criminal law and its procedures. However, the Minister has not quoted this report in the House.  On numerous occasions the Minister <Col N="1255" /> has quoted this report on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and other radio programmes, deriving some degree of vindication for initiatives he might see as necessary.  However, the public is presumed to know what this report might be and what its recommendations contain.  The Members of this House do not have access to this report.  If we have government by consultancy, as is increasingly the case with this and previous Governments, does the Taoiseach agree there is a fundamental need to change the procedures in Cabinet so that if the Government commissions reports to assist policy formation, it would be desirable in the interests of democratic transparency that the contents of these reports be published?  A report does not commit the Government to action.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that frequent quotations from a report by a Minister give the impression that reports are in the public domain, even though this may not be the case?  Does he also agree that this contradicts current guidelines?  Will he consider changing the guidelines so that Ministers are required to publish the contents of reports within a specified period and without prejudicing whatever decisions the Government may make?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the current pilot phase of the early school leavers initiative is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving.  The objective was to select a range of strategic pilot projects in urban and rural areas of disadvantage which will develop models of good practice, with a view to their integration, after evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice.</P>
      <P>As the objective at this stage is simply to test a range of models of response with a view to their possible wider application later, it is not necessary to replicate such models through funding a large number of similar projects.</P>
      <P>A total of 14 project areas were selected for inclusion in the present phase of the initiative. Nine of the projects focus on large urban areas; three on provincial towns and two on rural areas. A total of £3.62 million is being made available to the project over the next two years.  I am satisfied the selected projects will provide the required range of experience from which future approaches to the problem of early school leaving can be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the pilot phase of the initiative will be kept under ongoing review.  The question of extending the initiative will be considered in the light of experience gained with the models now being tested under the pilot phase.  The Deputy will appreciate that mainstreaming provision at this stage, or providing funding irrespective of evaluation, would defeat the entire purpose of the programme.  We must first discern what works best before disseminating it. <Col N="1257" /> The Deputy will also note that early school leaving has received unequalled attention from me over the past 18 months.  lt was the subject of one of the first items I brought to the Cabinet.  I assure the House that the priority which I have already shown for this area will inform other targeted interventions.</P>

      <P>How is it the case that among the successful projects, 43 per cent of those from Cork were successful, whereas the national figure was 12 per cent?  There appears to be an extraordinary favouritism towards one part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There was only one project from Cork.  I was anxious that the area based approach would be adopted.  In other words, where there are area partnerships, and there is an urban project in Cork, there would be some integration of existing services with the new pilot project.  The Commission made it clear when advancing funding that it wanted different partners applying.  In other words, it did not just want schools applying, but youth and community organisations and the area based approach.  The area of Knocknaheeny, north west city, Mahon, Blackrock is a partnership area and is the area of highest disadvantage. It is also covered by the local drugs task force and by ADM.  Dublin has a number of projects including Ballymun, Bonnybrook, Darndale, Priorswood, Clonshaugh, Jobstown and Killinarden. Limerick has Rosbrien, Southill and St. Munchen's.</P>

Is it not extraordinary that one third of the money has been granted to Cork while Dublin with two and a half times the population will receive less money under the scheme?

Cork received three projects, Dublin which has two and a half times the population of Cork, received four projects.  The success rate for project applications in Dublin was 13 per cent.

It is important that we integrate whatever we do in this scheme with other initiatives being undertaken by the State. For example, in the URBAN initiative resources have been made available to disadvantaged schools to provide teaching-counsellors and psychologists. It would have made no sense to set up a new pilot project which would be separate from those already in place.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to make allowance for siblings with physical, sensory or intellectual disability living at home similar to that made for siblings attending a post leaving certificate, CERT or other approved third level course in Garda training or as a student nurse when assessing a student's entitlement to a third level maintenance grant.</Quest>
      <QRef>[24740/98]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to a grant operates on a graduated basis.  To qualify for a grant the candidate's reckonable income must be below the appropriate income limit which varies for the level of grant and in relation to the number of dependent children in the family.  Different limits apply where there are fewer than four dependent children between four and seven, and eight or more dependants.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the higher education grants scheme for dependent children over the age of 16 who are medically certified as permanently unfit for work to be considered as dependent children.  Prior to the 1998 higher education grant scheme, the allowance referred to by the Deputy applied only in cases where there were two or more family members in full time third level education.  I made provision in the 1998 scheme to extend this allowance to include those family members attending other educational courses such as a recognised PLC course, student nurse training or student Garda training, those participating in certain CERT courses and those attending full time Teagasc courses in an agricultural college.  I also increased the allowance by 3 per cent.  In the relevant cases the reckonable income limits may now be increased by £2,060 where there are two such children, £4,120 where there are three and so on by increments of £2,060.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated that there is provision in the scheme to regard as dependent those children medically certified as permanently unfit for work.  Moreover, the additional allowance in respect of other children attending further education was originally introduced and has now been extended by me in recognition of the costs incurred in this regard.</P>
      <P>However, the issue raised by Deputy O'Shea's question is one which I will keep under review and I will consider it again in the context of the framing of the 1999 student support schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>When a young person with special needs finishes his or her education at 18 years and does not obtain a day-care place an extra cost is incurred by the family because the young person must be taken care of at home.  The allowance of £2,060 could be used to pay someone to look after the young person while the parents are at work. This would be particularly useful in the case of single-parent families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex area.  It was not entirely clear in the Department precisely what <Col N="1260" /> measure was being sought by the Deputy.  I am not sure if the young people described by him come into the category of dependent children over the age of 16 who are medically certified as being permanently unfit for work.  I am prepared to discuss sympathetically the details of his suggestion or individual cases with Deputy O'Shea.  The student support scheme for 1998 has already been passed and any measure such as that suggested by the Deputy could only be discussed in the context of the 1999 scheme.  It would be necessary to clarify the definitions used by mine and other Departments concerning young people with special needs but I would be happy to dicuss those details with the Deputy.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the reason for the substantial gap in resources per primary pupil spent in Ireland compared to the rest of the OECD countries; and if this accounts for the prevalence of educational disadvantage in Ireland.</Quest>
      <QRef>[26001/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The recently published Education at a Glance indicators show that in 1995, prior to the present Government's tenure of office, Ireland spent only 60 per cent of the OECD average per student at primary level.  This poor performance on a <i>per capita</i> basis has arisen historically. However, it would be too simplistic to say that resources alone are relevant in impacting on educational disadvantage.  Other countries which have higher <i>per capita</i> spending figures than us have serious problems of educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>This said, it was precisely because of the present Government's awareness of the inadequacy of funding in the primary sector that it is addressing the problem.  Following from the inadequate provision in the 1997 budget, this Government quickly and determinedly began allocating additional resources to primary education.  Before any changes which might be made arising from today's statement by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, the 1999 Estimates already show primary education receiving 20 per cent more than the amount provided in the budget two years ago. This level of increase will certainly improve Ireland's relative standing <i>vis à vis</i> other OECD countries when the comparative spending figures are updated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the 1997 freeze on school funding, I have secured funding to make sure that basic direct capitation funding will be one third higher next year than when the Government took office. In fact, next year's increase in direct funding will be the largest in the history of the State by some <Col N="1261" /> considerable margin.  These increases in the capitation grant represent important steps in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level and I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to pursue this policy.</P>
    <P>We accept primary education requires additional funding, but we must first target issues of disadvantage and address the needs of children with special needs.  The issue of educational disadvantage is not simply one of resources.  It is crucial the right approaches are taken and that schools are assisted in accessing the supports which will help them address the needs of their pupils.  An effective disadvantage strategy must include changes of approach and attitude.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage. My objective is to ensure all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support they need to maximise their potential in the educational system.  To achieve this, our actions must be co-ordinated more effectively to ensure we focus on identifying and expanding best practice.  The establishment of a new national educational psychological service and a new approach to school attendance are two areas which demonstrate the development of targeted initiatives.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to continue to both improve the funding of all primary schools and to address the needs of educationally disadvantaged pupils in primary schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, against the background of the figures mentioned, his decision not to allocate a single additional teacher to the primary system in each of the past two Estimates is extraordinary?  How does he square that with the declaration in the programme for Government that primary education is to get priority in access to funds?  It is receiving the smallest share of funds available.  Third level education is running away with what is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is incorrect.  Our record compares favourably with that of the previous Government of which Deputy Bruton was a member.  I welcome his conversion and that of the Fine Gael Party to the need to invest in primary education.  The last budget introduced by the Government of which Deputy Bruton was a member attempted to reduce teacher numbers and we had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year to correct that.  It also froze capitation spending.</P>
      <P>We have honoured our pre-election pledges on staffing.  We have more to do and have signalled that.  A targeted approach is needed in terms of remedial teachers, the establishment of a psychological service and a school attendance service. Those are two basic structural deficiencies within the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of absolute importance that we should quickly and thoroughly deal with all cases of child abuse brought to our attention. I view with grave concern the details of the case mentioned in this question.  On my instructions, my Department's papers on this case have been reviewed and I would like to outline the essential elements to the House.  I assumed the Deputy's question related to a specific case which has been topical recently.  Other questions on the Order Paper also deal with it so I thought it would be best to tell the House the full story.</P>
      <P>A letter of complaint was received by the Department about the principal in question in 1982.  This letter referred to his removal from his former position as principal of a primary school as a result of allegations of abuse of boys in his classes in the period 1965-70.  The letter also indicated the author had been in touch with the authorities of the secondary school in which the former principal was then teaching.</P>
      <P>Following my review of the papers, I am firmly of the view that the Department's response to this complaint was seriously lacking and that there can be absolutely no excuse by reference to the standards of the time.  The Department's papers on the matter were made available to the Garda at their request during the course of their investigations.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, procedures to deal with similar situations have been completely altered. Guidelines which were issued to all primary schools in 1991 and to second level schools in 1992 set out the procedures to be followed in dealing with allegations or suspicion of child abuse.  They emphasised the obligation on school authorities to ensure allegations or suspicions are reported to the health authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures to be followed by my Department where an allegation of abuse is received are <Col N="1263" /> set out in an internal instruction of 1995.  Where the allegation relates to a teacher or other member of staff of a school, the procedure requires that the appropriate school authorities be notified by the Department.  The response of the school is then monitored by an internal committee of the Department chaired by an Assistant Secretary.</P>
    <P>Where the allegation is the subject of a Garda investigation, my Department would expect and advise school authorities to suspend the teacher in question pending the outcome of the inquiry. In such cases, salary continues to be paid and substitution provided.  Where, following a Garda inquiry, no prosecution is taken or where an acquittal results, I and my Department take and act upon the view that the school continues to have a duty to establish if the teacher in question was guilty of misconduct, albeit misconduct not leading to a criminal charge.  The Department carefully monitors the actions of schools in this regard.</P>

    <P>There can be no room for complacency regarding current procedures.  For this reason a working party representative of the education partners is already examining the existing guidelines on abuse to ensure they represent a comprehensive and fully updated response to the issue.  Representatives of the health boards have joined the working party.  Furthermore, officials of my Department have held discussions with representatives of the working group established by the Department of Health and Children to review child abuse guidelines.  Updated guidelines will be issued to schools as soon as the group has completed its final report, which is expected within the next three months.  This close co-operation between health boards, the education partners and my Department is essential in safeguarding the wellbeing of pupils in schools.</P>
    <P>We must also continue to emphasise the value of preventative strategies in combating this evil. In this context, initiatives such as the Stay Safe programme will continue to play a critical role in promoting an awareness among pupils of inappropriate behaviour on the part of figures in authority.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister is replying to issues raised by Deputy Flanagan.  Is it the case that, until recently, a spokesman for his Department denied any contact had been made with the Department in this case?</P>
      <P>Regarding the procedures, I understand the Department maintains no record of complaints and cannot indicate their number.  How can the Minister be sure procedures are being followed in accordance with guidelines if no records are maintained by the Department on the frequency or the following up of such allegations?  Surely there is an obligation on the Minister and the Department to maintain records.</P>

      <P>A spokesperson wrongly made a statement to <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> that there was no record of the complaint.  It was a mistake by the civil servant in question.  I have checked it and it appears he was in consultation with another official in the Department and wires got crossed. To prove the bona fides of the case, the letter in question could not be found when the Garda sought it in September 1997.  It was later found in the second level section of the Department by staff who then sent it to the Garda along with the file.  If any Deputy with an interest in the case wishes to seek access to the file in the Department, it will be made available.  It is illustrative although it relates to something which happened 20 to 30 years ago.  However, that does not justify what happened.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply, a working party is due to report within the next three months on updating existing guidelines which will place an obligation on schools to inform the Department.  What cannot be tolerated is guilt by accusation.  Schools have a duty of care and we will lay down strict guidelines in terms of their immediately notifying the Garda and health boards in situations where allegations are made against teachers.  The issue of deregistration arises following conviction and it is envisaged the new Teaching Council Bill will have clear procedures for the deregistration of any teacher convicted of offences in this area.</P>

      <P>It is a pity under the rules of the House that Deputy Flanagan is not permitted to participate in the debate but I am sure he will follow up on what is said.  Why does the Department not maintain proper records of complaints and allegations and how they are dealt with so the Minister can comprehensively answer for what is happening in this area?  It is an area of huge importance for which he has direct responsibility and it should be tightened up.</P>

      <P>It is envisaged the new guidelines would do that.  I agree with the Deputy that there should be records of convictions.  The issue of recording allegations would have to be discussed with the partners.  There would have to be guarantees for all parties concerned because allegations without substance can occasionally be made about individuals.  Those people would have grave concerns if their names were on file in the Department because it would pertain to their professional integrity.  What happened in the past is inexcusable and I am determined it will not happen again.  There are clear procedures in such situations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea):</NameTxt>
      <P>An overall multi-annual budgetary framework and arrangements for Government Departments is currently being developed.  It will not be possible to clarify the multi-annual budgetary situation for the voluntary youth sector until the overall multi-annual framework has been finalised by Government. The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to pre-empt the statement of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, concerning these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will multi-annual budgeting be part of that framework?  Will the local youth service be informed of the funding it will be allocated over a number of years?  Under the present system allocations are made in late May.  Will the Minister agree that system restricts the development of the youth service in many communities? Will he also agree that the 1.7 per cent increase this year, which is below the rate of inflation, has restricted development and resulted in cutbacks in many of the services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it would be more satisfactory if the money was available earlier and we are trying to change that position.  I note from the figures available to me that the increase provided by Deputy Naughten's party during its last year in Government was a grand total of 1 per cent.  I dispute the 1.7 per cent increase he mentioned because it will be augmented by a Supplementary Estimate that will be brought before the House shortly.  In actual terms, that will mean the increase will be approximately 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my understanding of the system being developed, the answer to the question about whether any service will be informed annually about its level of funding for the next number of years is in the negative.  I am informed that detailed estimates and budgetary accounts will be produced for each year.  In addition, as and from this year, the Department of Finance, in consultation with other Departments, will produce two other sets of figures &mdash; the technical terminology for which is financial envelopes &mdash; the accounts for the following year and the year after that.  In the case of this year, they would be for 2000 and 2001.  That will not be done on the basis of the amount allocated to each subhead, but on the basis of the amount allocated to the Department as a whole.  Breaking that figure into subheads will require detailed consultation with, and possibly the sanction of, the Department of Finance, but that has not yet been decided.  While that means not any programme in the Department will have a cast iron guarantee of further funding over the following two years, it will give a greater degree of assurance that such funding will be continued. The present position is that if any programme is to be discarded, discontinued or substantially altered it would require a referral to the steering committee which decides on such matters. <Col N="1266" /> It consists of a representative of the Department, whose programme is being altered, and a representative of the Department of Finance.  The information as to which programmes are being considered in that regard is readily available.</P>

We are continuing that system.</P>

      <Quest>the number of remedial teachers required to provide a service to an acceptable standard to all those primary schools without a remedial service.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25866/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has estimated that an allocation equivalent to approximately 140 remedial teacher posts would be required to provide a service to all primary schools currently without access to a remedial teacher service.  The precise number of posts required would be determined by such factors as the locations of the schools in question and the numbers of pupils involved in each individual case.  My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.</P>
      <P>I recently allocated 60 additional remedial teacher posts to national schools with effect from September 1998.  There are now 1,302 remedial teachers in place in the primary system.  I am currently examining the scope for further development in this area, in keeping with my objective of ensuring that a remedial service is made available to every national school in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister will agree that every child has the right to be given an opportunity to fulfil his or her academic potential. Why will he not give higher priority to ensuring that children most in need of teaching assistance get it from a remedial teacher?  At present 704 schools are still without the service of a remedial teacher.  Will the Minister commit himself to a timetable to ensure that every primary school will have a remedial teaching service for mathematics and reading?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I took up office I stated that is my number one priority.  The difficulty has been caused by an intermittent commitment to addressing this problem over the years.  During the past five or six years 40 or 50 remedial teachers may have been appointed in one year and none the following year.  There was a stretch of two years when not one additional remedial teacher was appointed.  If we have strategic objectives for primary school teaching, we should aim to achieve them.  Every school should have access to a remedial resource.  At present there are approximately 700 schools that do not have access to that service.  Addressing that problem is a priority.  I signalled disadvantaged schools and the provision of the home-school liaison scheme as priority issues.  The home-school liaison scheme has been a great success story, but it suffered historically because no resources were allocated to it for a number of years.  I have no difficulty committing myself to a timetable and a target of providing a remedial resource to every child in the country.  From here on in we will consider case loads of approximately 30 pupils.  The circumstances will be governed by the location of small rural schools, the category into which many <Col N="1268" /> of the schools that do not have access to a remedial resource fall.  When we reach that stage the journey will not be over.  I do not want to hog the time allocated for this question and I will give way to the other Deputies offering.</P>

Will he clarify if it will be announced in the budget that it will be this year or will it be over two years?  What is the problem with making available to the House the full review of the remedial education scheme?  I have had to seek that information by way of the Freedom of Information Act.

I am not in a position to pre-empt what will happen later today.  I set a timetable at the INTO conference last year in that I said I hoped to ensure every school will have access to a remedial resource within two years.

We have two schools with over 900 pupils that have only one remedial resource.  We have to advance step by step.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I rise in awe in the presence of a saintly Minister.  It is something new in this House.  Is the reality that the Minister is dealing with teachers who do not exist?  Making a priority of remedial teachers, which I support, is very important but has the Minister enough teachers to do that?  Has he enough teachers to reduce the pupil teacher ratio, which would make a big difference?  The demand for remedial teachers might not be as important if one had smaller classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister already mentioned the fact that schools have secured remedial teachers in recent years, but I want to highlight the fact that it is only a token remedial teacher for 600 pupils.  I know of one example where six schools have one remedial teacher between them, so one school has to drop out every second week in order to share the teacher around all six schools.  That is a nomadic form of remedial teaching.  Will the <Col N="1269" /> Minister be specific and say how he sees remedial teaching developing?  What we have at the moment is not remedial teaching, but a gesture. Has the Minister got enough teachers to reduce the pupil teacher ratio, which would be a help in teaching normal classes?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised the issue of teacher supply which is a key one in terms of my objectives for improving staffing in schools, including remedial teachers and other categories. A number of months ago I outlined my initiatives regarding teacher supply.  The matter was actively raised by the INTO prior to last Easter's conferences, particularly in relation to substitution days.  There is a question later from Deputy Gilmore on the issue of teacher supply.</P>
      <P>We literally packed the teacher training colleges this September and 1,000 places will be provided between full-time undergraduate courses and 18 month conversion courses.  Within 18 months we will have an additional number of teachers within the system.  We are also negotiating with the University of Limerick with a view to providing a one year conversion programme for those who have completed the higher diploma in education.</P>
      <P>We have also reached agreement with St. Mary's in Belfast that anyone with Irish in the B.Ed. course there will automatically qualify as a primary school teacher in the Republic.  Prior to this they had to do an exam here, following the completion of their course.  We have a range of initiatives and have packed the teacher training colleges with 1,000 places to try to meet the expected growth in appointments.  Last year 600 primary teachers retired, which is 200 more than the previous year.  It is anticipated that 600 will retire in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to isolated rural schools that have been mentioned by other Deputies, has the Minister explored the possibility of taking on retired teachers &mdash; whether they retired early or in the normal way &mdash; on a part-time basis?  In some instances, if there was a retired teacher resident in an area it would be much more cost effective to pursue that avenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very good point.  We will be making provision in future for part-time hours. To some extent, the post by post approach has <Col N="1270" /> certain rigidities about it, whereas if you can have a framework whereby part-time provision can be made, it can be easier to deal with schools in rural areas.  Some schools use retired teachers for substitute purposes.  That is a possibility, particularly in the next year or two when there will be teacher supply difficulties.  Deputy O'Shea is correct in saying that and I would not have a particular difficulty with it.  I hope that by providing hours it will facilitate schools.</P>
      <P>This also concerns the issue of one teacher schools.  Where we are appointing second teachers it could be argued that both teachers in what was formally a one teacher school &mdash; I am giving Deputy Ring his cue &mdash; could suffice in terms of the remedial needs of that school.  As we appoint the additional teacher to one teacher schools I think that should suffice.</P>

If we had a uniform method of teaching reading to pupils we would not require the number of remedial teachers we have.

Second, over 30 special children in mainstream education in County Roscommon have no remedial resource.  Will the Minister consider allowing these children to be on two roll books &mdash; one day a week at a special school and four days a week in a mainstream school?

      <P>Once again, I want to draw the attention of the Minister to two small primary schools in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  They were part of a group but were left out when the overall group got facilities.  One of those schools has a major remedial need, yet it was completely ignored.  I support the proposal made by Deputy O'Shea that schools like that should be catered for by a part-time teacher, if necessary, to get <Col N="1271" /> over this crisis.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am heartened by the contributions which illustrate a consensus in the House that remedial teaching is the number one priority of most Deputies.  I have heard that before in the House.  It is important in terms of policy formulation and the priorities that I and the Department attach to these issues.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Timmins's point, reading is obviously essential.  While there are different methodologies and approaches, reading is extremely important in infant classes.  For the first time ever this year, on top of the capitation grant of £10, we are facilitating a capital grant for infant classes, which will allow teachers to buy equipment and materials.  The key to literacy is greater availability of books and easier access to reading materials.  We can do more for schools and teachers in terms of helping children develop their reading ability.</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned special needs.  We have already announced an initiative on special needs whereby, for the first time, child care assistants can be appointed to national schools in respect of children with special needs, as a right. That initiative was basically about automatic entitlements for children with special needs, both to a basic staffing schedule and child care assistants. About six weeks ago we announced that we had appointed 90 child care assistants to special schools under that initiative.  We have received a number of applications from national schools for posts in respect of children with special needs.</P>
      <P>On the issue of dual enrolments, I do not know the case to which the Deputy refers.  It is an issue that has arisen recently.  It has not been the practice in the Department to allow for dual enrolment. However, I am sympathetic to the concept where it facilitates the integration of children into the mainstream.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Crawford's point on the schools in Cavan and will have the matter checked again.</P>

      <P>The Green Paper, Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning, was launched on 24 November 1998 and copies have been issued to second and third level educational institutions and to all other interested parties.  It is intended to have a wide-ranging consultation process and debate which will enable my Department to define its priorities and to plan the development of the sector in a White Paper.  The specific details have not yet been finalised but the consultation process will include a number of seminars hosted by my Department, a request for submissions and observations from interested parties and meetings with all key interest groups.  This process is expected to be completed in about six months.</P>
      <P>A White Paper will be prepared and published on completion of the consultation process.</P>

      <P>Organisations such as Aontas, NALA and organisations involved on the community side will be invited.

      <P>The Minister will be aware that the range of adult education that takes place in the State as a whole far exceeds the range of adult education supported by the Department of Education and Science.  My recollection is that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs may have a bigger budget in that regard than the Department of Education and Science.  It certainly did in the past.  Is it proposed to invite community development organisations which clearly have a role in adult education, at an informal level at least, to these consultation seminars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very well acquainted with the range of people involved in the adult education sphere.  It is my intention to invite all the main actors, whatever area they are attached to, be it the community or the second level education system or otherwise.  I envisage that the consultation process will take about six months.  After that we will prepare a White Paper.  The preparation process will not take very long &mdash; six to eight weeks <Col N="1273" /> at most &mdash; because the groundwork has already been done.  The White Paper will be an amended version of the Green Paper, depending on what we hear and what we agree during the consultation process.</P>

      <P>The national qualifications framework was flagged as an immediate priority. When will it be introduced?  Will it require legislation? If so, when will this legislation be published? Has the Minister assessed the cost of establishing local adult education boards?  When will these be established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>The national qualifications authority will require legislation.  That legislation will, it is hoped, be introduced in the next session, based on the Teastas report.  As to the cost of the local adult education boards, I have not assessed that for the simple reason that no final decision has yet been made on how it will be delivered locally.  That is put forward as a Government proposal but it is subject to consultation.  We will be listening to what people say about the structure. The fact that we are engaged in a consultation process and moving on to produce a White Paper does not mean we intend to stand still.  We are proposing many things, for example, a comprehensive literacy strategy.  The structures, however, will have to await the outcome of the detailed consultation process.</P>

      <Quest>the number of in-service training days provided to date; the value and volume of audio materials and equipment provided to date to the 250 primary schools involved in the pilot foreign language programme; and if his attention has been drawn to the serious criticism of the adequacy of the planning undertaken for this initiative.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning for the pilot project in modern languages started in late 1997.  Schools were selected from over 1,000 applicants, a consultative group made up of the partners in education was set up, project leaders were appointed by advertisement and interview, an education centre was chosen to administer the project and initial training was provided for the project leaders.  Teaching of the pilot project commenced in 270 primary schools on 1 September 1998. Approximately 120 of these schools teach French, 80 German, 50 Spanish and 20 Italian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seven project leaders have been appointed to support the project.  Their tasks are to discern the in-service needs of project teachers in the areas of language proficiency and teaching methodologies and to design and implement in-service programmes to respond to those needs.  They advise teachers on choice of teaching materials.  They also advise school principals on the time-tabling of the project.  The project leaders are constantly <Col N="1274" /> available to teachers at the end of a telephone or fax line.</P>
    <P>To date, the project leaders have held 24 meetings nationwide for all those involved in the project, chairpersons of boards of management, principals, class teachers and language teachers.  In addition, project leaders have made individual visits to 126 schools.  By mid-January 1999, a one-day initial in-service programme will have been given in 33 venues to approximately 350 teachers. This in-service training will be held in the target language of the teachers attending and will include provision of teaching materials.</P>
    <P>Lists of resource materials, including multimedia materials, have been sent to schools.  A sum of £87,800 has been paid out in grants to participating schools for the purchase of resources.  I have received many congratulatory messages on my initiative in this important project which has been broadly welcomed by schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Time-tabling presents a huge difficulty for teachers.  Would the Minister not agree to give them time off, say two weeks, to train, because a huge number of teachers are unable to develop skills to match the computer technology now being developed in schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to language programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to language development as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The feedback so far seems to suggest that schools are happy with the arrangements. I will look at the situation again in the light of the Deputy's comments.  So far the feed-back from the school authorities has been positive and some very interesting work has already been done.  Certain schools need more support, but that is a fact of life generally.  Some schools are more pro-active than others, while some tend to wait around until the entire resource kit is provided. Some schools might have thought there would be automatic staffing supports.  That is not what the project is about.  It is about the development of languages within the curriculum.</P>
      <P>The fact that the number of teachers is small relative to other in-service training programmes allows for fairly intensive work on methodology which is very important when introducing languages at an earlier age.  We are keeping the matter under constant review.  If there are difficulties, we will remedy them.  If the Deputy has in mind a particular situation that gave rise to his question, I will be glad to meet him to discuss it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it extraordinary that three months into the school year in-service training is only now being put in place for a project initiated in 1997?  Surely it would have been logical to have all the teachers trained in advance of the commencement of the school year.  Why was there such an extraordinary <Col N="1275" /> delay in appointing the project leaders for a start-up date in September?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>

      <P>Some?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a lot.  I have a full list here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>No courses were held before September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we get this right because when one rushes into a project one can make a hames of it.  In terms of the recruitment of staff and project leaders one has to go through a proper procedure, there have to be public advertisements, a proper interview process and so on to get the right people to do the job. The feed-back from the schools has been very positive so far and I am reasonably satisfied with progress to date.</P>
      <P>I hope the scheme can be expanded in the near future because it is very important.  I am concerned, for example, that not enough students are studying Spanish and Italian.  The number of students leaving second level education with Spanish and Italian is extremely low even though Spanish is the language of a huge proportion of the world's population.</P>
      <P>This is a matter which should be kept under review, although I am satisfied with progress to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Was a cash grant recently made to the schools participating in the scheme?  On what basis were the grants calculated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant was related to the number of pupils and specific amounts were allocated per pupil.  I can forward the details of the calculations to the Deputy.  They were worked out by the project leaders with individual schools.  The needs had to be determined on an individual basis, taking account of scale and other matters.</P>
      <P>This is not an across the board cash grant but is related to effective delivery of the programme. It is not a case of setting up a pilot project and the schools rush in to get extra teachers and money.  It is based on what is appropriate to the way the schools do these things.  Broadly speaking, however, the amounts related to the number of pupils being catered for and a broad range of schools, in terms of size, was selected.</P>

      <P>When one is 50 miles out at sea it is hardly the time to start learning to use a compass.  The starting date for teaching young children foreign languages was September. Would the Minister agree that not providing in-service training in advance was poor planning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an extremely poor performance by Deputy Bruton and his colleagues in the <Col N="1276" /> last Government that they did not bother to introduce a pilot programme on continental languages in primary schools.  This is the first time a Government has supported and provided resources for primary schools to introduce continental languages.  More must be done to achieve language competency in schools.  Eventually, I hope to see the introduction of Asian languages in primary and secondary schools to achieve a truly modern competency in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal aims of the budget are to sustain a vibrant economy, to maintain social inclusiveness, to effect major personal tax reform and to plan for the longer term.</P>
      <P>There is no denying that our present economic position is satisfactory.  However, success brings its own problems.  I am lucky enough to be the first Minister for Finance in more than 50 years to bring in an overall budget surplus.  It is not surprising that the very mention of budget surplus has disturbed the economic discipline and restraint which underpin the conditions that led to the budget surplus in the first place.</P>
      <P>Fairness demands that we should use this opportunity to benefit those who have not done as well as most of us in recent years, in particular, the old and the lower paid.  However, in delivering fairness we must not abandon prudence. We must remember that the world economy is in a volatile state.  The open nature of our economy and the high level of foreign investment here are reminders that economic booms do not last forever.</P>
      <P>Neither should we allow our success to blind us to the fact that we still have a large national debt. It would be foolish in the extreme not to use this opportunity to reverse our previous habit of simply adding to it year after year.  We must maintain low inflation and competitiveness in the new policy environment that EMU will bring when the euro starts next month.  As a society, we must accept that this will be a new world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must maintain social partnership, the co-operation between all sections of the community for the common good.  We must expand our capital investment to meet the considerable infrastructural needs of a rapidly growing economy.  We must take advantage of our current favourable economic and budgetary conditions to reduce the <Col N="1278" /> net debt burden further and to prepare for challenges that lie ahead in the next century.</P>
    <P>The proportion of our population in the older age groups will rise steeply in the decades ahead. We have to consider how we should make provision now for the obligations arising from this which will face us in the next century.  We have time to prepare for this now.  I look forward to considering the forthcoming reports of the commission on public service pensions and the working group on the pre-funding of social welfare pension costs.  We have an obligation to plan ahead in the long-term national interest and I have been conscious of this in preparing my budget.</P>
    <P>This has been the fifth successive year of strong economic growth.  The general Government budget surplus will be close to 2 per cent of GDP compared with the budget target of 0.3 per cent. This reflects additional tax receipts of £900 million on foot of the improved economic activity.  It also reflects, as regards the Central Fund, an outturn for 1998 at £3,436 million or £33 million more than the budget estimate.  This forecast outturn includes provision for an additional £107 million contribution to the EU budget and an increase of £149 million in the assets of the capital services redemption account going into 1999.</P>
    <P>There are clearly some pressures in the economy which must be watched closely and tackled. First, I am concerned at the acceleration in pay increases this year.  Second, I am unhappy at the scale of domestic price increases.  Maintaining low inflation has been a key factor in the strategy underlying this budget.  Third, labour shortages are emerging in certain sectors and, fourth, the very rapid increase in house prices continues to be a cause for concern.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the taxation and expenditure measures I am proposing, the 1999 budget targets are as follows: a current budget surplus in excess of £2.3 billion, a capital budget deficit of more than £1.4 billion, an Exchequer surplus of £925 million and a general Government surplus of 1.7 per cent of GDP.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer pay and pension bill increased by more than 10 per cent in 1997 and is expected to increase by a further 9 per cent in 1998.  By the end of this year it will be nearly double what it was in 1989.  Increases in pay rates have added 60 per cent to the pay bill, whereas aggregate inflation over the same period was 30 per cent. This rate of increase cannot continue.  The Taoiseach raised this problem in his address to the social partners last July and he has recently invited ICTU and its public services committee to commence discussions on the issues involved.  I expect these talks to get under way in the near future and I believe the outcome will be extremely important in terms of negotiating a possible successor to Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Control of Public Spending.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government's programme includes a commitment to limit the growth in net current spending <Col N="1279" /> to 4 per cent a year over the lifetime of the Government.  The overriding aim of the Government's consideration of current expenditure in 1999 has been to ensure that this 4 per cent is respected.  Taking account of the additional spending I am announcing today, the average annual increase in total net current spending is 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Inclusion.</i>
    </P>
    <P>In Partnership 2000, the Government agreed to allocate, over three years, an additional £525 million for current spending on social inclusion.  Taking the announcements I am making today into account, the total amount delivered over the three years 1997-9 will be close to £1 billion in full year terms.</P>
    <P>The economic success we are currently enjoying does not benefit everybody in our society equally.  The Government is committed to creating conditions to ensure this success continues. At the same time, real progress has to be made on social inclusion.</P>
    <P>My philosophy regarding social exclusion and poverty is quite simple.  To be in a position to make progress means the Exchequer having adequate moneys, distributing these resources to the most deserving and ensuring the resources applied are effectively used for those who need them.  The overriding goal must be &mdash; the services are for those who need them.</P>
    <P>The social welfare improvements which I am about to announce will cost £155 million in 1999 and more than £287 million in a full year.  This is the biggest social welfare package ever granted by a Government of this country and includes special provision for low income farmers.  In addition to this package, I am happy to announce arrangements to pay pensions for certain previously ineligible self-employed persons and to pay arrears for certain late contributory pension claims costing about £23 million in 1999.  I am also announcing other social inclusion measures which will cost £58 million in 1999 and £91 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>SOCIAL WELFARE</P>
    <P>
      <i>Older People</i>
    </P>
    <P>In last year's budget I announced substantial increases in the personal social welfare rates for all older people.  Today, I am delivering a substantial additional instalment on this Government's pensions commitment.  I am happy to announce an increase of £9 per week for a pensioner couple.  This is made up of an increase of £6 per week in the full personal rate of old age and related pensions and of £3 per week for qualified adults.  As a result, the weekly payment to a couple both aged over 66 years getting a contributory old age pension will increase to £148.90 next year, an increase of £15.50 per week in my two budgets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" />
      <i>Welfare Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>In general, other personal social welfare rates will be increased by £3 per week and qualified adult allowances will be increased by £2 per week.  Additional increases are being provided on the personal rates for those in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance thus bringing social welfare rates for all categories up to at least the minimum recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  These improvements also reflect undertakings given in the context of Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child Benefit</i>
    </P>
    <P>Another priority of this budget is to assist families with dependent children.  From September next, child benefit rates for first and second children will be increased by £3 per month and by £4 per month for third and subsequent children. These increases will result in monthly payments of £161 for four children families.</P>

        <i>Family Income Supplement</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Family income supplement has been recognised as a valuable support for families in low paid work.  In my budget last year, I honoured a commitment in Partnership 2000 to calculate entitlement to FIS on a net as opposed to a gross income basis.  On this occasion, I am increasing the weekly income limit by £8.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Farmers</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition that many farmers' incomes have been badly affected this year by a combination of bad weather and falling prices, I am providing for a revamping of the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme at a full year <Col N="1281" /> cost of £15 million.  The details of the new arrangements will be included in the 1999 Social Welfare Bill.  I have also provided substantial additional funds for farming in the 1999 Estimates. An additional £25 million was allocated for on-farm investment programmes.  I am allocating £110 million for headage payments next year and I have also allocated £2 million to allow the reopening of installation aid.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Improvements</i>
    </P>
    <P>Various other improvements within the social welfare code relating to voluntary, community and family services, as well as to employment and education supports, are set out in the summary of 1999 budget measures.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Live Register</i>
    </P>
    <P>A little more than two years ago, the live register was heading towards 300,000 despite the improving economic climate.  The numbers now stand at less than 210,000.  There is little doubt that more active management of the live register has made a significant contribution.  Furthermore, the employment action plan initiated by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is proving very effective. Although the plan is only operating for a relatively short period, the initial results are, to put it mildly, quite dramatic.  The Government is concerned that only those available for, capable of and genuinely seeking work should appear on the live register.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Total Social Welfare Spending</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a result of the measures I have just announced, total spending by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs next year is estimated at about £5.1 billion, an increase of 6.6 per cent on expected spending on 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Labour Market Social Inclusion Measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is no reason we cannot achieve further substantial employment growth.  To do so we must ensure the unemployed have adequate skills, training and assistance to gain employment. I am proposing, therefore, a number of measures at a cost of £11.75 million which take account of these factors; the details are in the summary of 1999 budget measures.  These changes seek to get the long-term unemployed and lone parents on to skills training courses, which have the best results in gaining employment.  These measures, along with the jobs clubs for which I am also making provision, amount to more than 8,000 additional labour market programme places.</P>
    <P>I am also allocating an additional £15 million capital spending for the provision of upgrading of FÁS training and community enterprise facilities in areas of significant urban unemployment bringing the total to £21.7 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health and Children</i>
    </P>
    <P>Taking account of today's measures, total gross <Col N="1282" /> expenditure on health in 1999 will be £3.549 billion compared with £3.215 billion in 1998 &mdash; an increase of £334 million.  This compares with health spending of £2 billion as recently as 1993.</P>
    <P>The Government has already responded to the pressures on the health services in the provisions made in the abridged estimates volume published last month.  I allocated an extra £264 million for gross spending including additional provision for various medical services such as the acute hospitals, the cancer and cardiac strategies, the opening of new hospital theatres and wards, the improvement of the safety of blood products, nursing home and other services for older people, child care, mental handicap, bringing the total spending in this area to more than £275 million, physical disability programmes and dental services. In today's budget I propose to increase health spending even further.  An additional gross current spending allocation of £45.5 million is being provided for further improvement in services including the hospital waiting list initiative, services for the elderly and mental handicap services. Details will be announced by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Together with the impact in 1999 of the 1998 Supplementary Estimate, this will bring the increase in spending over the Abridged Estimates Volume allocation to £70 million.  I have also allocated a total of £525 million for a capital spending programme in the health area for the next three years.  This compares with spending of £400 million in the three years 1996-8.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Medical Card</i>
      </P>
      <P>In addition to the measures of particular benefit to the elderly which I have already announced, I am also pleased to announce, in the context of the forthcoming UN International Year of Older Persons, that the income guidelines used to establish medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 years and over will be doubled over the next three years, beginning with an increase of one third in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This will cost an estimated £3 million in 1999.  Of today's health increases, £29.6 million are in the social inclusion area.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Education</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional money provided today will increase spending on education in 1999 to £2.623 billion, an increase of over 9 per cent on the provision for 1998.  The Government is committed to improving opportunity at all levels of education because we see it as a key element in developing children and promoting social inclusion.  The published Estimates already provide £205 million more than was provided in 1998 and allow for <Col N="1283" /> the largest increase in direct funding of primary schools in the history of the State.  In addition, they provide for significant teaching and child care assistant resources to assist children with special educational needs.  I am today allocating significant extra funding to education initiatives relating to disadvantage.  These additional initiatives, costing £19 million in a full year, will address, for example, the problems of adult literacy, the need to encourage children to complete second level, and the development of the psychological services.</P>
    <P>Another important improvement being provided for is the retention of teachers in second level schools who might otherwise be redeployed to provide increased remedial services.  This will give a substantial increase in the remedial service and will be focused on pupils with particular needs.  I am also providing an additional £1.5 million for the development of the youth service on top of the published provision of £13.3 million. The details of these initiatives will be announced by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.  I believe that the total allocation to education in 1999 demonstrates clearly that the Government is determined to ensure that education remains a key priority.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Housing</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government is concerned about the difficulties many people, particularly those on low incomes, are experiencing in relation to housing at the present time.  In order to help address this, Exchequer support for the local authority and social housing programmes was set at £269 million in 1999, up £45 million or 20 per cent on this year.  The increased funding will, among other things, allow 600 extra local authority &ldquo;starts&rdquo;, to bring the number of units next year to 4,500, the highest level of local authority housing since 1986.</P>
    <P>Almost £28 million of the £269 million has been made available for the redevelopment and refurbishment of local authority housing in Dublin, including the continued redevelopment of Ballymun and a new five year project for the redevelopment of the deprived areas in inner city Dublin. The allocation to local authorities for hostels for the homeless has doubled from £2 million to £4 million on the previous year's Estimate.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Disabled Person's Grant</i>
      </P>
      <P>To meet the increasing needs of people with disabilities, I am increasing the provision for the disabled person's grant scheme.  This extra budget provision of £3 million in 1999 will bring spending on the scheme to £8.5 million next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" />
      <i>Capital Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am today allocating £2.308 billion for capital expenditure in 1999 &mdash; an increase of about 30 per cent over the 1998 outturn.  We must address the large infrastructural gap which still exists between this country and other EU countries with comparable levels of income.  Closing this gap will require very substantial investment over a number of years &mdash; against the background of reduced EU Structural and Cohesion funding. This investment is essential if the growth potential of our economy is to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Preparations for the National Development Plan 2000-2006 have commenced.  The amount of EU resources available for funding the country's development needs will decline in the post-1999 period.  Notwithstanding this, the Government is determined that the next plan will be structured and resourced to assist more balanced regional economic development, while also addressing national priorities such as infrastructural bottlenecks and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>In the published 1999 summary public capital programme, I budgeted for an increase of 27 per cent on voted capital expenditure and I am making a further allocation of £92 million available in the budget for investment.  The measures involved are set out in the Summary of 1999 Budget Measures.  However, I would specifically like to mention three important items.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rural Water Programme and Rural Depopulation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Rural depopulation is a serious problem.  One way in which it can be alleviated and more people encouraged to settle outside the larger urban areas is by improving the infrastructure of small rural towns and villages.  As part of the Government's effort to address this problem, I am allocating £50 million over the next three years to improve water and sewerage infrastructure in rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies:</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Two programmes are involved. The first is designed to upgrade water facilities in small rural towns and villages.  The second programme will be directed towards improving water quality in private group schemes.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Public Private Partnerships</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, I announced that the Government would be proceeding, on a pilot basis, with a number of public private partnership projects. My Department is working in consultation with other Departments to identify suitable projects. A number of projects are being considered.  One of these is a major new venture in international telecommunications.  There is an urgent need to develop Internet links between Ireland and major business centres in the US and Europe.  I am therefore providing £12 million in 1999 to support the establishment of a public-private partnership which will build a new high capacity Internet link <Col N="1285" /> into Ireland.  The Government will work in partnership with Irish and international telecommunications companies.  As the private sector becomes more involved, public sector involvement will be reduced.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Year 2000</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government has been actively addressing the year 2000 problem, which can arise with computers and other equipment.  An interdepartmental committee has been addressing the matter, and Departments have been reporting to Government on the steps they are taking to deal with it and on the progress being made in achieving compliance.  However, the full scale of the problem in relation to embedded systems, which are common in the health area in particular, and the costs of dealing with it are not yet fully known. However, they could be large.  The matter can be dealt with to a degree by the normal process of replacing equipment funded by allocations already made in the 1999 Abridged Estimates. However, it is prudent to provide more in case that course proves insufficient.  I am therefore creating a contingency fund of £40 million for this purpose which will only be drawn upon if I am satisfied that it is essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision for the fund will be included in the Revised Estimates Volume.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Overall Capital Increase</i>
      </P>
      <P>The cost of these and other capital measures will add a further £92 million to the capital allocations announced in the Estimates, bringing the total to £2.308 billion in 1999 and giving an increase in voted capital expenditure in 1999 of 30 per cent over the latest 1998 outturn.  I am confident that the extra capital measures announced today will further enhance the economy's capacity to sustain continued economic and social development over the longer term.  In fact, the total Exchequer capital investment for 1999 represents an underlying increase of £900 million or 65 per cent over the 1997 level.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Northern Ireland</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is continuing energetically to pursue the implementation of all aspects of the British-Irish Agreement.  We confidently expect that agreement will very shortly be reached with the Northern parties on the six or more areas in which North-South implementation bodies are to be established &mdash; we expect and believe that, taken together, these will be significant and valuable public bodies.  Detailed work on their functions and structures will then be urgently required to enable them to be established early next year, alongside the other institutions envisaged in the Agreement, including the North-South Ministerial Council.  As soon as all the relevant details have been clarified, I will ensure that the <Col N="1286" /> resources necessary for their successful operation are made available.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TAXATION</P>
    <P>Taxation is fundamentally a matter of political choice.  The individual election manifestos of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats set out clearly and unequivocally our preferences. Despite opposition from many quarters &mdash; not just the parties opposite &mdash; the people democratically decided the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my first budget last year, I intend to deliver over the five budgets of this Government the tax proposals as agreed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. I have said repeatedly &mdash;<i>ad nauseam</i> to some &mdash; that high rates in many areas of taxation &mdash; corporation, personal, capital and inheritance &mdash; lead to disincentive, evasion and lower yield to the Exchequer which ultimately constrains a Government from implementing progressive social policies to which we all subscribe.  The cry from the opponents of this view is best summarised as follows: they would prefer less economic activity which would mean no money to implement such policies.  I do not subscribe to that view.</P>
      <P>PERSONAL TAXATION</P>
      <P>
        <i>Income Tax</i>
      </P>
      <P>Under Partnership 2000 the Government agreed to provide £900 million for personal tax reductions over the three years 1997-9.  Taking account of the reductions I am announcing, the total amount provided is almost £1,500 million. The Government is committed to reducing the burden of personal taxation to reward effort and improve the incentives to work.</P>
      <P>Last year, I described my budget as the first in a series of five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is optimism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I delivered substantial tax relief to all taxpayers through a broadly-based package, concentrating particularly on cuts in the standard and the top tax rates.  This year I am concentrating on a major reform of the tax system to remove as many people as possible from the tax net and maximise the incentive to work.  The full year value of the main personal reliefs I am about to announce is £581 million.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Tax Credits</i>
      </P>
      <P>Last year I indicated that I had an open mind on the conversion of the basic income tax allowances into tax credits at the standard rate.  The special working group on tax credits under Partnership 2000 has continued its work on addressing the practical and policy aspects of such a move.  The attractions of such a move are clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> It would enable more resources to be devoted to those on lower incomes for a given Exchequer cost.  It would do this by equalising the value of the personal tax allowances to all taxpayers at the standard rate of tax.  In such a system every £1,000 of an allowance would be worth £240 to each taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that we should make a determined attempt to improve the position of the lower paid in this budget and remove as many taxpayers on low income from the tax net as is prudently possible.  I am happy to announce that the Government has decided to move towards a tax credit system by standard-rating the basic single and married personal allowances and the PAYE allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Changes in Allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>The changes I am making can best be looked at in two parts: first, standard-rating the existing basic single and married personal allowances and the PAYE allowance and widening the standard band to offset the effect of this; and, second, providing for a substantial increase in the standard-rated personal allowances and an increase in the standard-rated PAYE allowance.  The current single personal allowance is £3,150 per annum, with £6,300 for a married couple.  The PAYE allowance is £800.  I am proposing to standard-rate and increase these allowances as follows: the single personal allowance by £1,050 per annum, that is, from £3,150 to £4,200; the married personal allowance by £2,100 per annum, that is, from £6,300 to £8,400; and the PAYE allowance by £200 per annum, that is, from £800 to £1,000.</P>
    <P>The present tax bands are £10,000 for a single person and £20,000 for a married couple.  I am proposing to increase the bands as follows: for a single person from £10,000 to £14,000; and for a married couple from £20,000 to £28,000.</P>
    <P>In the history of Irish budget tax changes, these are major innovations.  The changes in allowances will result in standard-rated personal allowances for single persons on PAYE of £5,200 per annum. The effect of this, among other things, will be to ensure a single person on PAYE will not pay tax on income below £100 a week.  It also means that more than 80,000 taxpayers will be removed from the tax net and that the number of taxpayers on the marginal relief system, who face a marginal income tax rate of 40 per cent, will fall from the current level of 82,000 to just over 24,000.  For a married couple with one earner and two children on PAYE on the average industrial wage, income tax will reduce by £10 per week.  Under the current system a single person begins to pay tax at £79 per week.  Under the changes I am announcing, such an individual will pay no tax on income below £100 per week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>About time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of these changes, the basic single and married personal allowances <Col N="1288" /> will exceed the basic income tax exemption limits for those under 65.  It is not proposed, therefore, to increase the under 65 exemption limits.</P>
      <P>Widows and single parents have a special personal allowance structure and the difficulty of fitting them into a tax credit system has been recognised by the Partnership 2000 working group. Their basic personal allowances will be standard rated and increased in line with everybody else. A more complicated arrangement is needed for their special additional allowances to ensure nobody loses out, particularly in the case of widows with children and lone parents.  The changes proposed are set out in the Summary of 1999 Budget Measures.</P>
      <P>As will be recognised, I am making a major fundamental change in personal taxation in this year's budget.  It is a major and &mdash; yes &mdash; costly step towards a full tax credits system.  It is my intention that my future budgets will complete the changeover to tax credits, but this year's budget change will mark a fundamental departure in personal taxation.  It will herald a major seachange in attitudes to welfare and work for many and will unquestionably improve the incentive to work.  Due to the cost of this major move to focus resources on the lower paid, it is not possible this year to reduce the rates of income tax, but this will be addressed in future budgets.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Health and Employment and Training Levies</i>
      </P>
      <P>I propose to make adjustments to the health and employment and training levies which apply at a combined rate of 2.25 per cent on income over £10,750 per annum.  The employment and training levy of 1 per cent will be abolished from 6 April 1999.  The health levy will be increased from 1.25 per cent to 2 per cent from the same date.  The result is an overall reduction of 0.25 per cent in the amount taxpayers will pay by way of income levies.  The threshold for the payment of the 2 per cent levy will be increased by £500 from £10,750 to £11,250 per annum or from £207 to £217 a week.</P>
      <P>Health care spending has been growing faster than any other area of public expenditure.  It is important for taxpayers to realise the increasing magnitude of Exchequer health spending, projected to cost £3.6 billion for 1999, and that it is their taxes and levies that are paying for this.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Tax Relief for the Elderly</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made a promise in last year's budget to unify the exemption limits for all those aged 65 and over and increase the limits.  I have decided to increase substantially the income tax exemption limits below which those aged 65 and over will not have to pay income tax.  The current limits are £5,000 single and £10,000 married in the case of those aged 65 to 74, and £5,500 single and £11,000 married in the case of those aged 75 and over.  In the case of all those aged 65 and over, the new income tax exemption limits will be £6,500 per annum for single and widowed persons <Col N="1289" /> and £13,000 per annum for married couples.  The new exemption limits represent an increase of up to 30 per cent in the current exemption limits. The change will remove 15,000 elderly persons from the income tax net.</P>
    <P>In addition to these income tax changes I have increased the old age pension by £6 a week to £89 for contributory old age pensions and £78.50 for non-contributory old age pensions and improved the qualifying conditions for medical cards for the elderly.  Last year, I significantly increased the additional tax allowances to blind persons.  This is the centenary year of the National League for the Blind.  I propose accordingly to increase again the personal tax allowance for a blind person from £1,000 to £1,500 per annum and from £2,000 to £3,000 per annum for married couples where both spouses are blind.  This allowance applies in addition to the standard-rated ordinary personal allowances referred to earlier but will continue to be available at the blind person's full marginal tax rate.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Total Cost of Personal Tax Changes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The total cost of these changes to the personal income tax rate structure is £581 million and a breakdown of the cost of the individual components is set out in the Summary of 1999 Budget Measures.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child care</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the growing wish for a recognition of child care needs in the tax system.  The question of child care tax relief raises important and complex issues.  There is the question of equity between parents who stay at home to care for children and those who have to meet additional child care expenses when they go out to work.  There is also the need for a balanced treatment of those who are in the tax system and those who rely on social welfare benefits and for finding the right balance between measures to help towards the cost of child care and measures to improve the supply and quality of child care facilities to meet the growing demand.</P>
    <P>The Government has discussed this area in some detail and proposes to examine the matter further.  In doing so we will take into consideration the recommendations of the Programme 2000 working group on child care which has not yet finalised its report.</P>
    <P>As a means of facilitating and encouraging the supply of child care facilities, the Government has decided that the provision of certain cre che facilities by employers will not be subject to a charge to income tax in the hands of employees as a benefit-in-kind.  Furthermore, the Finance Bill will provide for capital allowances to allow for the write-off of capital expenditure incurred in connection with buildings or premises constructed or used by employers to provide child care facilities for their staff.  This capital allowances <Col N="1290" /> regime will also extend to providers of child care services generally in the community.</P>

        <i>Carers</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Government has also decided that the position of those families providing care in the home for a member of the family should be addressed by extending the terms of the current tax allowance which applies where a person is employed to care for a taxpayer or his or her spouse in the home.  This tax relief, which applies at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate for expenses up to £8,500 per annum, will now be claimable from 6 April next by other family members who employ a carer to look after a totally incapacitated family member.  This extension will widen significantly the scope of the relief which is currently claimed by around 500 taxpayers each year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Job Assist for the Disabled</i>
      </P>
      <P>The new tax initiative I introduced earlier this year to help the long-term unemployed back into employment is generally referred to as the revenue job assist scheme.  To date nearly one thousand claimants have used the scheme to return to work.  I feel that this scheme has met a clear need. The scheme allows for other categories to be assisted over time.  Following consultation with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I have decided that persons with disabilities will be able to avail of the revenue job assist scheme.  The details are in the Summary of 1999 Budget Measures.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Income Tax Year</i>
      </P>
      <P>Earlier this year I set up a special interdepartmental group to propose a plan for the alignment of the income tax year and the calendar year.  The group consulted the social partners and other interested bodies on the proposed change of tax year.  It would be more rational to have the income tax year, like other tax years such as VAT, commence on 1 January.</P>
      <P>I will be bringing my proposals on this to Government shortly.  If it were decided that as from 2001 the income tax year would commence on 1 January instead of 6 April, the year 2000 income tax year in that case would be a transitional year running from 6 April to 31 December 2000.  Consideration would have to be given to the necessary arrangements to ensure a smooth transition.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Film Relief</i>
      </P>
      <P>The existing tax incentives for investment in film making in the State will run out on 5 April next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> The Minister for Arts, Culture, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has recently received a detailed study carried out by an independent consultant. This looks at the operation of the tax incentives from the point of view of the appropriate Government strategy for the development of the film sector and the economic benefits deriving from this. That report is now being examined and in this context a decision will be taken on the future structure of film relief for the Finance Bill, 1999.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Profit Sharing</i>
    </P>
    <P>A number of organisations have called for expanded profit sharing schemes to assist in the promotion of profit sharing and, in this way, more flexible pay structures.  This will be a growing issue post-EMU.  I am not opposed to reasonable proposals in this area.  Indeed, if profit-related pay makes economic sense to employers and employees from a profit and pay point of view, it should need no tax relief from the State to encourage it to be put into practice.  It should also be recognised by all that there are tax planning opportunities in schemes of tax-relieved profit-related pay.</P>
    <P>I have received a proposal to allow the introduction of a tax-relieved save-as-you-earn scheme for employees to acquire shares in their companies. The new scheme involves employees saving for a fixed period to buy shares in their firm on favourable share option terms.  Any gain from the exercise of the share option is free of income tax. I intend to provide for a scheme along these lines in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Investment Accounts</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year, I increased the rate of DIRT on special savings accounts from 15 per cent to 20 per cent but I left the tax rate unchanged on special investment accounts at 10 per cent.  I now propose increasing the 10 per cent rate on these savings products to 20 per cent from 6 April 1999. In addition, I also propose increasing the £50,000 maximum investment limit for special savings accounts to £75,000, which is the limit that already applies to special investment accounts. These changes will bring in £3 million net in a full year.  The full details of these changes and of an anti-avoidance measure in relation to certain accounts are given in the Summary of 1999 Budget Measures.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Corporation Tax</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government will ensure that our corporation <Col N="1292" /> taxation policy acts as a stimulant and not as an impediment to economic growth.  It is for that reason that we have announced a single corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent and cleared this with the EU Commission under State aids rules of the Treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing discriminatory about this policy.  Ireland will remain attractive to foreign investors, not because we will discriminate in their favour, but rather because we will remain attractive to all investors.</P>
      <P>We should make no mistake about the extent to which our economic success is a product of a broad set of policies including taxation designed to stimulate growth and the creation of wealth.  It is a policy that has been successfully and consistently followed by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding our confidence, we must be on our guard against any threat to our ability to sustain this growth.  We must ensure that the concept of harmonising taxes does not become simply a means of increasing them.  Our policy in this regard is fundamental to our economic success. In the past, high levels of taxation led to higher unemployment, no economic growth and mountainous national debt.  It was only when Ireland moved away from this nonsensical policy that we began to see higher growth, more employment and less unemployment, and reducing national debt.</P>
      <P>The agreement arrived at with the EU Commission last July clears the way for the introduction of a single rate of corporation tax on trading income of 12.5 per cent from 1 January 2003 along with a rate of 25 per cent on non-trading income.  It is appropriate following this that the Government should set out now a programme of reductions in the standard rate of corporation tax for the next five years to achieve the 12.5 per cent rate.  Accordingly, the standard rate will be reduced from 32 per cent to 28 per cent to take effect from 1 January 1999.  The existing 25 per cent rate will remain unchanged but will apply to the first £100,000 of profits instead of the first £50,000 of profits as is currently the position.  The full year cost of these changes is £132 million.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to reduce the standard rate of corporation tax for trading income by 4 per cent per annum for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002 and by 3.5 per cent for 2003, giving a 12.5 per cent rate in 2003.  The lower rate on the first £100,000 of profits will be merged with the standard rate at the appropriate time and reduced thereafter in tandem with the standard rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To provide certainty for the business sector, the Summary of 1999 Budget Measures sets out the categories of passive income that will fall to be taxed in the future as non-trading income at the 25 per cent rate.  The 1999 Finance Bill will provide for the necessary legal definitions.  This 25 per cent rate <Col N="1293" /> will apply to all non-trading income of companies for the year 2000 and onwards.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Clawbacks</i>
    </P>
    <P>The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax is being made at a time when the business sector is experiencing significantly increased profits.  The Government is anxious that businesses and owners of capital should continue to make a reasonable contribution to the cost of providing Government services, many of which directly benefit those businesses.  For that reason, the Government will continue to look at the scope for clawbacks from the corporate sector and will examine carefully all tax reliefs and allowances which can be regarded as business reliefs, cutting back on those where necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employers PRSI</i>
    </P>
    <P>No other sector is having a tax reduction programme underwritten for it by Government in the way I have just set out.  The Government believes it right in these circumstances that the ceiling on the 12 per cent employer PRSI rate should be increased to £35,000 from the figure of £30,500 already provided for in the abridged Estimates volume.  This will bring in £37 million in a full year.  The threshold below which the lower 8.5 per cent employer PRSI rate applies will be increased from £14,040 to £14,560 per annum at a full year cost of £13 million.  The net effect of both changes is a yield of £24 million to the State &mdash; not a heavy burden to the corporate sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Withholding Tax on Dividends paid to Individuals</i>
    </P>
    <P>Since owners of capital in the form of shares will benefit from the reduced corporation tax rate on profits, it is right that the Government should accordingly take action to ensure that the tax due on dividends is paid to the Exchequer.  The existing tax credit on dividends will be abolished on and from 6 April next under measures taken in my first budget.  In effect, this means that after 5 April the onus of the payment of tax on dividends received by individuals will rest on self-assessment and income declaration by shareholders.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to introduce on and from 6 April 1999 a withholding tax at the standard rate of income tax on dividends paid to individuals resident in the State and certain non-residents. This tax will have to be deducted from dividends before they are paid out.  Those individual shareholders liable to tax at the higher rate will be required as before to declare their dividend income in their tax returns and to pay the balance of income tax due to the Exchequer.  The proposed system is explained fully in the Summary of 1999 Budget Measures.  It is estimated that the extra yield from the operation of this withholding system will be £15 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Surcharge on Undistributed Corporate Income</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government will continue to examine such <Col N="1294" /> other measures as may be needed to seek a balanced contribution to the national Exchequer from all sectors of the economy.  This also includes the extension of the current surcharge on undistributed corporate income of certain closely held companies.  While the needs of business for retained profits to fund investment are readily acknowledged, this will have to be balanced by concern that corporate structures can be used to shelter income at low rates of tax while postponing its distribution to shareholders.  The need for such surcharges will become more immediate as the standard rate of corporation tax approaches 12.5 per cent.  There will be consultation with business and other sectors before any extension of the current surcharge system is put into effect.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Irish Registered Non-Resident Companies</i>
    </P>
    <P>The problems arising from the use of Irish registered non-resident companies for various unlawful activities has been a cause of concern to the Government for some time.  I am pleased a package of measures under company law and tax law to deal effectively with this problem is now close to finalisation.  The package will be submitted to the Government shortly so that it can be announced with the publication of the Companies (Amendment) Bill in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Retirement Pensions for the Self-Employed</i>
    </P>
    <P>During the course of last year's budget speech and during the Dáil debate on the Finance Bill, 1998, I signalled my clear intention to make changes in the area of pensions for the self-employed.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to bring forward in the next Finance Bill significant changes to the present system to take effect from 6 April next.  The changes I plan will be grounded on the following principles: the self-employed person will not be restricted to the one option on retirement of investing his or her accumulated pension fund net of the tax-free lump sum into a traditional type annuity; the self-employed person will have the option of retaining ownership at all times of the capital sum invested on his or her retirement to provide a retirement income; the self-employed person will also have the option of retaining ownership at all times of the market value of the accumulating fund during the contribution period; and the limits on tax-relieved contributions to be increased substantially from 15 per cent to 30 per cent on a sliding scale basis relating to age, as detailed in the Summary of 1999 Budget Measures.  I see these principles as forming an integrated package.</P>
    <P>There will be appropriate consultation with the Pensions Board and other expert bodies prior to finalising proposals for the Finance Bill.  In the context of the increased contribution limits, it will also be necessary to examine the question of an earnings ceiling.  The cost of the increase in self-employed pension contribution limits is estimated at £18 million in a full year.</P>

      <i>Extension of Deadlines for Various Designated Area Schemes</i>

    <P>In response to representations received from various parts of the country I have decided to extend the existing termination dates for the various designated area tax relief schemes and for the transitional arrangements under the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, dealing with newly-constructed rental property.  Full details are set out in the Summary of 1999 Budget Measures.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rural Renewal Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, I introduced tax incentives for a new pilot rural renewal scheme for the upper River Shannon area earlier this year.  The residential incentives have been in operation since 1 June last and I am awaiting clearance from the EU Commission for the business tax incentives.  When this clearance is given, I will look at the possibility of extending this pilot scheme on a targeted basis to other rural areas.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Relief for the Provision of Student Accommodation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Since July 1992, the special tax relief for the provision of rented residential accommodation has applied only in urban renewal and other designated areas.  I have decided to extend the scope of this scheme beyond these special areas for a limited period to encourage the provision of third level student residences, preferably located on or near a third level campus.  The details will be contained in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Tax Relief for Convalescent Facilities</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose that the incentive capital allowance regime for nursing homes will be extended to the provision of convalescent health-care facilities. The provision of such facilities is aimed at reducing the hospital waiting lists by providing short stay facilities for patients to stay in after operations or intensive hospital treatment.  Further details are set out in the Summary of 1999 Budget Measures.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmer Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am extending the present stock relief arrangements for farmers for a further two years to 5 April 2001.  These arrangements are a general relief of 25 per cent and a special incentive relief of 100 per cent for certain young trained farmers.</P>
    <P>In the case of VAT, the flat rate of VAT which may be charged by unregistered farmers on their sales to registered traders will be increased from 3.6 per cent to 4 per cent from 1 March 1999 at a cost to the Exchequer in 1999 of just over £7 million and nearly £11 million in a full year.  The associated VAT rate for livestock will also increase to 4 per cent from the same date.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Acquisitions Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present, under capital acquisitions tax rules, <Col N="1296" /> all gifts and inheritances taken since 2 June 1982 are aggregated for the purposes of arriving at the rate of tax for a current gift or inheritance.  I now propose that for gifts and inheritances taken on or after today, only those previous gifts and inheritances taken since 2 December 1988 will be taken into consideration for tax purposes.  Bringing forward the date for aggregation in this way will ease the burden of compliance for both the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners.  I am also increasing from 1 January next the annual small gifts exemption limit from £500 to £1,000. This limit was last increased in 1978.  The cost of these changes is estimated at just over £6 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>ENVIRONMENTAL TAX ISSUES</P>
    <P>The issue of green taxes has been the subject of much recent comment.  I propose to take a number of positive steps in that direction in this budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VRT on Cars</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to restructure the VRT rates on cars. The new structure will favour smaller cars by raising the VRT rate on larger cars.  The current VRT rates on cars are 22.5 per cent for vehicles up to and including 2,500 ccs and 28 per cent on vehicles over 2,500 ccs.  I propose that a new three tier structure should be introduced.  The current VRT rate of 22.5 per cent will apply on cars up to and including 1,400 ccs, a 25 per cent rate will apply on cars up to 2,000 ccs, and a 30 per cent rate will apply on all cars over 2,000 ccs.  These changes will bring in £43 million in extra revenue and will apply from 1 January 1999.</P>

        <i>Traffic Related Measures</i>
      </P>
      <P>In addition to the changes in VRT, I propose to take a number of initiatives which have been recommended by various parties to address the growing traffic problem in urban areas.  The House will appreciate that the tax system cannot solve the traffic problem on its own but it can play its part in altering the relative prices of different modes of transport in favour of those that create less pressure on road use and the environment.</P>

        <i>Green Tax Policy</i>

      <P>Tax increases on energy and fuels can reduce emissions and bring about more efficient use of these products.  The revenue raised might also be used to reduce taxation in other areas such as labour. However, increases in the price of energy and fuel adds to inflation and affects those on low incomes.</P>
      <P>We need to put in place an agreed indirect tax policy which will assist us in meeting our international obligations on CO2 emissions.  Such a policy needs the support of all sections of the community as represented by the social partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy:</NameTxt>
      <P>This could place tax revenue and jobs at risk in the betting industry.  While the level of such telephone betting has not impacted so far on excise revenue, the problem is a growing one.</P>
      <P>The current excise tax of 10 per cent brings in £45 million per annum so that it is necessary to take measures to secure that source of revenue. The best way to do so is to reduce the rate of tax to internationally competitive levels.  However, any reduction in the off-course betting tax of 10 per cent has implications for the current on-course levy of 5 per cent which goes directly to the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon.  The latter bodies have in recent years, with the help of substantial Exchequer funding, invested in improved facilities.  Those investments are best protected by larger attendances at meetings.</P>
      <P>I have discussed this matter in some detail with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, who is responsible for the latter bodies.  Arising from these consultations, I propose to cut the 10 per cent off-course betting tax to 5 per cent with effect from 1 July 1999, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food will arrange with the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon to eliminate the present on-course levy of 5 per cent to zero with effect from the same date.</P>

      <P>Although I am of the view that the proposed off-course reduction will increase betting activity, I have made a prudent provision for the cost of this reduction.  I have provided for reductions of £12 million in 1999 and £24 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The net effect of the VRT, LPG, betting tax and tobacco changes will be to raise £32 million in additional revenue in a full year and to add 0.17 per cent to the consumer price index.</P>

        <i>Revenue Powers</i>

      <P>As the House is aware, both Revenue and my Department have been actively reviewing the existing powers which Revenue have in combating tax evasion.  This review involves looking at extra powers in relation to access to bank accounts and the examination of the affairs of banking institutions.  Revenue powers were last added to significantly in 1992, with further additions in 1993 and in 1995.  I have made it clear that all reasonable or necessary measures will be pursued to counter tax evasion.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissions have recently made proposals to me on this and I will examine these in the context of the Finance Bill, 1999.</P>

      <P>Taking account of this contingency provision and the measures I have announced today, the general Government surplus is projected at 1.4 per cent of GDP in 2000 and 1.6 per cent of GDP in 2001.</P>
      <P>I intend to continue to achieve a general Government surplus for as long as economic conditions are favourable.  In the event of significantly less favourable conditions, the necessary action will be taken to comply with the requirements of the EU Stability and Growth Pact.</P>
      <P>FUTURE BUDGETARY PROCESS</P>
      <P>
        <i>Multi-annual Budgeting</i>
      </P>
      <P>Last year I indicated that I would consider the implementation of the final phase of the move to multi-annual budgeting as envisaged in &ldquo;Delivering Better Government&rdquo;.  This involves the Government allocating resources over a three year period covering the main budgetary aggregates of taxation, expenditure and borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> As regards expenditure, I am publishing projections showing expenditure by individual ministerial Vote group for 2000 and 2001 on a no-policy-change basis.  I have also included an amount for allocation above these levels within the overall expenditure envelope specified in the budgetary tables.  I will address the final phase of the move to multi-annual expenditure budgeting which will involve the Government making decisions on the allocation of resources across Vote groups.  Decisions on this issue by the end of the first quarter of 1999 will allow Departments ample time to plan their spending in 2000 and 2001.</P>
    <P>The penchant of Irish politicians and media persons to regularly use the terms &ldquo;radical&rdquo;, &ldquo;reforming&rdquo; and &ldquo;major&rdquo; to describe even the most mundane event has led to the debasing of such political language.  I suggest that the phrases &ldquo;radical&rdquo;, &ldquo;reforming&rdquo; and &ldquo;major&rdquo; might be applied to this budget, especially on the income tax side.</P>

      <P>This is the final budget before Ireland enters EMU.  While EMU will present us with numerous challenges, none of these is insurmountable as long as we continue the prudent policies of recent years.</P>
      <P>My budget today delivers what our country needs in terms of economic and social priorities. I have committed £11.2 billion to social services in 1999, approximately £900 million more than in 1998, to look after the underprivileged and improve public services generally.</P>

      <P>I have allocated £2.3 billion for capital investment to boost our productive capacity.  I have reduced personal taxation.  It is now a fairer system which will increase the incentive to work and avoid excessive wage increases. I have also provided for a significant further improvement in the public finances to prepare for the challenges that lie ahead.</P>

      <P>Days, months and years from now we will reap the rewards.  We will see that on the day when we had the extra few pounds in our pockets, we made the right long-term decisions, and decisions which in time will be seen to have been our only sensible option &mdash; to look at Ireland in the longer term.  I commend the budget to the House.</P>

    <P>(a) This table shows the effects of the implementation of the Budget day measures on the pre-Budgetary position shown in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.</P>
    <P>(b) The Budget Measures have an impact on the economy with changes in consumption and investment patterns etc. leading to additional tax buoyancy.  It is estimated that this buoyancy will result in an additional £125.2 million accruing to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>(c) The net total of non-Budget day revisions (both increases and decreases) to the Estimates.  The main change is on the Vote for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs where the original Estimates have been reduced owing to lower Live Register numbers.</P>
    <P>The original Estimate for the Department of Health has also been adjusted to take account of the cost in 1999 of a Supplementary Estimate in 1998 and additional buoyancy in appropriations in aid.</P>
    <P>(d) Departmental balances are those amounts issued from the Central Fund for departmental spending in one year which remain unspent at year-end and are carried forward to be used in the next year.  They have no effect on departmental spending which is governed by the allocation in the Estimates for Public Services.</P>
    <P>(e) This figure is explained in Table 6 of the Budget 1999 Statistics and Tables.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Notes to Table 1</i>
    </P>
    <P>Note 1.  The projections reflect:</P>
    <P>(a) &mdash; the full year impact of the measures announced in the 1999 Budget;</P>
    <P>&mdash; an overall net current expenditure envelope of 4 per cent per annum for 1999 to 2001 within which expenditure will be managed;</P>
    <P>&mdash; interest rates are based on core eurozone rates;</P>
    <P>&mdash; exchange rates for EMU participant countries are assumed to be the bilateral central rates of the ERM agreed in May last as the basis for conversion to the euro with pro-rata adjustments for other currencies;</P>
    <P>(b) under the taxation heading a technical provision for further possible changes in both 2000 and 2001 in personal taxes costing £350 million in a full year &mdash; the level of tax changes in these years will be subject to review in the light of emerging economic conditions.</P>
    <P>(c) a provision for the cost of reducing Corporation Tax rates by 4 percentage points in each of the years 2000 and 2001;</P>
    <P>The figures for GDP and GGB values for 1998 are the ESA 95 equivalent used for defining GDP and GGB values from 1999 on.  The ESA 79 equivalent value for 1998 GDP is £60,200 million and that for the GGB is £1,172 million &mdash; a surplus of c.2 per cent of GDP.</P>
    <P>Note 2.  Appropriations-in-Aid are Departmental receipts which, with the approval of the Dáil, may be retained by a Department or Office to offset expenses instead of being paid into the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund.  Details of gross voted departmental expenditures are contained in the Estimates for Public Services.  PRSI receipts accrue to the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>Note 3.  Departmental balances are those amounts issued from the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund for departmental spending in one year which remain unspent at year-end and are carried forward to be used in the next year.</P>
    <P>Note 4.  A prudent contingency provision is made against factors outside the control of Government that may impact on the Budget but which cannot be foreseen at this stage.  Examples are variability in tax buoyancy and exceptional costs arising in areas of public expenditure.  While such variations are likely to be both positive and negative, it has been considered appropriate to allow in the projections for a modest negative net impact on the General Government Surplus and Exchequer Surplus.</P>
    <P>Measurement of Expenditure Increases</P>
    <P>Current Departmental Expenditure</P>
    <P>With the introduction of the new Local Government Fund in 1999, £224 million is included in the 1999 Estimates which is not included in 1998 and earlier years.

    <P>As in the case of current Departmental expenditure, there is £178 million included in the 1998 Environment Vote but not in the 1999 Estimate.  To make a proper comparison between 1999 and 1998, the 1998 outturn must be reduced by £178 million. This gives an increase of 30.2% in gross capital expenditure in 1999 over 1998.</P>

    <P>(a) As shown in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.</P>
    <P>(b) The reduction in net expenditure for the Department of Health and Children arises from the decision to increase the Health Contribution rate from 1.25% to 2%.  The resultant increase in appropriations-in-aid on the Vote means that net expenditure is reduced.  Gross expenditure has been increased by £70 million.</P>
    <P>(c) Departmental expenditure net of Appropriations-in-Aid.  These are Departmental receipts which with the agreement of the Dáil may be retained by a Department or Office to offset expenses instead of being paid into the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>(d) Departmental balances are those amounts issued from the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund for departmental spending in one year which remain unspent at year-end and are carried forward to be used in the next year.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Explanation of Net Difference between Exchequer Surplus and General Government Surplus.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer Surplus is the traditional domestic budgetary aggregate which measures Central Government's net surplus or borrowing postion.  It is the difference between total receipts into and total expenditure out of the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>The General Government Balance (GGB) measures fiscal performance of all arms of Goverment, i.e. Central Government, Local Authorities, Health Boards, Vocational Education Committees, non-commerical State-sponsored bodies, as well as Funds such as the Social Insurance Fund which are managed by Central Government Departments.  It thus provides a more accurate assessment of the underlying fiscal performance.  However, it does not reflect the position of commercial State-sponsored bodies as these agencies are classified as being outside the general Government sector.</P>
    <P>The GGB is calculated in accordance with ESA95, a consistent standard, developed by the EU to facilitate budgetary comparisons between EU member states in accordance with their obligations under the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Details of the variation between the Exchequer and the General Government measures is set out in the table below.</P>

      <P>The folksy bit at the end of the Minister's speech gave the game away.  The Minister's admonitions to people to keep a few pounds in their pockets and not to spend highlight the biggest fear the commentators will have about this budget &mdash; the fear of an inflationary consumer boom.  The Minister has not dealt with it by any instrument of policy, but he has covered himself with a bit of folksy pub talk at the end of his speech.</P>
      <P>In just four weeks Ireland will join EMU and the responsibility for monetary policy in Ireland will pass from the Government and the Central Bank to the European Central Bank.  Interest and exchange rate policies for Euroland will be the responsibility of the ECB.  As a consequence, fiscal policy will be the only instrument of policy entirely in the hands of the Government.</P>
      <P>Budget day has always been an important day in the political calendar.  It is now more important than ever because budgetary policy is the only major policy instrument left in the hands of the Government.  In the past, if a budget was either over expansionary or restrictive, the Central Bank could either raise or lower interest rates. If there was a major loss in competitiveness the Government had the option to devalue.  This was done successfully in both 1986 and 1993.  These options are no longer available and a greater responsibility than ever before rests on the shoulders of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>There is also a further difficulty.  The problems facing the main European economies, such as Germany and France, are different from the situation in Ireland.  The interest rate policy, which will be followed by the European Central Bank in 1999, will be designed to cater for the fundamental needs of our European partners which are different from our current needs.</P>
      <P>The Minister has unprecedented and virtually unlimited resources at his disposal today.  His task can be summarised as having a duty to ensure that the economic boom continues and that the country has the capacity to continue to grow so that the resources can be generated to enable the Government to wage war on poverty and disadvantage. There is widespread agreement those were the objectives when the Minister set about the task of compiling this budget.  Today's announcement is the end of a process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effects of the budget can be assessed only by taking the Book of Estimates and the budget together.  In the Book of Estimates the Minister planned to spend an additional £1 billion.  He has added £581 million in a tax package to that today and he has also made extra expenditure announcements in excess of £300 million.  This is an extremely expansionary budget.  It will add significantly to consumer demand at a time when the economy is booming and consumer demand has <Col N="1318" /> been significantly stimulated in the past two months by huge decreases in interest rates.</P>
    <P>The European Central Bank advised the Minister to be prudent.  The Irish Central Bank advised him that tax cuts in the budget should be offset by tax increases elsewhere.  The Minister has ignored all the advice and is now steering a dangerous course.  He is fuelling an economy which is already moving like a bush fire and has taken no counter steps, apart from the folksy advice at the end of his speech, to reduce consumer spending.</P>
    <P>The Minister's first mistake was in the Book of Estimates.  He should have required line Ministers to show savings in programmes of less priority so that funding in programmes of greater priority could have been increased.  He should have dampened down consumer spending and he could have done so without dropping any of the positive elements of the budget or without raising tax.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider two proposals between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill.  In any privatisation programme in 1999, he should offer a significant tranche of shares to the public.  If a significant proportion of potential consumer spending is invested in the shares of privatised State companies rather than in consumer goods or in the housing market, the advantages in calming the economy are obvious. The Minister should soak up consumer spending by issuing tradable paper to the public and not consigning his privatisation programmes to the institutions.</P>
    <P>Another method the Minister could use to soak up additional consumer demand is to raise the ceiling on private pension funds for tax relief purposes from 15 to 20 per cent for young people, up to 25 per cent for middle aged people and from 20 to 30 per cent for those over 55 years of age.  He could justify doing so on the merits of the case, but it would also be a mechanism to dampen down consumer spending.</P>

      <P>In present circumstances it would be better if he could take some consumer spending out of the economy and put it into pension funds, widespread share issues and State companies so that the consumer thrust forward can be reduced and people will have options other than the housing and property markets if they want to invest their savings.</P>

      <P>Nothing that I am suggesting runs counter to anything the Minister may include in the Finance Bill, and he should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister always talks tough about controlling public expenditure but his actions always fall short of his rhetoric.  In this budget he is taking serious risks with the economy, not so much by the measures announced today but by those in <Col N="1319" /> the Book of Estimates.  The increase in current expenditure is well over 8 per cent, year on year. The Minister always seeks to hide what he is actually doing.  He is a master of creative accounting. The House will be familiar with the story of the accountant whose young son asked what was 9 plus 7.  His father replied, &ldquo;What would you like it to be?&rdquo; The Minister's budgetary arithmetic reminds me of this approach.  The only reason I can see for the changes announced in the health and employment levies is to move money around from the two sides of the balance sheet so that the Minister can disguise the fact that he is spending more.</P>
    <P>The Minister is stimulating the economy while, at the same time, not taking sufficient measures to increase the capacity of the economy to grow. The country is running out of workers and a radical income tax policy would increase the labour force.  If the gap between welfare and wages were sufficient, many of the long-term unemployed would return to work.  If the tax regime were more benign and if child minding were more affordable, many married women would return to work.  If the tax take was lower many more emigrants would return to work in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In a total reversal of the policy pursued last year and the tax policy on which the Government fought the last election, the Government has moved to a position pursued by the rainbow Government parties and ICTU.  However, the Minister still has a difficulty in terms of what he is doing with income tax.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at the income tax package in some detail.  Three fundamental changes have been announced.  Personal allowances are being raised and calculated at the standard rate.  People on the standard rate are winners but those on the higher rate are losers.  To compensate losers on the higher rate who will now get their allowances at the standard rate, the Minister proposes to extend the band by £4,000 for single people and £8,000 for married people.  This neutralises the loss experienced by the losers and gives them some additional gain.</P>
    <P>There are minor modifications in levies and an increase of £200 in the income tax allowance to be paid at the standard rate.  That is the totality of what is happening.  There is movement and some commitment to tax credits, and I hope the Minister will move in this direction.  However, it is interesting to look at the overall effect of what the Minister has done.  For example, a single person on PAYE earning £96 per week will gain £2.38. A single person on £135 will gain £3.33 and a person on £192 will gain £4.48. The single person on the average industrial wage will get £6.71.</P>
    <P>The budget summary includes various best case scenarios who will do very well.  I thank the Minister and the Department for giving us this package of useful information to deal with this debate. However, what cannot be disguised is that the Minister set out on the wrong road last year and he is trying to mend his hand today.  He has <Col N="1320" /> mended it to some degree and I welcome him to the position on taxation which we have consistently argued.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very good at averaging measures over two years.  He does so regularly with expenditure figures.  I would like to average what he has done in this budget over two years. Over the two budgets, a single person earning £10,000 will gain £10.24 per week on income tax; a single person on £15,000 will gain £14.59 and a single person on £50,000 will gain £27.42.</P>
    <P>A married couple with two children and one income of £15,000 will gain £18.99 over the two budgets; on £50,000 the gain is £38.67. This shows how wrong the Minister was last year.  Even a more balanced package this year cannot neutralise the inequalities and injustice of last year's budget.  I accept and welcome the fact that the targeting is better this year.  There is a more even spread of benefit to workers across the salary scales, married and single.  However, the Minister was so wrong last year that anyone would have difficulty looking at the benefits over the two budgets.</P>
    <P>At this point I wish to congratulate the rainbow Government, particularly Deputies John Bruton and Quinn.  It was a tremendous achievement in economic management to have such a strong economy that even when it is on automatic pilot in the hands of the present Minister, such significant resources are being produced.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on receipts and expenditure indicated that, going into this budget, the Minister had £937 surplus for every worker.  It is interesting to look at what he did with this surplus. The total benefit for someone on the average industrial wage is £389.  From a surplus of £937 per worker, the Minister has given back £389.</P>
    <P>The White Paper indicated that the surplus per head of population was £400.  Old age pensioners will get an additional £312 out of that £400.  That is not too bad &mdash; it is close to the <i>per capita</i> figure. Every child will get £36 out of the £400.  That is not so good.  That is not focusing on children or child poverty.  An unemployed person, where we are targeting the poor, will get £156 out of the £400 surplus.  Before the Government parties go wild about the budget they should look at these figures.</P>

      <P>The Minister had major opportunities. He has done something significant on income tax and has changed the system. However, there will be no dancing in the streets after this budget.  I hope the Minister's calculation has been precise enough that he does not get into the difficulties I mentioned earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael is committed to the kind of taxation policy which the Minister has introduced.  We believe that the first £120 of income per week for a single person and the first £240 for a married <Col N="1321" /> person should be exempt from tax.  The standard rate band should be extended so that no single person would pay the higher rate on income up to £20,000 and no married couple would pay the higher rate on income less than £40,000.  We announced these proposals earlier this year.  The Minister has moved in the right direction but has fallen seriously short of the targets.</P>
    <P>Making the country more tax friendly so that additional people join the labour force is not enough to keep the economy moving forward. Emigrants will not return if they cannot buy or rent suitable accommodation.  Dublin women will not rejoin the labour force if the only affordable houses are in far flung midland towns.  The excitement of moving from the dole to work will be quickly dissipated after battling to work on Dublin Bus for a week of wet mornings.</P>
    <P>The country does not run on fiscal policy alone, and even if the Minister makes correct decisions, and he has made some today, there is no guarantee of success because other Ministers are not pulling their weight.  The Government is now 18 months in office, and there are at least six Ministers who have yet to take a serious decision, even a bad one.  They seem to think their primary function is to act as public relations officers for their Departments.  There was never an occasion when the country more needed a full team of decisive ministers, ready to plan, able to make decisions and willing to act but we do not have them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has neither a feel for, nor an interest in the needs of public patients. The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation who has made the elimination of drugs from sport his top priority, has left almost £5 million, voted by this House for this very purpose, unspent at the end of 1998 and in a Supplementary Estimate which I saw yesterday he is using these so called savings to pay for overruns in his Department. The Minister for Agriculture and Food has become the bogey man of farming families, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should get an Oscar for his unrivalled representation of the invisible man and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government cannot organise his Department or the local authorities to service sufficient building land in Dublin so that house building can meet the ever rising demand.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's corporation tax initiative and I wish him well.  In last year's budget the Minister introduced a package of measures for both urban and rural renewal schemes, but he has failed to get the EU Commission to agree to it. On Monday, the Minister for Finance was put under some pressure at ECOFIN about the proposed 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate and about the perceived loss to the German exchequer and the exchequers of others of our partners arising from the Irish Financial Services Centre.  I hope the Minister sticks to his guns.  The Rainbow Government proposed a standard rate of corporation tax of 12.5 per cent.  We had secured agreement for this rate but the incoming Government failed in its negotiations because of <Col N="1322" /> a false hope that it could secure agreement to a 10 per cent rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael believes a low corporation tax rate is essential to our economic and social objectives and hopes the Government will continue to defend this policy and will be successful. Europe is all about swings and roundabouts and while we gain on the 12.5 per cent swing we may lose on the roundabout.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is being increased by the perception in Europe that the Irish are now bad Europeans. There is a list of charges laid against us: that our corporation tax regime is predatory and anti-competitive; that the IFSC is a mechanism for tax avoidance; that our position on Partnership for Peace is ridiculous and hypocritical; that we try to extract the last pound from the European taxpayer and want to give nothing back; that we are churlish in our treatment of immigrants from central Europe, even from those countries which we expect will be in the Community before too long; and even that in recent weeks certain of our citizens have been chasing lorries carrying imported lamb around the country and harrying their drivers.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil prides itself on political cuteness. The Government's policy towards Europe is now far too cute, and is so perceived by our European partners.  The Government should quickly mend its hand because the 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax is absolutely fundamental to our prosperity and our industrial policy.  It is the cornerstone of our industrial policy.  Fine Gael put this policy in place when we were in Government but the Minister tried to change the rules and reopen the issue.  I hope he holds firm now when the pressure from our European partners and particularly from the new German finance minister, is endangering the policy.</P>
      <P>The changes in social welfare are not worthy of the term radical.  They are very modest indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one radical proposal which the Minister might have introduced and let us hope his colleague the Minster for Social, Community and Family Affairs may do so in the Social Welfare Bill.  For years the social welfare fund was in deficit but for the past two years it has been in significant surplus.  With the latest CSO figures showing that in the 12 months to April last 95,000 extra persons joined the labour force, it is now time to set up a statutorily based independent social insurance fund.  This would be a radical measure and would have a real impact on the question of funding pensions for PRSI payers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paid work is the best antidote to poverty, but there are always boats that the rising tide will not <Col N="1323" /> lift.  Any attack on poverty should address the needs of the elderly and of children.  Families with large numbers of children are usually less well off and when the head of a household is unemployed they are usually poverty stricken.  The response in the budget to the needs of the poor is half hearted.  There is no radicalism, the increases barely cover inflation and there is very little extra.</P>
    <P>The increase in the old age pension of £6 per week is disappointing.  The signals from the Government before the budget caused me to expect a more significant increase.  Inflation is almost 3 per cent.  An increase of approximately £2.50 is needed to cover that.  The Minister for Health proposes to take an extra £10 per month, or £2.50 per week from the elderly who are ill. There are 145,000 people in that category.  People who are old and ill will need £2.50 per week to cover inflation and £2.50 to pay the Minister for Health and Children.  They will be left with £1 which I am sure the local authority will take when they review differential rent allowances.</P>

      <P>The increases of £3 in child benefit and £4 for additional children in the family are very small.  The Government has failed to meet expectations in the area of social welfare.  Significant changes are being made in the income tax code but there is no matching approach to social welfare and, as always, the poor must wait.  They will continue to wait for as long as this Government is in power.</P>
      <P>This was to have been the budget by which the war on poverty would commence.  We were told this would happen.  I cannot believe the meagre and paltry increases in social welfare benefits against the background of the propaganda which preceded the budget.</P>
      <P>Any war on poverty must remember the plight of the poor in the Third World, overwhelmed as they are by debt and frequently visited by natural disasters and famine.  No one would grudge an increase in overseas development aid to relieve hunger, to keep children alive, to teach them to read.  There is nothing in the budget for them. When the Estimates were published three weeks ago the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid, Deputy O'Donnell, threatened to resign if the Minister for Finance did not provide additional resources for ODA in 1999.</P>

      <P>The health crisis has again been almost ignored in this budget.  Despite the Private Member's Bill and the Supplementary Estimate, we heard yesterday that hospital waiting lists have increased by more than 1,000 people.

The changes on the drugs refund scheme show savings of almost £20 million, yet he contributes £8 million of that to the waiting lists.  Does he have any concept of what public patients are suffering?  Does he have any idea what is happening in hospitals?  He funds the problems of those on waiting lists by asking those with severe illnesses to pay an additional £12 per month for their essential medicines.  I have heard of the blind leading the blind but the idea of the sick paying for the sicker is a novel experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has indicated additional spending on education.  Something unusual is also happening here.  Despite the propaganda of the Minister for Education and Science, I noticed in the White Paper on Monday that the total education Vote in the 1999 Estimates is £4 million less than was pencilled in last year in the multi-annual budget for 1999.  How could the Minister be spending all this additional money when his Vote is £4 million less than the Minister for Finance thought he would need this time last year?  That is on a no-policy change basis <Col N="1325" /> but there are additional costs because of the rate of increase in pay.  On the face of it, the Minister for Education and Science would have needed additional money.  I do not understand how he will fight the war on educational disadvantage without bullets in his gun.</P>
    <P>Despite our excellent education system, one in five children leave school functionally illiterate. That fancy phrase means they cannot fill out normal forms or read the labels on medicine bottles. That is what is meant by &ldquo;functionally illiterate&rdquo; and it affects one in five children.  Some 200,000 children in primary schools are in classes of more than 30, and 500 primary schools have no remedial teachers.  It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for the child of an unskilled manual worker to enter university. Despite the much hyped programme on education, examination of the figures shows that the commitment does not exist.  The Minister for Education and Science made a great deal of noise about the increased capital programme.  What use will it be if he does not have enough in his current account to pay for the additional teachers to provide the extra service to eliminate educational disadvantage?</P>
    <P>Farmers have had a frightful year and the Minister for Agriculture and Food has done little for them.  There is nothing to help farmers who were swamped by the deluge of the summer and nothing additional to help with fodder costs.  The people of rural Ireland are ignored again in this budget.  Farmers experiencing a significant income crisis are not being treated like other citizens. The Minister has not extended the family income supplement to farmers on low incomes. Instead, he has consigned them to the dole.  This is to be expected from a Minister for Finance whose only public reaction to the plight of small farmers was to accuse them of hyping their problems. His response to the Minister for Agriculture and Food when funding was needed to avert a fodder crisis was to grant £10 million, which is inadequate to meet needs.  With such a huge surplus available to him today, I thought the Minister would have dedicated funds to the crisis and would have at least spent more than the £15 million he announced to support poor farm families. I also thought he would have found a better mechanism for doing it than telling hard working people who have worked all their lives in farming that their status will be changed and that they will be drawing the dole from now on.</P>
    <P>Occasionally, a politician is in the right place at the right time and events present him with enormous, historic opportunities.  The former German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, had such an opportunity to unite Germany, and he took it.  The Government and the Minister had an historic opportunity to eliminate poverty and disadvantage and to reform this country beyond recognition. On the basis of today's budget, history will be very hard on the Minister for Finance and the Government.</P>

      <P>As I was coming to the House this morning, I was approached by a radio reporter who asked me if the Minister for Finance was about to introduce the Labour Party manifesto and if I was expecting him to apply for membership of the Labour Party, given how often he or people speaking on his behalf have been using the words &ldquo;social inclusion&rdquo;, &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; and &ldquo;low pay&rdquo; in recent weeks.  Based on what he said this afternoon, he has a different idea of social inclusion from ours and he should save himself the stamp.</P>
      <P>The budget statement is unique because the Minister is in a unique situation.  It is not reasonable to compare what he has done today with what was done in preceding years because, in our economic experience, his situation is unique.  No Minister has ever had the opportunity the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, had today.  Never before has a Minister for Finance started a budget day with an opening surplus of £1.37 billion or even a tenth or twentieth of that figure.  Never has a Minister had a genuine opportunity to radically restructure the tax system or the opportunity to make a serious impact on disadvantage, poverty and inequality.  Never before has a Minister had a genuine opportunity to set out his vision of the type of society he would like to see created in Ireland and to take tangible steps towards achieving it.  That opportunity has been lost and it is because the Minister, Deputy McCreevy did not want to take it.  He has not reformed the system because he does not believe it needs to be reformed. He has not done anything to tackle inequality because he does not believe in a more equal society.  This is the Minister who disparagingly uses the term &ldquo;poverty industry&rdquo; and who used a large part of the resources available to him last year to give a tax giveaway to the rich.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, and we should be grateful for it, the choice of the type of society we have is not just that of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, nor of the Government.  It is a choice all citizens are entitled and obliged to make and which was denied to many previous generations.  We can decide to channel our new found wealth into public wealth or private consumption.  We can decide to invest in the type of services which are the hallmark of a modern European society at the start of the 21st century.  We must ask if we really care about the health service offered to older people and about the standard of education provided for young people.  Do we want to pay off the national debt early or use the resources to invest in the future?  This is a different way of asking the questions the Minister put in a folksy manner at the end of his speech.  Do we want to save for a rainy day or invest in the infrastructure necessary to sustain economic growth in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy is clear on this.  In last year's budget, he spoke about reducing Government spending as a percentage of GNP and, in the supporting documentation supplied, he is projecting a continued reduction in the percentage of Government spending over the <Col N="1327" /> next three years.  In simple language, he has committed himself as a matter of principle and ideology to spending proportionately less on public services.  The consequences of this policy are unambiguous.  Additional resources are to be used in creating private wealth at the expense of services on which all citizens depend.  Our investment in public services as a percentage of GNP or GDP, whichever measure one may care to use, is already one of the lowest in the European Union.  The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, wants to see this state of affairs continue.  Nothing he has done suggests otherwise and his medium-term strategy, as set out in the supporting information, confirms this.</P>
    <P>What we have seen today is a piece of elaborate theatre.  The real decisions were taken during the Estimates process and published in the Book of Estimates.  Some of those decisions merit further elaboration and I will return to them later.</P>
    <P>I will comment briefly on the overall picture. The Minister provided for a general Government surplus of close to £1 billion next year, £950 million, on top of the £800 odd million he has this year.  In the current economic circumstances we should budget for a surplus.  That is the fiscally and economically sensible approach to take, but we must ask ourselves whether we should budget for a surplus close to £1 billion when hundreds of hospital beds in various parts of the country lie idle because we cannot afford to keep them in use. We must also ask ourselves whether we should budget for a surplus of that magnitude when the Minister for Health and Children only last evening announced a cutback in the drug refund scheme.  It is intended to take an extra £10 per month from those people who rely on medication.</P>

      <P>Should we budget for that measure of surplus when we have a record housing waiting list?  Nearly 40,000 people are on the local authority housing list and nearly the same number are on hospital waiting lists.  Those figures are higher than they have been for five or six years.  We can and we should run a surplus. We have that choice, but we should not run that measure of a surplus if it stops us from dealing with the genuine social problems.  Running such a surplus will have a real impact on potential patients, those people who should be using those hospital beds that are lying idle, and on those on the local authority housing list, who should be housed.  Today the Minister did not answered that question, much less address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the income tax measures announced by the Minister, only 18 months ago Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats sought and got a mandate from the electorate based on a policy of reducing the two rates of income tax.  The Minister, <Col N="1328" /> and I suspect the Taoiseach, when in Opposition played no small part in devising that policy. Whatever about the Taoiseach, the Minister genuinely believed in that policy and he has scarcely tired of telling us so since.  How many times have we heard the Minister lecture those of us on this side of the House for the damnable sin of political correctness?  How many times have we heard him say he always believed it was right to concentrate on reducing the tax rates and that he has believed that for 20 years, if not more?  How often have we heard him defend himself against the self-evident fact that his policy favoured the better off? How often have we heard him say he would not be bound by the terms which underpin the Partnership 2000 agreement?  Suddenly it has all changed.  The Minister has seen the error of his ways and he wants to introduce a budget which favours those on low and middle incomes.  Is it unreasonable for us to point out that this is inconsistent with everything he said over several years and probably over a much longer period?  Is it unreasonable to point out that this is inconsistent with the mandate the Government sought and got from the people only 18 months ago?  Are we to take it from the Minister's capitulation today that he now accepts that last year's budget was a serious mistake?  In short, today's budget is the longest act of contrition we have heard for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>There can be few other countries in the developed world where a Minister could reverse what he said with such ease and stay in office. The Minister is not the first Minister to change his mind and no doubt he will not be the last, but we should not forget a crucial fact.  Nothing has materially changed in the past year except apparently the willingness of the rest of the Government to accept the notion that give-aways to the rich filter down to the rest of us.  This is and always was manifest nonsense.  If the Minister accepts that, and I wonder if he does, his credibility is shot.  If he does not accept it, then he is still trying to delude himself or the rest of us, and probably both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the basic system the Minister put in place today.  It is fairer to have a tax credit rather than a tax free allowance.  The basic problem is straightforward.  Under a personal allowance system, if one increases the allowance, one gives those on the standard rate a 24 per cent benefit and those on the higher rate a 46 per cent benefit.  That is manifestly unfair and it is right and proper to introduce a system which gives the same benefit to all taxpayers, irrespective of their marginal rate.  I agree with that.  The Minister has moved to introduce a system which reflects that and I welcome it unambiguously but, as the Taoiseach and no doubt the Minister for Finance know, there were different ways of doing that.  We should also have used this opportunity to give a once off and very considerable benefit to those who are less well off, not least because the Minister did precisely the opposite this time last year.  What the Minister should have done is standardise the standard rate, the personal allowances, and use the savings achieved from that to add an additional £4 million without widening the bands.  As the Taoiseach knows, this would have had a significantly more progressive effect than the flat effect the Minister has produced.</P>
      <P>The Minister has produced a much fairer system than he did last year but he has not produced anything like as fair a system as he could have produced and he certainly has not rebalanced the effect over the two years.  I suspect that what we have heard from him today has more to do with optics than reality.  The Minister has used some of the language of reform, but he has taken relatively little action to back it up.  He is on the right road, but he has taken relatively few steps.  Since he was travelling full speed on a different highway only a year ago, we must suspend judgment and wait to see whether he is serious about the pathway to reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer briefly to some other income tax measures which were not included but which I had hoped would have been included in the budget.  There was an increase in the levy threshold, but there is still a problem in that regard.  It imposes a step into the income tax system which <Col N="1330" /> is unhelpful.  If one earns less than the income threshold, one does not pay the levy, but if one earns more than the income threshold, one must pay the levy on the entire income.  That introduces a disincentive effect which is unhelpful.  The Minister should have done something, given the opportunity he had to do something about that.  I was also disappointed that there was no increase in the PRSI exemption figure introduced two years ago.  It started at £80, the Minister extended it to £100 last year, but there has not been an increase in that figure, which is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The social welfare changes are the test of whether this was a budget for social inclusion. After a number of budgets in which income tax rates were significantly reduced, the case for improving the real level of welfare payments was strong today.  The case was made cogently by the ESRI only a few weeks ago and it is very disappointing that the Minister has made very little progress in that direction.  An increase of £3 per week in most social welfare payments is a real reduction, and the Minister knows that.  It will not keep pace with wages and will scarcely keep pace with the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we heard sound bites that the Minister would seek to tackle poverty and the problem of social exclusion.  When income is rising much more rapidly than prices, it is not enough to adjust social welfare payments to the level of inflation.  That is what the Minister did in last year's budget and, predictably, it led to a relative worsening in the standard of living of social welfare recipients compared to the general standard of living.  The Minister will no doubt recall that the anti-poverty strategy sets an explicit target for poverty reduction over the next decade. In light of our current economic success, those targets are extremely modest and there is a strong case for revising them, even at this early stage.  It is clear that if the Minister was to pursue his current policy, he would have no chance of meeting even those modest targets.  To have any hope of achieving the current targets, future increases in social welfare need to be on a much more generous basis than simply compensating for price changes.  The bottom line on poverty is relative. How can one possibly describe this budget as one for social inclusion if the majority of those who depend on social welfare are relatively worse off as a result?  That argument is strongest in relation to people who are most dependent on social welfare, be they the long-term unemployed, people with disabilities or old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to ask somebody to live on £83 a week for a short period, but it is something else to ask him to spend the rest of his days on that level of income.  I accept that the Minister is aware of this problem and I agree he has taken some measure &mdash; although a disappointing one, given the hype we heard earlier &mdash; to deal with the problem.  We need to do a great deal more.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach will be well aware that last year a great deal of disappointment was generated when people were told they <Col N="1331" /> would get a flat £5 per person increase and did not get it.  Instead they received the dependant allowance which was a good deal less than that. Although there is an improvement on last year, the same sleight of hand is being continued this year.  I suspect there will still be a cost to pay on that and the Taoiseach was disappointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have done more.  This is not the way to do it, however, because it will be seen by most people who receive a pension, however long established it is, as sleight of hand. We need to do a bit more about pensions in future years.  I will comment on the medium term in relation to that.  The Taoiseach will be aware that the Pension Review Group reported earlier this year and recommended that the level of the old age pension should be progressively increased to approximately 34 per cent of average incomes and tied to that level for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>We are uniquely fortunate in Ireland in that our demographic structure is different from that of most other European countries.  Most of our European partners are already facing a crisis of funding pensions because their dependency ratio is increasing all the time.  We have at least 15 or maybe 20 years before we are confronted with this problem arising as it does from the fall in the birth rate in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>It is important that we recognise this impending problem and take action now to ensure that we are well prepared for the change when it happens. It would be entirely appropriate for us to set aside a fraction of our surplus for the next few years into a dedicated fund to finance pension liabilities in years to come.</P>
      <P>We know there is a problem coming at us some distance down the road.  We should act now to assure the pensioners of 2015 and beyond that their needs will be catered for.  To put it bluntly, it is not a matter of ideology as to how this fund will be managed.  I would be quite happy to have it managed either by the private sector or by the NTMA or any other State body.</P>

      <P>It is important that neither the State nor the private sector should engage in reckless gambles with our future and, to that extent, we require a considerable a measure of transparency in how the fund is managed.</P>
      <P>Last Saturday, there was a demonstration in Dublin lead by people who these days are generally described as carers.  In some ways, this was an unusual public demonstration by people who are normally the invisible backbone of our health and social welfare services.  They are people &mdash; mostly, though by no means all, women &mdash; who spend hour after hour, day after day, year after year looking after an elderly or infirm relative.  It is a job for which they get precious little thanks or recognition from the State despite the fact that they save the State untold millions of pounds by providing a standard of care which would otherwise cost the Exchequer a minor fortune.  Many of these people act with little or no back up services.</P>
      <P>It is important for us to do something to improve the lot of carers and, indeed, those they look after.  The Minister knows what has to be done.  A fine report was sent to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs only a few months ago, setting out a check list of recommendations, some, but by no means all, of which the Minister has acted upon today.</P>
      <P>It is extremely disappointing that he has not acted on the income disregard that would have made a significant improvement in the standard of living of most carers.  We also need to look at the broader structure.  We need to ensure that back-up services are available to carers.  We cannot expect elderly women themselves to look after other elderly people without any back up from the State.</P>
      <P>A single weekly visit or a visit every two or three days from a community health nurse is not sufficient.  There needs to be a substantial back-up service involving whatever is needed, be it physiotherapist, community health nurse or psychological service.  We need to redress the situation where community care is still very much the Cinderella of our health services, and carers are just one part of it, albeit a particularly sensitive one.</P>
      <P>One of the issues on which the Minister kicked to touch today was that of child care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, and the Government as a whole, have made a point of discarding election commitments on a regular basis since they came to power.  This appears to be just another one.  We always said, and it is fair to repeat it, that the issue of child care is a complex one.  We have to keep an eye on some things and I will deal with them in a moment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made no effort to fulfil a quite explicit commitment given in the manifesto of the Fianna Fáil Party and in the programme for Government to introduce a tax free allowance or tax credit for people who make use of child care.</P>
      <P>I will put down a few markers on this issue.  Tax allowances in themselves would be a disaster.  We have to acknowledge the basic and obvious fact that a good deal of the child care sector is in the black market.  There is a very real risk that if we simply introduce tax free allowances or tax credits the supply of child care services will be reduced.  That is something that is counterproductive and not desirable.  We need to ensure that the supply and standards of child care are improved.  The Minister's detail in terms of the allowance that he will make available for cre ches, play-schools or other child care facilities are extremely scant.  It is difficult for us on this side of the House to comment on it on the basis of the details he has given.  It is appropriate, however, to give capital allowances and tax incentives to those providing child care facilities to ensure that they are up to standard.</P>
      <P>We have to be extremely careful to ensure that child care does not become the preserve of the middle classes or those who can afford it anyway. There are scant child care facilities of whatever nature in many areas of disadvantage in Dublin. It is a responsibility of the State and of the Department to ensure that those facilities, be they cre ches, play-schools or more elaborate child care facilities, are provided either directly or by the provision of grant aid.</P>
      <P>When dealing with this issue, we must explicitly acknowledge that some women choose to stay at home, as do some men.  Some men or women choose to take career breaks to look after their children.  It is inappropriate that they should be cut off from any assistance from the State.  They should be given direct assistance.</P>
      <P>An obvious way of giving direct assistance is by way of the universal child benefit system.  In that regard, it is disappointing, to say the least, that the Minister has not taken this opportunity to increase it by a significant amount.  When we were in Government, firstly with Fianna Fail and more recently with Democratic Left and Fine Gael, we increased child benefit every year by a significant amount.  Unfortunately, this policy appears to have been expressly reversed by the current Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I turn now to corporation tax. For many years, we operated a 10 per cent rate of corporation tax aimed specifically at the manufacturing sector.  In 1987 we sought and received permission from the EU Commission to extend a similar rate of tax to the IFSC.  Three years later the Commission approved an Irish application to extend this concession to the end of 2005.  It does not appear to have occurred to anyone, either in Dublin or Brussels, that the operation of differential rates of corporation tax might constitute a state aid as defined by the EU treaties.  That said, we know that the EU did later come to that view, and it was in that context that the Rainbow Government announced its intention to introduce a unified rate of 12.5 per cent last year.</P>
      <P>This move was opposed at the time by the current Minister.  He announced that Fianna Fáil in Government would pursue a single rate of 10 per cent.  On taking office the Government took not the slightest action to pursue its stated policy, and in last year's budget the Minister finally and formally abandoned the election commitment he had given.  We are now led to believe that the Government has concluded a deal with the Commission, and the Minister's announcement today is clearly intended in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party signed up in Government to a 12.5 per cent unified rate, and that remains its position.  However, there is more than one way in which we can deliver on that commitment, and I believe the Government has got it wrong in that respect.  The 32 per cent rate of tax, the so-called standard rate, is paid by a small minority of corporate taxpayers.  That said, these corporations are, by definition, the most profitable companies in the State.  Many are in the financial sector, most notably the banks.  Some are in the retail and construction sectors.  By contrast, over 90 per cent of companies qualify for the 25 per cent rate in that their profits do not exceed the current threshold of £50,000.  Some of these companies are struggling and could do with a tax break.  The Minister should have reduced the low rate only and progressively increased the threshold.  He should have postponed the benefit to the banks and other highly profitable companies until the last possible time in 2003.  God knows, who would want to bestow any privileges on the banks after the revelations of recent months?  Moreover, this <Col N="1335" /> makes sense on grounds of equity.  There is no persuasive reason why we should be looking to confer a huge windfall profit on the financial sector at a time when it is already enormously profitable. It is worth pointing out that the Minister's decision announced today is worth millions of pounds to the large associated banks.  There is something very wrong in giving an increase of a couple of pounds a week to pensioners and at the same time reducing the tax liability of AIB and Bank of Ireland by millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the fact that it would be fairer to postpone the benefit to the banks, there is also a certain logic to it from the point of view of the Exchequer.  The Exchequer will benefit considerably from raising the current 10 per cent rate to 12.5 per cent.  Yet this increase will only come into play at the last stage of the process.  It makes sense then to delay the windfall to the financial sector, and the banks in particular, until the last possible moment.</P>
    <P>This is not to accept that we should confer a windfall on the banks.  I strongly believe that we should use all possible means to claw back some of this windfall and ensure that it is retained by the Exchequer.  I accept that we need a low headline rate of corporation tax in order to attract and retain foreign direct investment, although the link between the two may not be as strong as it once was, but I find it very difficult indeed to accept that we should tax bank profits at little more than half the standard rate of income tax.  Is it really acceptable that a single person on £5,000 will pay 24 per cent tax on each and every additional pound he earns, but the Bank of Ireland will pay just 12.5 per cent?  If we cannot change the headline rate, and I accept that we cannot, we must ensure that the base is as wide as possible, that avoidance measures are closed down and that quirks in the system are dealt with.</P>
    <P>In his budget last year the Minister reduced by half the tax credit attaching to dividends.  I supported that measure then and I also support his decision to complete that process by eliminating the credit altogether.  I also support the decision to abolish accelerated corporation tax.  However, there are other areas to which we must look as a matter of urgency.  The agreement with the European Commission and the announcement made by the Government last year distinguishes, or attempts to distinguish, between trading income and non-trading income.  In his announcement today, the Minister looked to define that further and, in the short time I have had to check the back-up information, I found that there is an attempt made to define the difference.  I do not find it very convincing because it refers to tax laws established by Statute and by precedent.  As I understand it, the Statute and precedent are themselves very unclear and there are still more than sufficient grounds for avoidance.  That is something that will clearly have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>There has been much speculation in recent weeks about the attitude of our European partners <Col N="1336" /> to Ireland and in particular to our corporation tax regime.  Let me say in the first instance that I believe the agreement with Commissioner Monti will hold good, and I would be very surprised if any effort were made in Brussels to revisit what is effectively a done deal.  Having said that, we are heading for serious trouble down the road unless we fundamentally change our attitude to the European Union and do so quickly.  It is time we put away the begging bowl.  If we do not, it will shortly be flung back in our collective faces.</P>
    <P>For much of the past month we have been engaged in fancy cartography and spurious management of statistics in order to extract a few extra euros from the European taxpayer.  We have been hell-bent on proving just how poor we are or, at very least, how poor some parts of the country are.  We should just stop for a moment to see how this washes with our partners.  Take Germany for example.  Parts of Eastern Germany are a good deal poorer than Ireland.  Taxes in West Germany were raised so as to pay for reunification. Unemployment in some eastern Lander is more than 20 per cent and in some cases nearly 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>Our partners know we are progressively reducing all taxes, bar excise duty on cigarettes.  They know we have close to full employment.  They know our GDP per capita is already in excess of the Union average.  Yet we are juggling counties, and figures from several years ago, in order to drag as much out of the Union as we can at a time when all concerned know right well that the figures are of little more than historical interest and bear no relation to the current reality which is that no one region in the country, howsoever we put it together, will be under the 75 per cent threshold by the time the next tranche of Structural Funds comes on stream, and all of this for the sake of £20 million extra per year?  Let us face the fact that £20 million is only a small fraction of the total surplus which the Government returned this year, and an even smaller fraction of the surplus which is projected for 1999.  The Government has jeopardised friendship and influence in Brussels for the sake of a few pennies more at a time when the Exchequer is awash with money.  This is short-sighted, it is stupid, and we will rue the day.</P>
    <P>It is time for us to take some responsibility for our own development.  We cannot expect others to invest in Ireland if we are not prepared to do it ourselves.  We cannot use foreign money to pay for our roads and put aside our own money for a rainy day.  In short, we are trying to be too cute by half, and if we do not change our attitude all of us will live to regret it.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus in this House and among commentators that we need to invest a great deal in infrastructure.  I wonder, however, whether the figures support the Minister's rhetoric.  I do not believe they do.  The figures suggest to me a virtual freeze on capital spending over the next few years.  They do not suggest that the Minister is <Col N="1337" /> approaching this with the radical thinking that is required.  Let me give an example.  Deputy Noonan mentioned the question of public transport in Dublin.  It is true that a few months ago the Government, when redistributing the Luas money, provided for an additional 100 buses in Dublin, and there is provision for another 50 in the Estimates which were published a few weeks ago.  That is 150 buses to replace 150 clapped-out busses.  Dublin Bus has a fleet of 900 buses.  Do we really think this is the scale of change that will encourage people out of their cars and into public transport?  If Dublin Bus is allowed to renovate one sixth of its total fleet, is that going to persuade people?</P>

      <P>There is a failure of imagination, a failure to address new circumstances.  The Government has the capacity, which was not there three or four years ago, and there is also a greater problem, because economic success has in part generated this problem and it will not be resolved by giving Dublin Bus the capacity to renovate one sixth of its total fleet.  The Taoiseach knows this.  There is a quality bus corridor running through my constituency up the Malahide Road.  There is another in Lucan.  These are causing a good deal of distress to car owners, and it is going to take more than the renovation of one sixth of Dublin Bus's fleet to persuade people that they should use public transport.</P>
      <P>I agree with the policy of quality bus corridors. I agree with the Luas strategy.  However, this is a failure on a scale to do the sort of thinking, to put in place the sort of planning that we need, because the money is available but we are using it to pay off the national debt.</P>

Without a comprehensive system it will not be possible to tempt, cajole or force motorists to use public transport and without considerably increased usage of public transport, this city will grind to a halt and, with that, the economic success we are currently enjoying will reverse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State uses this argument as a political point but it is a real problem which we must tackle.  The opportunity to do so is now available.  It was not available five, 15 or 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>I will discuss some other aspects of the Estimates. Vote 39, which refers to overseas aid, is startling.  I am aware that the Estimates do not give the full story but the gross total for overseas aid is just 1 per cent higher than in 1998.  Taking inflation into account, it amounts to a reduction and when one considers that a pay and pension increase of 7 per cent is also provided for in that Vote, the reduction is even greater.</P>
      <P>It is important to put this figure in context. When the Labour Party entered Government in 1993 it agreed with Fianna Fáil to progressively increase aid until the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP was met.  The real value of overseas aid increased every year from 1993 to 1997 both as a gross figure and as a percentage of GNP.  When the current Government came into office, it stated its intention to increase aid to a medium term target of 0.45 per cent of GNP.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, was given responsibility for meeting this target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> One is entitled to ask what went wrong.  Why is the figure frozen?  Has the target been forgotten or abandoned?  Is the Government still committed to meeting its own target or is this just another election promise which has been discarded? Were the Minister, Deputy Andrews, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, simply distracted by other things or has the Government changed its policy?</P>
    <P>For many years Irish people have voluntarily contributed to development in the Third World. Even when times were not good at home, we have always been aware of our moral and political obligation to assist people in the developing world.  Since 1993 that moral obligation has been given tangible official expression in a progressive increase in our ODA budget.  I do not doubt that this represents the firm wish of the people.  We acknowledge our obligation to those who are a great deal less well off than ourselves and, as a people, we genuinely want to help them.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with Deputy O'Donnell and the predicament in which she finds herself.  She was clearly outwitted by the Minister for Finance. However, her efforts to suggest that she has been accommodated in the context of a three year allocation beggars belief.  The three year allocation is merely a part of the Government's effort to suggest that it is serious about the SMI initiative and multi-annual budgeting.  I do not believe the Government is remotely serious about any of these three year targets so there is no reason to believe that ODA will fare any better than the rest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, under the system started by Deputy Quinn when he was Minister for Finance, three year multi-annual budgeting is now part of the Government decision.  Any Vote, including ODA, is part of a Government decision.  It is entirely wrong to say that the figure is not bedded down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us talk about multi-annual budgeting for a moment.  Last year we were given no policy change Estimates for the following three years and we were told we would be given disaggregated Vote figures on a no policy change plus an additional extra amount.  Those figures are in the budget package circulated by the Minister but, unfortunately, they were not circulated sufficiently quickly to enable people to find them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will wager with the Taoiseach that by the time the Estimates process takes place next year, those figures will change.  They will change because the system of reaching them is wrong.  The figures have no credibility if they are reached at the end of an Estimates process which is conducted entirely in private.  Nobody knows where they came from and what they represent.  I have difficulty with the current Estimates process.  The <Col N="1340" /> notion of running a three year Estimates process into one year and producing Estimates as part of the background information for the budget makes a nonsense of the democratic process.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for next year will be debated in committee, if one can call it a debate, some time in the middle of next year when all the money has been committed and most of it has been spent.  How are we to deal with three year figures in that context?  I do not know what they mean. Who could possibly be asked to understand what they mean?  No explanation is given.</P>

However, I will make a small wager with the Minister that that will not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>Overseas development aid is important.  Many people find it genuinely nauseating that at a time of unprecedented economic growth we cannot find it in our hearts to give an extra few million or tens of millions of pounds in overseas development aid.  However badly off we are, there are people in the developing world who are infinitely worse off.  Irish people would want us to increase our spending in that area and it is a great disappointment that the Minister and the Government have not found a means of undoing the damage of a few weeks ago.  It is even harder for the Irish aid agencies such as Trócaire, Concern and GOAL who will, correctly, feel betrayed by the Minister for Finance and his colleagues.</P>
      <P>Tax matters are usually the concern of the Minister for Finance and, perhaps, the Taoiseach. However, in recent weeks we have witnessed a strange phenomenon north of the Liffey.  On several occasions in recent months we have been treated to interesting sound bites from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government advocating the benefit of eco or green taxes.  The Minister expected a move to green taxes in the budget.  There were several newspaper headlines to that effect and RTE even broadcast a news programme on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was obliquely suggested that taxes on energy use would be increased, the polluter would be made to pay, cars would be banished from city <Col N="1341" /> centre streets and free parking spaces would be taxed as a benefit in kind.  Where is the beef, Minister?  The evidence suggests that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, could not tax his way out of a plastic bag.  Whatever happened to that commitment?</P>
    <P>When I asked the Minister for Finance about green taxes a few weeks ago he treated me to a Charlie McCreevy special, if he will forgive me for thus describing it.  It was one of those long, rambling answers which tell one nothing other than that the Minister would prefer if one had not asked the question in the first place.  By the time the Minister finished I regretted asking the question. One thing was pretty clear, the Minister is less than enthused about the whole notion of green tax.  This is hardly surprising since anyone who has taken any interest in this issue knows the officials in the Department of Finance are implacably opposed to green taxes.  I do not imagine the Minister is the man to upset that apple cart.</P>
    <P>The official Government line, as opposed to the Custom House line, is that we will consider a carbon energy tax if our European colleagues agree to do the same.  As an aside, might I suggest to the Minister that relying on European tax harmonisation to stymie green taxes, while arguing against it elsewhere, is a chicken which is bound to come home to roost.  The current line was agreed some years ago when we were sure the UK Government would block any possible agreement at EU level.  There is a real danger that our hypocrisy will soon be laid bare.  The British Government has recently received a report which concludes that a shift to green taxes would be good for the UK economy.  The newly elected German Government has already announced its intention of introducing further tax on energy use.</P>
    <P>In all seriousness the Government is running out of time on this issue and will shortly be required to make a decision.  We are entitled to be told who represents the Government on this issue.  Does the Minister for the Environment and Local Government represent anyone other than himself?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government intends to do anything about this issue it should get on with the job.  If not, it should say so and quit the hypocrisy. It cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>On the issue of CO 2 emissions, the Department of the Environment and Local Government has had its own way.  Ireland has signed up to freezing our level of emissions at the 1990 level, plus 13 per cent before 2008.  This is not just a target, it is a legally enforceable limit.  The problem is that that limit has already been exceeded and without a significant policy shift, a shift in energy use, we cannot meet the target.  Either we close down most of the existing power stations and convert to nuclear energy or take measures deliberately intended to slow economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> The strange thing is that the Department of Finance seems to have no view and has done no work on the economic consequences of meeting our Kyoto obligations.  Governments in other countries have devoted a great deal of time, money and effort to devising plans intended to meet their obligations.  Only a few months ago the Government in Norway lost a vote of confidence on the issue.  Yet nobody here appears to take the issue seriously, despite an ESRI report which sets out clearly the potential consequences for us in doing what we have signed up to do.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Minister for Finance to wake up to the issue.  The Kyoto obligations are not soft targets.  We will be in real trouble economically in a few years' time if we do not get our act together and devise a genuine plan to meet our obligations.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced a package of £15 million to restructure the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme.  In as much as that is all we know about it, I welcome it, but the sum involved is not great.  We have got to state a simple principle clearly.  The vast bulk of direct aid to farmers is going to the better off.  Some threequarters of the aid is going to a quarter of the farmers.  That is not acceptable.  At the start of next year we will renegotiate the CAP in the context of Agenda 2000.  We need a clear statement of policy that the Government will seek to redress that balance, that it will look to direct aid as income support rather than price support at people who need it rather than people who do not need it.  That is a fundamental principle which should underpin the renegotiation as part of Agenda 2000.  The £15 million for restructuring does not appear to be a huge sum.  Given that there are no details on it we will withhold judgment until such time as we hear further.</P>

    <P>I wish to finish with a few personal words to the Minister, although unfortunately he is not present.  He had an opportunity today, an opportunity which comes rarely in public life, which never comes to most of us.

      <P>Not even the Irish rugby team could fluff the introduction of this year's budget. Even a Finance Minister as accident prone as Deputy McCreevy could not fail to introduce a good news budget, given that the State's coffers are awash with money.  For whom is it good news and has the Minister managed to undo some of the damage of last year when he flagrantly skewed the benefits of economic growth in favour of the better off and aggravated the divisions in society?  The rich do spectacularly well again today.  There should be no doubt, amidst all the brouhaha about the long awaited tax changes.  For example, corporation tax is reduced by 4 per cent, which gives relief of the order of £132 million in a full year to the better off.</P>

      <P>The better paid are included in the tax concessions.  The lower rate of corporation profits tax at 25 per cent is chargeable to a threshold of £100,000 rather than £50,000 as heretofore. There is a new raft of capital allowances permissible and the date and duration of certain of the designated schemes and some of the incentive schemes have been extended.  The Minister has not reversed last year's big mistake in respect of cutting capital gains tax in half in the middle of an economic boom.  He could at least have reduced it to the corporation tax level of 28 per cent.  That puts a great deal of money in the pockets of a small elite.</P>
      <P>For the bookies the budget is a case of winner all right.  I suppose one would expect a bookies budget from this Minister.  I concede the Minister has made a brave effort in seeking to reverse his policy on income tax.

      <P>It is important to record this conversion on the road to Damascus by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, because in last year's Budget Statement he boasted about and defended the disgraceful measures he introduced on the basis that his party had won the general election and he was keeping promises he had given during the campaign.

      <P>From the Minister's contribution, one could get the impression that the Irish people reflect on little else other than the successes of the Celtic tiger economy.  In reality, however, many people struggle to travel to work each day through the traffic gridlock, they struggle to pay honest taxes and they struggle to rear families on housing estates that are pockmarked by the depredations of the new landlord class which was brought into existence by the reduction in capital gains tax and whose members <Col N="1346" /> have purchased houses and leased them out for rental purposes in an unsupervised way.  The new landlord class has seen its speculative acquisitions fuelled by the Minister's halving of capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>At the same time, people living in poverty and those on social welfare have been gradually losing out because their miserly allowances are compared to the rate of inflation rather than to income increases.</P>

    <P>If the Minister, albeit belatedly, could devote his attention to a radical attempt at reforming the tax system, why could he not concentrate on the greatest problem confronting our society, namely, the depth of endemic poverty, particularly but not exclusively in large urban areas?  It is unconscionable that the Minister should have announced a £3 increase for the generality of 118,000 widows, 15,000 deserted wives, 59,000 one parent families and 212,000 people on the live register.  In the <Col N="1347" /> constituency that Deputy Lenihan and I, for the moment, share, a bag of coal costs £4.95.</P>

      <P>However, at a time when the coffers of the State are spilling over with money, the Minister for Finance, reminiscent of his time as Minister for Social Welfare when he authored the infamous &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts, has announced a £3 increase.  It appears he has not changed his spots and has focused his attention on the people he believes participate in the democratic process, namely, those most likely to exercise their ballot. Last year he concentrated on boosting the well off while this year he has reverted to concentrating available resources on people who are at work as distinct from those who are out of work.</P>

Through an accident of history, demographics and investment in education, those skills have been available for the past two decades or more.  Last year's figures show that <Col N="1348" /> performance has been greatly boosted by the return of young people who acquired skills outside the country.</P>
      <P>The housing situation is a real barrier to reentry to the workforce in Ireland.  A person working and living in reasonable comfort in London, Liverpool, Frankfort or elsewhere would have to think twice about selling up, returning to Dublin and trying to purchase a house.  Despite that situation the Minister has done nothing to add to the paltry provision he made in respect of housing in the Book of Estimates.  He repeated that provision has been made for 600 starts.  One of the best known housing economists in the country argued on radio with the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, that the figure is 200.  Does it matter whether the figure is 200 or 600 as the impact will be marginal for the 45,000 on housing lists?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the resources at his disposal no Minister for Finance has been so fortunate in introducing a budget.  The Minister had the opportunity to undo some of the damage done by his deeply flawed budget of last December.  It is symbolic that the Government has repartitioned the country between rich and poor.  It has divided the country into rich and poor.  There is no such thing as a poor county but there are poor people in every county with a great many concentrated in large urban unemployment blackspots in counties designated as wealthy by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister's first budget produced a more unequal society.  He deliberately redistributed the benefits of unprecedented economic growth to the better-off and boasted about it.  He said that he was only doing what Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats promised to do in their election platform.  As a result the gap between rich and poor has widened as the take home pay of the better-off increased significantly at a time of economic boom.  The Minister slashed capital gains tax in half making the fat cats fatter.  Having decided to exclude building land from this windfall in his Budget Statement he changed his mind and reversed this decision earlier this year.  He blatantly exploited the housing crisis to extend this huge tax advantage to those obscenely profiteering from it.  Those dependent on social welfare have fallen behind those in receipt of incomes and those on lower incomes have benefited least from last year's tax changes.</P>
      <P>A budget framed against the background of unprecedented economic growth that does not mount an assault on poverty is a failure.  By that yardstick the budget is a failure.  Side by side with great affluence is deep poverty.  Poverty and deprivation is mainly but by no means exclusively the experience of the long-term unemployed and welfare recipients.  There are not tens but hundreds of thousands on low pay, despite our fantastic jobs performance during the past five to six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many on low pay poverty is a reality exacerbated by the taxation system and the loss of protections such as a medical card.  The Combat Poverty Agency has highlighted the fact that &ldquo;despite the economic boom nearly one third of <Col N="1350" /> Irish children live in poverty &mdash; the second highest rate in the EU&rdquo;.  We have more people homeless on our streets and more of our communities are ravaged by drug addiction.  This is the face of hidden Ireland.  The shakers and movers in the land of the Celtic tiger do not know much about the hidden Ireland, they rarely encounter it and some do not want to know about it.</P>
    <P>How much of the damage done last year to the fabric of society by the Minister has been undone this year?  What has he done for the huge concentrations of unemployed clustered in a limited number of urban jobless blackspots?  As distinct from our returning immigrants who are most welcome, how many of the long-term unemployed can hope to land real jobs as a result of the budget?  For those on lower incomes who have paid more than their fair share of tax during the years what precisely is the value of the changes to them?  How does the man or woman on average industrial earnings fair?</P>
    <P>If child poverty is as serious as the Combat Poverty Agency asserts, how much has the Minister done?  In granting an increase of £1.50 in child benefit last year he reversed the process initiated by Deputies Quinn and De Rossa &mdash; Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare in the previous Government &mdash; as part of which resources were focused on child benefit.  They acknowledged that poverty is concentrated among children.  The Government reversed this process last year and has only made a token concession this year despite the fact that the coffers are awash with money.  How much has the Minister done to tackle hospital queues and attack the housing crisis?</P>
    <P>These are some of the questions that those listening to the debate want answered.  Have they a better chance of a hospital bed as a result of the budget?  By how much has their take home pay improved?  Will their child be in a smaller class? Will the local school finally receive a remedial teacher?  Will they finally get a real job?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 43,000 on hospital waiting lists when the Deputy was in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>Do they have better prospects of owning their own home?  Does their family have a better chance of being allocated a local authority house?  Has the Minister eased the burden on the shoulders of carers in the home and what has he done for the disabled and mentally handicapped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine what the Minister has done against these criteria.  People are getting a little weary of Minister after Minister being trotted out to tell us that we have never had it so good. According to the Taoiseach at the Árd Fheis, Fianna Fáil are &ldquo;living in the future&rdquo;.  That makes a change but I can tell him that most of my constituents are living in the present.  Many of them have wearied of the Celtic tiger &mdash; a mythical beast as far as they are concerned.  For many ordinary people it is a struggle to get to work in the <Col N="1351" /> traffic gridlock and a struggle to rear a family on their take home pay.</P>
    <P>Access to hospital care is a slow and painful experience and individual families will lose out again on the revamp of the drugs refund scheme, details of which were dragged out of the Minister for Health and Children yesterday.  This decision on the drugs refund scheme is typical of the kind of measure sneaked in but not advertised on budget day.  Last year, for example, the Minister did not refer to hospital charges in his Budget Statement, yet the next day his colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, slipped it out that hospital charges were being increased.  For example, the Minister raised the charges from £12 to £20 for self-referrals to accident and emergency departments and in-patient charges from £20 to £25.</P>
    <P>The same is happening to people who are trying to rely on their own resources who do not have a medical card and for whom the drugs refunds scheme was a good idea and a significant assistance.  That was tackled by the Minister yesterday. Only for the brouhaha in this House it would not have been admitted to.  It is a deterioration for people.  The Asthma Society of Ireland said that as a result their members will be dependent on less than quality care.</P>
    <P>The Minister succeeded last year in attracting unprecedented criticism from right across the social partners in terms of the choices he made. The trade union movement felt especially cheated in the manner in which the Minister flagrantly skewed the tax reductions in favour of the better off.  He had been put on notice this year that the cornerstone of our economic progress, social partnership, would be at risk if he failed to deliver on outstanding Partnership 2000 commitments.  The employers' organisation IBEC, fully aware of the value of social partnership to their member companies, rowed in behind Congress.</P>
    <P>There is hardly any mystery about why IBEC would want to support Congress on this.  If workers are asked to accept a decade of moderate pay increases and pay restraint, by comparison to profits performance in this economy, then it is natural they will accept tax and other improvements in the social wage.  Fair access to education and health care are two such elements of the social wage.  The earlier implementation of the promised national minimum wage on a phased basis is the subject of an ongoing campaign by the Dublin Council of Trade Unions.  In other words, the trade union movement is demanding a fairer redistribution of the benefits of economic growth.</P>
    <P>In their pre-budget submission to the Minister, the unions asked him, in return for the continual reduction of corporation tax to bring in the national minimum wage earlier than the date promised.  I understand why corporation tax is headed in that direction and how it is pivotal in terms of the jobs performance in this economy in recent years.  However, in this budget there are <Col N="1352" /> significant gains to business for the second year running.  It would not be an imposition at all if the Congress demand to bring forward the implementation of the national minimum wage was agreed to by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax changes in so far as they go. It will take us some time to depart from what Deputy Noonan described as the very favourable best example cases that are listed.  If the Minister is promising to go down the road of tax credits, I welcome that.  The lower and middle income earners will benefit disproportionately &mdash; it is about time as they have consistently lost out in the past.</P>
    <P>I refer to the front page headline in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Foreign Workers Sought in Job Boom&rdquo;.  At the same time that foreign workers are sought in a jobs boom, more than 200,000 of our people unemployed.  Almost half of these are long-term unemployed and the majority are clustered in urban blackspots.  If there really is a labour, as opposed to a skills, shortage then surely resources should be targeted on this stock of human capital to bring these people into the workforce.  That will require the kind of investment in training and education and in the employment services that we have seen neither in this budget nor in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Government's Employment Action Plan supports my argument.  It says:</P>
    <P>The sheer task of gearing up our employment services, which for a variety of historical reasons have been modestly resourced, to engage systematically with the numbers involved is a major challenge.  That challenge is exacerbated by the fact that these services have a moral, social and economic responsibility to seek to respond to those who are already long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is clear than those are no more than words on paper.  Clearly the Government does not believe the policy plan it was obliged to produce as a result of EU intervention in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I welcome a Government statement saying it has a moral imperative to respond to the needs of the long-term unemployed.  However, this Government has not done it and as I pointed out in the debate on the Estimates, it has cut the provision for the training of the long-term unemployed by 3 per cent.  That is the contribution to people for whom unemployment is a fortress without a drawbridge &mdash; people who are caught in intergenerational unemployment in unemployment blackspots and cannot find a way out, people for whom poverty is a landscape of the mind as well as financial and monetary deprivation.  Yet the Government passes over it.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Council also support my argument.  It says:</P>
    <P>. the Local Employment Service, the LES, is a litmus test of the Government's Strategic Management Initiative in tailoring employment services effectively to the needs of the customer. <Col N="1353" /> The council would like to stress the goal set out for the LES of becoming the gateway to a full range of progression, integration and employment options for the unemployed .. and that responsibility, budgetary resources and data must be devolved to the LES.</P>
    <P>That is the view of the NESC, which includes us all, to which there has been no response.  I make no secret of my view that the LES should concentrate on the blackspots.  We should be careful about the balance between the community and voluntary sector on the one hand and State delivery on the other.</P>
    <P>The LES should offer integrated, intensive counselling and placement services delivered by professionals.  The LES should require obligatory registration by all claimants in a blackspot and it should require obligatory registration of vacancies by employers.  It should offer optional registration to the employed in the blackspot clusters to enable them to better themselves in the jobs market.</P>
    <P>I accept, as Deputy McDowell said, that there is rural poverty.  We all know that.  However, there is nowhere in rural Ireland that I know of &mdash; and I know it as well as anybody in this House &mdash; where being unemployed equates with the phenomenon of being unemployed in a conurbation of 30,000 to 40,000 where the unemployment rate is about 60 per cent.</P>

      <P>I welcome Minister Ó Cuív's agreement and I accept his sincerity, but it is a great pity &mdash; I know he is not at the Cabinet table &mdash; that he did not persuade the Minister for Finance to take on board the obvious lessons, if that is our agreed analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that it is not possible, even by way of parliamentary question, to establish how many long-term unemployed benefited from the scheme introduced by Deputy Quinn as Minister for Finance and Deputy Noonan in the Rainbow Government to allow the long-term unemployed to keep their medical card for three years after they took up employment.  That tells something about the permanent government, for whom I have high respect.  The permanent government resisted that measure at the time.  It did not want it to happen, and it has certainly been successful in ensuring that it is not promoted. It is a major concern for the long-term unemployed that they do not lose the medical card when they get back into work.  That has implications for their family.  Illness is a function of poverty.  There is a higher instance of illness in these unemployment black spots.  It is the great failure of this budget that this phenomenon of <Col N="1354" /> poverty is alien to the experience of the Minister for Finance.  How it could be alien to the experience of his Taoiseach, who has a good deal of knowledge from the constituency which he represents of the phenomenon which I am describing, escapes me?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">

      <P>He does a great deal of travelling nowadays.  I accept that.  If there is an envelope to open or a book to launch, whether he is involved in it or otherwise, in any part of the country the Taoiseach will be there to do it.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the remarks by my colleague, Deputy McDowell, about the question of child care.  In the programme for Government there is a specific commitment to the introduction of tax allowances for child care.  Child care is an issue which affects thousands of young parents who are juggling the responsibilities of work and family. The high cost of house mortgages demands that both parents, in many cases, have no option but to work even when the children are small.  Great concern has been expressed by parents and organisations about the failure of the Government to address the issue in the last budget.  We all know that it requires a multi-faceted response, that tax allowances are only part of a wider picture which includes tax relief, structural supports for disadvantaged women, as well as recognition of the role of the parent in the home.  Yet, shamefully, the Minister for Finance has refused to live up to the expectations generated by his own party and the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>The expert working group on child care has done its work in briefing the Cabinet.  It made crystal clear that, as a minimum, £5 million needed to be set aside in the budget to make a start on the implementation of the strategy on child care when it is published.  Other than the benefit-in-kind, the Minister has made no concession.</P>
      <P>This budget also scores low marks for how it deals with education, and especially education at the basic level, including facilities for socially marginalised communities.  At a time of bulging coffers, primary education is again told that it must wait.  There is no substantial closing of the gap in funding between primary schools and the other levels, no expansion of the innovative breaking the cycle scheme to all disadvantaged schools, no prospect of a reduction in the class sizes of 36 and 38 which I hear about in my constituency. For adult and literacy education there is a Green Paper, but only small change by way of resourcing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is primary education still waiting?  It waited in the 1960s because resources went into the welcome initiatives taken in respect of second-level education.  Primary schools waited in the 1970s because second and third-level building and enrolments grew.  In the 1980s primary schools were among the victims of spending cuts. Is it not time in the late 1990s for the unprecedented <Col N="1355" /> level of State assets to be reflected in the largest and most basic sector of our education service, the primary schools?</P>
    <P>Primary schools have waited too long for a closing of the gap in funding as compared with other levels; a maximum class size of 30 students; extension of schemes like Breaking the Cycle, early start and teacher counsellors to all schools designated as &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo; which, under the Rainbow Government, where implemented with some considerable success, as is acknowledged by all sides of this House now; extending access to remedial teaching to all schools; and special supports for pupils at risk of early drop-out.</P>
    <P>Parents and teachers will not give a great Christmas report to this budget; their patience is running out.  Many primary teachers confront disadvantage when many of our kids come out of primary education.  Now was the time for significant investment in pre-school and primary education. Incremental improvement of a minimal kind is what we have got.  It is a missed opportunity.</P>
    <P>The problem with housing is not just one of shortage.  House construction and output has grown.  The problem is not just one of density either.  Higher densities have applied for some years now in the centre with the biggest housing problem, that is Dublin.  The problem is not really lack of serviced land, zoning or incentives.  Dublin and many other towns and cities, are awash with incentives, urban renewal, designation, infrastructure, etc.  Councillors are quite facilitating, so much so that the system is the focus of inquiries. Yet we are told we have a shortage.</P>
    <P>What we really have is a panic, which is something very different.  We have a panic among house buyers which was intentionally created by developers and builders.  Developers and builders have undue market power and are using this power to create an inflation.  The inflation is intended to enrich themselves first.  Second, the purpose of the inflation is to cause a self-sustaining panic among citizens so that inflation also becomes self-sustaining.  The situation is a cynical conspiracy among developers, builders and estate agents to enrich themselves at the expense of everyone else.  In addition, of course they now have in power Fianna Fáil, the builder's friend.</P>
    <P>The Bacon report is no answer to the panic and conspiracy.  Higher densities, higher grants, more reliefs will not work.  Demands for voluntary restraint by builders are unreal.  Talk of a social market is almost incidental.  We have an inflation because we have a panic, and we have a panic because builders and developers actually set out to create these conditions.  To make matters worse builders, developers and estate agents, an essential leg of the three-cornered stool, also got together to create a speculation and a new landlord class in Ireland.  They have already done it in this city.  You are nobody now unless you own a half a dozen houses in my constituency and that has been deliberately contrived.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> Fianna Fáil, the builders' friend, has overseen it all.  Minister Dempsey, other than wringing his hands, does not intend to do anything about it. The true description of the housing crisis is not in the pages of the Bacon report.  It is in the vaults of Dublin Castle and the proceedings of the Flood Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response to overseas development aid has been niggardly.  Organisations like Trócaire and Concern have demonstrated that there is a moral and humanitarian obligation on Ireland to reach the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as quickly as our public finances allow.  We, as a country, have failed to meet the earlier stated aid target of 0.4 per cent of GNP for 1997 &mdash; 0.31 per cent was achieved.  This is embarrassingly low in the context of Ireland's new found affluence. The Irish aid allocation for 1998, at 0.32 per cent of GNP, is the most marginal of increases.  Given our own history as a people it would be a travesty of that history if we were to join the complacency of the &ldquo;rich person's club&rdquo; rather than taking a progressive role with some of Europe's smaller, more enlightened countries in using development policy to make our contribution towards tackling dire poverty in the world.</P>
    <P>Nor is there any relief for the poverty options into which Minister O'Donnell has now thrust herself.  I bear the Minister no ill will, but I must confess that I look forward to Deputy O'Malley being elevated to the ministry of ODA.</P>
    <P>This is a crucially important day in the life of the country.  It is the one day in the year when politics is clearly shown to have enormous effect and consequences for everyone.  This is the one day on which political beliefs, instincts and ideology impact in a very real way on the lives of everyone living in the State.  Some journalists and commentators tend to promote the idea that the budget is old hat and that it is even a non-event, a bore.  It is not.</P>
    <P>At one level the budget is a technical exercise. It is another piece of the accountancy jigsaw for the public finances.  It is the revenue side of the equation with the Book of Estimates and the public capital programme representing spending decisions.  This is true but it is not the full story. On budget day the Government also changes policy. The Book of Estimates is cast on the basis of no policy change.  Budget day sees the policy changes on the spending side but also on the taxation side.  This is what puts budget day and politics at the centre of everyday life.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced policies today that affect the balance between rich and poor, high earners and lower earners, the low paid and the millionaires, the unemployed and the captains of industry and finance.  The Minister made changes today that affect the conditions of life in urban blackspots and in the salubrious suburbs.  He has instituted policies and measures that do or do not make life better for the home hunter and the homeless and affect the balance of power between such people and our new landlord class. The basis on which all of this power and influence <Col N="1357" /> is effected by the Minister is his political beliefs and ideology and the beliefs and ideology of his colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>What, in summary, can we say about the political beliefs of this Government on the basis of today's Financial Statement?  Where does it stand on the issues of poverty and wealth, the lower paid versus the big earners, the unemployed and the owners of wealth, the homeless and home seekers versus the builders and new landlord class?  Well, we know what the Minister has done &mdash; I detailed it earlier &mdash; for the rich people and the elite in this society.  The people at the bottom, those who are marginalised, poor and struggling to exist on allowances which many of us in this House would not survive on for one weekend, are invisible.  They are part of the hidden Ireland about which the Minister does not know anything and about whom the Government does not care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year's budget was a mission statement on behalf of the Government and set the tone for this Administration.  It deliberately and self-consciously set out to create an economic elite of super citizens, and it has succeeded somewhat. The number of people whose income exceeds £50,000 per annum has increased from 24,000 to almost 45,000 in recent years.  The number whose income exceeds £100,000 has increased from 4,000 to almost 7,000, while the number whose income exceeds £250,000 per annum has trebled from 400 in 1994 to almost 1,100 today. The Revenue Commissions informed me that they do not have accurate figures for the number earning upwards of £0.5 million per year but it is substantial.  This is marvellous news for those concerned.  They are the real beneficiary of that terrible cliché, the Celtic tiger.  There are, however, 60,000 people who subsist on incomes which have yet to reach levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare some 12 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pre-budget hype was all about how this budget would help those people &mdash; those on the margins of society.  It is an obvious attempt to correct the serious flaws of last year's effort.  It tries to put a human caring face on a Government whose primary task, it would seem, is to help the better off in society.  Members of the Government were clearly stung and embarrassed by the criticism heaped on them last year but it did not faze the Minister, who in his own brusque and populist manner dismissed the criticism as coming from what he called the poverty industry.  This is what some psychologists refer to as projection because nobody belongs to the poverty industry more than the Minister.  In fact, he is the chief executive of poverty plc.  This budget shows that his policies continue to widen the gap between rich and poor creating inequalities and perpetuating poverty.  It is a budget for the contented by the contented. Fianna Fáil is an expert at gauging the political climate.  It knows we have a culture of contentment and that those alienated and marginalised <Col N="1358" /> simply do not vote, so why bother too much with them?</P>
    <P>Above all, this is an accountants' budget. Fianna Fáil is the party of accountants.  Apparently, there are more accountants than any other profession among the ranks of Fianna Fáil TDs, including the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach. Accountants are fond of the bottom line.  I notice Deputy Ardagh, another accountant, has just left the Chamber.  The bottom line for the Minister is that he does not buy any of this nonsense about the redistribution of wealth.  He is an unreconstructed Thatcherite, a politician who is more PD than the Progressive Democrats themselves. As I learned today, he is something of a homespun philosopher as well.</P>
    <P>Those who expected real change in this budget will be bitterly disappointed.  This budget is about business as usual &mdash; big business as usual.  This is a budget which will keep the funds rolling into the coffers of Fianna Fáil from the contented and the well connected.  There is no vision of an inclusive, sustainable, well educated and healthy society because like his mentor, Margaret Thatcher, the Minister does not really believe in society.  He believes in markets, GDP and what were once known in this House as the fundamentals.</P>
    <P>This budget makes a mockery of the phrases &ldquo;people before politics&rdquo; or &ldquo;partnership with people&rdquo; because it will not tackle in a meaningful way the problems which confront people in their daily lives.  It merely tinkers around the edges of such problems as social exclusion, long-term unemployment, housing, the chaos in our health services, the underfunding of our primary schools, the terrible and worsening pollution and waste problems and our huge traffic problems, many of which stem from the so-called success of our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister accused some journalists of being somewhat liberal in their use of words like &ldquo;innovative&rdquo; and &ldquo;radical&rdquo;.  I do not suffer from that problem.  There is no long-term vision, innovation, radical or fundamental change.  This is not a budget which will improve quality of life, although it may superficially improve the standard of living for some, and this is a crucial distinction to which I will return.  Budget 1999 should not be judged by the yard stick of previous budgets.  It must be judged only in the context of the unprecedented opportunity the Minister enjoyed today to remedy many of society's ills. Using this criterion, he has failed.</P>
    <P>The budget's social welfare package is presented as an adequate intervention by the Government which has recorded a £1.3 billion revenue surplus for the year just ended.  When examined carefully we see that the increases, while marginally ahead of inflation, are well below wage increases and the rate of economic growth, which means social welfare recipients will remain well behind in the economic prosperity stakes.  Clearly, the rates announced today define what in the eyes of this Fianna Fáil-PD coalition <Col N="1359" /> Government is its acceptable level of poverty. What is even more disappointing is the position of those TDs who fooled the electorate in June of last year into voting for them as independents and who now support the Government's acceptable threshold of impoverishment as defined in today's budget.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional expenditure for the elderly but we must ask if it is enough.  These people contributed substantially over their hard working lives to the phenomenon of the Celtic tiger.  Many belong to the hard pressed PAYE sector and in stringent times they had to tighten their belts and carry the burden for society.  These increases do not come close to repaying them. More than one third of the Exchequer's revenue in 1998, as in many previous years, came from the PAYE sector.  It is simply indefensible that such revenue, when it is plentiful, should not generously support our elderly population.</P>
    <P>The Green Party stated that pensions should be increased to £100 per week and that the Christmas bonus should be paid at 100 per cent. This is an immediate practical step on the way to creating the universal base line of the guaranteed basic income.  What about those who look after the elderly and the sick &mdash; the carers who save millions in Exchequer spending annually?  Last year they got a bus pass, which showed the Minister's gratitude.  This year we see slight increases. My party believes it is time to abolish the means test for the carer's allowance.  That must be the bottom line, a phrase accountants are fond of using.</P>
    <P>A fundamental change in the social welfare system and in the attitude of the 1940s, which still informs so much of the social welfare law, is required.  This can only be done by prioritising the accelerated integration of the tax and social welfare systems to create a guaranteed basic income which provides full economic citizenship to all.</P>
    <P>What is the reasoning behind the wildly varying rates of child benefit for those parents dependent on social welfare payments?  Apart from being set at a low level, the range of child dependent increases is unequal.  An unemployed person receives a weekly child benefit rate of £13.20, while a person on a non-contributory widow's pension or deserted wife's allowance receives £15.20 and a person on a contributory widow's pension gets £17 child benefit per week.  The Green Party believes child benefit should be paid into the child's post office or credit union account once they are 16 years of age to familiarise them with prudent management of money.</P>
    <P>Many of our citizens are denied full citizenship through economic exclusion.  Their voices are not heard, their spending power is low and remedying their situation comes as an afterthought when the rich have been looked after.  Their housing, educational and occupational needs are neglected with the result that they are excluded from society and given a further sense of hopelessness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> The Green Party's proposal for a guaranteed basic income would do away with means testing and restrictions and create opportunities.  We welcome the move to introduce tax credits.  However, this is just one reform in a line of reforms and the logical extension would be the introduction of a guaranteed basic income.  A guaranteed basic income would provide every citizen with the needs to live comfortably.  The ending of means testing would mean the stigma and the seemingly inevitable cycle of poverty would be broken.  It would be the most equal and radical way to tackle unemployment, social exclusion and poverty.  It would lead the way out of the bureaucratic tangle which involves social welfare means testing, tax exemption thresholds and employment subsidies.</P>
    <P>The estimate of receipts and expenditure documented for the year ending 31 December 1999 shows personal income tax revenue is likely to produce £6.3 billion.  That is more than one third of the total expected take of £17.6 billion.  Whatever happens in the economy over the next 12 months, the PAYE sector is paying more than its fair share towards financing it, whether it is subsidies to multinationals locating here or the cost of tribunals into crooked land deals in north Dublin.</P>
    <P>On the revenue side, income tax reforms do not benefit those whose income is too low to pay income tax in the first place.  That is why the Green Party sees tax credits as just one reform in a continual process, the logical extension of which is the introduction of a guaranteed basic income scheme.  This should and could be achieved in the year 2000 budget.  With public finances currently in a healthy state, it is vital to introduce new reforms which will provide the basis for social equity and economic democracy in the future, including full citizenship for all as a central pillar of that economic policy.</P>
    <P>I will address the issue of widening the tax bands and lowering the tax rates.  I acknowledge that the Minister is heading in the right direction. However, the Green Party believes it is ludicrous that a single taxpayer pays the top rate of tax, PRSI and income levies on an income of less than £20,000.  The equivalent tax band in the UK is £32,000.  The Exchequer is too heavily dependent for its revenue on taxes levied on employment and on the creativity and ability of individuals. Taxation must be shifted progressively and determinedly off the backs of working men and women and towards non-renewables, such as carbon and phosphate taxes and green taxes in general.</P>
    <P>While the Green Party fully recognises the need to attract suitable businesses to Ireland, we do not accept that income earned by all companies should be taxed at the present tax haven rate. Companies which set up in Ireland must respect our people, environment and practices.  We would like to see the introduction of two rates of corporation tax, which would reflect the current tax rates paid on income.</P>
    <P>We would like to see Ireland develop as a world leader in green business where companies <Col N="1361" /> which meet the criteria on social and environmental issues would pay the lower rate, while those which do not take social and environmental issues into account would pay the higher level of tax.  We suggest a form of social auditing report which companies would have to publish every second year.  This would reflect the real impact companies have on society and it would produce the type of environment we have espoused for some time.</P>
    <P>The Government expected us to support many of its measures on green taxes.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has spoken for a long time and made the right noises about green taxes.  Green taxes are not an additional burden on the economy.  They reflect a shift in the existing tax burden.  Green taxes are not intended to increase taxation.  Simple measures would show that when the Government talks about the environment it is not dispelling hot air but is prepared to take action.</P>
    <P>The Green Party believes there is an urgent need to recognise that the environment needs green taxes.  The yearly tinkering with fuel prices is only skimming the surface of eco taxes. Environmentally disruptive activities, such as landfills and heavily pollutant industries, should be liable to a code of green taxes, whereas ecologically beneficial and socially responsible businesses should be encouraged by a low tax regime to promote entrepreneurship The burning of fossil fuels and oils should be subject to special taxation to discourage the use of these pollutants.</P>
    <P>Introducing green taxes on environmentally disruptive activities would give the financial incentive to use alternative sources of energy and move away from using landfill sites for waste disposal. The State should encourage the use of and research into alternative energy sources.  By eliminating VAT and excise duty on renewable energy, such as hydro, biomass and wind power, more producers and consumers would jump at the chance of using green methods to produce energy.</P>
    <P>The lip service currently paid to the traffic crisis does not come close to changing the mind-set of the car culture.  As house prices rocket, the car has become the ultimate status symbol.  This status symbol spends most of its time belching fumes and stuck in traffic jams with its owners demanding greater space and bigger roads.  By offering financial incentives and eliminating VAT and excise duty on public transport, the Government could make a firm statement on the need to move from private to public transport.</P>
    <P>A few green measures were outlined in today's budget which the Government, particularly the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, believes are good.  Vehicle registration tax on cars is a revenue raising exercise.  I do not have any qualms about it, but is it a green tax?  Will it mean fewer people will drive cars?  I have no doubt we will raise substantial sums of money.  If we had hypothecated taxes and used them to <Col N="1362" /> invest directly in public transport, we could talk about green taxation.</P>
    <P>We have to invest heavily in public transport but I see no such commitment in the budget.  One of the figures often given is that we waste about £1.3 billion annually because of gridlock in Dublin. We need radical measures but I do not see such measures in the budget.  Deputy Dempsey has spoken about these issues and there is a committee on green taxation.  The Minister is sincere but the stumbling block appears to be the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a carbon tax.  This may be introduced at the insistence of the European Commission, but we are slow to take this issue on board.  We are slow introducing such measures at out peril.  Deputy McDowell has shown that we face huge liabilities if we do not meet our commitments under the Kyoto agreement.  The Deputy plagiarised me a little when he said that Deputy Dempsey could not tax his way out of a plastic bag.  However, he is correct when he says that if we fail to meet our commitments under the Kyoto agreement, we will be forced to trade carbon credits.  There are various reports from the ESRI which state that we will exceed carbon emissions by about 25 million tonnes.  The penalty is $40 per tonne so one can see that we will owe between $500 million and $1 billion.  This will place severe pressure on the Exchequer and we need to sort out this problem very quickly.  It is not being addressed in the budget and I hope the Minister will not put this on the long finger.  We must sort out this problem between 2008 and 2012.</P>
    <P>I welcome the park and ride facilities.  The monthly travel passes are also welcome but we should go further and offer these free travel passes to ordinary commuters who could offset this benefit against their taxes.  This would be a better move.  However, today's announcement is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's difficulties concerning benefit-in-kind on car parking spaces.  This is always a contentious issue.  The Minister referred to the fact that his civil servants were enjoying certain privileges.  One need only look at the so-called temporary car park on Leinster Lawn.  I doubt if this is temporary and believe it will be permanent structure.  However, this issue must be tackled.  We will not solve the environmental crisis by small measures.  We have to make hard decisions which will be uncomfortable for people but that is the situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the move on LPG but I wish it had been extended to compressed natural gas.  I also hope that all such excise duties will be reduced, including those on public transport.  This is the sort of encouragement which the public transport sector requires but has not received.  We are moving very slightly in the right direction and it would be churlish of me not to welcome that move. However, there is also the issue of a tax on plastic bags which has not been tackled.  Deputy Dempsey has to rattle the cages a little more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course and I am happy to do so.  I am not in Opposition for the sake of it.  I believe in constructive opposition and I hope my comments will be taken in that spirit.</P>
      <P>We need leadership which will tackle these problems.  We need someone with the vision to introduce this tax which must be introduced to comply with the international commitments Ireland signed up to in Kyoto.  The Government said it would reduce emissions of six greenhouse gases, including CO2, CFCs and methane.  We need to see action now.</P>
      <P>A green tax regimé would make the use of alternative sources of energy much more viable and likely to make an impact on the environment. The Minister claimed that these taxes could fuel inflation.  However, that is not the case.  There are numerous studies, such as those by the Wupperdahl Institute and the ESRI, which indicate that such a tax would dampen the overheating of the economy.  This has been referred to by Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  This is a new idea of which people are afraid.  Economists need to look at this issue and the fact that the overall effect of green taxation would be enormously beneficial.</P>
      <P>We have seen what happens when farming becomes big business &mdash; animals suffer, disease is rife and confidence in the products from our land is shattered.  Farmers who decide to move from mass production and chemically-dependant forms of modern farming and convert to certified organic, bio-dynamic farming should be encouraged by additional incentive tax credits over five years.  Phosphates need to be taxed because of the damage they do to the environment and to our lakes and rivers.  The idea of a land tax should also receive serious consideration in the interests of economic stability and sustainability.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ó Cuív stated that the movement of people to cities was contributing to many social problems.  This is an important point but there is not a single penny for rural resettlement in the budget.  This means that we will get more people coming into the city; a greater housing crisis and more gridlock.  Rural resettlement was one of the founding principles of Fianna Fáil but has been thrown to one side.  Fianna Fáil should go back to the drawing board for next year's budget and invest in rural resettlement.</P>
      <P>As regards housing, we need to recognise the link between income and the living environment. It comes as no surprise that pockets of poverty have the poorest surroundings.  We need to create a healthy living environment for all, regardless of income or social status.  The right to inhale safe air and drink fresh water should not be confined to those who have cash to buy a healthy environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Party believes that there is a need for capital funding for housing associations providing long-lease tenure according to the European <Col N="1364" /> model.  This would mean giving people in rented accommodation an alternative to uncontrollable private landlords who can pick and choose between prospective tenants, leaving the poorest and most vulnerable in untenable situations where rents are high and the quality of housing is low.  Many people are coming on to housing lists because landlords are getting good prices for their houses and put up the rent from one day to the next.  I have raised this issue with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on many occasion but I see no commitment in the budget to deal with this massive crisis.</P>
    <P>The issue of child care has been disgracefully ignored despite the Government's commitments prior to the election.  We do not see that investment. All of these problems are interrelated because there are so many situations in which both parents must work to keep up with mortgage repayments.  However, what are they to do with their children?  The situation is scandalous and very little attention has been paid to this issue. The Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Flood, by appearing at a march in which I took part some weeks ago, indicated that this issue would be addressed in the budget.  However, it has not been properly addressed.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to increase the level of funding for the personal assistants scheme to make the service available to all who need it.  This would go some way towards ending the isolation of disabled people who are trapped in their own homes.  Personal assistants receive a paltry financial return for their hard and crucial work and are often forced to work outside health and safety regulations because the funds for aids and appliances falls far short of what is crucially needed.</P>
    <P>Half of the country's students are in primary schools but Government funding does not reflect this.  Only a quarter of spending on education goes to primary education.  Class sizes affect the way children learn.  We must guarantee that the pupil-teacher ratio will be kept as low as possible. When pupil numbers fall teachers should be redeployed to lower the teacher-pupil ratio even further rather than being forced into retirement. To create an environment in which children can learn well, the need of every schoolchild must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Green Party is committed to an increase in teacher support services.  Remedial teachers should be shared by no more than three small schools.  The failure to provide safe routes to schools leads to the practice of parents driving children to school adding hundreds of cars to our roads.  Lack of support for primary schools is a huge problem in my own constituency and particularly in disadvantaged areas.  The Breaking the Cycle programme has not been extended and other support programmes have been ignored.  At the present rate of investment it will take at least <Col N="1365" /> 30 years for funding for the primary sector to catch up with that for secondary schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance had an unprecedented opportunity to deal with the problems I have outlined but he has not dealt with them adequately.  The Minister gave us some homespun philosophy but he must consider concepts such as quality of life.  The Government of the United Kingdom has introduced indicators which will measure quality of life.  The Minister has concentrated on the standard of living and has only measured economic factors.  We need to take account of what some economists now refer to as sustainability indicators and quality of life indicators to see how well we are really doing.  If we examine the indicators for areas such as the environment, housing and education we may find we are not doing as well as we would like to think.</P>
    <P>The Government may put a spin on its achievements and congratulate itself but many people are not benefiting from the country's success. This budget has not achieved as much as it might have done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Financial Resolution No. 1:</P>
      <P>(1) THAT in this Resolution&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; means the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 (No. 22 of 1972);</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Act of 1998&rdquo; means the Finance Act, 1998 (No. 3 of 1998).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) THAT the rate of value-added tax on the supply of livestock and live greyhounds and the hire of horses be increased from 3.6 per cent. to 4 per cent.  of the taxable amount or value of such goods and services, and that, accordingly, the Principal Act be amended in subsection <Col N="1366" /> (1) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1992 (No. 9 of 1992)) of section 11 by the substitution in paragraph (<i>f</i>) of &ldquo;4 per cent.&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.6 per cent.&rdquo; (inserted by the Act of 1998).</P>
    <P>(3) THAT the rate of flat-rate addition to prices of agricultural produce or agricultural services supplied by unregistered farmers be increased from 3.6 per cent.  to 4 per cent., and that, accordingly, section 12A (inserted by the Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978 (No. 34 of 1978)) of the Principal Act be amended by the substitution in subsection (1) of &ldquo;4 per cent.&rdquo; for &ldquo;3.6 per cent.&rdquo; (inserted by the Act of 1998).</P>
    <P>(4) THAT this Resolution shall have effect as on and from the 1st day of March, 1999.</P>
    <P>(5) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This resolution provides an increase from 3.6 per cent to 4 per cent in the level of the flat rate farmers' refund together with a similar change in the VAT rate on livestock, live greyhounds and the hire of horses.</P>
    <P>The flat rate scheme is a simplified and practical method of applying value added tax to farming. It compensates unregistered farmers on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on their purchases of goods and services.  This is achieved without applying the normal VAT rules on registration, record keeping and returns.</P>
    <P>The amount of the flat rate is arrived at by calculating the VAT payable on agricultural inputs as a percentage of agricultural sales.  The Revenue Commissioners have calculated on the basis of macro-economic data for the past three years that a flat rate of 4 per cent is now needed to achieve full compensation.</P>
    <P>Traditionally the VAT rate on all livestock has been retained at the same level as the flat rate addition.  This is administratively more convenient for farmers and their customers.  These changes will have effect from 1 March 1999 and are worth £10.76 million in a full year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>This increase in VAT rebate will mostly benefit unregistered farmers.  They are on average farmers of a lower income than the combined total of farmers, both registered and unregistered.  The Government had an opportunity to recognise the serious income situation faced by these farmers in deciding the level of rebate.  I am disappointed it has not chosen to grant a larger VAT rebate to the farming community given its circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is extremely severe across a range of products.  Farmers face a situation where, in the case of beef, for example, it is not possible to make money.  The only way an income can be obtained is through the cheque in the post.  The product is losing money and that is not a sustainable <Col N="1367" /> situation.  No self-respecting of group of people will want to stay in what was the self-reliant enterprise of farming when they now rely for their entire income on cheques from the Government.  Current development of agriculture is turning rural Ireland into a form of Indian reservation where people are being paid to stay down on the reservation.  That is the effect of the cheque in the post.  It is an Indian reservation policy.  That is not a very inspiring policy for any industry.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity in 1980 to visit an Indian reservation in Nebraska.  If that is where Irish agriculture is heading, it is not where I would like to see a self-reliant community heading.  At 1 o'clock in the middle of the day the streets on that reservation were deserted, but there was a sound coming from one building, which happened to be the bar.  I opened the door and the place was packed.  The entire population of the reservation was in the bar at 1 o'clock in the day.  The place stank with the smell of people who did not have adequate sanitary facilities in their homes. That is what reservation living does to people who get a cheque in the post from Washington or Brussels and are paid to stay on the reservation. As far as agriculture is concerned, we are heading towards the creation of a reservation in rural Europe where people are being paid to be on the land.  That is no way to go.  Coming from that community, I can recall at time when no one was more proud of their self-reliance than farmers, but that is no longer the case.</P>
    <P>While I do not expect it would have been possible for the Government to resolve the problems I am addressing, irrespective of what it did in respect of the higher VAT rebate with which we are dealing, an opportunity has been lost here to do something about addressing them.  The Fine Gael Party will not support this resolution, not because we disagree with the thrust of it but because it is so completely inadequate in comparison to the crisis being experienced in rural Ireland at present.  We have no way other than opposing this resolution to express our sense of protest at the Government's inertia in facing this very difficult income situation for people who are relying on food production from the land for their living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris:</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Bruton's concern about the people of rural Ireland who have suffered dramatically in so many different ways in recent months.  Today's budget will not have brought those people any sustenance.  There is a &ldquo;live horse and you'll get grass&rdquo; promise of something in the small holders assistance scheme, but we must wait for the social welfare Bill to see what that will bring.  There are many farming sectors where incomes are so low that they are almost insignificant and those farmers have become almost dependent on the cheque in the post.  While such money is essential for them to live, it is ruining the spirit of farmers in rural <Col N="1368" /> Ireland who want to work.  They have an instinct to work and derive satisfaction from working irrespective of the income they get.  However, our policies are geared towards farmers not doing anything.  People who have tried to rear pigs have become bankrupt under the present system.</P>
      <P>The resolution mentions live greyhounds, livestock generally and the hiring of horses for riding. Those are sensitive areas because they include some of the main alternative enterprises in which farmers, who cannot produce anything else, engage.  They may breed greyhounds and hire out horses to tourists.  The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation will realise that the south east region recently launched an equine tourism oriented enterprise, which involves the provision of horses for tourists.  Any changing of the VAT rates in respect of these areas would be dangerous.</P>
      <P>I will oppose this financial resolution on the principle of what is proposed and because of the segment of our community it will affect.  We should stop and think of our responsibilities to the people of rural Ireland.  We all talk about them, about how important they are, but we have done very little for them at a time of economic boom when we could have done something for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the previous speakers in saying there was very little in the budget for the farming community and the majority of my constituents. I do not wish to repeat points that were made, but I agree with the comments of my party leader, Deputy Bruton, and Deputy Ferris.</P>
      <P>A recent survey carried out in my constituency among the farming community shows that 63 per cent of farm families in my constituency earn £10,000 a year or less.  When that income figure is compared to the average industrial wage of £15,000, it sends out a message that the state of affairs is very poor among the farming community. Of that 63 per cent, 40 per cent of family farms in my constituency have an income of £5,000 or less.  Nothing the Minister for Finance said this afternoon has given the farming community any confidence or hope.</P>
      <P>A County Offaly farmer who called to my constituency clinic last week told me, and he was rather embarrassed about this, that for the first time ever Santa Claus would not be visiting his family because of the fall in farm incomes.  Farmers are losing their dignity because of the manner in which agricultural policy has been totally ignored by the Government.  That should have been addressed today by the Minister for Finance. He had an opportunity to offer some hope to the farming community, but he did not take it. The Minister for Agriculture and Food must stand accused of presiding over a Department that has done very little to encourage, and has very little to offer, farming.  Today's budget offers nothing to the farming community and that is most regrettable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken in this House on numerous occasions about a particular segment of farmers, most of whom will get an increase of 3.6 per cent to 4 per cent in the VAT refund. One must exceed an income threshold to be registered for VAT, but hardly one of our 100,000 dry stock farmers is registered for it.  A method should be found to allocate additional moneys to them.</P>
      <P>A total of 75 per cent of farmers in County Westmeath are dry stock farmers.  A recent survey indicates that approximately 60 per cent of farmers earn an income of £110 a week or less. Recently a detailed survey commissioned by the IFA and carried out by Jim Phelan, a very reputable man, revealed that a total of 37,000 farmers are in danger of extinction.  The budget does not offer one whit of help to any of those farmers. The Minister should not try to deceive the people.  There is more for a gambler in the budget, £20 million odd, than the £15 million given to farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of £15 million was distributed to a large segment of farmers.  Who does the Minister think he is fooling?  He is not fooling anybody.  I have been talking to dry stock farmers, some of whom have told me privately they are finding it very hard to survive.  That is not a bit foolish, Deputy Power.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see the tax on betting reduced because I go racing, but at the end of the day priorities are important.  Let us take another example.  Are we encouraging young people into farming?  Is a miserable £2 million great encouragement for young people, or am I being fooled about that as well?  Seven hundred farmers are in limbo.  If one multiplies 700 by £5,600 it comes to £4 million.  How many new farmers will be taken into the installation aid scheme?  Where are the people who have been left in limbo or in suspension?  Is that the situation or am I misleading anybody?  Those facts were given to us in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>If I was supposed to be talking nonsense on the last matter, let us see the Government repudiate this one.  Seven hundred young farmers, under 35, are in limbo because they were left in a state of suspension when the installation aid was suspended. There is an extra £2 million in today's budget for them, but is that all we are going to do?  Is there any extra money for them?  We need £8 million immediately for installation aid.</P>
      <P>That is accepted by the Minister.  He knows that. I am speaking for young farmers and people in my constituency who want to get into farming.  I explained this to the Minister who is not surprised by it.  People in rural areas are in a difficult situation and I will continue to make that point, although many people might not like me doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>We provided £10 million for it. Some £5,700 per annum will be available to young farmers to help and encourage them into farming.  That is on top of the restoration of the control of farmyard pollution scheme, which was terminated by the rainbow Government.  I was glad to be in a position to restore it so that farmers could keep up to date with the very best in the EU.  That scheme will cost an additional £25 million, which is in addition to the dairy hygiene scheme, which Deputies will recall was also terminated by the rainbow Government.  That represents a total of £36 million for on-farm investment.  I am pleased that turns around the particularly negative attitude to farmers that prevailed before I arrived on the scene.</P>
      <P>An old sore had existed for some considerable time where farmers had been paying RSI for less than ten years.  Despite the fact that representations were made to resolve that anomaly, it took the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to resolve that difficulty in the last few weeks at a cost of £18 million.

      <P>That is on top of a £20 million fodder scheme for farmers, which acknowledges the difficulty we had with excess rainfall this year.  I was pleased today to hear the president of the main farming organisation on television including the word &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; in his response to that range of initiatives.  I expect any reasonably fair-minded person would have made the same generous response.</P>
      <P>Along with all those measures, because of the front loading of the various headage schemes under the rainbow Coalition, the Structural Funds for headage had run out.  Deputies will have noted a figure of £110 million to ensure headage was paid to the least well off &mdash; those people in disadvantaged areas, including the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taken together, all those measures account for well in excess of £2,000 million, at least half of which is going directly into farmers' pockets.  The <Col N="1372" /> remainder is for on-farm investment, schemes and assistance of various kinds.  This budget will be immensely helpful to the farming community because 80,000 people will be taken out of the tax net.  Medical card applicants over 70 will get an additional one third on to the guidelines to help them qualify for medical cards.  Married people over 65 can earn an income of £13,000 per annum before they enter the tax net.  Farmers will benefit from all those measures.  As well as the general good health of the economy and low inflation, there is a considerable amount in this budget for agriculture and the farming community generally.  The measures relating to on-farm investment and the restoration of the scheme of installation aid for young farmers constitute general support for the least well off.</P>
    <P>The farm assistance scheme will be tremendously beneficial to farmers with seven or eight cows and a quota of 13,000 or 14,000 gallons who exceed their quota in September or October and have no cash flow or income until the following May. There is up to £50 million for this scheme.  A farmer with two children and an income from any source, inside or outside of farming, of, say, £100 per week will get £61 per week under the farm assistance scheme, compared with only £38 per week under the old farmer's dole or unemployment assistance for smallholders.  This will be of benefit to double the number of farmers who benefited under the old farmer's dole.  About 7,000 farmers benefited under the small farmer's assistance scheme, but 14,000 farmers will benefit under this new scheme, and some will get double the amount.  It will be skewed in favour of family farms while the smallholder's assistance scheme was more beneficial to single people living on their own.  I am very pleased that an additional £15 million, on top of what was spent on smallholder's assistance, is being made available in this budget.</P>
    <P>Taking all those measures into account, this is a good budget for farmers.  It is recognised as such by the farming organisations.  We will continue to do more.  I will be here at 9.30 a.m. tomorrow to move a motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I have been a Member of this House for a long time, and it is not usual, in a time-limited debate on the financial resolutions on budget night, for Ministers to take up so much time.  This is usually time reserved for backbenchers on both sides of the House.  The Minister is setting a bad precedent. He will have ample opportunities to get publicity for his views and he should not be taking the time that is available to other Members.</P>

      <P>I listened with amazement to the fake indignation expressed in the Chamber, particularly by the Labour Party and Deputy Penrose, its spokesperson on agriculture.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I am happy the socialist voice has not been drowned out by the spat between the two wings of the big farmers organisations.  I am opposing this measure because it is contemptible.  It reflects the utterly cynical approach of the Government to the whole question of taxation, including farmer taxation. There is an important issue concerning farmer taxation.  The nub of the issue is that for decades a minority elite of the farming community &mdash; the big farmers, the ranchers &mdash; have skimmed the fat from the Brussels gravy train with virtually no comeback to the taxpayer and the Exchequer while, for some time, small farmers have suffered. I am not surprised the Minister for Agriculture and Food could say the farming organisations welcome some of the measures implemented, given that those organisations represent the wealthy farmers.  They do not represent the small farmers in west Kerry, Connemara, Wicklow, etc. The issue of farmer taxation, which is that the ranchers should be required to pay their due share, is not addressed in the budget nor in this contemptible resolution.</P>
      <P>The reality is that this budget has the Progressive Democrats mark written all over it.  Already tonight on Radio na Gaeltachta, where I sat beside a Progressive Democrats Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, he boasted about the gap opened up between those on social welfare and those at work.  What a shameful approach by a Minister of State.  The £3 per week crumb to the unemployed person by contrast with some modest measures which were overdue to the low paid and middle income worker was boasted by a Minister of State.  That is contemptible but is in line with the Progressive Democrats philosophy whereby the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> Tánaiste, presiding over this debate, has stood over and engineered the policy of morally intimidating people on the dole, out to work or at cheap labour to satisfy the call from the corporate whingers and the small firms association in the west that they do not have enough people to work for starvation wages.  That is what is at stake.  What the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy meant, was that the level of wages and social welfare is deliberately kept at respectively low levels so that people will be forced to work for slave wages.  That is what is behind this budget.  It is shameful.</P>
    <P>Issues on farmer taxation and the horse industry are barely referred to in this motion.  There are real issues that should be addressed.  For example, why did the budget in its alleged desire for taxation justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Why did the Government not shift the VAT burden to that section of the horse industry, the stud farm industry which is tax free?  How can a horse such as Sadlers Wells earn about £15 million per year in cover fees without a penny being paid in tax? There is no reference to that in the budget.  A lady in my constituency who has to clean at night and earns £120 per week must pay every penny of taxation due.  That is shameful.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed the budget did not address the fodder problem.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food did not have an opportunity to visit west Limerick.  In fairness, his Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, visited the area and could see at first hand the tragedy arising from the fodder crisis.  Many people regarded the Minister's response of approximately £300 per farmer as a derisory attempt at assisting them.  I had anticipated there would have been a more positive response in the budget.  I come from a constituency where the Government has almost introduced a form of apartheid.  Limerick did not satisfy the criteria for Objective One status.  I respect the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who spoke on this issue initially and indicated his disappointment.  Subsequently we heard a different side of the story from the Minister.  It is a tragedy that Limerick was bypassed as it is contiguous to Kerry and Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government thinks it is codding the people of west Limerick, it is not.  They know the Government's attitude and its approach to date. It was bad enough that the whole area of west Limerick, from Newcastlewest to Abbeyfeale and all the surrounding areas suffered during the summer <Col N="1384" /> and now has a fodder crisis.

However, if they want an indication of people's thoughts on farming and the Government's action in respect of it they should discuss this matter with the Teagasc officials who are dealing with the situation on the ground and the people who have finished their three year certificate programmes and consider the progression for the future and the number of people who will complete their farm certificates and enter a career in farming.

      <P>When one considers the decisions the Government was obliged to make in drafting the budget, it is obvious they involved trying to strike a balance. Deputy Donal Carey asked whether we thought farmers &ldquo;got enough&rdquo; from the budget. No sector, be it education, justice or another area, got enough because the Government was intent on striking a balance.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it must be remembered that this refund is worth £92 million per year to farmers and today's decision will mean an additional £11 million.  Deputy John Bruton asked why this could not be calculated on the previous year's data.  I would have no problem with that but, unfortunately, under the sixth VAT directive we are precluded from doing so.  Part III of that directive states that such percentages shall be based on macroeconomic statistics for flat rate farmers alone for the preceding three years only. Clearly it cannot be calculated on the basis of the previous year's data.</P>

      <P>If it could be calculated in that way, the Government would have done so.  We have done everything possible to assist farmers during this difficult period.  As already stated, it is worth £92 million which means farmers will receive an additional £11 million.</P>
      <P>Deputy Joe Higgins is in a unique position because he and Deputy John Bruton seem to be the only party leaders who do not support reducing the top rate of tax.  I congratulate Deputy Higgins on converting Deputy Bruton to his policies. He obviously has not yet converted him to his views on agriculture.  That will be the challenge he faces during the coming year.</P>

    <P>This resolution provides for excise duty increases on tobacco products from midnight tonight, which when VAT is included, amount to 5p on a packet of 20 cigarettes with <i>pro-rata</i> increases on other tobacco products.  This increase is expected to yield £0.91 million in 1998 and £13.2 million in a full year.  As the House will be aware, cigarettes have a significant weighting on the consumer price index and this increase is expected to increase the CPI by an estimated .077 per cent. It is expected that the increase of 5p will reduce projected cigarette consumption by 0.43 per cent compared to what it would otherwise have been. The Government remains very concerned about smoking and its impact on health.  This increase may help discourage smoking, particularly by younger people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is there such a small increase given that this product is far more damaging to people's health than a number of drugs distributed by people gardaí spend a great deal of time seeking to detect?  We face a serious choice in our society.  It is possible, through the tax system, to discourage activities which are not socially beneficial.  It is certainly the case that cigarette smoking is not socially beneficial.  The Government has similarly dodged the issue as far as global warming is concerned, where they have backed off any significant measures to discourage activities which cause Ireland to breach its limits under the Kyoto Accord.  Here we have another example in the case of cigarettes where the Government is putting popularity in the short-term against the better long-term interests of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will not oppose this Financial Resolution.  However, we see the 5p increase as somewhat niggardly in the context of the real objective.  It is not a Revenue measure <i>per se</i>&mdash; it should be a health measure.  Given that some 6,000 people die in this country every year from smoking induced ailments, whether they are cardiovascular or respiratory, the Minister should have done something more substantial. <Col N="1391" /> I did smoke but I learned the folly of my ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are working on the Whip. Against the background of the health problems related to smoking, the fact that so many young people continue to take up the habit, particularly young girls, putting 5p on 20 cigarettes will not make any difference to the number of new smokers. A more imaginative approach should be taken in next year's budget.  The Whip is now suggesting it should be as much as £2 per packet next year.  I do not think that is necessary, but a substantial amount would act as a deterrent to young people taking up smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can remember a time in this House when on budget night all the Opposition parties, no matter which party was in Government, automatically voted against the increase in tobacco products.  It is a sign of the times that this side of the House will not vote against this increase.  However, it is a derisory gesture.  Tobacco products are addictive.  They are poisoning thousands of teenage children across the length and breadth of this country and are setting the seal for a large number of people suffering serious cardiac illnesses and cancer.  We have 6,500 deaths a year from smoking related illnesses. This Government has no policy to deal with tobacco sales.  It has no commitment towards preventing and discouraging our young people from becoming tobacco addicted before they reach their adult years, despite the fact the law prohibits the sale of tobacco products to people under 18 years.</P>
      <P>At a time when other countries, particularly the United States, are forcing tobacco companies into multi-billion pound settlements to compensate for the damage they have done over decades to the health of the young and old, this Government is sitting around thinking about the issue, doing nothing.  It is a disgrace.  Now we know, without a shadow of doubt, the impact of tobacco and its addictive nature as a drug, this House and the Government has a duty to take far more radical action than it is taking to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of the health committee which has had hearings attended by a number of the tobacco companies based in this State.  They have treated members of the committee with nothing short of contempt by constantly denying the true health impact of their tobacco products and pretending to be unaware of the irrefutable scientific evidence of the dangers posed by their products to every member of the population in this State who smokes.  It might be too late to prevent some adults addicted to tobacco from smoking.  All we can do is discourage them.  However, we can have <Col N="1392" /> a policy to prevent our young people becoming addicted.  This Government has no policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power:</NameTxt>
      <P>If one considers tobacco price increases in previous budgets, Governments always say they are concerned about the health of the nation.  It is a difficult balance to strike as many people including old people are addicted to cigarettes and tobacCo. For some people, it is their little pleasure.  I am glad the increase announced today is not as severe as some of the Deputies here would want it to be.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge and welcome the contributions the Opposition has made to this debate.  It is nice to see change taking place in the House.  If we are serious about the health of the nation, we must quickly introduce a ban on tobacco advertising.  Millions of pounds are spent on sexy advertisements to recruit young people, because their older customers are dying.  It is as simple as that.  We must treat this matter seriously.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I am opposed to this resolution, particularly because of the cynicism of the Government in using the cover of the health of our people to put it forward.  That is not the motivation of the Government.  It is only a revenue raising measure.  Raising the price of cigarettes by 5p per packet will not protect the health of the nation.  Unfortunately, the acutely high price of heroin has not protected thousands of our youth over the past 15 years from addiction.</P>
      <P>Nicotine is a dangerous and addictive drug. Smoking is a despicable habit.  In case I am accused of hypocrisy, I should say that I would smoke a cigar maybe three times a year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I must make that admission although I would not smoke in company or in an enclosed room but out in the air where I do not contribute to poisoning other people.</P>
      <P>In practical terms this increase will hit the pockets of working class people and particularly unemployed people and poor people.  Unfortunately, the reality of life under the present system is that because of the stresses and strains of life many of our people, particularly those who are struggling on the margin, turn to smoking among things for relief, albeit a false relief, which is widely available to poor people.  The more expensive pleasures are not widely available to poor people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Taoiseach was serious about directing the attention of the Government towards the health of our people, he would propose, for example, a modest 100 per cent VAT on cigarette advertising on glossy magazines, billboards, etc.  or he would ban it.  Why has the Government not banned <Col N="1393" /> cigarette advertising rather than put forward this pathetic and lame excuse of a contribution towards the health of our people?  I hope the next Government spokesperson will address this issue.</P>
    <P>Thousands of people are seriously ill as a result of becoming addicted to nicotine.  They need to take up valuable health care time because of the acute diseases which arise from addiction to nicotine. Unfortunately, thousands die painfully from this addiction.  If the Government was serious, it would introduce a real policy and not insult the people with the glib argument that this increase is in the interest of the health of our people.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of prohibitionism.  It does not work on most fronts.  However, I am in favour of an imaginative and even aggressive campaign against nicotine, directing people away from this drug through education and a change in lifestyle.</P>
    <P>If the main political parties &mdash; I include Fine Gael in this &mdash; were really interested in the health of our people and the threat posed by nicotine addiction, they would be in favour of the type of radical changes which would change life for so many of our people so that they could move away from poverty, deprivation, pressure of all kinds, bad housing and agonising and suffering on the housing lists.  In moving away from these problems, many of the pressures which lead to nicotine addiction and other addictions would be overcome.  Then I would be convinced about their seriousness.</P>
    <P>If the Government wanted to raise this £13 million in revenue, instead of coming back to mainly working class and poor people I suggest they could have saved the £9 million in 1999 as a result of the cut in corporation tax, the £125 million in the year 2000 and the £132 million in a full year.  If they had left the corporations and the super rich paying taxation at that level which is already modest instead of giving them these savings, then perhaps we could direct more resources towards the health of our people and towards eliminating the causes of ill health including nicotine addiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to leave when I heard the Taoiseach state that this resolution was an anti-drug proposal.  I have not heard so much hypocrisy in quite a long time.  It was being proposed to encourage people not to smoke, as an anti-drug proposal, because alcohol, nicotine and drugs are all inter-related.  When I heard the Taoiseach saying this and I contrast it with the attitudes of some of his Ministers to other proposals on drug prevention, it sticks in the craw.</P>
      <P>Today the Minister announced a drug prevention allocation of £500,000 for one project which has been left waiting for a year and a half while costs were escalating, that is the North-West Ridge Project on which the Taoiseach cut a sod recently.  They were left waiting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Financial Resolution No. 3 provides for an excise duty reduction on auto liquid petroleum gas which, when VAT is included, amounts to approximately 1.8p on a litre with effect from midnight tonight.  The decrease is expected to cost <Col N="1395" /> the Exchequer approximately £5,000 in 1998 and almost £100,000 in a full year.  The effect on the CPI will be negligible.</P>
    <P>The change is also expected to increase consumption of auto LPG by almost 2.5 per cent. Auto LPG is an environmentally friendly fuel. Reduction in the rate will encourage greater use of this cleaner product as a road fuel.</P>
    <P>Financial Resolution No. 4 changes the structure of the vehicle registration tax for private cars in category A. It makes the following changes: the tax will now have three separate rates based on engine capacity which replaces the existing two rate system; the rate of tax on cars of less than 1,401 cylinder capacity remains the same at 22.5 per cent of the open market selling price, as determined by the Revenue Commissioners, and for all other cars, the new system means a rate increase.</P>
    <P>This change will bring in significant extra revenue to the Exchequer but the change in rates is not intended solely as a revenue raising measure. Instead, these changes are a first response to the undoubted environmental impact of motoring in terms of air pollution, traffic congestion and fuel consumption.</P>
    <P>The new structure will mean that for cars with an engine of a cylinder capacity of up to 1,4000cc, the rate of vehicle registration tax will be 22.5 per cent.  This is the existing rate for these cars under the current system.  For cars with an engine of a cylinder capacity of 1,401cc to 2,000cc, the rate of VRT will be 30 per cent.  This represents an increase from the current rate of 22.5 per cent. For cars with an engine of a cylinder capacity of 2,001cc and over, the rate of VRT will be 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>This means that for cars with an engine of a cylinder capacity exceeding 2,000cc, but not exceeding 2,5000 cc, the rate is increased from 22.5 per cent to 30 per cent and for cars with an engine of a cylinder capacity exceeding 2,500cc, the rate is increased from 28 per cent to 30 per cent.  The new structure will come into operation with effect from midnight on 31 December 1998. The Exchequer yield from these changes is estimated at £43 million in a full year.  It is estimated that these measures will increase the consumer price index by just under 0.1 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not oppose Financial Resolution No. 3, but I will oppose Financial Resolution No. 4 on the grounds that to increase the tax on cars at this time is wrong since there is no adequate transport policy to provide an alternative for people to get to and from work other than by using a car.  The public bus service is inadequate and not adequately supported by public funds.  The bus fleet is extremely old and many areas do not have adequate routes.  New suburbs, in particular, are not being adequately serviced by a bus service.  Reports on the rail service show that it is unsafe and investment is not being made to deal with this matter on an adequate basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> If the additional taxation on cars was used to fund a substantial enhancement of the bus and rail services, one might have a somewhat easier conscience in supporting such measures.  The Government is seriously failing on the issue of traffic.  We acknowledge the traffic problem has been brought about by our economic success.  The almost 50 per cent growth in our economy in the past five or six years has created a greater demand on our infrastructure.  This demand has to be met by radical action by the Government to reorientate traffic into public transport.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect people to use public transport and leave their cars at home unless there is an adequate, clean and modern public transport system.  People are used to a certain level of comfort nowadays in their cars.  Cars have more modern conveniences than they had 15 or 20 years ago.  People will not leave their cars at home and travel on a dirty rattling bus.  They will expect the same level of comfort on a bus or train as they get in their cars, in which they do not have to stand leaning on somebody or perhaps squeezed in, as is the case on the DART in the mornings and evenings.  We cannot coherently ask people to leave their cars at home unless we have proper public transport.</P>
    <P>We oppose this increase in vehicle registration tax because it is being misapplied.  If the money was used to put in place a proper public transport service, we might not object to it.  I already indicated that I was disappointed at the Government's failure to tackle the green taxation issue, to acknowledge that tax is an instrument for changing behaviour and to deal with the issues publicly flagged by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>This Government has reached a point where Ministers think it is credit worthy for them to indicate they will put a matter to their colleagues. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, obviously felt he was gaining some kudos by telling the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> about all his ambitions for green taxation. We now know he failed to get any of his ideas accepted at the Cabinet table.  This issue has been kicked off to the social partners which is a sure guarantee it will not happen, because everyone must agree before anything is done in that particular context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an awful slight on the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are obliged to deal with the green taxation issue under the requirements of the Kyoto agreement.  Ireland, as an economy, could face serious fines and structural difficulties in the first decade of the next century.  We may have to close one or two of our electricity generating stations because we will be exceeding the global warming limits agreed at Kyoto, to which the Government signed up.  There is a possibility that the ESB will have to close one part of Moneypoint because that is the only way Ireland <Col N="1397" /> can keep within the limits we agreed.  If that happens, it will be because we did not prepare in time.</P>
      <P>We could have done something by aggressively investing in public transport while at the same time discouraging private motoring.  We could have done something to reduce global warming in good time and avoid what may transpire to be a very serious economic crisis in the first decade of the next century because of our failure to comply with the Kyoto agreement.</P>
      <P>The ultimate environmental damage being done to the planet by global warming is one of the most serious justice issues in modern times. From our economy's point of view, it is an exceptionally serious issue because we have entered into international commitments which could poleaxe our economy if we fail to fulfil them.  If, like the old cliché, a stitch in time saves nine, we took measures now to reduce the extent to which we produce global warming gases from motoring, electricity generation and so on, we would be able to live within the limits of the Kyoto agreement. We are not willing to do that now because it is not urgent.  I believe it is inevitable that we will pay a high price at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>This measure, which is the only one being put forward that has anything to do with this, is a very modest one.  I oppose it because it is not introduced in the context of a broadly based public transport policy that emphasises buses and trains and ensures people have a more humane and less self-centred and atomistic existence than that which is currently the pattern of modern life.</P>

      <P>We do not have a problem with Financial Resolution No. 3 which is just a token.  I do not know if anything will be done to cut down on unwanted gases.  We should have been more imaginative in this regard.  I have a problem with Financial Resolution No. 4 which we will oppose. I am amazed the Minister decided to introduce this range of VRT increases despite the effective lobby in recent months.  Those on the Government side participated in that lobby and gave their support to the Society of the Irish Motor Industry.  On the last occasion the Government sought advice on this subject, it took the advice of the industry, based on the facts and figures it produced, and reduced VRT, which increased car sales and created additional wealth and employment. On this occasion it lobbied the Government on the basis that if there was a genuine reduction in VRT, it could lead to a further growth in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cubic capacity of cars ranges from 1400cc upwards and these are the type of cars people buy as replacements if they want to ensure they get to work safely and on time.  In addition to the problems created by this additional tax of £43 million on the industry, thousands of second hand cars with VRT are sitting in the forecourts of garages throughout the country.  Garage owners cannot export those cars unless they are allowed <Col N="1398" /> reclaim the existing VRT, to enable them to compete with similar cars from other countries.</P>
    <P>This brings into focus the difficulties with imported cars from Japan and elsewhere which are not meeting the same standards as the newly designed modern cars on sale here.  This is a double edged sword.  We should at least give garage owners the opportunity to compete by exporting second hand Irish cars which are of a much higher standard than imported cars from Japan. However, that cannot be done because of the way VRT is applied to new car sales.</P>
    <P>The motor industry provides hired transport for tourists.  Many people in my constituency are involved in this industry and have experienced difficulties with the cost of cars and the provision of insurance and VRT.  It almost pays American and other tourists who come to Ireland for a motoring holiday to go across the Border to hire a car.  That means people in the South could lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>Although these taxes are intended to raise revenue, we should look at their long-term implications for the industry and for the people employed in the industry.  For that reason, we will oppose the proposal to increase VRT on new vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in opposing the proposed increase in VRT.  I am astonished that the Taoiseach, whom I respect for presenting things in a practical way, is trying to convince us that this is being done in the interests of the environment.  That is the last straw.  It is bad enough to tell us that an increase of 5p on a packet of cigarettes will save our health.</P>
      <P>The reason there are so many cars on the roads is low interest rates and special packages being offered by garages through finance companies and scrappage schemes.  We will not stop cars being bought by increasing VRT, but we will make it difficult for people who have no other form of transport.  If young people want to buy houses, they must move out of the city into the countryside where there is no public transport or provision for a transport network.  Yet we are telling these people it will be more expensive to buy a car.  Surely it is safer for people to buy new cars than to allow them to drive old ones?</P>
      <P>I would have thought Government policy would have been in keeping with its policy last year to slightly reduce VRT.  The Government may argue it is not changing the rate for cars up to 1400cc.  However, the price is still too high if it is compared with European costs and the price of insurance.  We must also look at its effect on the tourism industry, as Deputy Ferris said.  From an environmental point of view, it would be better for people to drive new cars than old ones as there would be less emissions from exhausts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any proposals in the budget to deal with old buses which pump exhaust fumes into the air or with heavy vehicles which cause environmental problems and should be off the roads.  This is another excuse to raise revenue.  If <Col N="1399" /> the Government wants to raise revenue, it should say so rather than arguing for this increase on an environmental basis.</P>
    <P>Increasing people's tax relief and then taking it back from them will make their day to day living more expensive.  I heard a great deal today about the tax package.  However, people's wage packets will not increase by much every week.  As Deputy Noonan said, we were not told about the increase in the price people will have to pay for drugs if they are ill.  VHI payments have been increased so that will take away from a person's tax relief if he is a VHI patient.  If we must pay more for our cigarettes and motor cars, the £6 increase in tax relief will not be long disappearing.</P>
    <P>I join with my colleagues in opposing this measure.  It is time we brought the cost of living into line with other European countries, particularly in terms of motoring.  The price of a car here compared to that in Great Britain, let alone on the Continent, is frightening.  We must send a message to the Government that it is time the Irish motorist got a fair deal compared to those in other European countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity Financial Resolutions Nos. 3 and 4 are not being taken separately given that there is some difference between the two. Financial Resolution No. 3 is worthy of support, although it is a small measure.  I am sure the Taoiseach will claim it is a major step forward.</P>
      <P>We are now in harmony with Northern Ireland where there is no excise duty on LPG.  Unfortunately, however, diesel will still be seen as a cheap option.  We now know it is a serious cause of respiratory illness and it has carcinogenic effects.  We must go further in radicalising our transport policy.</P>
      <P>There is great disappointment that there are not more green taxation measures in this budget. Kicking this issue to the social partners is like Keith Wood kicking the rugby ball into the crowd in the hope of a good result.  However, it depends on what the crowd does with it.  In this case we must show political leadership and face up to our international responsibilities.  Those responsibilities will come back on us like a ton of bricks in 2012 when we are asked to account for the commitments we have legally entered into in limiting CO 2 emissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VRT increase in Financial Resolution No. 4 may dissuade people from purchasing cars, but it will not dissuade them from using them.  Once someone has made a financial commitment of that magnitude, he will be encouraged to use that product as often as possible.  This will cause greater problems which we are supposed to be trying to resolve.  It is cynical to describe this as an environmental exercise when the park and ride schemes only begin at 10 a.m. and do not deal with rush hour congestion.  If they were used as we would like to see them used, there would not be enough buses to accommodate the numbers of passengers.  The Government must come <Col N="1400" /> back with the type of radical approach which will not be seen as a cynical exercise such as this.  This will mean a budget which would put green taxation at the centre of reform.  It would take tax off labour and ensure that tax on consumption is at the centre of our tax code.  Only then will we begin to see people motivated by what most motivates them &mdash; financial advantage.  People will be financially better off by making better use of better public transport.  This will not come until the Government shows some political leadership.</P>
    <P>Other countries are far ahead of Ireland on this issue.  They have introduced LPG bus fleets, they have lower tax on environmentally sound activity and higher tax on environmentally damaging activity.  Unless we grasp the nettle, we will find ourselves paying between £500 million and £1 billion by the year 2012 or thereabouts.  We entered into a legally binding commitment.  If Deputy Dempsey was serious, he would have resolved these issues in Cabinet before seeking to make political mileage out of claims he cannot substantiate.</P>
    <P>We are still waiting to see the first glimmer of green taxation from the Minister.  When we begin to see such taxation perhaps we can begin to take the Government seriously on its international commitments on the environment.</P>

      <P>This measure will affect only a minority of car purchasers.  The fact is that 57 per cent of cars in use are under 1400 cc.  This is a tax targeting measure which, hopefully, will encourage people to buy smaller cars.  The benefits of this should be obvious, even to Opposition Deputies.</P>
      <P>The point has been made that it is hypocritical of the Government to present this as an environmental measure.  It is not being presented exclusively as such a measure.  It is hoped that it will have a beneficial impact on the environment in that it probably will encourage more people to buy smaller cars.  This has been acknowledged by Deputy Sargent.  However, it is also a revenue raising measure.  VRT is a well-established source of revenue under successive Governments.  There is an income tax giveaway of £581 million in the budget.  We have to obtain revenue from some source and we must protect the sources we have, particularly where increasing a source of revenue will not have knock-on economic implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition has made the point that we need a proper transport fleet, we need to improve the roads infrastructure and so on.  We concede these issues but we have to get the money from somewhere.  Raising money in this way will make a contribution to these objectives.  This measure will have some environmental impact.  However, it is also a revenue raising measure.  When one looks at the unprecedented increase in car sales <Col N="1401" /> due to the economic growth of the past few years, no one can doubt that the motor sector is well able to afford this modest £43 million.  It will not put a dent in that business.  It is a textbook example of an area in which we can raise revenue without adverse economic implications.</P>

      <P>It is fair to say that the Government tried to satisfy as many sectors as possible in this budget.  Despite the welcomes I have heard from farm leaders, the average farmer will not welcome this budget as there is nothing it in for them.  The motor industry will also be very disappointed. I do not have to remind the Taoiseach that this industry is responsible for about 46,000 jobs and takes in £2.2 billion in taxation.  This is a substantial figure.  Despite Deputy O'Dea's remarks about the £43 million which will be raised by this measure, I have heard from a reliable source in the industry that this measure could cost £100 million.  Deputy Harney should seek clarification from the industry on this point.</P>
      <P>The Irish consumer pays 25 per cent more for a car than the average European consumer.  We import 40,000 used cars every year but we export none.  Because of VRT our second-hand cars are not competitive.  This budget presented an ideal opportunity to address this issue.  The motor industry had a strong lobby and became very good at lobbying.  However, it has delivered the goods for the Government, the country and the taxpayer.  This is the first attempt to halt that growth and to de-motivate the motor industry.</P>
      <P>Whatever gains the average taxpayers will receive from the small PAYE concessions will be eroded by this measure.  This provision will erode whatever gains the average motorist is receiving by changes in PAYE.  In most houses, there are two people working.  In many cases, particularly in rural areas, people have to travel long distances to work.  People need more powerful cars and they are buying bigger cars.  This measure will discourage them from doing so.  The Government is not going to retract this provision.  The Taoiseach has many friends in the motor industry.  I have seen him associating with many of them at places such as Listowel races.  However, I do not think they will be so kind to him at the next race meeting.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> The Minister for Finance stated that in addition to the changes in VRT he proposed to take a number of initiatives which have been recommended by various parties to address the growing traffic problem in urban areas.  In this context, it is clear that he is bringing in this measure under cover of sorting out the growing traffic problem.  This is derisory and on that basis alone it must be challenged.  To use the increase in VRT as an important vehicle to sort out traffic chaos is taking the people for fools.  It is derisory.  This Government is the first to try to introduce revenue raising measures under false cover.  We saw the attempt to pass off the increase in duty on cigarettes as a health measure.  Now we see a revenue raising measure passed off as an attempt to solve the traffic problem and improve the environment.  This practice adds to the level of cynicism among the general public. Fianna Fáil expressed great concern at the issue of genetic engineering of plants but threw up their hands in helplessness.  Nothing was done to deal with that question but a revenue raising measure is presented as one to improve the environment.</P>
      <P>This measure will not work and must be placed in the context of this and the previous budget. Last year's large reduction in capital gains tax sent a clear signal to the section of society which buys big cars.  They were being clearly told to continue to buy large cars.  This year's reduction in corporation tax sends the same signal to the same sector.  Top executives will continue to be rewarded with large company cars and this practice will continue to be encouraged by the Government.  The Government's presentation of this measure as one which will improve the environment is not convincing when profiteers and landlord speculators are encouraged to buy large cars, take up even more space on our roads and pollute the air.</P>
      <P>Working people and small self-employed people who need to drive a middle-range car to get to work or run their businesses will suffer from this measure while the extra tax will not create hardship for large corporations who give cars to their executives as benefits in kind.</P>
      <P>Prohibitionism does not work.  We must create viable and attractive alternatives to the private car.  Investment in public transport is essential. The Government has taken no imaginative steps in this regard.  Employers could be obliged to provide showers so that workers who cycle to work could shower before they start their day's work. Numerous imaginative measures of that sort could be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1403" /> The Government continually panders to petroleum companies who dictate our transport policy. Enterprise Oil and other main players in the petroleum market have made large gas and oil finds off our coast.  In contrast to the Norwegian government, our Government will derive almost no revenue from these discoveries.  The companies are not even required to use Irish workers in their enterprises.  These conglomerates have no incentive to invest in research into alternatives to the petroleum-driven motor car.  If these companies were obliged to invest some of their massive profits in research and development into alternative means of transport much more effective, safer and cleaner forms of transport would be developed.</P>
    <P>The opposition to this motion is determined to reject the cynicism of the Government in presenting one revenue raising measure after another as attempts to promote health and improve the environment.</P>

      <P>I have been listening with interest to the debate and I found the comments of the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, particularly fascinating. If this is a serious environmental measure I expect the Government to lead by example and to announce that all ministerial Mercedes will be replaced by cars which come below the level at which the extra tax is to be charged and that such cars will in future be provided to Ministers and Ministers of State.</P>

      <P>That would be important if the Government seriously expects this to be accepted as an environmental measure.  I am sure Deputy O'Dea will lead by example.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea was in danger of competing with the gentleman on the Eamon Dunphy radio show with whom he has engaged in public battle and of whom he has been critical.  The Minister of State's contribution would have been worthy of that comedy routine. If we wish to encourage people to use smaller cars we should give tax relief on smaller cars and not impose additional tax on bigger ones.  We do not have a coherent public transport system. Large numbers of people depend on their cars to get to work.  This Government has dismally failed to put in place the policies which are so badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motor industry was referred to.  We know that industry is booming and a historically high number of new cars are being purchased. However, the motor industry has created a substantial number of new jobs and could play a role in the export of second-hand cars.  I do not believe the Minister for Finance has given any consideration to that possibility.  Our economy is changing and the possibilities within it are changing too.  In years gone by the idea of exporting <Col N="1404" /> second hand cars would have been regarded as fantastic.  Now it is a possibility and that is something which must be examined in the context of the tax system.</P>
    <P>Also of concern in this area is the manner in which every person required to use a car for business or domestic purposes is discriminated against in the context of the vast majority of citizens throughout the European Union.  At the time of joining the European Union, an implicit promise was made to Irish people that cars which were more expensive here and which were taxed to a greater degree than in the vast majority of European Union countries would eventually, after an introductory period, be available at costs similar to those of our European partners.  That is now not only not the case, the gap is being widened by the Government's policy.  It is the wrong way to convince people, especially those dependent on motor cars to travel to work, that they are full participants in the European Union and are benefiting from being in a single economic entity.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton, the Leader of Fine Gael, referred to the general absence of a transport policy. The Government will raise additional revenue from this measure.  In an earlier debate on physical and sensory disability, one element of transport policy was referred to which indicated the failure of the Government to take a comprehensive overview of what is socially necessary. This was the acquisition of 150 new buses by Dublin Bus and the appalling anomaly that none of these, which have been acquired with State funding, will be wheelchair accessible.  Will any of the money raised by the additional taxes imposed go towards ensuring that even a reasonable number of the new buses being purchased for public transport purposes will be wheelchair accessible? Has any thought been given to that?  The problem is that the action does not match the rhetoric in this area.  In the context of my constituency of Dublin South, the absence of a transport policy has forced people to use cars.  People who drive their cars in the early morning from areas such as Knocklyon, Firhouse and Dundrum find themselves caught in an hour of gridlock and the same in the evening when they return home.</P>
    <P>Let the Government put in place genuine policies to encourage people to use public transport when there is a viable public transport system.  At a time when there is not, when there are piecemeal policies and postponements of initiatives, such as the Luas from the Sandyford industrial estate to the city centre, and when the Government cannot get its act together, it should not impose additional taxation on the users of motor vehicles.  What it should do, and would have the support of this side of the House for so doing, is discourage people from using what were referred to in years gone by as &ldquo;gas guzzlers&rdquo; and encourage them to buy smaller cars where it is feasible for them to do so in the context of their needs.  In that context, if the Government intended to impose higher VRT on larger cars, the minimum <Col N="1405" /> it should have proposed this evening was lower VRT on smaller cars and it failed to do so.</P>

      <P>There is a traffic problem in Dublin which must be addressed.  This new measure, while raising £43 million for the Exchequer in 1999, will also reduce the power, size and speed of cars on the road in Dublin and this will have a positive effect on the movement of traffic in the city.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with Deputy Deenihan's earlier remarks and with other Deputies from the country because they need large cars to travel the few hundred miles back and forth to Dublin each week in comfort.  Thanks to the actions of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy earlier in the year, they will perhaps not mind paying the additional cost as they change their cars for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Road accidents are often caused by fast, heavy motorised vehicles with high capacity engines in excess of 1400 cc and even 2000 cc travelling at very high speeds.  This measure will help reduce the overall number of accidents which occur.</P>
      <P>I found the lobbying by the motor trade threatening and aggressive.  I received a letter saying if I did not attend a certain meeting, the motor dealers in my constituency would be informed of my absence from that meeting which was to be held in a hotel not far from Leinster House.  I am on good terms with motor dealers in my constituency. One has his business beside my constituency office.  He, like all motor dealers, has done tremendously well in recent years in the sale of new motor cars.  The number of large, high powered cars sold recently has increased dramatically. It is only fair that those who can afford such cars pay the extra money which, at the same time, will reduce demand for large, fast motor cars which have a negative effect on traffic and accidents. For that reason, I have no hesitation in welcoming this financial resolution.</P>

      <P>I address those remarks to the Chair.  Surgeons have put this point to me and that is why I have raised it here this evening.  I was not trying to provide amusement for the Fianna Fáil Deputies on the Front Bench.  I never provide amusement for Fianna Fáil and I do not intend to start now.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Chair has met many senior surgeons and spoke to them about the causes of accidents. I am sure they never told him that they were caused because the motorist was driving a large car.  The Departments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government are in collusion every time this convenience VRT tax is raised.  They impose this tax on large cars, but that is wrong. We all have friends who were involved in serious accidents.  More than 500 people are killed on Irish roads annually.  Most of those accidents do not occur in the city.  I accept the concerns of my fellow Deputies about the increase in pollution caused by the number of cars in the city.  Most accidents occur in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many small farmers use their cars to transport their families and goods.  I would not encourage farmers to drive small cars because their cars must be strong enough to pull a trailer full of produce.  They use a car and trailer to move produce from one farm to another.  Therefore, it <Col N="1407" /> is better if they have a large car that can pull a trailer.  However, this measure will discourage farmers from buying large cars.</P>
    <P>This measure seems to have been introduced out of spite.  The SIMI has a lobby who wanted VRT reduced to increase the number of jobs created in industry.  The Government rejected that proposal because it wanted to collect £45 million in revenue to cover something else and it decided to introduce this convenience measure, but it will rebound on it.  As Deputy Deenihan said, the industry has responded very positively to the reduction in VRT during the past four years.  I would like the Taoiseach, when replying, to state what research has been carried out in respect of large cars.  Will Ministers stop travelling in large cars?  I saw the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, on a television programme the other night talking about the new measures that will be imposed in respect of drivers.  He said that if they do not obey the rules they will be caught.  I have often been overtaken on the main road south by the Minister's car.  Will the Minister lead by example and ask his driver this weekend to travel at the authorised speed limit?</P>

      <P>I want the Taoiseach to tell Members why he is targeting large cars.  Is there a constructive reason for doing that or is this tax being imposed for some frivolous reason because agreement could not be reached at the last Cabinet meeting and it was decided to pick up £45 million by imposing this tax?  I cannot see any other reason for imposing it.  Is this measure an attack on the SIMI because its lobby has increased or is it being imposed because it did not pay the Government last year?  Did the SIMI not divy up?  Imposing this tax is petty and wrong.</P>

      <P>A total of 140,000 cars will have been sold by the end of this year.  There may be further car sales because this measure will take effect from 31 December.  There has been a total of 40,000 second hand car sales.  In 1993 only 64,000 new cars were sold.  That shows there has been an enormous growth in car sales.  A total of 57 per cent of new car registrations are in the zero to 1400cc band.  Practically 60 per cent of cars are still within that range.  A total of 39 per cent of new car registrations are in the 1400cc to 2000cc band and only 4 per cent are over 2000cc.  I do not see that there is any great difficulties with regard to this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sargent said that all EU states must have a minimum EU tax rate for auto LPG.  It will be 9p per litre cheaper here after the budget. The restructuring of VRT will not solve environmental problems and I did not say it would, especially as it can only have a real impact on future purchases of new and imported used <Col N="1410" /> vehicles, but it has an important role to play in influencing the type of vehicle purchased at the key choice stage.  Restructuring can only be effective as part of a balanced environmental package combining green taxes and other elements such as traffic related measures.  Other elements in this package include the provision of tax incentives for the construction of park and ride facilities, the exclusion of certain employee travel passes from benefit in kind provisions and the excise reduction on LPG, which will encourage greater use of environmentally clean products.  I did not get a chance to make any points on the last two resolutions because the time was talked out.</P>

      <Quest>if any members of the Government have made joint orders under section 12 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, assigning responsibility to specified civil servants for the performance of functions in respect of cross departmental matters; if so, the matters, functions and Departments affected; the proposals, if any, being considered for the making of these orders in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to a previous similar question, the purpose of section 12 of the Act is to provide, as necesssary, for the assignment by Ministers or Ministers of State of responsibility to civil servants for cross departmental issues and the associated accountability arrangements.  The Act also requires, under section 4, that the heads of Departments and offices ensure that appropriate arrangements are put in place to facilitate an effective response to these issues.  Ministers are, of course, well aware of these provisions to which I have previously drawn their attention. However, no orders have so far been made under section 12 of the Act.</P>
      <P>Issues of policy do, of course, cross departmental boundaries and there is a need to identify new ways of managing such issues more effectively. The strategy statements approved by Ministers earlier this year have identified a number of cross-departmental issues arising.  I have asked the SMI implementation group to consider appropriate action on these issues.  I expect that such consideration will address the use of section 12 of the 1997 Act as a means of progressing the matters.</P>
      <P>I will continue to keep this matter under review in the light of progress by Departments in achieving the goals set out in their strategy statements.</P>

      <P>I welcome the third progress report on the President published by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution on 25 November 1998.  The report recommends a number of changes to the Constitution which require serious consideration. These include issues such as the procedure for nominating a presidential candidate, extending the power of the President to confer titles of honour after consultation with the Council of State and reduction of the age of eligibility for election to the office of President to 18 years.</P>
      <P>I understand that the all-party committee proposes to publish further progress reports early in 1999.  I am prepared to consult with other party leaders when the Government has had an opportunity to consider the reports and I will be in touch with the leaders in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>In respect of my Department, no costs have been incurred in 1998 for external legal advice and there is no specific provision in the 1999 Estimate for my Department for commissioning such legal advice.  There is a general provision for consultancies commissioned by my Department from which any such costs would, in the normal course, be met.</P>
      <P>The bodies under the aegis of my Department are directly responsible for payments of costs from their financial allocations within Vote 3, including costs for legal advice if arising.  No such costs have been incurred during 1998.  The commissioning of legal advice is a matter entirely at the discretion of the bodies.  I am advised that the All-Party Committee on the Constitution may have some minor legal costs arising in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>External legal advice is sought as a matter of routine by the Office of the Attorney General, including the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. The 1998 provision to these offices for fees to counsel and general law expenses is £8.38 million. Expenditure to date amounted to £7.396 million. The expenditure encompasses the full range of legal services involving both civil and criminal cases.  Given the number and range of cases it is not readily possible to isolate the amounts paid <Col N="1415" /> for advice only.  The 1999 provision for fees to counsel and general law expenses is £12.24 million.</P>

      <P>The allocation in the 1999 Estimates which relates to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is primarily intended to allow for the contingency of the forum having one or more meetings in 1999.

      <P>My Department frequently receives requests for Government support for projects and events of a commemorative nature.  The purpose of the funding provided for under the heading &lsquo;commemoration initiatives&rsquo; is to allow the possibility of such support in appropriate cases.  This could include support for some residual projects relating to the commemoration of the Famine and 1798.</P>

      <P>Social partnership is a dynamic process which must be constantly developed and refined in line with the changing nature of Irish society.  The inclusion, for the first time in the process, of organisations representing the community and voluntary sector was a most positive development.  It represented a tangible acknowledgement of the need to bring the socially excluded and marginalised into the economic and social mainstream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The organisations under the community and voluntary pillar have made a significant and unique contribution to the development of Partnership 2000 and, equally important, to its full <Col N="1416" /> implementation.  In recognition of that, the Government has responded positively to the NESF report of December last in that the pillar is now represented on the NESC in its own right, as well as the NESF.</P>
    <P>The Government's focus is on fulfilling the present agreement and on putting in place the necessary pathways towards a successor.  On the question of whether representation should be widened in the context of future agreements, the Government will decide on such matters closer to the time when Partnership 2000 is due to expire.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As we near the close of the Governments 1798 commemoration programme I am delighted, as chairperson of the commemoration committee to take this opportunity to outline the events organised or assisted, as part of that programme by my committee.</P>
      <P>As you know it was my committee's intention to develop a broad ranging, comprehensive and inclusive programme which commemorated the ideals of the United Irishmen and the &lsquo;Fellowship of Freedom&rsquo; that inspired them in 1798.</P>
      <P>With this in mind it was felt that the commemoration programme should focus primary attention on the principles of democracy and pluralism which the United Irishmen advocated.  Projects such as the international conference, 1798 A Bicentenary Perspective, the National Museum and National Library's interactive exhibition at Collins Barracks, the Irish and British Governments 1798 commemoration scholarship and the RTE documentary series &lsquo;Rebellion&rsquo; are examples of projects funded, which, I think, duly reflected my committee's objectives.</P>
      <P>My committee was also happy to fund projects such as the Dublin/Belfast Choral Festival, the publication of Wolfe Tone's Diaries and the Drennan Papers, the Humbert and Merriman Schools and the restoration of the William Lawless Tomb in Paris.  Plans to circulate an education pack to schools are under way.  The Film Institute of Ireland's Film Festival I know was a great success and the Glencree Peace Centre is continuing to develop its programme, From Revolution to Reconciliation.</P>
      <P>The Croppies Acre Memorial Garden at Collins Barracks, which I opened on the 22 November, was developed in association with the Office of Public Works, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the National Museum, and will serve as a lasting memorial to all those who died in 1798.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we can all agree that the 1798 Centre at Enniscorthy, which opened earlier this year, is a shining example of what can be done when State and local bodies work together with a single goal <Col N="1417" /> in mind.  The centre and its exciting interactive 1798 Exhibition I know will continue to attract a large number of visitors for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>Many ceremonies have taken place over the last ten months to mark the rebellion.  I attended one such ceremony, involving the French military and our own Defence Forces in Ballina on 22 August, to acknowledge France's involvement in 1798.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that throughout the commemoration period funding has been made available at local level to many projects throughout the country.  Armagh, Antrim, Cavan, Carlow, Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Down, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois and Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Sligo, Tipperary, Wicklow and Wexford all benefited from funding.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately given the limited budget available, it was not possible to fund all of the many worthy projects under way throughout the country. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the local committees who have worked tirelessly to make their commemoration initiatives a success.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take this opportunity of thanking my committee for all its work in developing this broad ranging and inclusive 1798 programme of commemoration.</P>

      <P>Estimates of GDP <i>per capita</i> for the EU and its regions, expressed in purchasing power parities (PPPs) to allow for differences in price levels between member states, were received by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) form Eurostat by e-mail on Wednesday, 18 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These estimates incorporate the latest data supplied by the member states.  They showed that Ireland was at 95 per cent of the EU average over the period 1994-96.  The conversion of the Irish estimates to a PPP basis is still the subject of discussion with Eurostat regarding some technical issues.  However, any resulting amendment is <Col N="1418" /> likely to be of a relatively minor nature, probably amounting to no more than 1 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first six months of 1997, the total number of teaching days given by untrained personnel amounted to 74,145.  The corresponding figure for the first six months of the current year was 79,834.  A significant factor in the current difficulties in the supply of trained teachers is the fact that there has been a significant increase in the level of retirements among teachers.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that, when I was in Opposition, I was gravely concerned at the large number of untrained personnel working within the primary school system.  Accordingly, as soon as I came into office, I immediately set about addressing this issue.  First, I have ensured that there are over 1,000 places available in the colleges of education during the current academic year.  This includes 730 students who will pursue the three year B.Ed. degree programme and 280 degree holders will be admitted to an 18 month full-time postgraduate course.  It is expected that the intake of students to the colleges of education, on the B.Ed. degree course and the 18-month postgraduate course, will continue at the 1998 levels in each of the years 1999, 2000 and 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1421" /> Second, following consultations with the authorities of St. Mary's College in Belfast, I have recognised as fully trained B.Ed. graduates of that college who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification.</P>
    <P>Third, I am currently examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing one year conversion course for degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education and who have either Irish as part of their degree or have Irish to Grade C at the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
    <P>Fourth, I have further decided that from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education will be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service.</P>
    <P>Fifth, my recent decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification will also contribute to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>Finally, Montessori-trained teachers who successfully complete the course of three years' duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, and which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, will, from 1 September 1998, be granted recognition as fully trained substitutes. This recognition also applies to teachers trained by the Association Montessori Internationale.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will, I am sure, acknowledge that these are substantial measures which will significantly assist the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide physical education halls as part of the schedule of accommodation for all new post-primary schools. A PE hall is also provided when a major extension to a school, which does not have such a facility is being built.

    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1422" /> The question of providing a PE hall at St Mary's can only be considered in the context of capital available for post-primary building purposes and priority has to be given to the provision of essential classroom accommodation.</P>

      <P>Combating the problem of underage drinking is a challenge for a wide range of agencies and persons, including the drinks industry and, very especially, parents.  Schools and teachers and youth services have an important role to play in co-operation with parents and with others.</P>
      <P>In order to support schools in fulfilling their role my Department has just completed the development of a programme of substance misuse prevention education for primary schools.  I intend that this programme, which is called &ldquo;Walk Tall,&rdquo; will be disseminated to all primary schools over a two year period beginning early in 1999.</P>
      <P>My Department has prepared a substance misuse prevention education programme, &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet,&rdquo; for post-primary schools.  This programme was introduced in early 1995 when a support programme of in-career development commenced.  The programme has been introduced to approximately 70 per cent of the schools now and to Youthreach centres.  The supporting in-career programme continues this school year at 12 locations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>My Department co-operates with the Department of Health and Children in the preparation and introduction of the programmes mentioned; and both Departments are now engaged in preparing to begin the dissemination, in 1999, of the experiences and outcomes of the Health Promoting Schools Network, which has involved primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>In the youth services area, voluntary organisations are supported in prevention of substance misuse education through the National Youth Health Programme.  This is a partnership between my Department, the National Youth Council and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>One of the resources produced by this Youth Health Programme is the &ldquo;Drink Awareness for Youth&rdquo; resource package.  This provides comprehensive information for young people and guidance on dealing with the topic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has stated its commitment to produce a White Paper on the matter of mandatory reporting.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to pre-empt its publication by commenting further at this stage.</P>
      <P>However, in a broader context, my Department issued guidelines to all primary schools in November 1991 under the title Procedures for Dealing with Allegations of Child Abuse and to post-primary schools in 1992 under the title Procedures for Dealing with Allegations or Suspicions of Child Abuse.  These guidelines were drawn up in consultation with the education partners, and cover suspected child abuse either external or internal to the school.</P>
      <P>The guidelines make clear that the role of the school authorities is to ensure that suspicions or allegations are reported to the Health Authorities or the Garda.  The guidelines advise that, if there is indisputable evidence that an individual has abused a child, the matter must be reported directly to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that there can be no room for any complacency in relation to current procedures.  For this reason a working party, representative of the education partners, is already examining the existing guidelines on abuse in order to make sure that they represent a comprehensive and fully updated response to this issue. Representatives of the health boards have joined the working party.  Furthermore, officials of my Department have held discussions with representatives of the working group to review the child abuse guidelines which has been established by the Department of Health and Children.  Updated guidelines will be issued to schools as soon as the group has completed its final report, which is expected within the next three months.  This close co-operation between health boards, the education <Col N="1424" /> partners and my Department is essential in safeguarding the well-being of pupils in schools.</P>
    <P>We must also continue to emphasise the value of preventative strategies in combating this evil. In this context initiatives such as the Stay Safe Programme will continue to play a critical role in promoting an awareness among pupils of inappropriate behaviour on the part of figures in authority.</P>
    <P>As regards the Education Bill, I would point out that the appeals procedure provided in section 29 of the Bill will apply in respect of decisions, taken on behalf of schools, which affect students.  It is not intended that this section will cover allegations of abuse which, as I have already stated, are properly matters for the health authorities or the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's current involvement in the area of pre-school education extends to its support for the Early Start Pre-School Pilot Programme, the Rutland Street Pre-School Project and Traveller Pre-Schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Early Start Pre-School Programme, a total of 55 pre-school classes are in place in 40 national schools in areas of particular disadvantage. The classes in question have the capacity to cater for up to 1,650 children in the 3 to 4 year age group.  Total expenditure under the Early Start Programme in 1997 amounted to slightly in excess of £2.1 million, of which teachers' salaries accounted for £1.18 million. <Col N="1425" /> Each pre-school class has the services of a fully qualified primary teacher and a child care assistant. Funding is also provided for materials and equipment and to foster parental involvement in the projects.</P>
    <P>My Department meets all the operating costs of the Rutland Street Pre-School Project which caters for pre-school children.  This project caters for a total of 95 children in the 3 &mdash; 5 years age bracket.  Expenditure on the Rutland Street Pre-School Project in 1997 was £101,000.</P>
    <P>My Department funds 98 per cent of the approved tuition costs of 56 pre-schools for traveller children.  Funding under this heading in 1997 amounted to £516,800.  A further sum of £183,000 was expended on transporting the children to the pre-schools and a sum of £40,000 was allocated for the purchase of materials and equipment.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Deputy in addition that a number of other State agencies also provide funding to programmes which address the needs of pre-school children.  Chief among these are the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Area Development Management, and local authorities.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I held a National Forum for Early Childhood Education.  My objective in holding the forum was to allow all groups with an interest in the area of early childhood education to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the future development of services in this area.</P>
    <P>The report on the outcome of the forum has been received in my Department and is currently being considered as part of the preparation of a White Paper on Early Childhood Education which will set out my proposals for future development in this area.</P>

      <P>I have allocated an additional 26 resource teachers and 60 remedial teachers with effect from September 1998.  There is now a total of 104 resource teachers and 1,302 remedial teachers in the primary system.</P>
      <P>In addition, I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area.  This initiative is specifically designed to ensure that all children who have been assessed as having a special educational need will receive the support they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key element in this initiative is the introduction of a formalised system of special support for all children attending national schools on a fully integrated basis who have been assessed as having a special education need.  Such support may <Col N="1426" /> take the form of extra teaching or child care support or both, depending on the assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
    <P>Arising from these new developments, my Department has already allocated a total of 104 additional child care assistant posts.  The total number of child care posts now sanctioned by my Department is 402.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently considering all applications for either teaching or child care support in the context of my recent announcement on developments in special education services.  I expect that further allocations of teaching and child care support will continue to take place through 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>Information on the number of schools implementing relationships and sexuality education is currently being collected.  A questionnaire for this purpose has issued to schools and the replies are currently being returned and collated. The preliminary results of the first 1,062 questionnaires returned from primary schools show that 74 per cent of schools have set up their RSE policy committees.  This is the first stage in implementing an RSE programme in a school. Already some 54 per cent of primary schools have indicated their intention to teach the RSE programme in some or all classes in the current school year.</P>
      <P>The preliminary results of the first 88 of the 250 responses received so far at post-priinary level show that 83 per cent of schools have set up RSE policy committees and 81 per cent have indicated their intention to teach the RSE programme in some or all classes in the current school year.</P>
      <P>This progress is encouraging.  It must be noted that the process of policy formulation through partnership is a relatively new experience for many school communities.  Many schools have found this process to be a valuable and rewarding experience as they discussed their vision for the children's education, enunciated school ethos and debated the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> I am satisfied that the necessary supports have been put in place to assist schools with the introduction of relationships and sexuality education. I recognise that schools are at different stages in implementing a programme.  The information on progress being collected at present will enable effective targeting of supports.</P>

      <P>Multi-denominational schools are funded by my Department on the same basis as the denominational sector.  The arrangement provides that where a new school building is to be provided, the patron must provide the entire cost of the site and a local contribution, generally 15 per cent, towards building costs.  Similarly, where a vacant school building in private ownership becomes available, the patron must provide the entire cost of the site, 15 per cent of the cost of the building and 15 per cent of any refurbishment costs.</P>
      <P>Following the meeting in Galway to which the Deputies refer, I gave consideration to an initiative in regard to the provision of sites and local contributions.  I met with Educate Together on 27 October 1998 to discuss these and other matters. Consideration of these issues is being finalised in the context of the Estimates for my Department for 1999.</P>

      <P>I have no plans for the type of study referred to by the Deputy.  There is already a good deal of information available about the costs incurred by parents in relation to the education of their children.  In the light of this information a range of measures are in place.</P>
      <P>At primary level my Department operates a scheme of grants for schoolbooks for needy pupils.  This scheme is administered through the principal teacher who has discretion in the selection of pupils to be assisted, and ensures that available funds are distributed to those most in need of assistance.  Additional grants are made available to encourage schools to operate a book rental scheme.  The amount of funds allocated to the scheme in the current year is £2.534 million.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs operates a back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme. Under this scheme, a grant of £43 is payable in respect of each eligible child up to 11 years of age, while a grant of £58 is payable in respect of each eligible child in the 11 to 22 years age bracket.</P>
      <P>At second level, a range of supports are in place including <i>per capita</i> grants for schools which are about to be further increased in 1999, including enhanced <i>per capita</i> grants for schools classified as disadvantaged, and the book scheme for necessitous pupils.</P>

      <P>Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann, which receives a grant-in-aid from my Department, is the national centre for state language policy.  It provides research and consultancy services. The factors underlying the status and usage of the Irish language in society has long been a focus of study for the Institiúid.  Its many published studies in psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics are held in high regard among experts in these fields.  Their findings reveal a highly complex network of interacting psychological and social factors underlying the present position of the Irish language in society.  These factors extend well beyond the range of influence of the school and permeate every strand of social interaction. The teaching of Irish and of other modem languages in schools is one of the special concerns of the Institiúid.  It has recently co-operated with my Department in the preparation of lesson material for primary schools. <Col N="1429" /> Further steps are being taken to enhance the position of the Irish language in schools.  Under the aegis of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, a new primary school curriculum is being finalised and will be presented to me in the near future.  This will include a new programme in Irish.  It will reflect modem research in language teaching and be directed towards the development of communicative competence. The launch of the new curriculum will be supported by a comprehensive in-service programme for teachers.</P>
      <P>The syllabi in Irish at junior and senior cycles at post-primary level have been thoroughly revised recently.  The four language skills &mdash; listening, speaking, reading and writing &mdash; are catered for in the syllabi.  The leaving certificate examinations comprises an oral examination and an aural test as well as tests involving reading and writing.  The junior certificate examinations consists of tests in the reading, writing and aural areas, with provision for an optional school-based oral examination.  In the established leaving certificate and the junior certificate courses, pupils become familiar with the three main dialects of Irish.</P>
      <P>Section 31 of the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1977 makes provision for a body to advise the Minister on all matters concerning teaching through Irish. A joint committee has been set up recently between my Department and An Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileáin to liaise on matters of mutual interest and to advise both Departments on an ongoing basis.  Should this joint committee advise that qualitative research should be carried out along the lines suggested by the Deputy, the proposal will be given careful consideration by both Departments.</P>

      <P>In the context of my recent announcement of significant new developments in special education services, I have requested my Department to examine the introduction of mechanisms to ensure the early identification of the children in question, their locations and the range of special needs involved.  A certain number of children with special educational needs will require referral for individual assessment by a psychologist.

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied for disadvantaged status.  I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged status to additional primary schools.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the schoolgoing population.  The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils.  As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted at the most disadvantaged schools already in the scheme.  The Breaking the Cycle of disadvantage scheme was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage.  My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support they require to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>The provision of effective in-service training opportunities is already a key objective of my Department and the major focus of all in-service activities is on the development of teaching methodologies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant developments are taking place in the curriculum at both primary and post-primary levels and the in-career development unit of my Department is responsible for the management of the national programme of in-service training.  Many of the curriculum changes are designed to ensure that the school curriculum meets the learning needs of all pupils within the system.  Central to the successful implementation of the various initiatives is the employment of effective teaching methodologies and in-service training is designed to support teachers in reviewing existing practice and developing new pedagogic skills. <Col N="1433" /> In order to ensure greater and improved support for teachers through in-service training, the 1999 Estimates make provision for an 18 per cent increase in in-service funding.</P>

      <P>The pupil teacher ratio in primary schools declined from 25.2 to 1 in the 1992-3 school year to 21.7 to 1 in the 1997-8 school year.  While the exact pupil teacher ratio in the current year is not yet determined, it is anticipated that the ratio has declined further to approximately 21.2.</P>
      <P>The actual pupil teacher ratio at second level in the 1997-8 school year was 15.64 to 1 and it is anticipated that it will reduce further for the current year.</P>
      <P>I am currently considering a range of options with a view to determining the most appropriate ways to effect still further improvements within both the primary and second level sectors.  The Deputies can be assured that the matter of further improvements to the pupil teacher ratios in both sectors and the provision for special needs pupils will rank highly in these deliberations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the student support schemes, the rate of maintenance grant payable is determined by reference to the distance from the student's normal residence to the college which s/he is attending.  In the case of independent mature students, normal residence is defined as the address of the candidate while in attendance at college.  If this address is 15 miles or less from the college which s/he is attending, the adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable.  If the address is more that 15 miles from the college, the non-adjacent rate of grant is payable.</P>
      <P>However, where an independent mature student can produce supporting evidence that s/he is maintaining a residence other than his/her address while attending college, it will be open to the awarding authority to regard that address as the candidate's normal residence.</P>
      <P>My Department does not receive a breakdown of mature students by reference to the category of grant received.  However, I am concerned about mature students generally and independent mature students in particular and I am reviewing the current arrangements.</P>

      <P>The Green Paper, Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong, proposes the establishment of local adult learning boards to co-ordinate the provision of adult education in their respective regions.  However, the paper does not propose specific mechanisms for the implementation of this proposal but articulates the principles which should underpin the operation of the boards. How the implementation of these recommendations should best be achieved within emerging developments in regard to local services reforms generally will be a key focal point for debate in the consultation process which will follow the publication of the Green Paper.</P>
      <P>As the number and scope of activity of the boards remain to be determined, it is not possible, at this early stage in the consultative process, to estimate the administrative cost of such boards. Accordingly discussions on the cost of this proposal have not yet taken place with the Department of Finance.  However, the essential principles will hold that we will minimise administrative costs, ensure proper co-operation between bodies and focus resources on direct targeted initiatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education recommended that the number of mature full-time entrants into third level education should be progressively increased from 1,000 in 1993-4 to 2,200 by the year 2000.  Preliminary data indicate that the intake of mature students at third level in the 1996-7 academic year was in the order of 1,500 which represents significant progress towards meeting the recommendation in the steering committee report.</P>
      <P>I am committed to developing initiatives to facilitate this increased participation.  A range of measures have been introduced in recent years which have contributed to an increase in the number of mature students in third level.  The Higher Education Authority provides targeted funding to its institutions for initiatives designed to support the participation of mature students, particularly second chance students.  In 1997, the authority provided £615,000 for projects in this area. Further funding of £640,000 is being provided by the Higher Education Authority in 1998.  In addition, the proposed new institute of technology at Blanchardstown and the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute will have a major focus on non-standard applicants and on mature students and continuing education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> In July 1997, I established a joint education-industry task force to improve the supply of technicians for high technology industries.  Under this initiative colleges and industry jointly recruit, educate and train technicians.  In seeking applicants for the courses, the aim is to attract the kind of applicant who might not before have considered a technician career.  These applicants might include, for example, mature persons who may have been out of the workforce for a time and underemployed or unemployed persons.  This is a most important initiative for providing a second chance for people to acquire technical qualifications while addressing one of the clear areas where skills are needed in the economy.</P>
    <P>Part-time options are often more attractive to mature students and while a current age profile for part-time students is not available, it is estimated that approximately 85 per cent of the 23,000 part-time students currently in higher education are mature students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>My Department, through its guidelines on school discipline, lays considerable stress on the fact that suspensions and expulsions should only be used as a last resort.</P>
      <P>Under the Rules for National Schools, no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
      <P>My Department provides assistance in securing placement in individual cases.  Typically, this can arise where a pupil has been suspended as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made.  In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with the schools and through the inspectorate to assist in the reinstatement of the pupil in the school.  If this is not possible, every effort is made to arrange an alternative placement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In more difficult situations, my Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils in order to determine the nature and extent of <Col N="1437" /> any special needs which might exist, with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.</P>
    <P>However, I can assure the Deputy I am not satisfied with present arrangements in relation to school attendance.  Under new legislation, which is being drafted, I will be bringing forward a comprehensive range of measures to address this area.  Among my key objectives is the establishment of a single national authority with responsibility for school attendance on a country-wide basis.  The legislation will also include specific measures for the early identification and support of children who have dropped out or are at risk of dropping out of the school system.</P>
    <P>The recently launched early school leavers initiative is targeted on eight to 15 year olds in areas of serious disadvantage.  Under this initiative, models of response to the problem of early school leaving will be tested in 14 selected areas over the next two years.  The objective is to identify effective approaches which can be given wider application in the effort to combat the problem of early school leaving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 65 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the university sector, the Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994 which indicated a completion rate of 81 per cent, which is high by international standards, for those students entering in 1989-90.  The Authority has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, to undertake a further detailed study in this area and a report should be available by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>In the technological sector, a number of initiatives have been taken to assist the compilation of a data base on attrition-drop-out rates and to develop appropriate strategies to address the issues.</P>
      <P>The Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology has established a National Committee on Retention which has set out a menu of initiatives for institutes of technology particularly in relation to actions targeted at first year entrants in 1998.  Already a number of these actions have been implemented with a view to increasing retention levels in the institutes.  The council of directors has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra to undertake a comprehensive study on the issue of non-completion in the IT sector, which will consist of: a quantitative analysis to track a cohort of students over a four year period; and a qualitative study of students who leave without graduating.</P>
      <P>A system has also been developed for a statistical monitoring of uncertified departures from certificate and diploma programmes and is being applied on a pilot basis in some institutes.</P>
      <P>Three institutes &mdash; Carlow, Dundalk and Tralee &mdash; have undertaken a study on non-completion among first year students.  The study consisted of a comparison of students who continue with those who do not in all courses.  A report of this study is expected to be available shortly.</P>
      <P>A computerised management information systems project is in progress as part of the ongoing work to establish modem financial and administrative systems for the institutes of technology. The project has the aim of supporting the efficient and effective administration of the institutions and providing both the institutions and my Department with timely and accurate management information for a variety of purposes. This new system will provide enhanced information on attrition and the results from the initiatives above will be fed into this project.</P>
      <P>The reasons for drop-out are complex.  There is no simple explanation.  Factors such as motivation, capabilities and suitability are all involved. There must also be a balance between completion rates on programmes and maintaining the necessary, objective standards.  The challenge of maximising completion rates, consistent with maintaining appropriate standards is a matter, in the first instance, for individual universities, institutes of technology and the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> It is also of note that in its Consultative Process &mdash; Background Document which was published in September 1998, the Commission on the Points System included the results of a sample study on the relationship between performance in the leaving certificate and performance in higher education. The outcome of the research indicated, <i>inter alia,</i> that non-completion of courses, either due to drop out or failure, is especially acute among those with lowest leaving certificate scores at entry.  In particular 2 per cent of the sample failed final year, 3 per cent were still attending higher education, 7 per cent passed first year and withdrew, 7 per cent failed first year and withdrew and a further 7 per cent did not sit first year examinations.  The research team engaged by the commission, is now undertaking a more detailed analysis of the sample of students and the commission aims to publish the outcome of this analysis early in 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 107 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of initiatives in place in both the university and institute of technology sectors specifically geared towards disadvantaged students.  These initiatives involve links with second-level schools and local communities. Examples of these activities include the pathways through education project, supervised study programmes, summer schools, study skills programmes and mentoring.  There are two aspects to these programmes, one involving assistance to students to meet the points requirements for courses, enabling them to obtain a third level place through the standard CAO entry procedure. The other aspect of the programmes are the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports are put in place for students entering by this method.  It will take some time for the effect of these programmes to be reflected in the actual numbers going on to higher education. Consequently, my Department does not <Col N="1441" /> have detailed statistics in relation to student numbers assisted under these initiatives at present.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate the multi-faceted nature of the initiatives under way which are indicative of my commitment to tackle educational disadvantage. These initiatives span the first and second level systems as the need for an holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the third-level sector and on the transition from second to third level, is well established. In this regard, fuller participation in third level depends on measures to ensure access to and retention of students in full-time education at first and second levels.</P>
    <P>I am reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage and I will continue to extend these initiatives as resources permit.</P>

      <P>Some 22,727 places have been approved on the programme in 1998-9 an increase of 1,464 places from 1997-8.  In 1996-7 there were 18,712 places in the sector.  As the PLC sector plays a key role in meeting skill needs, particularly in the teleservices and technician areas, I anticipate modest growth in the region of 1,000 places in 1999-2000 and future years based on statistical projections.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to the sector is clearly evident with such expansion being accompanied by investment of £20 million for PLCs and apprenticeships under the Education Technology Investment Fund, the introduction of maintenance grants for students with effect from September 1998, substantial investment in equipment for centres providing the international teleservices programme and a new student support scheme towards the cost of placing teleservices students abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, the third level colleges levied a standardised charge of £150 in the 1995-6 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for two academic years.  At that time, the then Minister stated that the level of the charge would be reviewed.  In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997-8, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-8 academic year.  In line with the 4 per cent increase agreed for third level tuition fees for the 1998-9 academic year, I also accepted a similar increase in the level of this charge to £260.  The level of the charge is subject to annual review.  Students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the charge payable by students for registration, exams and student services, is a matter for the third level institution involved.  When I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge, I was concerned about that portion of the charge, which is intended to fund student services and in particular, the lack of transparent procedures.  Accordingly, I requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The Higher Education Authority issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions in January 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution should provide information as to the allocation of the charge towards <Col N="1443" /> exams registration and towards student services on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>As recommended by the working group, the Higher Education Authority is co-ordinating a review of the consultative and decision making procedures in place in the various third level institutions in relation to the disbursement of these funds.  I expect to receive a report from the authority in this regard before the end of the year.  I would also mention that I have asked USI to provide me with details of any difficulties that it considers to have arisen.</P>

      <P>The situation to which the Deputy refers has been brought to my attention.</P>
      <P>In an earlier response to a similar question on 22 October 1998 from Deputy Richard Bruton, it was incorrectly indicated to the Deputy that the matter in question had not previously been brought to my attention.  I regret that incorrect information was given to the House on that occasion.  This arose from a misunderstanding on the part of my Department regarding the particular diagnostic facility being referred to by the Deputy on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I understand the facility to which both Deputy Barnes and Deputy Bruton refer is the specialised school unit at Temple Street, which caters for up to eight children who require ongoing assessment, rather than the general diagnostic service available to children at the Temple Street Clinic.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputies in relation to admission to the specialised school unit are being investigated by my Department with a view to determining what action can be taken to address present difficulties.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of preschool services for special needs children, I recently held a National Forum for Early Childhood Education. My objective in holding this forum was to facilitate a debate on the future development of early childhood education services, including services for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>The report on the outcome of the forum has now been received in my Department and is being considered in the context of the preparation of a White Paper on early childhood education which I will publish next year.</P>

      <P>A range of schemes under the Department's support for schools in disadvantaged areas is already in place.  In addition to the Early Start pre-school pilot project, the Breaking the Cycle pilot project and the home-school community <Col N="1447" /> liaison scheme, the new initiative focused on eight to 15 year old early school leavers should have a positive effect on raising standards in these schools during 1999.  It is also intended to begin the process of introducing the revised primary curriculum to schools during 1999.  There is an increased emphasis in the English curriculum on raising literacy standards through the development of reading skills as part of a whole language process.  There will be a significant programme of in-career development of teachers in regard to the introduction of this revised curriculum.</P>
      <P>School planning guidelines will be issued to schools at first and second levels.  This initiative should ensure that there is a whole school approach to literacy development and extension and a whole school responsibility for raising standards in this area.  It is planned to extend the provision of psychological, remedial and resource teaching services to schools.  Among the strategies to be encouraged during 1999 will be earlier identification and a sharper focus on supporting pupils with learning difficulties and more intensive interventions.  All of these developments should help to raise literacy standards.  The review of teacher training at first and second levels will give new direction to existing practice in the preparation of teachers for the teaching of literacy and for improving teachers' skills in tackling reading difficulties and underachievement in pupils, thereby raising standards.</P>
      <P>A new leaving certificate English syllabus will be introduced in 1999.  This will complement the emphasis on functional literacy in the junior certificate English syllabus.  While in the past literature and creative writing may have dominated the leaving certificate programme at the expense of functional language, teachers are now being made more conscious of the need to inculcate proficiency in the English of the workplace.  This emphasis will be reflected in the in-service programme for teachers of leaving certificate English which is just about to commence.</P>
      <P>Ireland is participating in a major OECD a programme for international student assessment which will involve assessment in three main domains &mdash; reading, mathematics and science. The main focus in the testing of achievement of 15 year olds in 2000 will be in reading.  In preparation during April 1999, 1,800 15 year olds will be assessed in reading in 60 schools in Ireland. Reading literacy is defined in the project as understanding, using and reflecting on written tests, in order to achieve one's goals, to develop one's knowledge and potential and to participate in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Encouraging full participation in the education system is a key factor in ensuring good levels of literacy.  During 1999 fuller participation by traveller children in second level education will be promoted and the promotion of an increased retention rate to the end of senior cycle will be encouraged.  The development of measures to <Col N="1448" /> raise literacy standards at third level is a matter for the colleges themselves.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional national schools.  A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils.  As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools already in the scheme.  The Breaking the Cycle of disadvantage scheme was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage.  My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support they need to maximise their potential in the education system.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>My Department currently has approximately 1,120 applications on hand from national schools seeking either a remedial or resource teacher service or an improvement in an existing service.  I recently allocated 60 additional remedial teacher posts to national schools with effect from September, 1998.  There are now 1,302 remedial teachers in the primary sector.  I am currently examining the scope for further development in this area, in keeping with my objective of ensuring that a remedial service is made available to every national school in the country. <Col N="1449" /> Resource teachers are deployed to assist ordinary teaching staff in addressing the needs of children with disabilities in integrated school settings. I recently allocated 26 additional resource teacher posts with effect from September 1998. There are now 104 resource teachers in place in the primary sector.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The response may take the form of full or part-time teaching or child care support, or both, depending on the number of children involved and their special needs.  In the context of this new development, my Department is currently considering all applications on hand for resource teacher support.  I expect that allocations of such support will commence in the near future and continue through 1999.</P>

      <P>My Department provides capitation grants towards the day-to-day running costs of primary schools.  School authorities are required to supplement the capitation grant with a local contribution, which traditionally amounted to 25 per cent of the State grant.  Since 1995 the local contribution has been frozen at £10 per pupil in the case of mainstream schools, and at £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged. In effect, therefore, the required local contribution has fallen well below the traditional 25 per cent.  The State is obliged under the Constitution to provide for free primary education and to ensure that such education is available to children.  This is achieved through the partnership between the State and local community which is expressed in the State grant combined with the local contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.  This commitment is reflected by the fact that I obtained an increase of £5 in the standard rate of the primary capitation grant in 1998 and a further £10 increase has been provided for in the 1999 Estimates.  This will bring the standard capitation grant to £60 per pupil, and will constitute a 33 per cent increase in the rate of the grant since I assumed office last year.  These increases represent important steps in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to give priority to the question of <Col N="1450" /> increased funding for primary education as set out in the programme for Government.</P>

      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, identified a number of areas within the education sector where action is required to reduce and eliminate poverty.  These include, for example, the need to remove barriers to educational participation and the provision, in the context of a continuum of supports from early childhood through to adulthood, for adults to re-enter the system at a variety of levels.  Educational policy in this regard is focussed on two key principles, viz the need for a wide variety of interventions at school level and the provision of second chance education opportunities for those who have left school early.  The school-based initiatives include the Early Start programme, Breaking the Cycle, home school liaison, a schools psychological service, the provision of remedial, resource and guidance teachers together with a variety of curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes.</P>
      <P>Second chance education and training is provided through a range for programmes such as Youthreach, the vocational training opportunities scheme and a range of adult and community education measures.  I am satisfied that the various measures in place will help greatly to increase participation in education thereby helping to meet the objectives of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>

      <P>Following a review by my Department of primary school accommodation needs in Naas, it was concluded that there is a need for a new 16 classroom school in the town.  It is intended that this school will be provided on a site with a capacity for further development, if required.  The procurement of a site for the school is being pursued by a committee representative of all primary schools in Naas and this committee has investigated a number of options in the process.  A site on the Sallins side of Naas has been identified by the committee and I understand that procurement is at an advanced stage.  Subject to more detailed inspection, the proposed site appears to be particularly suitable because of its location in an area of large population growth.</P>
      <P>My Department was aware of developments in relation to Devoy Barracks, but decided not to pursue the matter further in view of the progress that had been made by the local committee towards identifying a suitable site.  Every effort will be made by my Department to have the new school in place by September 2000.</P>

      <P>Classroom teachers in primary and post-primary schools, in consultation with remedial teachers, have the lead responsibility for the identification and remediation of specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia.  My Department has supported courses in remedial education for many years.  Since 1994, there has been a national programme of training for remedial teachers.  At present, post-graduate courses for teachers at primary and post-primary levels are held in six centres in universities and in colleges of education. In the current academic year 99 primary teachers and 64 post-primary teachers are attending these courses.  These courses in remedial education are supported and directly funded by the in-career development unit of my Department.  The syllabus includes training in the diagnosis and identification of reading difficulties and in appropriate techniques for remediation.  In particular, there is a focus on the problem of specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia, in relation to diagnosis and pedagogy.</P>
      <P>Many shorter courses for remedial and other interested teachers in specific learning difficulties have been supported financially by my Department. They have been mainly provided through the network of education centres, through teachers' organisations and through the programme of summer courses for primary teachers. Remedial teachers may need to consult educational psychologists in respect of certain pupils who display marked specific learning difficulties. My Department provides an educational psychological service at present to all post-primary schools and to more than 700 primary schools. The psychologists provide assessments and advice to teachers and parents in respect of students with specific learning difficulties as the resources of time and personnel allow.  My Department's psychologists are firmly committed to consultation with parents as an essential part of the assessment process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to improve access to such support by the provision of a national educational psychological service, which will be readily available to all schools.  On 15 September of this year, I launched and endorsed the report of the planning group for this service.  I have now set up a small implementation group within my Department to produce detailed proposals for the development of the psychological service, beginning in 1999. <Col N="1453" /> As an interim measure, my Department will shortly be recruiting a further 10 psychologists.</P>

      <P>The OECD Report &ldquo;Education Policy Analysis 1997&rdquo; shows that 47 per cent of the Irish population in the 25-64 year age group have achieved upper second level education or higher, compared with an OECD average of 61 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am committed to improving participation and completion rates in the education system and, in this regard, my Department has a range of strategies in place which are designed to achieve this objective.  These include the development of Early Start centres; the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the Breaking the Cycle initiative; the home school community liaison scheme; an initiative designed to combat early school leaving among 8-15 year olds; curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes; support for junior and senior centres for travellers; the free book scheme, and alleviation of examination fees for necessitous pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of second chance education is also being addressed through the expansion of Youthreach for unqualified early school leavers by 2637 places by FÁS and the VECs, allied with the introduction of guidance, counselling and psychological supports for the programme.  In regard to the vocational training opportunity scheme which provides integrated education, vocational training and work experience for unemployed adults, my Department has equalised the payment of training allowances with those of the back to education allowance, and has removed the 10 per cent quota which limited participation of lone parents, those with disabilities and dependent spouses.  In addition, provision for adult literacy services has been doubled in 1998. These developments have been accompanied by substantial progress in making national certification available for adults and young people who left school early through the work of the NCVA and NCEA.  Work is also on schedule for the publication early in the new year of legislation to underpin the development of a national framework of qualifications for all extra university third and further level vocational education and training programmes.  This will play a key role in promoting <Col N="1454" /> access and progression to second chance education and training.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper &mdash; Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning &mdash; was launched on 24 November 1998 and sets out a framework for the future development of adult education provision within a framework of lifelong learning, and points to a range of factors and international comparisons which make concerted investment in adult education an imperative in the years ahead. The paper proposes the development of a national adult literacy programme, a part-time back to education initiative for adults who have left school with less than upper secondary education, and a range of services to support access and progression, and structures for the co-ordination and integration of the work of a range of actors in the adult education field.  The paper will be used as a basis for consultation and debate to enable the Government to define its priorities and to plan the development of the sector.</P>

      <P>The report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education recommended an increase in student places in what was then the Regional Technical College Waterford, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title to regional institute of technology as a response to the higher education needs in the south east region.  It recommended that the major focus of expansion be at degree level, with the percentage of award recipients who terminate in a given year with a degree increasing from 22 per cent of total in 1995 to 33 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the report of the steering committee was published, the number of full-time students in the institute has increased from the 1994-95 level of 3,500 to 4,740 in 1997-98.  An increase in degree level provision and ten new degree courses have been sanctioned by my Department in respect of Waterford Institute of Technology in the context of meeting the identified higher education needs of the south east region.  Figures provided by the institute indicate: that the number of students on degree courses has increased from an estimated 1,046 in 1994-95 to 1,825 in 1997-98; that the intake of students to degree programmes &mdash;<i>ab initio</i>&mdash; has increased from 285 to 560 in the same period; and that the percentage of full-time students who graduated at degree level has increased to 28.4 per cent in 1998.  The institute <Col N="1455" /> has submitted a framework for its development to my Department and this proposal is the subject of ongoing discussions with officials.</P>
    <P>Early in 1997, the institute was designated as the Waterford Institute of Technology and arrangements have been put in place to carry through the process leading to the delegation to the institute of authority to make awards, within a national qualifications framework.  This process is being carried out by an interim review group chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly.  I understand that the interim review group has completed a draft report on the self-evaluation study by Waterford Institute of Technology and has furnished the institute with its observations on the study and its draft recommendations.  At present the group is considering the response from Waterford Institute of Technology to these observations and draft recommendations prior to finalising its report which will then be submitted to me.  I would point out to the Deputy that the institute does extremely valuable work at subdegree level which should not be disregarded.</P>

      <P>The most recent international comparison in relation to investment in education which is available to my Department is contained in the 1998 publication, Education at a glance &mdash; OECD Indicators.  This publication provides information and data on key aspects of the education system in various OECD countries including the resources invested in education in a range of countries participating in the project during the period 1990 to 1995.  The report notes that in 1995, the Irish proportion of total public expenditure accounted for by education was above average for the OECD countries, and at 13.5 per cent it was the highest in the EU.  Further, the Irish proportion of total public expenditure accounted for by primary and secondary education was also above average for the OECD countries, and was the second highest after Spain in the EU.</P>
      <P>In 1996, 17 per cent of Ireland's population was in the five to 14 age group, the highest proportion for the EU member states where the average was 12.2 per cent.  Ireland also has the highest proportion of young people aged 15 to 19 in the EU, and for the OECD as a whole Ireland ranked fourth for this age cohort.  To a significant degree this situation presents the Irish education system with a greater challenge in the area of provision than that which confronts most other countries in the survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In broad outline the OECD report demonstrates that the Irish system of education compares <Col N="1456" /> favourably with the other OECD countries over a wide range of indicators.  Nonetheless, the report demonstrates there is little room for complacency. Major challenges arising out of the growth in participation rates face us as we approach the millennium and the Government will continue to provide for a systematic general improvement in the education system.  In this regard the Deputy will recognise the significance of the major increases in education spending provided by this Government.</P>

    <P>While suitable educational provision can play an important role in the rehabilitation process, the Deputy will appreciate that the health authorities and the probation and welfare service also have a key role to play in supporting the welfare and rehabilitation of children leaving the custodial facilities.</P>
    <P>The Children Bill 1996, which is awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil, proposes a comprehensive range of measures to update and streamline existing legislation in relation to children who are in need of care or who come into conflict with the law.  One of the fundamental principles set down in the Bill is the proposition that the imposition of custodial sentences should be a matter of last resort.  In keeping with this approach, the Bill sets out a range of non-custodial alternatives which will be available to the courts to address the needs of such children.  The Bill also recognises the need for effective after care services and will bring much greater clarity to the roles and responsibilities of the various statutory bodies involved in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>A recently published OECD report shows that in 1995, prior to this Government assuming office, Ireland spent only 60 per cent of the OECD total per pupil at primary level.  It was due to the fact that the Government realised that primary education was underfunded that An Action Programme for the Millennium contained a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.</P>
      <P>To this end I obtained an increase of £5 in the standard rate of capitation grant payable at primary level in 1998 and a further £10 increase has been provided for in the 1999 Estimates which will bring the standard capitation grant to £60 per pupil.  This constitutes a 33 per cent increase in the grant in place since I assumed office.  These increases in the capitation grant represent important steps in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.  Clear priority will be given to primary education.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any conclusive data that would indicate that the level of educational disadvantage in Ireland is higher than that in other countries.  A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population. The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils.  As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted at the most disadvantaged schools already in the scheme.  The breaking the cycle of disadvantage pilot project was subsequently introduced to deliver the targeted support recommended in the study.</P>
      <P>I am reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage. My objective is to ensure all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support they need to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 100 and 239 together.</P>
      <P>There are three strands to the leaving certificate. For the established leaving certificate the system of access to third level education awards points for all subjects at higher and ordinary level in accordance with grades achieved.  In the case of the leaving certificate vocational programme, the institutes of technology award points for three grades of achievement &mdash; pass, merit, distinction &mdash; in the examination of the links modules.  As the Deputies will be aware, the question of points equivalence is a matter for the individual institutions and I understand consideration is being given by the conference heads of Irish universities and the Dublin Institute of Technology for the awarding of points for the links modules also.  The appropriate recognition of the link modules in the leaving certificate programme for points is among the issues that have been raised in submissions to the commission on the points system which is due to report in late spring/early summer 1999.</P>
      <P>In the case of the leaving certificate applied, direct access is not possible to higher education.</P>
      <P>However, access is possible to a wide range of post leaving certificate courses certified by the National Council for Vocational Awards, NCVA. The NCVA has developed linkages for graduates from some of these courses to courses in institutes of technology.</P>

      <P>A practice whereby students could indicate the presence of a specific learning difficulty on their examination scripts never existed.</P>
      <P>The range of special arrangements available to students with specific learning difficulties in the 1999 certificate examinations will be the same as those available in 1998.  These arrangements include the use of tape recorders, readers, scribes and enlarged print depending on the needs of each individual case.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, where a concern has been expressed regarding the readability of material presented by candidates, this has been brought to the attention of the individual examiner.  This approach is intended to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties, every effort is made by the examiner to ensure the candidate is given full credit for all work.  In the event of an examiner encountering difficulty, he or she is instructed to send the answerbook to his or her supervising examiner.</P>
      <P>This year my Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner.  The intention is to ensure problems with readability whether brought to the Department are dealt with by the examiner and that no candidate is disadvantaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESRI report examined the issue of over-education in the labour market, using a survey of school leavers who left school in the school year 1985-6.  The respondents were first inteviewed in mid-1987 and again in late 1992.</P>
      <P>Since the time these respondents were last interviewed there have been major changes in developments in the education system.  Early Start and Breaking the Cycle were introduced, teaching counsellors were appointed and the home-school liaison scheme and remedial and guidance services further expanded and developed.  The number of educational psychologists in the service was expanded and a report has been completed on the establishment of a national educational psychological service.  This is critical to the early identification and remediation of learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>Support services have been established to provide systematic support for schools in implementing a range of new curricular developments, including IT2000.  The junior certificate schools programme, the transition year, leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational programme have all been expanded, and of the order of 60,000 pupils annually are now following these programmes in the second level system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second change education has also developed, from an initial start with 1200 students in CTOS and Youthreach in 1989, to approximately 16,000 in 1998, including those on back-to-education <Col N="1464" /> programmes.  A counselling, guidance and psychological service has been introduced for Youthreach, and child care support has been made available for Youthreach and VTOS.</P>
    <P>These developments have been accompanied by substantial increases on PLC courses and in third level colleges and, more recently, by the introduction of maintenance grants for PLC courses.  For example, third level full-time enrolments increased from 53,000 in 1985-6 to around 103,000 at present, while PLC enrolments increased from roughly 12,000 to approximately 23,000 in both instances.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Vocational Awards has developed national certification for a wide range of vocational education and training programmes ranging from foundation level to level 3.  With the implementation nationally of level 1 certification from March 1999, there will be a continuous route of progression for young people and adults who left school early from foundation level to level 2, PLC courses, and from there to third level.  Legislation to underpin the establishment of a national qualifications framework for all non-university vocational education and training is on schedule for publication early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The Government has recently published a Green Paper, Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning, which sets out a range of recommendations for consultation and debate on the future development of the adult education sector. It is my intention to continue to adapt and review the education system to ensure its responsiveness and relevance to ongoing needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states.  Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland.  In this context and following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of <Col N="1466" /> the country in which the student is pursuing his-her course.  Previously, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates.  Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continue to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates.  Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate that the current exchange rates do not favour grantholders who are studying in Britain or Northern Ireland, I believe that these arrangements are equitable and efficient.</P>
      <P>There is no provision within the student support schemes for the local authorities or vocational education committees to supplement the grant payable to students studying in Britain. Indeed such a supplement could not be made without giving rise to an anomalous inequity <i>visà-vis</i> students studying elsewhere in the EU.</P>

      <QRef>[25794/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a case where allegations of child abuse were made to my Department in 1982 in relation to a former primary school principal. At that time the former principal had transferred to a teaching position in a secondary school.  The teacher continued to teach in the secondary school sector until 1985.</P>
      <P>The letter of complaint received by the Department in 1982 referred to the removal of the principal from his former position as principal of a primary school as a result of allegations of abuse of boys in his classes in the period 1965 to 1970. The letter also indicated that the author had been in touch with the authorities of the secondary school in which the former principal was then teaching.</P>
      <P>On my instructions my Department's papers in this case have been reviewed and following this review, I am firmly of the view that the Department's response to this complaint was seriously lacking and that there can be absolutely no excuse by reference to the standards of the time. I should add that the Departments papers on this matter were made available to the Garda, at their request, during the course of their investigations.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, procedures to deal with similar situations have been completely altered. Guidelines which were issued to all primary schools in 1991 and to second level schools in 1992 set out the procedures to be followed in dealing with allegations or suspicion of child abuse.  In particular they emphasised the obligation on school authorities to ensure that allegations or suspicions are reported to the health authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures to be followed by my Department where an allegation of abuse is received are set out in an internal instruction of 1995.  Where the allegation relates to a teacher or other member of staff of a school, the procedure requires that the appropriate school authorities be notified by the Department.  The response of the school is then monitored by an internal committee of the <Col N="1468" /> Department chaired by an assistant secretary. Where the allegation is the subject of a Garda investigation, my Department would expect school authorities to suspend the teacher in question pending the outcome of the inquiry.  In such cases, salary continues to be paid and substitution provided.</P>
    <P>Where following a Garda inquiry no prosecution is taken or where an acquittal results, I and my Department take and act upon the view that the school continues to have a duty to establish if the teacher in question was guilty of misconduct, albeit misconduct not leading to a criminal charge.  The Department carefully monitors the actions of schools in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that there can be no room for any complacency in relation to current procedures.  For this reason a working party, representative of the education partners, is already examining the existing guidelines on abuse in order to make sure that they represent a comprehensive and fully updated response to this issue. Representatives of the health boards have joined the working party.  Furthermore, officials of my Department have held discussions with representatives of the working group to review the child abuse guidelines which has been established by the Department of Health and Children.  Updated guidelines will be issued to schools as soon as the group has completed its formal report, which is expected within the next three months.  This close co-operation between health boards, the education partners and my Department is essential in safeguarding the well-being of pupils in schools.</P>
    <P>We must also continue to emphasise the value of preventative strategies in combating this evil. In this context initiatives such as the Stay Safe Programme will continue to play a critical role in promoting an awareness amongst pupils of inappropriate behaviour on the part of figures in authority.</P>

This Act provides that the money shall be disposed of &ldquo;for the purposes of such projects or undertakings, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, involving co-operation between the State and Northern Ireland or the State and Great Britain or relating to the island of Ireland as a whole as the Taoiseach <Col N="1469" /> may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental assessment committee, which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, has recently invited applications for funding for projects which would promote mutual understanding and reconciliation between Great Britain and Ireland or between the State and Northern Ireland, sustain and develop ventures and-or activities on an island of Ireland basis or relating to the island of Ireland or promote the welfare of the Irish community in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Preference will be given to projects related to areas which may have restricted avenues of funding open to them.  The closing date for the receipt of completed application forms is 15 December 1998.</P>
      <P>I earlier allocated funding of £150,000 to the Island of Ireland Peace Park and £13,500 for a peace bell at Messines, Belgium, and funding of £180,000 over three years to a Lectureship in Irish at the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool.</P>
      <P>Under the aegis of the Commemoration Office of my Department, funding was made available for events or projects to commemorate the Great Famine and the 1798 rebellion and also to commemorative events or projects at local level throughout the country.

    <P>As the Deputies are aware, I met yesterday with a deputation of public representatives and representatives of management and the workforce to discuss the serious situation arising from the expected substantial redundancies at this company early next year because of a loss of business from its major customer.  I conveyed to them my serious concern at these developments and indicated that IDA Ireland is arranging an urgent meeting with the US parent company, CTM, to clarify its intentions with regard to the plant.  It will also again be pursuing with the company's major customer the position in relation to existing business.  Simultaneously, the industrial development agencies will work closely with the company <Col N="1471" /> in seeking to identify alternative markets and job opportunities.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the valuable employment afforded in Kells by this company over the years and of its importance as an employer in the local economy.  I assure the House that every effort will be made to minimise the job losses involved and find alternative jobs for workers affected.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the published report fully reflects the independent professional view of the consultants on the safety of the railway in Ireland. No attempt was made by my Department to alter the thrust of the consultants' findings, conclusions and recommendations.</P>
      <P>The assistant secretary responsible for public transport in my Department made comments on, and suggested textual changes to, a draft of the consultants' report.  This was in accordance with the normal practice of Government Departments in dealing with the consultants' reports.  The purpose of these comments and suggestions was to ensure that the report was clear and unambiguous and that it was easily read and accessible.  It was made clear in writing to the consultants that they were free to accept or reject the suggestions in accordance with their professional judgment.  This is precisely what the consultants did &mdash; they accepted some and rejected others.</P>
      <P>The comments and suggested textual changes were not brought to my attention and the question of my authorising them did not therefore arise.</P>
      <P>A Fine Gael Member of the Oireachtas made various requests for documentation relating to the study.  These were fully and promptly responded to by my Department.  I also arranged for Fine Gael Oireachtas Members to separately meet officials of my Department and the consultants to discuss the matters they have raised about the railway safety report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>Following my intervention in the threatened Bus Éireann strike in July 1997, I held a series of consultations with management and unions in the CIE companies and the Labour Relations Commission.  There was general agreement that the negotiations in each of the CIE companies should continue with the assistance of facilitators appointed by the Labour Relations Commission.  There was also a view that CIE should retain the services of a suitably qualified person from outside the company to assist in the co-ordination of its approach to the negotiations. I put this view to the company and suggested that the person referred to in the question might fulfil that role.  The company considered this view and in a press statement dated 31 July 1997, the CIE chairman announced that in order to facilitate swift progress in these negotiations CIE was willing to appoint a facilitator with a view to achieving early agreement.  CIE subsequently appointed the person referred to in the question to assist the operating companies in the negotiations.  His role, to whom he reports and his relationship with the ClE management and board is a matter between the parties involved.</P>
      <P>The restructuring negotiations in the individual operating companies are proceeding slowly but significant progress has been made in recent days with the acceptance by drivers in Dublin Bus of the restructuring proposals put forward by that company.  I also welcome the acceptance last week by the trade unions representing the Iarnród Éireann locomotive drivers of the proposals put forward by the Labour Relations Commission for the continuation of negotiations with that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have encouraged all parties to these talks to participate in a positive and constructive manner and have stressed the importance to the companies of a successful outcome, the resolution <Col N="1480" /> of problems associated with implementing the plans is a matter which can only be addressed by management and trade unions in the group.  I am hopeful that the talks will result in a successful outcome for all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith):</NameTxt>
      <P>To date a total of 14 claims have been made by current or former members of the Defence Forces in relation to post traumatic stress disorder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always been recognised that military personnel may be exposed to traumatic situations leading to what has in the past been described as &ldquo;battle stress disorder&rdquo;.  Indeed, one of the aims <Col N="1481" /> of military training is to create a sense of comradeship and mutual support to enable personnel to cope with the stress which is an inevitable part of military operations from time to time.  Support from commanders, from the Medical Corps and from the Chaplaincy Service has always been available when required.  In more recent times, following developments in the medical sciences which have led to the identification of what we now call post traumatic stress disorder, procedures have been put in place which formalise these traditional support systems throughout the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces now operate a stress management and post traumatic stress disorder programme the purpose of which is to educate personnel in stress recognition and to provide support to personnel so that they can deal with trauma and stressful situations in an appropriate and timely manner.  This programme is implemented through the Defence Forces psychologist, the Personnel Support Service and the Chaplaincy Service.</P>
    <P>Cases of post traumatic stress disorder are referred in the first instance to the military psychiatrist at St. Bricins Military Hospital.  A multi-disciplinary approach to case management is generally adopted and is led by the psychiatrist.  The team may include nurses of the Army Nursing Service with training in counselling skills, social workers of the Personnel Support Service, the Chaplaincy Service and appropriate colleagues. The psychiatrist may also refer cases to civilian agencies, particularly clinical psychologists, if he feels that is appropriate.</P>

      <P>Under section 4 of the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act, 1988, Teagasc <Col N="1482" /> is charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with the provision of educational services in agriculture and horticulture. In conformity with this provision, Exchequer funding for the sector is channelled through Teagasc.</P>
      <P>Teagasc has made a submission to my Department seeking funding over five years to meet the capital development needs of the private colleges as well as the Teagasc colleges and some local Teagasc training centres. However, as these needs will be influenced by the level of future demand for training in agriculture and horticulture Teagasc has, at my request, commissioned a study to establish the likely level of such demand.  I propose to await the completion of this study before making a final decision on the funding proposals.</P>

A review of this decision was requested by him in October 1998.  Following the review the original decision was upheld.  The person named was informed of this in writing on 24 November 1998 and was given the option to appeal the decision within 21 days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>I support the principle of the single market where EU produced goods are allowed to circulate freely within the European Community.  In terms of agriculture and food products, Ireland has a strong reason to uphold such a principle, given our dependence on exports.  As far as pigmeat is concerned, approximately half of our overall production is exported, the bulk of it to other member states of the EU.  At the same time, the decision to import is a commercial one for the company involved.</P>
      <P>Nothwithstanding this, the future development of the Irish food sector must involve a greater degree of partnership and linkage between producer and processor, especially given the large volumes of raw material available in this country. Such partnership brings with it the potential to improve quality, regularity of supply and in turn greater benefit for the sector as a whole.  This applies to pigmeat just as much as it does to other sectors.</P>

      <P>With regard to details of beneficiaries under such schemes and measures, there are upwards of 200,000 clients on the Department's client data base.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, it has been the policy of successive Administrations to treat as confidential details of individual beneficiaries under Government schemes.</P>

Appeals are dealt with in the order in which they are received and require individual examination.  The reason for the delay in examining the appeal is the large quantity of appeals currently on hand in the appeals unit. This appeal will be dealt with in due course and the herdowner will be notified of the outcome.</P>

The groups take their decisions in accordance with the priorities of their own business plan, the needs of the area, the demands on the funding available and operating rules set down by my Department.  It is not uncommon therefore, under the programme that a project which is funded in one area would not be considered for grant aid by another group.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that audit and investigation programmes are operated by Revenue to monitor tax compliance of all cases chargeable to tax under the self-assessment system.  Such cases include the business sector, professions, company directors and persons in receipt of any type of investment income.  The focus of the programmes is on cases where tax is perceived to be at greatest risk.  As a result, tax evasion or avoidance schemes operated by any group, or across any particular business sector or profession are targeted with a view to corrective action, including recovery of any tax, interest and penalties due to the State.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that most gardaí would not come within the self-assessment system.  However, where individual gardaí have, in addition to a salary, business or other income which is chargeable to tax under the self-assessment system, their tax compliance position is subject to review under the Revenue audit and investigation programmes.  They may also come up for review if they are part of a group, for example landlords, who are otherwise being targeted for investigation.  Revenue have indicated that there have been a number of cases, as with persons in other occupations, of individual gardaí who have been the subject of inquiries and who have made tax settlements with Revenue.</P>

      <P>My Department is involved in the operation of two grant schemes.</P>
      <P>The first of these schemes involves the operation of grants under the economic development measures of the Ireland-Northern Ireland and Ireland-Wales INTERREG programmes.  Both these programmes are cross-Border initiatives funded by the European Commission so that decisions taken in relation to grants are joint decisions which reflect the views of my Department and the views of the other national authorities involved in the management of the programmes, that is, the Welsh Office or the Department of Economic Development in Northern Ireland.  The views of the relevant development agencies on both sides are also considered when arriving at a decision.  The decision-making process which takes place through joint working groups three to four times a year is guided by projection selection criteria set out in the documentation for each programme.</P>
      <P>The overall objectives of the INTERREG programmes are to improve cross-Border co-operation and assist the economic regeneration of the Border regions.  In the case of the economic development measures of the Ireland-Wales and Ireland-Northern Ireland programmes, these objectives are being pursued by developing links between bodies such as trade associations, professional associations and local authorities, by assisting studies of a multi-sectoral nature and by promoting joint ventures between SMEs in both regions.  Tangible economic benefits to the eligible regions are expected to follow in return for the grant assistance given to projects, such as increased employment, improved competitive, production or marketing capacity and-or new ranges of products and services.</P>
      <P>The names of bodies grant aided under the economic development measures of both programmes are set out in the following statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey):</NameTxt>
      <P>A precise breakdown in relation to unit costs for the provision of childcare facilities for infants and children in various age groups is not available.  Both the capital and operational costs of the provision of this service up to the standards required in the Childcare (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, varies depending on a number of factors including the type of service, the pre-inspection standard, the age of the children catered for, the staffing ratios, staffing costs, geographic location and any special arrangements required.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that an expert working group on child care has been established under Partnership 2000.  The group under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is currently examining the provision of a co-ordinated national framework for the development of a child care infrastructure including the financial and resourcing implications of its implementation.  The group is due to finalise its report in December 1998.</P>
      <P>In 1998, £8 million revenue has been made available by my Department to strengthen child care services.  This includes £500,000 for the continued implementation by the health boards of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII, in regard to pre-school services.</P>
      <P>The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, cre ches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service.</P>
      <P>A working group to monitor the implementation of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, is in place.  The group is representative of all the health boards and is concerned with ensuring a consistent approach to the implementation of the regulations.  It is intended that the operation of the regulations will be reviewed after three years, with a view to effecting any changes considered necessary at that stage.  As a first step in this process, I recently initiated a review of the inspection process through the working group.</P>

The refuge in Rathmines is operated directly by the Eastern Health Board and the Coolock refuge is substantially funded by the board.

      <P>In addition, the refuges employ children's workers whose primary function is to provide structured educational and recreational activities for resident children and to arrange for their admittance to local schools.  The workers refer children for relevant professional support where necessary.  The workers also work in close co-operation with the children's mothers.</P>

      <P>In the main, grant schemes within the health services are operated by the health boards. The only scheme operated directly by my Department is the national lottery discretionary fund.  Under this fund a group, organisation or individual may request a grant from my Department's allocation of national lottery funds towards the cost of health service projects.  A standard application form must be completed and is referred to the relevant service division for its assessment, evaluation and recommendation of the proposed project.  All applications are forwarded to me for my consideration, with the Department's recommendation.</P>
      <P>When the present Government took office, there was a balance of £21,099 available to the me from the 1997 allocation of £2,038,000.  In 1998, I have a total of £2,299,000 available to me for discretionary allocations from national lottery funds.  Details of the allocations made to date are set out on the following schedules.</P>

They have further stated that this service is not required very often but on those occasions when it is required, the hospital has been able to avail of the service at other local hospitals and the city morgue.  The Deputy will also be aware that the upgrading of the hospital's mortuary facilities is included in its major development project.</P>
      <P>I understand that in this particular case, when the pathologist in the Mater Hospital notified the city coroner of his patient's death, the coroner decided that it was necessary to carry out a post mortem.  In the circumstances, the post mortem had to be carried out at the city morgue.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express my sympathy to the relatives and friends of the deceased and to emphasise that I will do everything possible to ensure that the Mater's facilities are improved as early as possible.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have, for many years, been required to let their dwellings on an incomerelated basis.  At this stage only a very small number of tenancies, which are of a long standing nature, are on fixed rents.  The costs of transferring tenancies of old age pensioners to fixed rents would depend on the level at which rents were fixed and the number of dwellings occupied by pensioners.  As the determination of the rents of their dwellings is the responsibility of individual local authorities, information is not available in the Department to enable the costs sought to be computed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern) Dermot Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs operates a range of programmes of support for community groups, including grant schemes for voluntary organisations; locally-based community and family support groups the community development programme and the money advice and budgeting service.  The objective of these schemes is to enable disadvantaged communities to work in a practical way to address the issues that face them, to foster greater self-reliance and community leadership and to support a process of community and personal development in disadvantaged communities. Support in the form of grant aid is also provided to voluntary marriage and child counselling services.</P>
      <P>The community development programme was established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling poverty and disadvantage.  The programme provides financial assistance to projects towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in the area and to other specialised community development projects and initiatives having a strategic importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of a family and community services resource centre is to help combat disadvantage by improving the functioning of the family unit. Centres can provide special services for lone parent families, young mothers and others considered in need of extra support and can act as a first step to community participation and social inclusion for the most vulnerable and marginalised families.  There are currently 27 centres <Col N="1507" /> participating in or in the process of being set up under the programme.</P>
    <P>Recognising the important role played by these centres in supporting families, this programme has been expanded in 1998 and an additional £700,000 provided to this end.</P>
    <P>The total provision in 1998 for both the community development programme and the family and community services resource centre programme is £7.759 million, representing an increase of £2.159 million over the 1997 allocation.</P>
    <P>For many years my Department has also provided assistance to voluntary and community groups through a range of once-off grant schemes.  These grant schemes concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.</P>
    <P>As many of the groups funded under these schemes provide supports for the family, my Department has, in 1998, introduced a new integrated scheme of grants to locally-based community and family support groups, integrating the former schemes of grants to locally-based women's groups, locally-based men's groups and lone parent groups.  In addition, the Department continues to provide funding under the once-off scheme of grants to voluntary organisations and the community development education and training grants scheme.</P>
    <P>The total budget in 1998 for the scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups, including those groups that receive core-funding, the community development education and training grant scheme and the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, is £2.825 million, representing an increase of £100,000 on the amount provided in 1997.</P>
    <P>My Department also operates the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  A sum of £5 million has been allocated to the 1998 scheme.</P>
    <P>Through the provision of the money, advice and budgeting service the Department is directly involved in activities to combat moneylending and over-indebtedness.  Forty seven projects, providing advice and education to the local community in relation to money and debt management, have been established throughout the country.  The allocation to this scheme for 1998 is £3.143 million, representing an increase of £943,000 over 1997.</P>
    <P>This year, my Department took over responsibility, from the former Department of Equality and Law Reform, for providing support by way <Col N="1508" /> of grant aid to voluntary organisations providing services in marriage counselling and child counselling in relation to parental separation.  A total of £1.5 million was allocated for these grants in 1998, an increase of £600,000 in the funding for the previous year.</P>
    <P>Grant aid to voluntary organisations providing marriage preparation courses and bereavement counselling and support services is also being made available under this scheme in 1998.</P>
    <P>The Department provides grants to voluntary sector organisations towards the cost of welfare rights and information services and also to assist with once-off innovative information projects designed to increase awareness of the social services generally.  The allocation for 1998 was £500,000.</P>
    <P>The back to work allowance was introduced at the same time, as an incentive to ease the transition of the long-term unemployed back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>Employment grants, under the employment support service set up as part of my Department's proactive approach to long-term unemployment, aim to encourage self employed people on the back to work allowance to employ an unemployed person, also on the back to work allowance. The grant amounts to one third of the 75 per cent rate of back to work allowance payable over 12 months and is payable in two instalments. This year to date, 171 grants have been paid, totalling £258,730.</P>
    <P>Grants paid under the employment support services relate to individuals and cannot be released without the beneficiaries consent. Details of the total funding provided under the various programmes and once-off grant schemes have been made available to the Oireachtas Library each year since 1990.  Details of the total funding provided in 1998 under each scheme and programme will again be provided to the Oireachtas Library at the relevant time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have: (1) entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age; (2) at least 156 contributions paid from April 2002, this will increase to a minimum <Col N="1509" /> of 260 paid contributions and to a minimum of 520 from April 2012; and (3) a yearly average of at least 20 contributions or 24 in the case of a retirement pension registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.  The yearly average condition was reduced to ten contributions for the new <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension which came into force with effect from 21 November 1997.  To qualify, a person with a yearly average of between ten and 19 must have 260 rather than 156 paid contributions.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged that the application of the yearly average test has led to particular difficulties for people who, for one reason or another, had gaps in their insurance records leading to a diluted yearly average.  While the facility did exist for some people to maintain their record by becoming voluntary contributors, over the last decade successive measures have been introduced to alleviate some of these difficulties.  These include: in 1997, the reduction of the minimum yearly average requirement from 20 to ten contributions per year, leading to a <i>pro rata</i> pension; the introduction, in 1994, of the homemaker provisions to cater for periods of time spent outside the workforce caring either for children or incapacitated people; the introduction in 1991 of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for people with mixed insurance records, the rate payable being in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the rate appropriate for old age-retirement pensions, and the introduction, in 1988, of special partial old age pensions for people who entered compulsory social insurance in 1974 but who failed to qualify for a pension due to gaps in their insurance records between 1953 and 1974, due to the operation of the remuneration limit.</P>
      <P>In addition, a new <i>pro rata</i> pension will be made available to those self-employed, aged 56 or over in April 1988 when social insurance for the self-employed was introduced and who have at least five years contributions paid since then.</P>
      <P>I am aware that other issues still remain to be examined.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have long stated my commitment to ensuring the most broadly feasible contributory pension coverage to as many categories as possible.  With this in mind, my officials are undertaking a detailed review of the contribution conditions generally applying to the old age contributory and retirement pensions and I would hope to have a report on this in the first quarter of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also point out that where people have worked abroad, they may either qualify for a pension, in their own right, under the national legislation of that State or avail of the facility to combine the social insurance contributions with those paid in Ireland.  For instance, structures are in place for co-ordinating social security with other <Col N="1510" /> EU member states and those of the European economic area.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also concluded bilateral social security agreements with Australia, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, Quebec and the United States and further agreements with the Swiss confederation and the UK to include Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, are in the process of finalisation. The main purpose of these is to protect the pension rights of workers who have had periods of social insurance in both countries.  They also allow workers who are sent by their Irish employer to work in the other State, for short periods, to remain in the Irish social insurance system, thereby being exempt from double payment of social security contributions.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for carer's allowance in July 1998.

      <P>The person concerned appealed against this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
      <P>An appeals officer has considered the case and is of the opinion that an oral hearing is required to afford the person concerned the opportunity to present his case.  An oral hearing has been arranged for Wednesday, 2 December 1998 in Cavan and the person concerned has been advised accordingly.</P>

      <P>Craft gardeners employed in the Botanic Gardens have, for some time, sought a universal upgrading.  This claim has been rejected by the Labour Court on two previous occasions, in 1992 and 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuing this claim the gardeners refused to co-operate with training assessments, which they have traditionally completed for student gardeners undergoing practical training elements of their amenity horticulture diploma course, which is organised by Teagasc, in the Botanic Gardens. In 1994, Teagasc decided to revise the system of assessment to a modular base.  This required a modest additional input from the gardeners, entirely in keeping with their craftsperson grading. They refused to co-operate and used the situation to renew the grading claim, the concession of which would have given them greater status over other craftspersons including other gardeners, within the Department.  There would also be repercussions in so far as other Government Departments and the local authority sector are concerned.  The issue was again referred to the Labour Court in 1996, where the claim was rejected.  Following further negotiations my Department made a significant offer to the union in an effort to finally resolve the matter.  Unfortunately, on foot of a union ballot, the gardeners voted to reject this offer and simply reverted to their original position of seeking universal <Col N="1513" /> upgrading.  My Department could not accede to this demand.</P>
    <P>The gardeners subsequently refused to co-operate with the student training programme, which led to their inevitable suspension from duty.  From the outset, my Department has indicated its willingness to renew negotiations with the union, on condition that normal working is resumed, including full co-operation with the student training programmes.</P>
    <P>Within recent days my Department has engaged in informal discussions with the union side.  At this juncture it is hoped that further exploratory talks can provide the basis for a resumption of negotiations, in turn leading to a settlement of the dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The correspondence referred to by the Deputy raises a number of important issues which I will deal with in some detail.</P>
      <P>The importation of pornographic material, whether by post or by other means, is prohibited under section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.  The Customs Service is responsible for the enforcement aspects of this legislation and I am aware that they are very active in this regard. Any pornographic material imported is liable to seizure and the importer may be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of dissemination, distribution, sale and/or rental of pornographic material, the following is a summary of existing legislative measures which deal with these issues: Section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824; section 72 <Col N="1514" /> of the Towns Improvement Ireland Act, 1854; section 3 of the Indecent Advertisements Act, 1889; section 63(i)(b) of the Post Office Act, 1908; Censorship of Films Acts 1923 to 1992; Censorship of Publications Acts 1929 to 1967; section 9(i) of the Criminal Law Act, 1976; Video Recordings Acts, 1989 and 1992; and section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in July of this year the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998 came into operation.  The Act makes it an offence, <i>inter alia,</i> to produce, distribute, import, export, sell or show any child pornography, punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of this legislation is, of course, a matter for the Garda Siochána.  As the Deputy will appreciate the gardaí act on the basis of information or complaints received in relation to matters of this kind.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have received no complaint in relation to the matters to which the Deputy refers.  I would urge the Deputy to encourage any of the persons concerned to report the matter to the gardaí so that they can carry out inquiries to ascertain if any possible breaches of the criminal law have occurred.</P>
    <P>In view of the specific issues raised I have also brought this matter to the attention of the Data Protection Commissioner and I understand that he is investigating the data protection aspects of the matter.  It is, of course, open to anyone who has a complaint about this matter to also refer the data protection aspects of their complaint to the office of the Data Protection Commissioner for investigation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should point out that the importation and distribution or sale of pornography are among the issues addressed in the discussion paper on the law of sexual offences which I published in May of this year.  An analysis of the submissions received on the paper is at present being undertaken in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>While my Department does not operate any grant schemes as such, it does provide funding for a wide range of initiatives. Information in relation to the initiatives in question is as follows.</P>
      <P>
        <i>National Women's Council of Ireland</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department pays an annual grant to the National Women's Council of Ireland towards <Col N="1515" /> general operating costs.  The amount provided for in 1999 includes funding for general running costs and funding for a joint North-South conference to be organised in 1999 on mainstreaming/gender equality work.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Equal Opportunity Child care Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>In 1994, a pilot child care initiative was designed and was continued in each subsequent year, up to and including 1997.  The initiative was intended to assist projects for the establishment, on a pilot basis, of childcare measures utilising the skills of trained local people, to enable local residents to undertake education, training, retraining and employment opportunities which they would otherwise be unable to do, in the absence of a childcare facility.  It was a condition of the initiative that grants were confined to groups in disadvantaged areas which were defined as those areas in which there were Area Based Partnerships/local community groups.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I sought and obtained Government approval for the conversion of the pilot child care initiative into an equal opportunity child care programme.  This programme is designed to support local communities and employers who are trying to facilitate women and men who have childcare responsibilities while accessing training, education and employment.  It is targeted particularly at parents in disadvantaged areas and those in low pay who cannot access training, education and employment opportunities due to lack of affordable good quality childcare.  In July of this year I announced expenditure on this programme, including EU funding, over the 1998-9 period.  This funding is being provided to the following three initiatives.  On capital infrastructure, money is being targeted at community childcare projects to enable them to upgrade-enhance their facilities or establish new purpose built facilities for women and men who need child care while they are at work or availing of training; some 90 community projects are in receipt of funding.  On core funding, this fund is being used to provide support to meet the expenditure required for full-time senior childcare works in community childcare projects with a focus on equal opportunities and disadvantage; some 25 flagship projects are in receipt of funding.  The employer demonstration childcare initiative is being developed in partnership with IBEC to stimulate employer interest and involvement in supporting equal opportunity childcare facilities; some 21 companies, forming eight consortiums, are in receipt of funding.  I will arrange to have a list of the projects being funded under the equal opportunities child care programme sent to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Irish Council of People with Disabilities (Interim)</i>
    </P>
    <P>My Department furnishes an annual grant to the council to assist it in the performance of the <Col N="1516" /> tasks assigned to it by its constitution, which include the establishment of a permanent council which will act as the representative voice of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pilot Community Services Projects</i>
    </P>
    <P>My Department provides funds to Area Development Management Ltd.  (three projects) and to the Disabled People of Clare (one project) for four pilot projects designed to facilitate access at local level to information in accessible formats and to promote participation by people with disabilities in the local decision making process.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pilot Community Action Plan</i>
    </P>
    <P>My Department also provides funds to Area Development Management Ltd.  for two pilot projects designed to facilitate cross-sectoral planning at local level for the delivery of services to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Legal Aid Board.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid made to the Legal Aid Board is provided to enable it to carry out its function as required under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995. Under this Act the principal function of the board is to provide, within the board's resources and subject to the other provisions of the Act, legal aid and advice in civil cases to persons who satisfy the requirements of the Act.</P>
    <P>Apart from the civil legal aid scheme, the Legal Aid Board has agreed to operate the refugee legal service for which separate funding is being made available.</P>
    <P>
      <i>FLAC.</i>
    </P>
    <P>An annual grant is paid to FLAC.  Because of specific difficulties which FLAC encountered in late 1991 and early 1992, the then Minister for Justice undertook to provide them with financial assistance on an annual basis.  Funding has been made available to FLAC since that time.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Marriage and Child Counselling Grants</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Department administered a scheme of grants to those voluntary organisations which provided marriage counselling and also to those voluntary organisations which provided counselling to children whose parents had separated. On and from 1 January 1998 responsibility for administration of this scheme transferred to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The following is a list of organisations which benefited under the scheme of grants in 1997:</P>

      <P>In general, there are three ways in which a person who is not a citizen of Ireland can obtain Irish citizenship; by descent (foreign births registration), by naturalisation or by marriage to an Irish citizen (post-nuptial citizenship).</P>
      <P>There does not appear to be a record of applications for naturalisation or post-nuptial citizenship having been received in my Department from or on behalf of the persons detailed and the Department of Foreign Affairs, which administers foreign births registration, has confirmed that there is no record of applications having been received in that Department.</P>
      <P>The conditions governing the acquisition of Irish citizenship through the three methods mentioned above are set out below and if the persons detailed are satisfied that they fulfil the criteria under any of the headings, it is open to them to make an application to my Department or to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Descent</i>
      </P>
      <P>A person whose mother or father was born in Ireland is automatically an Irish citizen.  A person whose grandfather or grandmother, but not his or her parents, was born in Ireland may become an Irish citizen by registering in the foreign births register (FBR) at an Irish Embassy or consular office or at the Department of Foreign Affairs. There are also certain instances whereby a person can obtain Irish citizenship through his or her great-grandfather or great-grandmother.  The following table sets out the position &mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1521" /> The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986 introduced a provision whereby registration in the FBR would henceforth grant citizenship from the date of registration only.  Hence, the situation whereby the great-grandchild of an Irish-born person (&ldquo;D&rdquo;) can only register as an Irish citizen if his/her parent (&ldquo;C&rdquo;) had registered him/himself prior to the child's birth.</P>

      <i>Naturalisation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as substituted by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986, provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, at his absolute discretion, grant a certificate of naturalisation where statutory provisions are complied with.  These provisions require that an applicant has resided in the State for five years, is of good character and intends to reside in the State after naturalisation.  Section 16 of the Act, as substituted by the 1986 Act, provides that the Minister may, in specific instances, waive some or all the statutory requirements when considering an application.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Marriage to an Irish citizen (post-nuptial citizenship)</i>
    </P>
    <P>Section 8 of the 1956 Act, as substituted by the 1986 Act, provides that a person who is not an Irish citizen may, following three years marriage to an Irish citizen, lodge a declaration accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship, provided that the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgement of the declarations and the couple are living together as husband and wife and the spouse who is an Irish citizen submits an affidavit to that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the report of the task force on violence against women, the national steering committee on violence against women was established in December 1997.  It is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, and comprises representative from five relevant Government Departments, various non-Governmental agencies working with women who are experiencing violence, the health boards, the medical and legal profession, the gardaí, the probation and welfare service and the clergy.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the task force report are being addressed on a structured and ongoing basis.  The thrust of the report has been subsumed into the work of the national steering committee which has a wider remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The steering committee has a number of specific objectives to undertake, including the establishment of regional structures, the development of a public awareness campaign, the co-ordination and provision of advice in relation to the distribution of resources, the ongoing development of policies, the oversight and monitoring of individual agencies' written policies and guidelines, the undertaking of research and needs assessments, the promotion of inter-agency training and the development of codes of practice for collecting statistics and monitoring responses. Progress has been made in all of these areas and <Col N="1523" /> I would like to set out some specific examples for the Deputy below.</P>
    <P>The national steering committee is in the process of developing a public awareness campaign to generate debate and to educate society about the problem of violence against women.  This is the first phase in a process which is expected to last from two to three years.  The primary aim of this phase of the campaign is to generate debate in a wide range of media which would reach all strata of society including both rural and urban areas.</P>
    <P>Under the remit of the national steering committee, eight regional committees along the health board boundaries were established in May 1998.  Membership reflects that of the national steering committee, i.e., key players in the field of providing services of victims of violence while at the same time taking due account of specific local circumstances.</P>
    <P>A number of other initiatives have been put in place along with the national steering committee and the establishment of the regional committees. Earlier this year I launched a discussion document on the law on sexual offences.  Interested individuals, groups and organisations were invited, to give their views on changes they would like to see made to the law.  The issues identified in the paper were complex and sensitive and include the law relating to the protection of children and women from sexual offences.</P>
    <P>The role of the gardaí in the area of domestic violence has also been significantly improved with the domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit being given a national role since 1997.  At present nominated inspectors monitor the implementation of the Garda policy in this area at divisional level.  There is also ongoing training at in-service training schools in each Garda division on crimes of violence against women and children as well as practical on-the-job training which is monitored and evaluated by supervisors.  Service providers also give lectures to gardaí at the Garda College and at in-service training schools.  The development of the regional committees is facilitating closer working links between the gardaí and service providers.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has developed a range of different programmes, of which the two most widely used are the social, personal and health education programme (SPHE) and the relationships and sexuality education (RSE), which are compulsory in all primary and post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>In May 1998, a contract was signed with Women's Aid to act as a support agency to the community development programme.  This programme is focused on supporting people living in areas of disadvantage.  Women's Aid provides support and advice to CDP projects on how to deal sensitively with women in need of support.</P>
    <P>The National Network of Women's Refuges and support services is developing a computerised bed bureau which will be operational in <Col N="1524" /> early 1999.  This will be a practical measure to assist any woman who has to leave home as a result of violence.  In relation to statistical data, the network collects data on the number of women and children availing of refuge accommodation, distress calls received and the number of women who cannot be assisted by refuges.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that courts dealing with domestic violence cases should improve the services directed towards family law cases.  I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, will be taking these issues up with the Courts Service when it is up and running in the new year.</P>
    <P>My Department has just commissioned a research project into the reasons why there are high attrition rates in bringing prosecutions in rape cases.  This is being undertaken jointly by the Department of Applied Social Studies, University College Cork, Cork Rape Crisis Centre and Kerry Rape Crisis Centre.  The project will examine, on a step by step basis, the obstacles which rape victims encounter before coming into contact with the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>My Department is also part-funding a research project into the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.  The aim of the research is to provide a baseline of data and informed comment on the implementation of the domestic violence legislation.  This project will document the way domestic violence is responded to by the Garda and processed through the civil law and criminal justice system.  The system includes Garda lawyers, court officials, the judiciary and other professionals, such as probation officers, the medical profession and social workers who work as part of the court system.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new process which the establishment of the national steering committee embodies is making steady progress.  I understand that the committee's first report will be published early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The investigation of complaints in respect of members of an Garda Síochána is properly the function of The Garda Síochána Complaints Board.  My office wrote to the person referred to by the Deputy on 20 May explaining that it was open to him to lodge a complaint with the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This letter also described why it was necessary to introduce certain changes in the law, to enable immigration officers carry out checks on persons travelling from the UK.  These measures were <Col N="1525" /> introduced to protect the common travel area (CTA) between Ireland and the UK in the context of overwhelming evidence that the CTA was increasingly being abused by persons who had no right to enter Ireland.</P>
    <P>Of course, I would be concerned generally to ensure that these controls are applied with the minimum possible interference or offence to genuine travellers and the Garda authorities have been asked to ensure that immigration officers exercising these powers do so in a discreet and courteous way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid):</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Bray Partnership has written to all members of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, including the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and me, in relation to their report on social inclusion and drugs in Bray and, specifically, the question of designating Bray as a local drugs task force area as part of the Government's drugs initiative.</P>
      <P>A report on the external evaluation of the drugs initiative was recently considered by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion.  The evaluation found that the task forces have achieved a number of significant successes in the short time since they were established and that their very existence has provided a strong focus for tackling drugs issues in target areas, reducing the feeling of isolation felt by many local communities and preventing a potentially critical solution from developing further into a continuing downward spiral of economic deprivation, addiction and crime.</P>
      <P>Arising from recommendations in the evaluation, the Cabinet committee has agreed in principle to the continuation of the local drugs task forces for the time being, to facilitate the putting in place of an evaluation framework which would include clear statements of the overall aim of the initiative, the specific objectives arising from this aim and the specific targets arising from these objectives, quantified where possible and appropriate macro-level monitoring arrangements to allow performance against stated objectives and targets to be measured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meanwhile, a full review of the drugs task forces, having regard to the findings and recommendations of the evaluation, has already begun with a view to submitting a detailed response to the Cabinet committee at an early date.  This will make way for a comprehensive, in-depth review of the overall national drugs strategy, due to commence early in the New Year.  The question of establishing local drugs task forces in areas outside <Col N="1526" /> the existing 13 will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme operated by my Department consists of the recreational facilities and the major facilities schemes.  The recreational facilities scheme assists voluntary community organisations in providing, improving and equipping recreational, leisure and community facilities.  The major facilities scheme is a multi-annual capital programme for major sports facilities at national, regional and local level.</P>
      <P>In February last, the present programme was closed down and all applications received up to the closing date were examined.  In the light of this assessment, grants totalling £5.95 million were allocated to a number of projects around the country, a list of which I will forward to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In the context of the 1998 round of allocations, I announced that I was initiating a comprehensive review of operation of the sports capital programme. The review of the programme has been ongoing in my Department for the past few months and I expect that it will be completed very shortly.  Once the review is completed, details of the new programme will be widely publicised and it will then be open to clubs and organisations to apply for funding under the new programme.</P>
      <P>The annual grant scheme for national governing bodies of sport (NGBS) administered by my Department provides funding for 75 recognised NGBs to assist with the cost of administration, international competition and training, international events and meetings, organisational development, and equipment.  The aim of this scheme is primarily to assist the NGBs' ongoing efforts to increase participation in sport, especially amongst the young, people with disabilities, communities in areas of disadvantage, and women; and to promote standards of good conduct and fair play.</P>
      <P>A list of the national governing bodies of sport which receive funding in 1998 under this scheme is also attached.</P>
      <P>The international carding scheme for high performance player/athletes was launched in May 1998.  The scheme replaces the outstanding sport-spersons grant scheme operated by the Department of Education between 1986 and 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international carding scheme provides Ireland's most talented junior, developmental and world class athletes with the opportunity to <Col N="1527" /> benefit from a structured system of supports which includes (i) direct financial assistance and, (ii) access, free of charge, to a full range of sports science and medical services, a career planning and counselling service and training facilities.</P>
    <P>Under the international carding scheme, athletes must have attained specific performance standards in one of the classification categories &mdash; junior, developmental, international or world &mdash; in order to be considered for support.  The selection of applicants in each category is made with reference to sport specific criteria, as agreed with the relevant national governing bodies of sport. This system aims to remove any element of subjectivity in that only those athletes who have reached the agreed criteria may be selected.</P>
    <P>The objective of the scheme will be to nurture emerging talent and to turn a higher percentage of international class performances into world class performances, thus helping Irish players and athletes to reach more European, World and Olympic finals and win more medals in these events.  The scheme is underpinned by a drugsfree philosophy.</P>
    <P>A total of 178 players and athletes have qualified for support under the carding scheme in 1998.  Funding of £964,365 has been allocated in direct financial support to the relevant national governing bodies of sport for distribution to the individual players and athletes.</P>
    <P>A list of the 178 players and athletes who attained carded status under the 1998 scheme, is attached.</P>
    <P>Under the youth and sport grant scheme, administered by my Department, funding is provided to vocational education committees (VECs) for the promotion of youth and sport <Col N="1528" /> activities at local level.  Grants are distributed by the vocational education committees to local youth and sports clubs and to a number of special initiatives, including projects for disadvantaged young people.  All 33 vocational education committees received funding in 1998 under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Assistance is provided to recreational sports by means to grants towards organisations providing recreational sport opportunities as part, or all, of their overall activities.  Funding is given to the specific sports programmes of these organisations. The organisations benefiting from this scheme in 1998 are: The Irish Heart Foundation; Dublin Healthy Cities; Dublin City Marathon; The Irish Countrywomen's Association; Saol Plus; Age &amp; Opportunity; and Parks Tennis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 223 together.</P>
      <P>Funds are available to schools from my Department either to initiate or further enhance information and communication technology (ICT) development under a number of schemes as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  <i>Schools IT 2000 Project</i></P>
      <P>All recognised primary schools and all second-level schools recognised for grant purposes under the free education scheme are eligible for grant aid under Strand I of the technology integration initiative (TII) of Schools IT 2000 as follows:</P>
      <P>Ordinary Schools: A basic grant of £2,000 plus £5 per pupil in ordinary classes.</P>
      <P>Special Schools: A basic grant of £3,000 plus £20 per pupil.</P>
      <P>All ordinary schools with one or more special classes are eligible for an additional grant of £1,500 plus £20 per pupil in the special class or classes.</P>
      <P>The grants concerned were issued to all qualifying schools in May of this year and new schools are also being grant aided as they come into operation.</P>
      <P>I have also put in place a special fund of £250,000 to cater for the ICT needs of individual special needs pupils, including those who are fully integrated into ordinary classes.  Applications for funding from this provision are submitted by schools to the special education section of my Department and are assessed on the basis of priority of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above, primary and second-level schools selected for participation in the school integration project (SIP) element of Schools IT 2000 will be eligible for additional funding for ICT equipment and for a reasonable amount of teacher release time for those teachers involved in the project.  The National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE), which I established to implement the various elements of Schools IT 2000, has invited applications from schools and will be announcing the results of this process shortly.  At least 40 <Col N="1531" />&ldquo;lead&rdquo; schools will be selected for inclusion in the SIP.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Other Scheme for Primary and Special Schools</i></P>
    <P>The special education section of my Department makes funding available for the purchase of equipment, including computer equipment, for pupils with special needs.  All applications for such funding are assessed on the basis of priority of need.  The total funds available for this purpose in 1998 are £529,000.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Other Schemes for Second-Level Schools</i></P>
    <P>The post-primary building unit of my Department supplies computers, printers, peripherals and software in all instances where a computer room is being provided as part of a new school or a school extension.  Funding for this purpose is provided from the second-level capital allocation for school buildings.  It is not necessary for schools to make special application in this instance because the appropriate arrangements for supply are made with the school by my Department when the relevant building project has been completed.  Approximately £1 million will be spent in this area in 1998.</P>
    <P>Grants of up to a maximum of £22,000 which are mainly for the purchase of IT equipment, are available to schools on introducing the leaving certificate vocational programme and-or the leaving certificate applied.  The leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational programme support services assist schools in the identification and purchase of equipment, which will best meet their individual needs.  The Department pays the grant to schools or vocational education committees following this process.  The 1998 provision for this scheme is £1,369,000.</P>
    <P>An amount of £700,000 has been provided under the school administration project in the current year for the purpose of assisting second-level schools in acquiring information technology equipment and software for administration purposes.  Schools are invited to participate in the project by way of letters of offer of equipment or software or, more recently, of grant-aid issued by the IT unit of my Department.</P>
    <P>A grant scheme for the purchase of equipment, including computer equipment, for second-level pupils with serious physical and/or communicative disabilities is administered by the post-primary administration section of my Department.  Application for the grant is made to the section by school authorities.  The 1998 provision for this scheme is £340,000.</P>

      <P>The following schemes provide a range of measures designed to provide additional support to schools designated as disadvantaged: the disadvantaged areas scheme, Breaking the Cycle pilot project, home school community liaison scheme, Early Start pilot project, and the teacher counsellor scheme.</P>
      <P>The aims of these schemes are to address the effects of socio-economic deprivation on the pupils in the schools concerned through the provision of additional staffing and financial resources.</P>
      <P>Schools seeking disadvantaged status are assessed and prioritised as to need on the basis of socio-economic and educational indicators such as unemployment levels, housing, medical card holders and information on basic literacy and numeracy.</P>

      <P>My Department has ensured that all products purchased since 1997 are year 2000 compliant. In addition, my Department is currently implementing a major programme of work designed to ensure that all its existing IT systems and all of the hardware and software components of its IT infrastructure will continue to work through the changeover to the next millennium. The programme of work also deals with the potential impact of the millennium bug on non-IT equipment with embedded electronics, for example, phone systems, lifts, security systems, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's programme of work is progressing <Col N="1533" /> well towards the goal of ensuring that any adverse effects of the millennium bug on the Department's operations will be minimal.</P>
    <P>With regard to bodies under the aegis of my Department, status reports are sought from 90 bodies every two months and these form the basis of bi-monthly progress reports to Government.  It would appear that a number of bodies, particularly larger bodies, are making good progress at present, but continuing close monitoring of the general situation will be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The period since the formation of this Government has seen an unprecedented level of activity in legislation relating to education.</P>
      <P>In December of last year the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Act, 1997, was enacted.  That Act established a fund to provide for educational and vocational training and research in the fields of science and technology. The Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund (Amendment) Bill, which provides for an increased allocation to that fund, has recently been drafted.  It is my intention that this legislation will be in place before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, yesterday completed Report Stage in the Seanad and it is likely that the Bill will be enacted before the end of 1998.  The Bill will provide a statutory framework for education at primary and post-primary levels for the first time.  It will also make provision for the roles and relationships of the partners in the education system.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme of special arrangements relating to the certificate examinations operated by my Department, extra time, subject to a maximum of ten minutes per scheduled hour of each question paper, may be approved where the candidate needs the help of a scribe or would <Col N="1534" /> otherwise be unable to make adequate use of the mechanical aids provided for recording the answers or where the candidate is visually impaired.</P>
      <P>Ten minutes additional time per question paper may be allowed in the case of candidates who are profoundly deaf.</P>
      <P>Each individual case is assessed separately to determine the precise arrangements to be made for the student concerned.</P>
      <P>The Education and Training (Qualifications) Bill is currently being drafted and it is hoped to publish the Bill in the new year.  The aim of the Bill is to promote access, mobility and progression within adult, continuing, further and higher education and training, effectively all education and training from post-primary education to third-level education excluding the currently established universities.</P>
      <P>The Youth Work Bill will be brought to Government shortly.  The Bill will be a re-working of the Youth Work Act enacted in 1997.  The latter is largely inoperable as its provisions were to a large extent dependent on the establishment of education boards.  As well as confirming the Government's commitment to establishing youth work on a sound statutory footing, the Bill will enhance youth work provision in a number of significant ways.  In particular, the Bill will provide for the development of co-ordinated plans at local and national level.</P>
      <P>A school attendance and educational welfare Bill is being drafted and it is hoped to publish the Bill early in the new year.  The new legislation is intended to address not only the problems attached to school attendance but also issues relating to the educational welfare of children in general.  It will emphasise the importance of both identifying cases where a child is experiencing difficulties in school attendance and intervening at an early stage.</P>
      <P>The George Mitchell Scholarship Bill was debated in the Dáil this morning.  The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Government to pay a sum of £2 million into a scholarship fund to enable American students to study in Irish universities. It is intended that the legislation will be in place before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Work is ongoing in my Department on a Bill which will amend the Vocational Education Acts. The aim of the Bill will be to modernise certain aspects of the existing legislation.  Consideration will be given to the composition of the bodies so as to give parents a statutory role and it is proposed to review the accountability and reporting provisions so as to bring them into line with modern best practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the steering committee on the establishment of a teaching council has recently been published and, following consideration of their recommendations, proposals for a Teaching <Col N="1535" /> Council Bill will be brought to Government shortly.</P>
    <P>A national forum for early childhood education was held in March of this year.  The forum provided a focus for consultation with all of the partners and for the development of proposals aimed at co-ordinating and resourcing early childhood education services.  The report of the proceedings of the forum was published last month.  Following consideration of the report, a White Paper on early childhood education will be published covering issues such as funding, certification, curriculum and co-ordination.</P>
    <P>A Green Paper on adult education, Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning, was also published last month.  This first ever Green Paper in this area aims to promote awareness and debate on the key role of adult education, to identify the main weaknesses in provision and to set a basis for a national policy on adult education. Following a process of consultation, a White Paper setting out policy in this area will be prepared.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Grant Scheme &mdash; Child care</i>
      </P>
      <P>Provision has been made available by my Department, in the financial years 1998 and 1999 for the provision of child care facilities for participants in the vocational training opportunities scheme, Youthreach, and senior traveller training programmes.  In September this year the first grant installment of 1998 funds issued to each vocational education committee to contribute towards the cost of running centres, of purchasing places in community-based child care centres, and of funding child minders where places are purchased in commercial cre ches or child minders are used.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Scheme of grant aid to schools under the technology integration initiative of the Schools IT 2000 project.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this once-off grant, paid in the current year, is to enable schools to add to their information and communication technology infrastructure by purchasing computer equipment for classroom use.  All recognised primary schools, special schools and all second-level <Col N="1536" /> schools recognised for grant purposes under the free education scheme have been grant aided.</P>
    <P>The grants paid were as follows: ordinary schools &mdash; basic grant of £2,000 plus £5 per pupil in ordinary classes; special schools &mdash; basic grant of £3,000 plus £20 per pupil.</P>
    <P>All ordinary schools with one or more special classes received an additional grant of £1,500 plus £20 per pupil in the special class or classes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Scheme of grant aid to education centres under the Schools IT 2000 project.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The objective of this once-off grant is to enable education centres to add to their information and communication technology infrastructure by purchasing computer equipment to support the provision of ICT training to teachers.  A grant of £6,000 is available to each education centre under the scheme.  The following eight education centres have availed of this grant to date: Gortahork; Cavan; Laois; Mayo; Kilkenny; Wexford; Navan; Sligo.</P>
    <P>The remaining 21 centres are expected to avail of the scheme in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Scheme of grant aid for individual special needs pupils under the Schools IT 2000 project.</i>
    </P>
    <P>With this scheme, I have put in place a special fund of £250,000 to cater for the ICT needs of individual special needs pupils, including those who are fully integrated into ordinary classes.  It would not be appropriate to release the names of the individual pupils grant aided under this scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Technology upgrades.</i>
    </P>
    <P>A grant scheme to assist second-level schools to upgrade pupil administration software was initiated in 1998.  The objective of the scheme is to enable schools to migrate from an existing applications package to a more modern version, which is fully year 2000 compliant.  Schools who do not have a software package at present will also be offered a grant to assist in the acquisition of the appropriate software.  No funds have yet been disbursed under the scheme but it is intended that all second-level schools will be entitled to grant-aid.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Early school leavers initiatives</i>
    </P>
    <P>A total of £3.62 million is being made available under the recently launched early school leavers initiative for eight to 15 year olds.</P>
    <P>The objective of this initiative is to pilot test models of response to the problem of early school leaving in selected areas of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>A total of 14 project areas have been selected for inclusion in this phase of the initiative.  The selected projects will be funded over the next two school years.</P>

      <i>Pilot project on modern languages</i>
    </P>
    <P>A pilot project on modern languages has been introduced in approximately 270 primary schools. As part of this project, certain schools who do not have a teacher on staff capable of teaching one of the target languages, that is, Italian, French, <Col N="1538" /> German and Spanish, have been grant aided by the Department to enable them to source a teacher locally who will teach the language for a number of hours each week.  The amount of the grant varies according to the number of children in fifth and sixth classes in each school.  This grant has been termed the visiting teacher tuition grant.</P>
    <P>In addition, each school participating in the project is being given a grant to assist with the purchase of resource-teaching materials associated with the project.  The amount of the grant will vary from £200 to £500 depending on pupil numbers.  This grant has been termed a resources grant.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Examinations</i>
    </P>
    <P>There are no new grant schemes <i>per se</i> in relation to examinations.  I did however waive examination fees in respect of medical card holders or the children of medical card holders.  This replaced a scheme of alleviation where schools were allocated amounts that could be offset against the total exam fee bill due from the school.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New grant schemes in the higher education area PLC grants</i>
    </P>
    <P>A maintenance grants scheme for participants on PLC courses was introduced with effect from the 1998-9 academic year.  The rates of grant, income limits, and other criteria for eligibility are similar to those which apply to the third-level student support schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Government of Ireland research scholarships</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government of Ireland research scholarships in the humanities and social sciences were announced in June 1998 and have a budget of £500,000 for 1998.  An interim council on the humanities and social sciences has been established to oversee the awarding of these scholarships. The interim council has approved a total of 48 awards to date.</P>

      <P>A total of £3.62 million is being made available to the early school leavers initiative over the next two school years.  The objective of this phase of the initiative was to select a range of strategic pilot projects in urban and rural areas of disadvantage which will develop models of good practice with a view to their integration after evaluation into mainstream policy and practice.</P>
      <P>The initiative includes a project strand, a research strand and an evaluation/support strand. A management committee comprised of representatives of the Department of Education and Science and outside agencies has been established to oversee the operation of the initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 115 consortia applied for inclusion under the projects strand and each application <Col N="1540" /> was examined by a selection committee.  Fourteen project areas were selected for inclusion in the current phase of the initiative.  Nine of the selected projects focus on large urban areas.  Three projects focus on provincial towns and two on rural areas.  A list of the selected project areas follows.</P>
    <P>The education research centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, Dublin 9, has been selected to undertake three related pieces of research under the research strand.  These include the development of a tracking template/pupil database for use in primary schools.</P>
    <P>The evaluation support strand of the initiative will provide administrative and professional support for the overall initiative and for each of the selected projects.  It will also promote the formation of networks between the project areas, develop appropriate performance indicators and reporting structures and evaluate the ongoing delivery and effectiveness of the actions undertaken.</P>
    <P>The overall operation of the initiative will be kept under ongoing review.  The question of extending the initiative will be considered in the light of experience gained with the models now being tested.</P>

      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school going population.  The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils.  As an alternative to extending disadvantaged status to further national schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools already in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Breaking the Cycle pilot project was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended by the study.  The pilot offers a package of targeted supports to selected schools in urban and rural areas.  A total of 33 urban and 123 rural schools are included in the scheme at present.  The support packages provided involve the following: Urban Schools: extra staff to allow a PTR of 15:1 in all junior classes; special funding of up to £3,000 for materials/equipment; special funding of up to £4,000 for out of school projects; support from the specially appointed co-ordinator of the urban phase of the scheme.  Rural Schools: special funding of £1,000 for materials/equipment; special funding of £1,000 for suitable local initiatives; special capitation funding of £75 per pupil; support from 25 specially appointed co-ordinators. The 123 rural schools are grouped into 25 clusters, with one locally-based co-ordinator serving each.</P>
      <P>Total expenditure on Breaking the Cycle in the 1997 school year was in excess of £700,000, exclusive of teacher salaries.</P>
      <P>The operation of the programme is being closely monitored over its five year pilot phase.</P>

      <P>The Early Start pre-school pilot programme was introduced in 1994 with the establishment of eight pre-schools centres involving 13 pre-school classes.  In September 1995 a further 32 projects involving 43 pre-school classes were established.  This brought the total number of pre-school classes to 56.  This reduced to 55 in September of this year due to falling enrolment in one school.</P>
      <P>Each pre-school class caters for up to 30 children, 15 in the morning and 15 in the afternoon. The 55 classes can cater for up to 1,650 children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each pre-school class attracts: special capitation funding of £75 per pupil; a qualified primary <Col N="1542" /> teacher and a child care assistant; a start-up grant of £4,500 for materials/equipment; and a grant of £1,500 to foster parental involvement.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on Early Start in 1997 was £2,106,542, which included grants to schools, teacher salaries and child care assistant salaries.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I held a national forum for early childhood education.  My objective in holding the forum was to allow all groups with an interest in the area of early childhood education to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the future development of services in this area.</P>
    <P>A report on the outcome of the forum has now been received in my Department and is being considered in the context of the preparation of a White Paper on early childhood education which I will publish next year.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of caretaking and clerical services.</P>
      <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil &mdash; £15 per pupil in respect of each service &mdash; to a maximum of £15,000 per annum, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant.  The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management full discretion as to the level and extent of the services to which the grants are to be applied.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of such services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP.  The priority has been to extend the scheme in the first instance to schools which have no caretaking or clerical provision already.  In this regard the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services and the position of schools which are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the scheme will be examined <Col N="1543" /> in the context of any improvements to the scheme which may be implemented in the future.</P>

      <P>I have just recently received correspondence from the Waterford Association for Learning Difficulties regarding the provision of supports, including educational facilities, for pupils with attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactive disorder.</P>
      <P>Many children exhibiting less extreme forms of the behaviour associated with ADD/ADHD are being successfully taught within mainstream classes with the support, where necessary, of remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>Where more pronounced forms of the behaviour are exhibited, the children have access to a range of special support services including special schools for pupils with emotional and behavioural disturbance; special support from the resource teacher service and special support from the teacher counsellor scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department's inspectorate ensures that the attention of teacher trainers is drawn to the condition in question.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area.  This initiative is specifically designed to ensure that all children who have been assessed as having a special need will receive the support they require.</P>
      <P>A key element in this initiative is the introduction of a formalised system of special support for all children attending national schools on a full integrated basis who have been assessed as having a special educational need.  Such support may take the form of extra teaching or child care support or both depending on the assessed needs of the individual child.</P>

      <P>Arrears of pension are due to some retired teachers in accordance with the terms of the PCW agreement and Partnership 2000.  In order to calculate how much is due under Partnership 2000, it is first necessary to complete the calculation of how much is due under the PCW agreement.</P>
      <P>The PCW agreement is a complex one and, in order to cope with implementation of its provisions, including paying pension arrears, my Department has taken on additional staff, both permanent and temporary.</P>
      <P>The pace of the work of payment has been affected by the fact that normal retirements, which reached a record level in 1997, have continued to occur at the same high level, almost 50 per cent higher than in 1996.  The work has also been delayed by the amount of queries which are received on a daily basis regarding the benefits of the PCW agreement and regarding superannuation generally.  The rate of queries received is such that staff are dedicated to answering phone queries between 10 and 12 in the morning in the case of secondary teachers and between 2.30 and 4.30 in the afternoon in the case of primary teachers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the outstanding arrears, including the arrears due under Partnership 2000, the position is that a dedicated group of staff are working full-time with a view to making payments to as many retired teachers as possible before Christmas.  Where it is not possible to complete the work of calculating the amounts due before Christmas, my Department will make payments on account to the retired teachers involved.</P>

      <P>The board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of primary schools.  In 1993 my Department issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour to all primary and post-primary schools.  The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase the awareness of the problem among school management, staff, pupils and parents.  A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department investigates specific complaints which involve an alleged breach of the rules for national schools, including bullying complaints, but only after every effort has been made to resolve the matter at local level.  In the case referred to by the Deputy, the complaint received by my Department alleges bullying of the complainant's daughter by another pupil.  When the matter was originally brought to my Department's attention, my officials replied to the child's mother by outlining the responsibilities of the board of management of the school in relation to <Col N="1547" /> bullying and discipline and setting out the Department's complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>My officials received permission from the child's mother on 12 November 1998 to pursue the matter on her behalf with the board of management of the school.  My officials wrote to the board of management on the same day asking them to forward a report on the matter.  When the board's report is received it will be referred immediately to my Department's inspectorate for investigation.  As soon as the process is completed the child's mother will be informed of the outcome. I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to conclude this matter as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 260 together.</P>
      <P>There are 27 applications for the post of remedial teacher, and three applications for resource teacher posts from primary schools in County Kildare.</P>
      <P>Three second level schools in the county have submitted requests for additional remedial and resource provision for the 1998-9 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I allocated an additional 60 remedial teacher posts to primary schools with effect from 1 September 1998.  The number of remedial teachers in place <Col N="1552" /> in the primary system now stands at 1,302.  I am currently examining the scope for further development of the remedial service in keeping with my objective to ensure that a remedial service is made available to every national school in the country.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The response may take the form of full or part-time teaching or child care support, or both, depending on the number of children involved and their special needs.  In the context of this new development, my Department is currently considering all applications on hands for resource teacher support.</P>
