    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the British Prime Minister's announcement of the intention to establish a new, independent judicial tribunal of inquiry last Thursday.  This has been continuously sought by me and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in all of our contacts with the British Prime Minister and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland since we took office, as it was by my predecessor, Deputy John Bruton, to whom I pay tribute for his excellent initiative in commissioning the Irish Government's assessment in <Col N="830" /> the first place.  As the House is aware, I authorised the publication of the assessment last Thursday, since it played such an important part in the decision to establish a new and independent inquiry.  Having given the British Government sufficient time to fully consider its contents to enable it reach this decision, we published the assessment not in any spirit of recrimination, but as something that was owed to the victims and the relatives of the victims in the interest of truth and justice.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the British Prime Minister and acknowledge his strong interest in this matter leading to last week's welcome announcement.  I also pay tribute to his steadfast commitment and unstinting efforts to establish the truth for the Bloody Sunday victims and relatives.  I hope the new inquiry will help them to put the events of that terrible day behind them by finally establishing and acknowledging the truth of the tragic events of that day.</P>
    <P>I visited Derry and Belfast on 23 January where I was met by Mr. John Hume, MP for Foyle; the Mayor of Derry, Councillor Martin Bradley, and a representative of the Secretary of State.  My first call was breakfast with the Derry District Partnership which co-ordinates the implementation of the EU peace and reconciliation package in the Derry District Council area and brings together political representatives with representatives of the social partner organisations and voluntary community bodies.  The attendance was representative of both communities, although DUP members did not attend and delivered a letter of protest at my visit.  I was able to note the success of the partnership approach in Derry and elsewhere and add my support to all those maintaining cross-community links.  I was also able to acknowledge the success of the credit union movement in Ireland and the strong tradition of self-help of the people of Derry when I called to Derry Credit Union in the Bogside and met staff and directors.</P>
    <P>While in Derry I laid a wreath at the Bloody Sunday Memorial where I made a statement to and responded to the questions of the media.  I met the victims and relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday at a meeting also attended by Mr. John Hume, Mayor Martin Bradley, Mr. Martin McGuinness, Mr. Mitchel McLaughlin and the former Bishop of Derry, Edward Daly, where I paid tribute to the relatives' commitment and unstinting efforts to establish the truth.</P>
    <P>While in Creggan I visited the headquarters of the Creggan Festival at the Ráth Mór Shopping Centre where I acknowledged the tremendous achievements of the Creggan community over the past 50 years and spoke of the essential need for a fair and balanced accommodation of the legitimate concerns of all.  I stressed this could not be a purely internal settlement if there is to be an agreement but would have to include a meaningful North-South body to provide institutional expression for the Nationalist identity and a <Col N="831" /> framework for practical common action on an all-island basis.</P>
    <P>I paid a brief visit to St. Peter's school on Southway Road where I met governors, staff and pupils.  I then visited the Derry City Council offices where I met the mayor, city councillors of all traditions and the leaders in Derry of the four main churches.  I also met the North West Region Cross-Border Group which is comprised of elected representatives from Derry, Donegal, Limavady and Strabane where a presentation was made on the constructive developmental work being done by the group following which I spoke on and discussed a number of issues, including the Government's determination to secure an agreement which will bring peace and stability.</P>
    <P>In Belfast I was the first speaker in a weekly series of political lunches organised by the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I spoke on a number of issues and, having outlined the role of positive hands-on action by Government, pro-active public policy and effective executive agencies in our economic success in the Republic, stressed the need for effective public policy and executive agencies on an all-island basis if we are to gain the advantages of a single island economy and thus the need for a North-South ministerial council and implementation bodies with executive functions at an all-island level.  I also highlighted the need to sustain the talks and achieve a widely acceptable settlement.</P>
    <P>While meeting a group of senior students at Campbell College in Belfast to which I had received an invitation, who were joined by senior students at Strathearn and Bloomfield Collegiate, I had an opportunity to talk about our approach to peace and how best we think it will be achieved.  I had a private meeting with the Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam.</P>
    <P>It was a useful and positive trip and I availed of the opportunity to make clear to all communities the Government's commitment to achieving a fully balanced settlement based on agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his kind words.  Does he believe the talks will have achieved an agreement which will be robust and detailed enough to put to the people in a referendum on both sides of the Border by the May deadline?  If not, what interim arrangements does he envisage might be agreed by May that would allow us have the referendum somewhat later and allow for further detailed work to be done in the meantime to bring it up to a level where it could be put to the people in a referendum?  Will he agree that anything put to the people must contain answers to all questions they may ask?  Also, will the Taoiseach give the House some details on his plans to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into the domestic law of the Republic in view of the fact that the Government committed itself to this in the propositions document?  Will this convention supersede the <Col N="832" /> existing provisions of our Constitution and, if so, what are the implications of that, particularly for the Articles on the family.  How does the Taoiseach intend that we would fulfil this commitment contained in the propositions document in regard to the European convention?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of Questions Nos. 1 to 6 and the comprehensive reply the Taoiseach has given, I trust he got an opportunity to get something to eat in the course of the day.  The Taoiseach made specific reference to the expedition he made to the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry during which he outlined the benefits for an all-Ireland economy of North-South executive type operations within the framework of the Council of Ministers.  I am not asking the Taoiseach to reveal any confidences but what was the reaction, either privately or publicly, from what would have been a predominantly Unionist business community, to the idea of North-South all-Ireland executive bodies exercising economic related functions on behalf of the all-Ireland economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered questions for some time after the lunch and I concluded that nobody had any great difficulty with that, particularly in terms of the economic aspects of the island economy. That has been the case since I first attended seminars by Dr. Quigley some years ago when he led that campaign, even before IBEC and the CBI formally constructed their relationships. Obviously the business community would want to see all the detail worked out but they do not have a difficulty with it.  The chairman asked people not to be over political, and judging from the questions put to me on the business side &mdash; they were not all to do with business, some were loaded &mdash; it was very much the view of business people that if there was a benefit for the island in terms of the European enlargement process, they wanted to be part of it.  Some issues were of major concern to them such as corporation tax, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Taoiseach's visit to Derry, will he join with me in condemning the threats issued to a number of prominent Unionist people living in the city, one of whom has said he will have to leave his home in Eglinton, near Derry, because of the threats to him?  Will he also join with me in condemning the threats made to the Secretary of State and to Catholics in general <Col N="833" /> by another organisation?  Will he agree that the achievement of a political settlement is rendered much more difficult if it is increasingly exceptional for people to live in mixed areas and if they will only live in areas where their own community is in a majority?  If that is the case will the Taoiseach agree it will be very difficult for people to develop the sense of cross-community understanding that is necessary to underpin any political settlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would join with the Deputy in condemning all of those threats.  Unfortunately, in the past number of weeks threats have been issued not only by known organisations but by unknown organisations.  I cannot be sure of the extent to which those threats are real.  I have been unable to get any real information from security sources on some of these organisations.  It is considered some of them are bogus, but they are serious enough to be believed.  Apparently a number of younger members of those organisations are freelancing to some extent and that is a cause for concern.  I am very well aware of some of those operating in Derry and of others.  Threats made against the Secretary of State and other key figures must be condemned.  However, those threats are designed to have the effect of heightening tension, creating fear and disharmony and trying to undermine what people are involved in. We will have to do all we can to speak out against those people and declare that they cannot stop the democratic process.  I know other party leaders have had experiences similar to those I had last week when meeting people from some communities.  When I was in Derry I met people from both sides of the community.  The situation there is not nearly as bad as in Belfast and the residents of Derry were quick to point that out.</P>
      <P>Some of these acts are not unfamiliar when compared to what has happened through the years.  They are part of the same strategy that has been followed since the 1920s.  At certain times tension is heightened to create these situations.  A similar ploy is used by different sides on occasions.  It is wrong to say this ploy has been used by only one side.  I have rejected that claim. In spite of all of that and the intentions of those people, we must all continue to try to move forward the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to my Question No. 3 on Bloody Sunday, I thank the Taoiseach for his remarks about the previous Government's efforts in that regard.  I also congratulate him for having levered the outcome arrived at last week. There were some concerns in previous weeks that we would only get a review of the Widgery tribunal and not a full-scale inquiry.  That decision is to be welcomed.  Will the Taoiseach use his good offices with Sinn Féin as a <i>quid pro quo</i> to press the IRA to identify the location of the bodies of those who have disappeared to enable their families to give them a burial with some dignity?  If <Col N="834" /> that step were taken, it would contribute greatly to confidence building in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Taoiseach's remarks when he indicated during his visit to Derry that there could not be a purely internal settlement, which I believe is a position shared by all parties in this House, will he agree that implies there needs to be an assembly in Northern Ireland and if a North-South body is to be an intergovernmental or interministerial body such an assembly will have to have Ministers and that people who stand aside from negotiating for an assembly of that kind are not facing the realities of the three stranded approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his remarks.  The answer to the first part of his question is yes.  I have again renewed a request that Sinn Féin use whatever contacts it has in regard to these issues.  I stated in the House on a number of occasions in reply to questions raised by Deputy Currie on this issue that I believe there are people who must know the possible location and whereabouts of the missing persons.  It would be a very helpful confidence building measure if an attempt were made to resolve that issue. Given the passage of time, I am not saying that it can be resolved as simply as that.  We know this measure was used in other countries as part of a settlement to deal with these issues.  We discussed that a long time ago at the forum.  I will continue to urge for action to be taken in this area.</P>
      <P>On the Northern Assembly, I have always accepted there will be some type of assembly. While this was not stated clearly in the forum document, it was interpreted in that way at the time.  There are those outside this House who argue that because the Framework Document did not state this, it was not there.  However, the British Government issued its document on the same day.  When we were in Government, we negotiated 90 per cent of that document and it was clearly understood that was the position.  That did not change in the other 10 per cent of the negotiations and it is a nonsense to suggest so.</P>
      <P>The three strand approach, and this has been accepted since the then Secretary of State, Mr. Brooke, put forward the proposition, is interlocking. Whatever assembly structure or body is established in Northern Ireland has to be understood as part of the three strand approach and the overall process.  If it is not, it will not be accepted by any Nationalists.  It is helpful if it can be explained in that context.  I raised the issue in the Creggan because people questioned our position. If it is put in the other context of an internal arrangement, the North part of a North-South body derives its power from nowhere if there is no structure there.  I have yet to hear anyone give any coherent argument longer than one sentence of how that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a Northern assembly which evolves into a North-South ministerial body.  Having a strong Northern assembly is how one gets to a position where there is a strong <Col N="835" /> North-South body.  I have not heard a good argument against that either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party is relieved there will be a new inquiry into Bloody Sunday.  I thank the Taoiseach, the Government and the British Prime Minister for their co-operation and work in bringing it about.  Will the Government ensure that all relevant information will be available to the inquiry?  Is the Taoiseach aware there is a moratorium to the year 2047 on some official British medical records?  Will he ensure that witnesses can examine all relevant information before giving evidence?  Does he agree that if there is a problem in obtaining records, the objectivity of the inquiry will be called into question and it is vital to resolve this issue before it begins?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The tribunal, which will be set up under the 1921 Act, will have the powers of a High Court.  It will have the ability to gain access to papers, call witnesses and deal with all of the issues a tribunal can deal with.  There will be no difficulty with its powers to access any information and we will examine whatever details surface. Our representation, including observers, will also be looked at carefully.</P>
      <P>In so far as Lord Saville is concerned, we will wait to see who are the other people involved.  I believe they will be eminent people of an independent nature.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I welcome the inquiry into Bloody Sunday.  Can the Taoiseach and the Government guarantee this inquiry will be truly independent and objective and will put the search for truth above all partisan political considerations, unlike the barefaced whitewash that took place under Widgery?  Does the Taoiseach know whether the most senior relevant authorities of the British Army will be willing to give evidence?</P>
      <P>The begrudging response by Mr. Trimble, the Leader of the Official Unionists, is extremely unfortunate and does not help to ease the current tensions among the communities in the North of Ireland.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Although Bloody Sunday is in a particular category because of official State terror, will the Taoiseach agree it is crucial that we acknowledge publicly that the Protestant community has also suffered hugely over 25 years from sectarian and paramilitary outrages?  It is vital to acknowledge that in the interest of equality and how the communities are treated and regarded in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree all sides of the community have suffered.  In reply to the Deputy's first question, we are not running the tribunal so I cannot guarantee what the Deputy asked. However, I am prepared to accept what the British Prime Minister has told me.  I am pleased with the judge picked.  I have seen Lord Saville's track record.  The British public and political system want to see this issue dealt with.  An editorial published in the last few days stated it would be in the best interests of all of the people in Northern Ireland, Unionists as well as Nationalists, for this matter to be despatched permanently to the history books.  The only way that can happen is if the truth is seen to be achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 30, inclusive together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to condemn all acts of violence and express my sympathy, and that of the House, to all the families and friends of victims of the recent appalling violence.  I already indicated this in my recent speech in Belfast to the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  I commend the <i>Newsletter</i> and the <i>Irish News</i> on their initiative in launching their pledge for peace campaign.  I also mention the STOP <Col N="839" /> campaign, whose members are also involved here in organising a campaign for peace.  It is important that we all make clear our rejection of violence in all its forms and that we will not be deflected by such violence from the search for a fair and balanced settlement that would bring an end to the conflict which remains at the root of recent violence.  These killings are a grim reminder to us all why these talks must succeed.</P>
    <P>Discussion on the most inclusive basis possible, consistent with compliance with the Mitchell principles, is the way forward.  As the House will know, the UFF issued a statement on 23 January admitting it had broken its ceasefire for a period but that it had now been restored.  The Chief Constable of the RUC has indicated that during the suspension of its ceasefire, the UFF was involved in the sectarian murder of at least three civilians.  The claim by the UFF that its actions represented a measured military response is outrageous, unsustainable and deeply offensive to the families and friends of its innocent victims.</P>
    <P>Against that background, there was a heavy responsibility on the two Governments to ensure that when the negotiation participants met in London last Monday the Mitchell principles and the integrity of the talks process were upheld. The issue of the UFF statement and its implications was accordingly raised at the commencement of the proceedings by the two Governments and a plenary session was convened at which the UDP made a statement.  All the participants gave their views and the UDP responded to these.  The two Governments then, under Rule 29 of the Rules of Procedure, considered the question of appropriate action in light of all the material available to them and having due regard to the views of the participants.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of the issue, I consider it appropriate that I read into the record of the House the conclusions section of the determination made by the two Governments and issued on Monday last.  It states:</P>
    <P>11.  The Governments regard the UFF involvement in sectarian murders, which has been well attested by information in the security forces' possession, to be admitted in their statement.  The statement itself asserts that these murders were a &ldquo;measured military response&rdquo; to &ldquo;Republican aggression&rdquo;.  If this was the motivation of the perpetrators it is all the clearer that the murders constitute a manifest breach of the first Mitchell principle of democratic and exclusively peaceful means of resolving political issues.  We find the UFF's use in this context of terms like &ldquo;military response&rdquo; outrageous, unsustainable and deeply offensive to the families and friends of their innocent victims.</P>
    <P>12.  The Governments accept that the Ulster Democratic Party may have sought to use its influence to oppose the violence of the UFF, <Col N="840" /> and take full account of the acknowledgement by other participants of the UDP's efforts.</P>
    <P>13.  But there is also no doubt in the Governments' mind that there are close links between the Ulster Freedom Fighters and the UDP, and that the question whether the party has demonstrably dishonoured its commitment to the Mitchell principles has to be considered in the light of that.</P>
    <P>14.  The Governments are obliged to conclude that by reason of the UFF murders, there has been the clearest breach of the UDP's commitment to the Mitchell principles.  The UDP is therefore no longer entitled to participate in the negotiations.  The UDP has now withdrawn from the talks, which in view of the course of events seems to the Governments an appropriate gesture.</P>
    <P>15.  The UFF statement indicates that its involvement in killings has for the present come to an end, in that what it terms its military response is now concluded.  The statement leaves room for doubt, however, as to how unequivocal the restored ceasefire is.  The ambiguity here must be resolved.</P>
    <P>16.  If over a period of weeks a complete, unequivocal and unqualified UFF ceasefire were demonstrated, and established through word and deed to have been fully and continuously observed, the Governments would consider the possibility of the UDP rejoining the negotiations.  The Governments would welcome the prospect in such circumstances.  With that possibility in mind, they, with their advisers, will keep the situation under the most careful review.  The Governments will, of course, do nothing incompatible with the integrity of the process, which depends on the total and absolute commitment of all participants to democratic and exclusively peaceful means of resolving political issues required by the Mitchell principles.</P>
    <P>The events on which I have reported raised difficult issues, given the attachment of the Government to the most inclusive participation possible, consistent with compliance with the Mitchell principles.  However, I have no doubt but that the decision taken was the correct one.  It was absolutely essential that we upheld the integrity of the process.  At the same time, we have it made clear that if over a period of weeks there is a complete and unqualified ceasefire established by word and deed, the Governments would consider the possibility of the UDP rejoining the negotiations.  The Government would welcome the prospect in such circumstances and, in that connection, I welcome the fact that the UDP indicated that the outcome on last Monday week does not mean the UDP is withdrawing from the political process.</P>
    <P>Following intensive discussions after the adjournment of the talks before Christmas, the two Governments presented a paper to other participants at the talks which set out propositions <Col N="841" /> on heads of agreement.  It was and is imperative to ensure that the talks remain the sole focus.  For the first time in this difficult process we have identified a way to proceed to real negotiations on issues of substance.  These are not detailed proposals or a draft agreement but they are a good basis on which all the participating parties, whose responsibility and prerogative it is to do so, can work towards a widely acceptable agreement.</P>
    <P>While the propositions were presented in the name of the two Governments, they were developed as an aid to discussion from the views expressed by all parties during the discussions in recent months.  The best judgment of the two Governments as to the form of an acceptable and balanced settlement remains as set out in the Joint Framework Document, published in February 1995.  The firm commitment of the two Governments to the position set out in that document as being their best assessment of where agreement might be found in the negotiations, and to the positions in the Joint Declaration, was restated in the joint paper tabled last week by the two Governments to facilitate discussion in strand two.  The three day talks session at Lancaster House in London ended on a positive note with an agreement by delegations to pursue detailed negotiations on the basis of the papers tabled by the two Governments in strands two and three.</P>
    <P>The issues are now on the table and the participants are beginning to engage in discussion on the detail.  We know that there will be difficult issues to be resolved for everyone before real agreement can be achieved and both Governments are determined to press ahead to find a settlement which will give a firm foundation for peace.  I believe that all parties currently participating in the talks are prepared to seriously engage in substantive discussions.  I will continue to avail of every opportunity, including while the talks are in Dublin, to meet with the talks participants both on a bilateral basis and a multilateral basis and to inject momentum into the talks to ensure that they continue to move forward.  Planning for the talks session in Dublin is being undertaken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. With regard to those parties who have taken the decision not to participate in the talks, I continue to hope that they will reconsider their position. They know the talks are constituted on an all-inclusive basis in respect of parties that are committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means and the door is always open to such parties.</P>
    <P>Before the heads of agreement were tabled at the talks, all of my contacts with the British Government, Northern Ireland parties and US representatives were designed to help us prepare a paper that would provide a map leading towards a future settlement.  I have had intensive contacts with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and the leaders of the Northern parties, including Sinn Féin, and I do not believe it is helpful or constructive to report on these contacts in detail <Col N="842" /> on a regular basis.  I have already reported extensively on my meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in Luxembourg in December and the communiqué and report which we issued on east-west co-operation, when I made a statement in the House on 17 December last.</P>
    <P>I have not been in direct personal contact with President Clinton since 19 December.  While close contacts at diplomatic and official level have continued, as reflected in a number of supportive statements issued from the White House, I have had some helpful and informative meetings with a number of US representatives, including Senator Connie Mack on 15 January, Senator Edward Kennedy on 10 January, and Congressman Patrick Kennedy on 20 January.  At these meetings, they continued to offer their support and assistance for the peace process and I was glad to have the opportunity to inform them of current developments.  I also used the opportunity to express our appreciation of their efforts on behalf of Ireland, and the input of all in the USA who have taken such a great interest in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to meetings of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, it was agreed at the last meeting in December that contacts would be made with all the parties to explore their views in this regard.  I understand that this is now being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me express my support for the stance taken by the two Governments in applying the Mitchell principles with vigour and rigour on the recent occasion.  Would the Taoiseach agree that it might be useful to establish a unit reporting directly to the talks participants on the ongoing day to day respect for the Mitchell principles in practice so that there would be objective information available other than from the security forces alone on compliance with the Mitchell principles, particularly with regard to punishment beatings and shootings as well as with regard to more serious acts?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give me his view as to whether it will be possible for the talks participants to have in place by May an agreement that is sufficiently detailed to be capable of being put to referendum?  If it is possible or likely that this will not happen, what arrangements might the Taoiseach have in mind for allowing further work to be done and a referendum to take place at a slightly later date when all that detailed work would have been completed?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on how he proposes to comply with the commitment given in the joint statement he made with Prime Minister Blair to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into the domestic legislation of this jurisdiction?  Will this involve overriding the existing provisions of our Constitution or will it be subject to the existing provisions?  How is this matter to be proceeded with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still hopeful that we can reach a position where we will have made substantive progress in the talks by Easter.  However, <Col N="843" /> it is difficult to move people on at the pace I would like in order to make progress.  There is a great desire by the parties to ask the Governments to present papers and positions, but there are great difficulties when the Governments do that.  It is still my view that we should continue to do this.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks I have been working on the overall paper from our point of view and encouraging the British Government to do likewise.  I formed the view before Christmas that it would not be possible to meet the Easter guideline if we continued to take each section in isolation and tried to get agreement on it.  We should put all the propositions on the table and link them to the Downing Street Declaration and the Joint Framework Document.  I equally believe that the sooner everything is on the table the better.  I am certain that this agreement cannot be put to the people if there is the slightest hint of fudge in it.  It cannot propose an absolute union on one side or be a step to a united Ireland on the other.  It must be as clear as it can possibly be.  In this context, we know the outlines, strands and the confidence building measures required.  There are also other issues such as the equality agenda, the important prisoner issues, the role of education and other matters.  It behoves us to try to document these and to reach a substantive agreement.</P>
      <P>I hope the House will understand if I tell Deputy Bruton in a few weeks that we have not achieved agreement on all of this.  However, I would like to be able to put as much of the agreement together as possible so that we would have an inclusive and conclusive argument about what can be agreed.  This is the way we will make progress. If we drag out the matter indefinitely we will lose too many of the players.  There are also difficulties with international issues which mean the British Government does not have the same involvement.  I am conscious that Prime Minister Blair and the President of the United States have other responsibilities.  The previous Government and this Government called on them to devote much time to Northern Ireland issues.  We need to concentrate our minds on dealing with the issue in a shorter timeframe.  I cannot tell Deputy Bruton that I have agreement on this but I am endeavouring to convince people that this is the right way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the revelation by the Taoiseach that there is an overall paper in being on which work is being done.  It is very important that this exists and that people know of its existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that at this stage in the talks a cross-strand mechanism is needed whereby it will be possible to simultaneously discuss the North-South institutions and the internal mechanisms in Northern Ireland?  One cannot really discuss how one will work without discussing how the other will work.  At this juncture in the talks there effectively needs to be one conversation <Col N="844" /> rather than three conversations in parallel. Does he have any procedural change in mind which would allow this to happen?</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach agree with me, Deputy De Rossa and others that it is important at this stage for Sinn Féin to be willing to address strand one issues, internal issues, as part of a three strand approach and that it cannot simply take notes at the talks without participating in them?  Equally it is important that the Ulster Unionists should be willing to have a bilateral meeting with Sinn Féin at this stage, notwithstanding that the main business will be done during the plenary session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The three points made by the Deputy are correct.  We need to get more movement and dialogue across the strands.  The propositions are merely the heads for discussion.  We have the document on strand one put forward by the British Government yesterday and we have the joint papers put forward by the two Governments on strands two and three.  There are other issues such as the wider equality agenda, but these documents are the basis for the discussion and we must work on them.  Obviously, we will have to look at the three interlocking strands.</P>
      <P>The only way it would ever be possible for Sinn Féin to agree to an assembly or body is in the context of an overall agreement.  This cannot be done in isolation as it is prohibited by its rules.  It would be helpful if it engaged in the strand one discussions.  It would also be very helpful if Sinn Féin and the UUP could engage at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate his support for the Stop campaign which is organising a two minute stoppage next week? Will he indicate that the Government and Opposition parties support this event and encourage the media, including RTÉ, to take it up and participate in it?  I understand that RTÉ has been reluctant to give coverage to this initiative up to now.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach seek to have the documentation which was almost completed by the forum subgroups completed and published?  This may be a more worthwhile job for the forum than to simply meet in plenary session where various spokespersons tend to let off steam.  There is productive work which could be done by the subgroups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the participation of parties not currently involved in the talks, my question specifically related to the DUP and the UK Unionists.  Since I tabled my question the UDP has withdrawn from the talks.  I support the stance taken by the British and Irish Governments in defending the Mitchell principles and the necessity to defend the integrity of the negotiations by insisting that they be applied.  Are any efforts being made to bring back in the DUP and the UK Unionists? The more parties representing the broad community in Northern Ireland involved at the conclusion of the talks the more likely it is that the <Col N="845" /> outcome will be accepted across the board, North and South.</P>

      <P>I would dearly like if the DUP and the UK Unionists rejoined the talks.  I have continually stated that the talks are being conducted on an inclusive basis and these parties have every right to attend.  They withdrew primarily because they believed Sinn Féin was only entering the talks on 24 September as a tactic and would only stay for a short period before leaving.  However, it is now clear that this was not a correct assessment.  They had other reasons for withdrawing but that was the main one.  The more parties there are at the talks the better.  If we want to get an ultimate agreement which can be sold to the people North and South on the same day by means of a referendum the more people signed up to it the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to distribute fairly the funds available in 1999 under the new local government fund by reference to criteria to emerge from a needs and resources study which my Department is funding and which will be undertaken this year as a pilot study by Galway County Council.  The study will initially focus on Galway County Council, Galway County Borough and Ballinasloe UDC and will involve the development of a set of indicators which will facilitate the measurement of the needs of each local authority service area and the capacity of the authority to meet service needs given resources and capacity to raise resources.  The methodology and draft models to emerge will be capable of application to all local authorities. When the study is completed towards the end of this year each local authority will be considered by reference to the study criteria and funds will be distributed accordingly in an equitable fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware discussions took place some time ago with a number of local authorities about possible criteria for such a scheme?  Will he agree a study that is confined, albeit to several local authorities but to one county area, is not likely to produce usable guidelines whereas the question of equity will require comparisons to be made between different county councils with different tax bases and different needs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions took place with a number of local authorities, but in order to ensure fair and equitable distribution of money a little more than anecdotal evidence is required by the Department on what might be needed.  I agree with the Deputy that to focus on one local authority would not be satisfactory.  We will use this study as a basis for methodology which will be applied to each local authority, and each local authority will then be asked to undertake its own study of needs and resources.  Financing will be based on the composite picture rather than on the needs of one local authority.  In regard to the local authority selected, there is a borough council, an <Col N="847" /> urban council and a county council involved and the intention is to draw up parameters for those kinds of circumstances.  I agree it would be unfair to apply across the board the findings of the study of one local authority and that is not the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree the discussions that took place with a number of local authorities produced much more than anecdotal evidence?  Is he aware there was a strong view among members of many local authorities, regardless of whether it was justified, that the outlines of a system had emerged and there was a degree of consensus on how the system would operate?  Will he accept that to consider a different system, which he seems to have in mind, is turning his back on what was very valuable consultation with local authorities?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that rather than undertake a study that includes different local authorities in the one county, as is proposed, it would be more relevant to base a pilot study on a comparison between one local authority, or set of local authorities, which has a strong base for local taxation, whether commercial rates, motor tax or whatever, and an authority at the other end of the scale which does not have such a strong base? It would not be stretching ingenuity to find two appropriate local authorities to make such a comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the Deputy thinks I am turning my back on consultation that has taken place.  We are trying to build a composite picture and the methodologies that apply in the Galway study will be applied to each local authority.  The needs and resources of each local authority will not be based on a local authority with a huge or a small funding base but will be considered separately, and funding will be distributed accordingly.  I take the point the Deputy is making, but he may be under a misapprehension as to what is intended in the study in Galway.  The intention is to set up a framework to allow us to carry out needs and resources studies of all local authorities so that we have a true picture of each authority before we distribute money.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of an exercise carried out some years ago on needs and resources and most people agreed at that time that a theoretical approach would disadvantage a large number of local authorities.  The approach we are adopting is a practical one based on the realities on the ground rather than on a theoretical desktop exercise.  We want to be fair to each local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am under a misapprehension as to the Minister's proposal, part of the reason may be that his explanation is not entirely clear.  Is the Minister aware there is a substantial level of disappointment, if not anger, among local authority members of all parties in view of the fact that, <Col N="848" /> having engaged in meaningful consultation, as they thought, with the Minister's predecessor and reached a measure of agreement on guidelines, they now find they will have to wait another year?  Is the Minister aware that compared to the exercise carried out by his predecessor, the system he has outlined seems theoretical, particularly since it lacks an element of comparison between different local authorities in different circumstances?</P>

We are trying to develop a set of indicators which we can apply to other local authorities.  Then those local authorities which have real need for resources will be able to make the case for equalisation funding.  We are not talking about theory, but about local authorities being given the opportunity to make their case and outline the resources which they need.  We will judge from that what they will receive from the equalisation fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The funding system which I recently announced will come into effect on 1 January 1999.  It involves the establishment of a new local government fund.  The fund will be financed from two sources, the proceeds of motor taxation and an amount provided by the Exchequer.  The amount provided by the Exchequer will be £270 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>On the basis of current estimates of motor tax, the fund will be of the order of £590 million in its first year and will provide significant additional money for local authorities.  This will enable authorities generally to improve the quality and range of services they provide.</P>
      <P>The fund will be buoyant, ringfenced in law, channelled exclusively into local government and, importantly, protected for the future.  The £270 million contribution from the Exchequer will be provided for in legislation which will also provide that this contribution will be increased annually to reflect inflation and any changes in the functions or the cost base of local authorities.</P>
      <P>As part of the new funding package, I propose to take steps to cap rates on commercial property with effect from 1 January 1999.  I am at present considering various options on capping rates and I will announce specific details of the proposal later this year in plenty of time before local authorities adopt their estimates for 1999.  The proposal will be designed to ensure that the rate demand on the business sector is neither excessive nor disproportionate to other sectors of society.  The increased resources which the new funding system will deliver will facilitate this measure.  Overall, the new funding package will substantially enhance the autonomy and discretion of local authorities by putting greater funding at their disposal.</P>
      <P>To complement the increased level of resources which the new funding package will generate, I am developing measures to improve the financial management systems in local authorities and to ensure that value for money practices pervade all local authority operations.</P>
      <P>I will bring legislation to give effect to the new funding proposals before this House shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that his proposals simply boil down to a relabelling of funds which were to be allocated in any event, that he is simply replacing money to be paid on the non-national roads with motor taxation and calling the non-national roads fund a local government fund, that the motor taxation was to be made available to local government in any event by law enacted by the Houses last year, and that by next year we would be spending approximately <Col N="850" /> £270 million of Exchequer money on the non-national roads programme in any event? Would the Minister accept that it is not really a new deal except that it diminishes the authority of local government to have any fiscal autonomy whatsoever with a proposal to cap rates?  Would the Minister accept that that proposal will mean, in effect, that those who are efficient are to be punished and those who have allowed rates to be rampant in recent times are to be rewarded?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give some indication of how the £320 million roads fund will be allocated? Will it be on the basis of road need or of some linkage to the amount collected?  Will the Minister give us some notion of how the equalisation fund will operate?  How much money will be available for redistribution through the system of equalisation and who will control it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that the local authorities' autonomy is being undermined.  Local government is local people elected at local level to implement local decisions.  If they are dependent on handouts from Government and if their means of raising funds at present, commercial rates, is being capped, this is a further reduction in their autonomy.  How does the Minister propose to distribute the £125 million between 29 county councils, five county boroughs, five corporations and 49 urban district councils?  If inflation rises above the cap, how can local authorities maintain their services, given that a significant proportion of that funding comes from commercial rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies should wait to see how I intend to apply the cap before criticising it because the rate of inflation is one of the considerations which relates to the level of any cap. I do not foresee a situation arising where the cap will be set at a level lower than the rate of inflation.  That would be grossly unfair to everyone involved.</P>
      <P>How do I intend to allocate the money?  My reply to the first question I answered this afternoon, which was tabled by Deputy Dukes, is part of the entire process of how we intend to allocate the funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We intend to allocate the funds on the basis of need which will be firmly established by the exercise currently being conducted within local authorities, namely, the needs and resources studies.  We intend to allocate the funds fairly on the basis of objective criteria.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the need will vary from year to year.  One of the problems we face is that, by continuing to increase the amount granted to local authorities each year, on an incremental basis, by reference to inflation &mdash; without a system of value for money, performance indicators, an accounts accrual system or modern accounting systems being in place &mdash; efficiency will never be achieved.  In addition to funding we are concerned with a large range of measures some of which were initiated by my predecessor and others I intend to put in place to ensure that value for money is achieved, needs are met and resources are provided.</P>
      <P>It is slightly unfair that Deputies are obliged to consider the funding proposal without being aware of the other measures being put in place by the Department.  However, crocodile tears regarding the autonomy of local government, etc., ring hollow in my ears in light of the previous Government's record on local democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reply to a specific question on the equalisation fund?  The proposal put to the House by the previous Government was that 80 per cent of motor taxation should be spent in the local authority area where it was collected and that a balance of 20 per cent should be placed in an equalisation fund to be distributed according to need.  Now that a substantial amount of this money will be used for roads, is there any prospect of the bulk of it being spent &mdash; as originally demanded by local authorities &mdash; in the counties where it is collected or will it be given to the counties with the worst road systems?  Some counties might collect large amounts of money and not be able to spend it. What mechanism of equalisation is being put in place and what percentage of the overall amount will be made available through equalisation?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the proposal to cap the ability of local authorities to set local rates is the final nail in the coffin of local government's fiscal autonomy?  Does he accept that his heart is not in this proposal, which is merely a sop to a demand from the Progressive Democrats? Given that the Minister indicated he intends to remove the proposal to allow local authorities to fix, or not do so, as the case may be, a 3 per cent increase in motor taxation, does he agree this will finally remove any remaining discretion on the part of local authorities to set local rates?  If the latter comes to pass, there will be no single fiscal measure available to local authorities in respect of collecting revenue.  With what autonomy will they be left?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities carried out an assessment of housing needs at 29 March 1996.  Details of the assessment for each local authority were published in the 1996 Housing <Col N="855" /> Statistics Bulletin, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  In summary, the assessment indicated that 27,427 households were assessed as then in need of local authority housing. This compares with the figure of 28,624 households in the 1993 assessment.  My Department does not have information on the numbers of current applicants for local authority housing, nor on the percentage of these who have remained on the housing list for the past three years.  The next statutory assessment of local authority housing needs is due in March 1999 and the results will provide the basis for the future planning of the Government's response to social housing needs.</P>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium sets out the Government's commitment to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups.  A programme of 3,900 housing starts and acquisitions has been notified to authorities for 1998.  These, together with output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing local authority housing stock, will enable the needs of some 10,000 households to be catered for in 1998.  Improvements in the terms of the social housing schemes, which I announced last November, are expected to increase housing output from these measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Minister of State there are just over 27,000 applicants on local authority housing lists.  However, my information is that there are over 37,000 applicants, which represents over 100,000 men, women and children looking and waiting for local authority accommodation.  Does he agree this is a crisis and it is time his Department rejigged its audit unit because the statistics are completely out of date? It took me two days last week to find out that 37,000 applicants are on housing lists.  The Minister of State has shown that the figures he presented are out of date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct as the figures I quoted are the results of the housing assessment carried out by the previous Government. The 1996 assessment of housing needs classified 27,427 households as being in need of local authority housing.  While the total number of households assessed amounted to 37,718, local authorities categorised separately those households whose needs could be met by other social housing measures, such as improvement works <i>in lieu</i> of local authority housing, rent supplementation under supplementary welfare allowance, voluntary housing, etc.  The figure of 27,427 represents the number of households on waiting lists on 29 March 1996 as assessed by the previous Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State is not sure about the number of people who are seeking housing, will he arrange to have an immediate assessment carried out without having to wait until 1999?  Does he accept that the housing assessment and figures he quotes from the local authority housing lists are no longer a reliable basis on which to assess housing needs because thousands of families cannot afford to buy a home and their incomes are too high to allow them to go on a local authority housing list?  What plans has he to extend eligibility for local authority housing lists to such people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The next assessment is not due until March 1999 and the guidelines on it will issue to each local authority in September after consultation with some major authorities.  The conduct of the assessment by local authorities is an administratively complex task, needs a good deal of preparation and requires statutory notice.  One simply cannot issue a letter and expect to receive all necessary information by return post.  The assessment is complex and involves much consultation with relevant authorities in order to have a meaningful understanding of what the figures mean.  I will happily take any suggestions from Deputies into consideration bearing in mind there is no system which cannot be improved.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Does the Minister of State agree that with 37,000 families on the lists and 3,900 starts allocated, Government funding for local authority housing is hopelessly inadequate? Is he aware of the intense suffering of families on housing lists, such as the unbearable stress of overcrowding?  Does he further agree that the insane and obscene rise in prices for new houses will make that situation even worse?  Will he declare a housing emergency and set aside emergency funds for a crash programme to meet the needs of those on housing lists?  Will he revamp the shared ownership scheme and the loans and grants scheme so that workers with salaries that would not qualify previously will now do so in view of the crazy rise in house prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must correct the Deputy when he says the total number of houses to be provided is 3,900 as the estimate is for 10,000 when everything is taken into consideration, including social housing assistance provided by the State.  The State also provides private housing assistance. The Deputy asked me whether I was aware of the anguish and concern of families while they wait for public housing.  I have represented my constituents for about 33 years and interview them on a weekly basis.  I am well aware of the concern, anguish and heartbreak for families who do have a home and anything the Government and I can do in order to try to improve that situation shall be done.</P>
      <P>I have already greatly improved the level of assistance available in the voluntary housing sector through substantial increases in funding.  That was done with the specific intention of making it easier for organisations working in that area to help meet the urgent housing needs of many families. The Government provided a substantial increase in funding for public housing against that provided last year.</P>

      <P>It might be that long in some cases. I am not happy with that and I wish to improve the situation.  I am also aware from contact with people waiting for housing and people who have been housed that there are other social aspects which give cause for concern.  Some people who have been allocated houses find the conditions in which they live unbearable and seek transfers to new areas.  People can feel under stress because of a high level of harassment that takes place and that is an aspect of society that concerns me.  In many cases getting a home is not a happy solution to the housing problem.  There are other aspects to be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>These are factors and I hope to be able to make a contribution in that regard.  There will always be limitations to what can be done.  In the case of some local authorities that are building houses in rural areas problems arise getting builders because there is such a high level of demand at present.  I do not say that is the cause of the long housing lists but it is another factor. There is a certain house building capacity which is being pushed to the limit at present.  Almost 40,000 houses were built last year which is a great increase on previous levels.  We want to see that increase continue.  The level of house building in the private sector is exceptionally high.  I am aware that levels of building in the public sector have been higher in the past and I hope to increase levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister of State set a target percentage during his period of office for the reduction of the housing lists?  His party sets clear targets for tax reduction and it should set targets for reducing the housing lists, be it 20, 30 or 40 per cent.  On 5 January the Minister of State announced the construction programme and indicated that 3,900 new constructions will take place in 1998.  In reply to Deputy Higgins and in that press statement he indicated that a total of 10,000 new households will be provided for during 1998 and that leaves 6,100.  How will that difference be made up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is made up from new lettings; some people leave local authority housing and move into private housing or emigrate. Houses are surrendered on a regular basis and this creates an opportunity to take people off the housing lists.  Voluntary housing must also be added in.  There are a variety of ways in which people on the housing lists are housed.  The assessment made by the previous Government was 9,500 and we hope to make it 10,000 this year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's point is well made.  The Department is currently examining the building regulations covering listed buildings so that the stringent conditions attaching to fire regulations and so on can be adapted to suit the needs of houses with architectural merit.  I accept the Deputy's point that by the time negotiations on some planning applications have been completed it is often not worth the person's while continuing with works.  I hope the Bill addresses this matter.  From a constitutional point of view, I do not believe we can impose obligations on people without offering them some incentive or balancing monetary compensation.  I will keep both those matters in mind when dealing with the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 79 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are empowered, under the Local Government Act, 1994, to provide, operate and maintain parks and open spaces for amenity and recreational purposes.  Under the planning Acts, planning authorities' development plans must contain objectives for preserving, improving and extending amenities in their areas.  This provision will be examined in the review of the planning process currently under way to see if it is necessary to strengthen it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When deciding planning applications, a planning authority must have regard to the policies set out in the plan and may attach conditions to permissions requiring the provision of appropriate facilities.  The provision of open spaces, recreational facilities, amenity areas, etc. in local authority housing schemes is a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance. <Col N="861" /> Appropriate limited facilities of this kind are funded as part of the cost of a housing scheme from my Department's capital allocations.  Local authorities have been advised, in guidelines issued by the Department, that new housing should comprise small, well designed schemes, be integrated as far as possible with housing and other developments in the area, create a good living environment for the residents and be convenient to various services and amenities.</P>
    <P>Funding is available under my Department's remedial works scheme to assist housing authorities to carry out major essential works of a structural nature to dwellings in designated run-down housing estates.  The objective is not only to upgrade the fabric of the dwellings but to improve the living conditions of the tenants.  For this reason, works of an environmental nature, including limited amenity and recreational facilities, may be included as part of a project where they are considered necessary to support the work undertaken on the dwellings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister set out to be a reforming Minister.  I hope he will reform local authority housing schemes so that recreational amenities and housing are provided in tandem. Does he agree that since the foundation of the State, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, massive mistakes have been made in building local authority and private housing estates?  The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, will recall that I spoke at length on this matter last week during the debate on the planning Bill.  How can we, as Members of this House, justify what happened in places such as Ronanstown, Neilstown and Tallaght in Dublin, in Knocknaheeny in Cork city and Ballybeg in Waterford where thousands of local authority houses were built without any recreational facilities or amenities?  I constantly raise this matter at local authority level, but I might as well speak to the wall.  I heard what the Minister said in his reply, but the authorities do not appear to have the will or, more importantly, the money to do what is necessary.  I stated here on another occasion that for every £1 spent on building houses we should spend £1 on providing recreational and amenity facilities.  Will the Minister attempt to do that?  Many of the problems in our society, whether they involve drink, drugs, crime or joy riding, are allied to the fact that there are no facilities available in built up areas.  The Minister stated that he is spearheading his housing drive towards smaller estates, but will he do something for the deprived people in the massive sprawling estates where there are no facilities and the few open spaces are occupied by stray horses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what the Deputy said.  We made appalling mistakes in the 1970s and 1980s for which we are suffering now. I hope we have learned from them.  The Deputy is right that we must correct those mistakes.  The Cabinet committee dealing with social inclusion <Col N="862" /> is trying to do that.  The Minister of State and I will ensure those mistakes are not repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cabinet committee dealing with social inclusion is examining that matter. The remedial works programme deals with more than the mere fabric of houses.  A subcommittee of that committee is examining the wider infrastructure in existing estates and we hope to be able to do something in certain designated areas in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from existing refurbishment schemes, will the Minister provide grants to local authorities to enable them tackle the requirements of deprived areas?  In regard to private schemes, where similar problems exist, will he examine the planning laws to ensure that planning permission cannot be obtained unless proper recreational facilities and amenities are provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be included in the review of the planning process taking place.  Submissions have been made and the matter must be examined carefully.  It may be necessary to put in place a stronger statutory base to levy private developers to ensure facilities are provided for the wider community.  The Deputy also referred to private schemes.  The Department's remedial works scheme is not confined specifically to dealing with the fabric of houses, an allowance is provided for some community resources.  I understand ADM is providing money for this purpose, particularly in private schemes and that should be encouraged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>I propose to take these questions together.</P>
      <P>I inform the House that I conveyed today the following appeal to the Governor of Texas, Mr. George Bush:</P>
      <P>Dear Governor,</P>
      <P>I am appalled to hear that it is intended to proceed with the execution today of Ms Karla Faye Tucker.  In my view, such executions are a setback for the goal we share of universal respect for human rights.</P>
      <P>I appeal to you on humanitarian grounds to exercise your power to order a stay in the execution to allow the Supreme Court to hear Ms Tucker's appeal.</P>
      <P>David Andrews, T.D.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ireland.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House, the Governor of Texas has no power to commute the death sentence. This power is vested in the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles which yesterday agreed unanimously to refuse a clemency recommendation to the Governor.  The action I have appealed to him to take is, therefore, the only course open to him, apart from signature of the death warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> The Deputies will be aware from my statement to the House on 23 October 1997 of the Government's total opposition to the use of the death penalty.  I take this opportunity to reassure the House that at the 54th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, which begins on 16 March, Ireland will again take a strong position in favour of the worldwide abolition of capital punishment.  It is our firm conviction that the abolition of the death penalty as an instrument of judicial punishment would contribute to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights throughout the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Has he taken other steps which might convince the Governor of the merits of his request, and has he received an indication of the likely response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that it is now 10.20 a.m. in Texas and the execution is due to take place at 6 p.m. their time, midnight Irish time.  I have asked our Embassy in Washington to convey our concerns to President Clinton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is barbaric that a woman may have poison injected into her veins and that her chance of getting one month's reprieve so that her case can be heard again depends on the electoral prospects of the Governor of Texas?  Has the Minister raised with the American Ambassador and the American administration generally our concerns about the obscenity that a political campaign influences whether this woman lives or dies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Minister representing a Government in one jurisdiction I would not wish to enter into a political contest in another jurisdiction, as suggested by the Deputy.  However, I agree with his view that the death penalty in itself and the method by which this woman may be put to death this evening are obscene, to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reconsider his position on speaking to the American Ambassador, especially since this House agreed on 18 December 1997 a motion seeking to promote the universal moratorium on capital punishment, thus putting an onus on him to be pro-active in this regard?  This would be the first woman to be executed by the State of Texas for 100 years and the Minister must be conscious that the House has committed itself to a moratorium on capital punishment.  This puts a responsibility on him to be a little less laid back and more pro-active on this issue.  The American Ambassador to Ireland is accessible to him and he should strongly put the case that we do not want this execution carried out.  We want to ensure that what is agreed in the House will be followed up by a Minister in an appropriate way, rather than indulging in rhetoric without taking action which will have results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another example of giving a dog a bad name.  I have already attempted to contact the Governor of Texas, Mr. George Bush, and the President of the United States.  As for contacting the American Ambassador, I can undertake to make a telephone call this afternoon or possibly to call her in to add a third string to my efforts to prevent this execution.</P>
      <P>I am not the only person to object strenuously to the prospective execution of this unfortunate woman.  The Pope and the European Parliament are among many prominent people and institutions throughout the world to add their voices to this call.  We are not alone in this.  Many others are strenuously objecting to this person's impending death in these circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputies for their rather belated suggestions.  Those who have already urged Governor Bush to reprieve Ms Tucker include Pope John Paul II, the European Parliament, the Rev. Pat Robertson of the Christian Coalition which favours the death penalty, the brother of the woman she murdered, the detective who arrested her, the former prosecutor, prison guards, Amnesty International and thousands of anti-capital punishment activists in the United States.  We are dealing with a capital punishment culture.  A recent opinion poll in the United States indicated that 70 per cent of those polled wanted the retention of capital punishment.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say if his letter to Governor Bush was sent before or after the <Col N="866" /> question was tabled by Deputy Durkan and me? Has the Government been proactive in raising concerns about this case?  Is it the Minister's intention to find out what other EU foreign Ministers have done and if they intend to let their views be known to Britain in relation to this case? Will the Minister agree that the question of whether this woman has poison injected into her veins swings on whether the Governor of Texas runs for election and if he could give her a one month reprieve he is fearful that he would be seen as being soft?  Therefore, this is not only a matter of human rights, it is a cynical question of the life of one person possibly being sacrificed because of the political ambition of one other person.  This is what is at the centre of this case. Will the Minister make that case forcefully to the US ambassador and raise it with his EU General Affairs Council colleagues?</P>

      <P>In response to the first part of the Deputy's question, I sent a fax to the governor's mansion this morning which, I am sure was among many thousands of other faxes; I assume his fax machine was jammed.  In the circumstances I cannot add to what I have done in that regard.  I have been in touch with our Embassy in Washington which has brought our concerns to the attention of President Clinton and again I will be contacting the American ambassador.  So far as the political career of Governor Bush is concerned, it would be inappropriate to comment on what he considers to be his position in respect of this unfortunate woman's predicament.</P>

Given the good relationship between the State and the President of the United States, in relation to Northern Ireland we can simply lift the phone and talk to the highest person in the land.  Will the Minister use that phone to convey to President Clinton the strong feelings being expressed here on the barbarity that is about to be enacted on a woman?  This undercuts the reputation of the United States around the world in relation to human life and human rights.</P>

      <P>I thought the Minister said he would contact or summon her in.  With all due respect, it would be appropriate for the Minister to invite her to meet him on such a serious matter as this.  When he meets her he should request her to contact the President of the United States directly.  It would be very important for American politics to be able to deliver the life of a woman and ensure she is not executed in a few hours' time.  If the Minister were to meet the ambassador and request that she contact the President directly &mdash; as she does frequently &mdash; this would have an impact along with all the other efforts being made.</P>

      <P>I undertake to communicate the views of the House and the Deputies to the American ambassador.  I understand 144 executions have been carried out in Texas since 1976, including 37 last year.  Those 37 executions were half the total number in the US in 1997. That is the difficulty and the mindset we are dealing with.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware there are approximately 3,000 people on death row in the United States, that only half the states, at most, have the death penalty in their criminal code and that there is no evidence that violent crime is any less in the states which do not have the death penalty? In other words, there is no evidence that the death penalty has a beneficial effect in reducing crime and it is also considered to be an ineffective method of punishment in terms of deterrents. Will the Minister convey these arguments not just to the President but to the governors of the states which have the death penalty on their statute book?  US evidence shows it does not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton's point of view.  There are some 3,300 people on death row in the United States, which includes six women.  Gender is not taken account of in the case of Ms Tucker, which is unfortunate.  So far as the Deputy's suggestion about contacting politicians in various other states in the United States is concerned, I undertake to do that.</P>

      <P>Anti capital punishment activists throughout the United States, including politicians, have protested to Governor Bush about the impending execution of Karla Faye Tucker. The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy John Bruton, asked me to contact politicians of like mind in the United States.  I undertake to do so but in relation to the immediate problem, tragically, the case rests.  Many organisations and individuals have protested but it appears the governor concerned will not change his mind.</P>

I have expressed the view inside and outside the House that there should be two separate questions.  In relation to the impending execution of Karla Faye Tucker, given that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said he has done as much as he can do, will the Taoiseach use his influence to encourage the President of the United States to use his substantial influence to have the execution stopped?  It is ludicrous at a time when the United States is preparing to go to war against Iraq to prevent the development of chemical weapons, it is preparing chemicals to be injected into the body of a woman.</P>

Many difficulties arise which the Deputy will recall because when he was Minister for Health he set up a group to examine this issue which reported back to the then Government on 17 clauses that had to be dealt with.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is following the advice that those 17 issues should be dealt with comprehensively and that the difficulties should be ironed out.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; This is the third substantive Bill relating to referenda since the enactment of the Constitution. The Referendum Act, 1942, set out the basic law relating to the conduct of referenda, while the Referendum Act, 1994, consolidated and amended the law up to 1994.  This Bill is a result of greater political awareness by the electorate and the need to provide information in relation to matters dealing with constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>We have much experience of referenda.  In all there have been 20 since 1937 when a plebiscite was held on the Constitution.  Of those, 15 were approved by the people and five were rejected. That demonstrates the people are very discerning on proposals to amend their Constitution.  That is a welcome indication of the public interest in the most fundamental legal document of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we move towards a new millennium and in a period of rapid change when existing practices <Col N="878" /> and procedures are under constant review, it is timely to consider how the electorate can be more involved and informed on important political issues.  There is hardly a more important issue than amending the Constitution.  We must start at the so-called &ldquo;grass roots&rdquo; and work upwards at central and local levels.  However, in the case of the proposed referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty, time dictates that we must act quickly to inform the public about the treaty which is a difficult document to explain.  The provisions of the Bill will achieve this for the forthcoming referendum but also for all future referenda.  It will become part of the permanent referendum law.</P>
    <P>Despite all the technology and multimedia facilities available today, it does not seem that the public are well informed on the contents of the Amsterdam Treaty.  A recent public affairs television programme interviewed a sample of individuals who were asked what they knew about the Amsterdam Treaty.  Only one respondent seemed to know about it, even though the treaty is the product of much work at EU level and its negotiation has been covered in the media for a few years.  The treaty results from the Intergovernmental Conference which opened in Rome in March 1996 under the Italian Presidency and was continued further during the Irish Presidency when the first draft for a new treaty was submitted to the Dublin European Council in December 1996.  The treaty was agreed at the Amsterdam European Council in June 1997 and was signed in Amsterdam by member states last October.  There have been frequent references to it in the media over recent months, but the public mind has not been focused on it.  That is the information gap which we must try to fill.</P>
    <P>In recent years most of the political parties represented in this House have been in favour of proposals put before the people in referenda. That is a good sign, but it has the downside that public debate has suffered.  My predecessor, Deputy Howlin, and I give him credit for it, commenced the process of providing direct information on the advantages and disadvantages of a proposal in a referendum.  To date we have had three <i>ad hoc</i> commissions on referendum information. Those commissions had responsibility for preparing statements with arguments for and against proposals for the divorce referendum in 1995, the bail referendum in 1996 and the Cabinet confidentiality referendum in 1997.  The commissions engaged two senior counsel, who were nominated by the chairman of the Bar Council to set out both sets of arguments.  A leaflet was produced on the divorce referendum and delivered by An Post to each household.  Because of time constraints, advertisements in respect of the other two referenda were placed in the national and local newspapers.  Criticism was expressed after the most recent referendum that the advertisements were not the best method of communicating simple factual information to the electorate. This, some claim, was the reason for the <Col N="879" /> high incidence of spoiled votes in that referendum.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the criticism, the <i>ad hoc</i> commissions were a step forward in attempting to bridge the gap in the provision of information.  I pay tribute to the people involved, especially the members of the <i>ad hoc</i> commission and their staff who, at short notice, had to carry out a difficult task.  However, it is time to advance the matter further.</P>
    <P>When I was in Opposition I introduced a Private Members' Bill in June 1996 to provide for the establishment of an independent referendum commission having the function of preparing and presenting to the public information in an objective, impartial and informative manner in order to assist the process of enabling the electorate to make an informed decision at constitutional and ordinary referendums.  I am glad to have this opportunity to give expression to the main function contained in my Private Members' Bill in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>This matter was also considered by the All Party Committee on the Constitution following a recommendation in the Constitution Review Group report that:</P>
    <P>There ought not be a constitutional barrier to the public funding of a referendum campaign provided that the manner of equitable allotment of such funding is entrusted to an independent body such as the proposed constituency commission.  The total sum to be allotted should be subject to legislative regulation. Article 47.4 should be amended accordingly. Such a constitutional safeguard meets the principal objection to the old funding arrangements identified in the McKenna case by ensuring the Government does not spend public money in a self-interested and unregulated fashion in favour of one side only, thereby distorting the political process.</P>
    <P>The All-Party Committee on the Constitution in its first progress report last April concluded that:</P>
    <P>The Committee agrees with the Constitution Review Group that an independent body should be established to regulate the funding and conduct of referenda.  It feels, however, that it would be tidier to provide in the Constitution for a commission to carry out not just those functions but also those undertaken by the Constituency Boundary Commission, the Public Service Ethics Committee under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and any commission which might be proposed to regulate election funding.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the all-party committee is currently reconsidering the matter and I would welcome its views.  However, in view of the short time available before the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty, I must proceed with the Bill and I will consider any recommendations the committee may make for future legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> The Constitution Review Group recommended a constitutional amendment to enable a commission to be established which would allocate funds to political parties and interest groups to ensure a thorough sustained debate on a referendum proposal.  That option has yet to be considered. I am not convinced and I am not aware of any evidence available that providing funds directly to political parties and interested groups would provide simple factual information to the electorate.  We would probably see much more disjointed information about different facets of a proposal which might leave the electorate even more confused.  Funds would have to be given to all groups with a bona fide interest in a referendum and unless the overall amount of funds available was very large, the impact each group could make would be minimal.  It would be extremely difficult to set down criteria for approving funding and for public accountability of its use.</P>
    <P>For instance, take the hypothetical example of a referendum where it is clear that 90 per cent of public representatives and the public are in favour of the proposal.  If we assume that the Government decides to allocate £1 million to be distributed to political parties and interested groups, how is the allocation to be divided &mdash;<i>pro rata</i> to the size and representation of parties or groups or 50 per cent to both sides?  Either of these approaches is open to challenge on the grounds of unfairness.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the taxpayer would be in favour of the Government issuing large sums of its money, together with the extra administrative costs of administering a scheme, to political parties and interested groups to try to persuade them to vote either &ldquo;for&rdquo; or &ldquo;against&rdquo;.  The potential for the wastage of public funds would be enormous, especially if the electorate is bombarded with conflicting, and perhaps inaccurate, propaganda paid for with its own money.  The Government considers the Bill will provide a better option for supplying information to the electorate in a manner that is fair to all the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>An amendment to the Constitution to provide for the commission envisaged by the all-party committee may be unnecessary but a decision on that point does not arise now.  I am not saying that a single commission should not be set up which would encompass the present separate commissions &mdash; the Public Offices Commission, Constituency Commission and, when this Bill is enacted, the Referendum Commission.  Much could be said in support of such a proposal and my colleague, the Minister for Finance, is drawing up proposals which could include such a single body, rather than several individual commissions.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish an independent statutory Referendum Commission to prepare and disseminate information on the subject matter of a referendum and to foster and promote public debate in a manner that is fair to all <Col N="881" /> interests concerned at a referendum.  It will also consider and rule on applications from bodies for a declaration that they be approved bodies, whose sole function will be to appoint agents at a referendum.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for interpretation of some definitions.  It is not exhaustive as the Bill will be read with the Referendum Act, 1994.  Section 2 provides for the establishment, by order of the Minister, of an independent Referendum Commission not earlier than the date on which the Bill to amend the Constitution is initiated in Dáil Éireann or, in the case of an ordinary referendum, not later than the date of the order appointing polling day at such a referendum. Where the commission is established before the passing of a Bill to amend the Constitution by both Houses of the Oireachtas, it will be prohibited from publishing any statements or incurring any expenditure without the consent of the Minister for Finance before the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The section provides that the commission will be independent in the performance of its functions and, subject to the provisions of the Bill, will regulate its own procedure.  This is an important point especially when read with the specific directive in the Bill that the commission carry out its functions in a manner that is fair to all interests concerned.  This will allay any fears on the part of public representatives, interest groups and individuals that the funding to be provided by the Government may not be spent in a fair manner to both sides of the debate at a referendum.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that a member of the commission shall not advocate or promote a particular result at the referendum in respect of which the commission has been established. While it may not be necessary to provide for this matter, given the membership of the commission, I consider it important to demonstrate explicitly that the commission will be neutral in its attitude to the proposal in the referendum.</P>
    <P>Because of the time constraints and the complexities of the Amsterdam Treaty, the Government has approved the setting up of the commission on a non-statutory basis on this occasion pending enactment of the Bill.  This will assist the commission in setting about its task of preparing a work programme to carry out its functions.  I have written to the five members of the proposed commission and I expect the secretariat to contact them this week to arrange their first meeting. I am pleased to inform the House that the former Chief Justice, Mr. Thomas Finlay, has agreed to be chairperson of the first commission.</P>
    <P>The section also sets out the membership of the commission.  The members will be a former judge of the Supreme Court or a serving or former judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, who will be chairperson, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.  The section makes provision for substitution where <Col N="882" /> there is a vacancy in the office of one of the ordinary members of the commission and where the chairman or another member of the commission is temporarily unable to act.  A member of the commission, who ceases to hold the relevant office, such as on reaching retiring age, will normally continue as a member until the commission reports.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is required to make available to the commission such services, including staff, as the commission may require.  Consultations are taking place between the Office of the Ombudsman and the Department of Finance about the provision of extra staff.  As the commission will be dealing with submissions from a variety of sources relating to many different aspects of the proposal in the referendum, the section provides that documents of the commission and of its members and reports of and submissions to the commission will be privileged. Section 3 sets out the principal functions of the commission.  It provides that it will prepare statements containing a general explanation of the subject matter of the proposal, the subject of the referendum.  It will also prepare a statement or statements of the arguments for and against the proposal having regard to any statements received under section 6.</P>
    <P>The commission will be required to publish and disseminate these statements to the electorate.  I am leaving it open to it to decide the best way of communicating with the electorate.  It can use television, radio and other electronic media in addition to printed matter in brochures, leaflets, pamphlets and posters.  It will also be a function of the commission to foster, promote and facilitate public debate on the proposal, the subject of a referendum.  In carrying out these functions the commission will be required to be fair to all interests concerned.  This is the essential part of its role and is designed to meet the point in the McKenna judgments on the use of public money in a fair and even handed manner.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the commission may engage such consultants and advisers as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions. It will be a matter for it to engage professionals such as public relations experts, publicists, advertising agencies and other professional services to ensure it gets its messages across to the electorate in the most useful way. This is important to ensure that the electorate is fully informed and funds are not wasted on ineffective publicity.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the prohibition in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, and the Radio and Television Act, 1988, on the acceptance of political advertisements will not apply to advertisements to be broadcast at the request of the commission in relation to its principal functions at a referendum.  The importance of the commission's work, which is governed by the concept of fairness to all interests concerned, warrants the departure from the prohibition on political advertisements for the purposes of conveying balanced <Col N="883" /> information on a referendum proposal to the electorate.</P>
    <P>Under the section the commission may, after consultation with the RTÉ authority or the Independent Radio and Television Commission and having considered any proposals on their broadcasting plans in connection with a referendum, request the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, to direct the RTÉ authority or the Independent Radio and Television Commission to arrange to make broadcasting time available to facilitate the commission in the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>I would see this power, to request the Minister to direct the two authorities to provide broadcasting time to the commission, being used only in very exceptional circumstances.  The commission will be obliged to consult both RTÉ and the Independent Radio and Television Commission and to consider the programmes and coverage relating to a referendum proposed by stations under the aegis of both bodies before exercising this power.  I would expect to see a commonsense approach by the three bodies, especially as the three of them are required to be fair to all interests concerned in carrying out their respective functions.  Nevertheless, the commission must be given the necessary powers to carry out its functions.  Television and radio are probably the most used and effective means of communicating today.  I consider that the commission must have the option of using these methods of communicating information to the electorate, so that the latter will be able to make an informed decision on polling day.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the public can make submissions to the commission relating to a proposal, the subject of a referendum.  The commission will have regard to the submissions received when preparing statements under section 3.  That is not to say every submission will have to be reproduced by the commission.  It will be a matter for the commission to decide the contents of its statements provided they are fair to all interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that a body may apply to the Referendum Commission for a declaration that it is an approved body for the purposes of the referendum.  The only function of an approved body under the Bill will be to appoint agents at various processes at the referendum.  The right of such bodies to appoint agents will be in addition to the right currently conferred on Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to appoint agents. This provision is included to take account of a High Court judgment in 1997 which held that the Minister has jurisdiction to rule on requests made to him by persons or groups to appoint such agents at a referendum.</P>
    <P>A body will have to apply for a declaration at each referendum at which it wishes to appoint agents.  The requirements are kept to a minimum. The body must have an interest in the referendum, <Col N="884" /> it or a branch of the body must be established in the State, have at least 500 members, have a constitution, memorandum of association or other such document approved by the members, and a name which is not identical or does not closely resemble the name of a political party registered in the Register of Political Parties. The commission must be satisfied the applicant body has a bona fide interest in the subject matter of the referendum.</P>
    <P>While some may criticise these minimal requirements, I stress that the role of an agent at an election or referendum is a serious and important one.  It is a task which must be done correctly and is not a matter to be taken lightly.</P>
    <P>I will give some background to the appointment of agents and what the agents can do at a referendum.  Section 26(1) of the Referendum Act, 1994, provides that a Member of the Dáil for the constituency and any Member of the Seanad may appoint agents at a referendum to be present at the issue of ballot papers to postal voters, the opening of postal ballot boxes and the counting of votes.  Any Member of the Dáil for the constituency and any Member of the Seanad may appoint one person to be present in each polling station at a referendum for the purposes of assisting in the detection of personation.</P>
    <P>In November 1995, prior to the referendum on divorce, an anti-divorce activist wrote to the then Minister requesting him to redress what she referred to as a deficiency in the Referendum Act, 1994.  The person claimed that groups opposing the then proposed constitutional amendment were excluded from appointing personation agents and agents to attend the count without obtaining an appointment from Members of the Oireachtas.  The person indicated that most if not all the parties in the Oireachtas supported the proposed amendment and requested the then Minister to make provision by way of emergency regulations to allow anti-amendment groups to appoint such agents.  As that request was not acceded to, legal action was initiated.</P>
    <P>The High Court, in March 1997, granted the plaintiff a declaratory relief and made a declaration that the Minister has jurisdiction to consider whether there exists circumstances of special difficulty arising from the operation of the power of appointment contained in the section.  Should he decide circumstances of special difficulty arise, he may modify section 26 by providing by ministerial Order that the power of appointment should be exercised by persons or groups in addition to the persons mentioned in that section.  The powers available to the Minister under section 164 of the Electoral Act, 1992, were intended to deal with unforeseen difficulties or emergencies.  It has been used to deal with problems with the delivery and or return of postal voting documents during a postal strike, robbery of postal deliveries and the continuation of a poll on a second day on islands where confusion led island electors to believe that polling stations were not open on the original day appointed. <Col N="885" /> Examples of other situations in which it was envisaged that the provision could possibly be used were a prolonged widespread evening power cut on polling day during the winter or extreme weather conditions, for example, a severe blizzard.</P>
    <P>The practical arrangements to be put in place at a referendum where there is no political party in the Dáil opposed to a constitutional amendment must take account of any group opposed to the amendment.  The Minister could, by difficulty order, determine which groups could appoint agents or he could designate that this function should be performed by the referendum returning officer or each local returning officer. It would not be the most satisfactory arrangement that the Minister adjudicate on who should have authority to appoint agents at a referendum as refusal by the Minister of a particular person or group to appoint agents would be likely to lead to allegations of bias or conflict of interests on the part of the Minister and could result in a referendum petition.  Assigning the duty to the referendum returning officer or local returning officer to determine which bodies should be entitled to appoint agents is not considered appropriate as it could embroil impartial election officials in charges of partiality.</P>
    <P>The section 164 order procedure is not an appropriate mechanism for authorising bodies to appoint agents.  Instead, section 7 provides that interest groups which are declared to be approved bodies by the referendum commission will be entitled to appoint agents.  This will avoid any allegations of unfairness or partiality.</P>
    <P>Under section 8 a commission is required, as soon as possible after its establishment, to publish a notice in at least two national newspapers inviting submissions in relation to the proposal the subject of the referendum.  The public notice must also refer to the procedure for declaration of approved bodies for the referendum.  It must also specify the latest date for receipt of submissions and for applications to the commission for declarations as approved bodies in respect of the referendum. This public notice will alert individuals, groups or political parties of the right to make a submission which must be considered by the commission in preparing its statements.</P>
    <P>The commission may require further information or documents from a body which applies for declaration as an approved body under section 9.  It may require the authorised officer of a body who furnishes such further information to make a statutory declaration in support of the information so supplied.  The section provides that it will be an offence to knowingly provide false information following a request for further information from the commission.  Provision is also included in this section to enable a commission to revoke a declaration made by it in relation to a body where it is satisfied that false information has been furnished to it.</P>
    <P>The commission will be required by section 10 to notify the referendum returning officer of <Col N="886" /> details of each body declared to be an approved body under the Bill or where any declaration is revoked by it.  The referendum returning officer is required to notify such details to each local returning officer.  Each approved body at a referendum will be empowered under section 11 to appoint agents to attend at the issue and opening of postal voters' ballot papers, at polling stations and at the counting of votes.  Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas who currently have the right to appoint such agents will continue to have this right.  The conditions relating to the appointment of agents in relation to Oireachtas Members as set out in the Referendum Act, 1994, will apply to agents appointed under this section.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the amendment of the Referendum Act, 1994, to provide that the result of a referendum may not be questioned on the grounds of non-compliance by the referendum commission with any provision of the Bill or any mistake made by the commission if it appears to the court that the general principles laid down in the Bill were complied with and the non-compliance or mistake did not materially affect the result of the referendum.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 the expenses of the referendum commission will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas from the Vote of the Minister who initiates the relevant Bill containing the proposal, the subject of the referendum.  The Government has approved funding of £2.5 million for the commission's promotional work in the Amsterdam Treaty referendum.</P>
    <P>The commission will be required under section 14 to furnish a report to the Minister as soon as practicable but not later than six months after the completion of its functions at a referendum.  The Minister is required to cause a copy of the report of the commission to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Where the Minister so directs, the report of the commission must include information on any particular aspect of the commission's functions as may be specified by the Minister.  A commission will automatically be dissolved one month after presentation of its report.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the amendment of the Referendum Act, 1994, consequential on the extension of the right to appoint agents at a referendum to approved bodies.  Section 16 provides that where an offence under the Bill, which has been committed by a corporate body, is proved to have been committed with the knowledge of a director or other employee of the body, that person as well as the body corporate shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against.  Proceedings for an offence under the Bill shall not be instituted without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Section 17 is a standard provision relating to the Short Title and construction of the Bill with existing Referendum Acts.</P>
    <P>This is short but important legislation.  It will put in place a mechanism to provide information to the electorate in a way that is fair to all interests concerned.  The forthcoming referendum <Col N="887" /> on the Amsterdam Treaty is an important national event.  The commission will have a difficult task on this occasion in carrying out its functions due to the complexities of the treaty.  The commission can only provide information; it cannot make the electorate read or consider it.  The commission cannot force the electorate to vote.  I hope the information provided will increase public awareness which will result in the electorate being in a position to make an informed decision and express that decision by coming out on polling day to cast its vote.  However, politicians of all parties also share a responsibility to generate public interest so that we will have a large turnout on polling day.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will oppose this Bill on Second Stage and will seek to amend it on Committee Stage.  We have serious reservations about the Government's approach to the handling of referenda, to the establishment of the commission provided for in this Bill and to the handling of the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
      <P>I agree with some of the Minister's points, including his statement that &ldquo;it is timely to consider how the electorate can be more involved and informed on important political issues&rdquo;. However, the Government is not doing much to live up to that in the present context.  It is regrettable and worrying that the Government handled its announcements about this referendum last Thursday and Friday week and treated some of the issues in the White Paper published last week in a way which has allowed fears to gain ground outside this House, and it now appears among some people in this House, for which there is no foundation in fact and no justification in the text of the Amsterdam Treaty.  The Government has not done anything significant to counter that.</P>
      <P>The Government appears to have allowed the impression to gain ground that the flexibility provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty apply to provisions relating to a common foreign and security policy.  The Government has advice to the effect that they do not.  Members of this House, who are not in Government now but who were involved in the negotiations, know that link is not there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet that is being stated and fears are being expressed for which there is no foundation and the Government is not dealing adequately with it.  In the White Paper the Government states categorically and correctly that it would not be possible to provide for the integration of the Western European Union into the European Union without an amendment to the treaties and consequently a constitutional referendum here.  The Government does not state clearly and categorically that the same would apply if any move was made to adopt a common defence policy.  Paragraph 549 of the White Paper <Col N="888" /> does not deal properly with that.  That is a defect in the way the Government has been handling this, that will cloud the debate.  I hold the Government directly responsible for that.</P>
      <P>My party believes in the right of a Government to advocate a point of view in a referendum. Whatever our feelings about the current Government, or indeed any Government at any given time the Government in office is there as a result of electoral choices by the people and as a result of political choices by the parties to which the elected members belong.  It is a proper part of the function of a duly elected Government in a democratic system to act and negotiate on behalf of the people and, where an issue has to be put to the people in a referendum, to give the people its views on the issues before them, to state its convictions in the matter, to state why it believes the matter being put to the people is one they should approve, to state what benefits it thinks it may bring the people and to state also what reservations, if any, it has about any part of the issue that arises.  It is not outside the ambit of democracy for the Government to use the available machinery of Government, which is there for all of its activities, to express those convictions, to advocate its views, even in the case where a question has to be put before the people, because in our system Governments can be and are voted out of office.  We have elections, in our case, more frequently than is provided for in either our Constitution or our law.  To pretend the advocacy by any Government of this State of a point of view in a referendum campaign is oppressive or unfair is utterly absurd and, as a citizen, I regret that our Supreme Court has accepted utterly specious arguments in this matter and given rise to a part of the debate which underlies this Bill.</P>
      <P>If there is any role in a referendum for a commission it should surely be to judge whether the Government's advocacy is fair.  A commission set up to do that job would consist of persons eminent in the fields of law and international affairs, European affairs, political science and other relevant disciplines and even, perhaps, politics.  We will hear how important it is that commissions should be outside of politics, but whatever commission is set up as a result of this will deal with an intensely political issue, and we are being told it should be run, staffed and composed of people who are not politicians.  I do not know whether there is any other area of life where we would adopt that approach.  Would we set up a commission to deal with a medical problem composed exclusively of non medical people?  Would we set up a commission to deal with a legal problem composed exclusively of non legal people?  I do not think so.  We are allowing dictates of political correctness &mdash; which is only a passing fad anyway &mdash; to cloud our judgment in all of these things.  I will come back to that in a moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the Constitution in a minute.  This is more important than the Minister's feelings on the matter.  Parties to the debate, if they felt the Government was being unfair in any aspect of its advocacy, should be entitled to appeal to the commission for a ruling as to whether the Government was being fair, and if that commission found the Government's advocacy was unfair, it could order the Government to desist from its line of argument.  If, on the other hand, the commission found the Government's advocacy was fair in the light of what it was saying, in the light of the circumstances, in the light of the argument being made, the objectors would simply have to put up with it.  That would be a fairer way of going about it than the kind of Byzantine complexity into which we are now descending.  The Government should approach this issue by having legislation along these lines, and that such legislation should be tested in the courts to ensure its validity.  This would be a far better approach than to establish a commission to operate within the framework set out in this Bill, a framework which has proved itself to be already unsatisfactory.  This was the procedure, after all, which gave us the most unsatisfactory Government contribution in the debate on the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
      <P>I have no criticism of the expertise or the objectivity of the eminent persons who drew up the pro and anti statements which the Government published in the course of that referendum campaign, but I have not heard anybody say a good word about the way in which the material was presented in newspaper advertisements. What came out was illegible, incomprehensible and indigestible in two languages.  This is not the way to go about providing information to the public, yet that procedure is what the Government is now proposing for the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  The Minister referred to the fact that this was used in two other referenda &mdash; the bail referendum and the divorce referendum that went before it.  The Minister said there was a bit more time on the occasion of the divorce referendum and that the commission set up at that time distributed widely throughout the country a leaflet that dealt with the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With great respect to the people who prepared that &mdash; I mean that; I am not just saying it &mdash; I was actively involved in that referendum campaign as was Deputy Howlin and my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  I am not misrepresenting the case when I say that my experience of that referendum campaign was that the leaflet presented in that way counted for rather little in the whole debate.  I do not say that to criticise the people who prepared it, or their motivation or <Col N="890" /> their objectivity.  However they were not people who were involved in the debate.  They were not people who understood the atmosphere of the debate, and they carried out an exercise which was divorced from the way people think about debates, from the way people feel in debates, and from the way people see the issues.  It is not possible to sit in a place apart from the rambunctiousness of an argument like that and prepare a document that will be of much illuminative value &mdash; such documents are not intended to be persuasive &mdash; in the context of such a debate.</P>
    <P>We will again put a number of eminent people into a very difficult position.  Certain persons are proposed in this Bill to be members of this commission. I hope none of them will be offended by what I am about to say, because it is not my intention to offend them.  I can assure each and every one of them there is nothing personal in my remarks.  It is not my purpose to reflect on their competence in their present positions, on their dedication to their duties, on their integrity or on their qualities of imagination or understanding.  I refer to them only because they have the misfortune to be proposed as members of the commission. They are the officeholders designated by this Bill to form this commission.</P>
    <P>It is not obvious to me that any member or former member of the High Court, former member of the Supreme Court, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Clerk of Dáil Eireann, or the Clerk of Seanad Eireann have, by virtue of their office, any particular insights or experience that fit them to be members of a commission charged with the job that this commission is proposed to be given by this Bill.  There is no reason to believe these people are any more fitted for this job than other officers or citizens of the State or that there is anything which distinguishes them as being particularly suitable to carry out the functions set out for the commission.  They are proposed in the Bill simply because the Government wants to find people who are apart from the political process and who happen to hold offices which all of us respect.  This does not equip them to carry out the job being given to the commission.  It is not enough to simply say these are all persons of great probity and integrity.  This is accepted, but it is not all that is required.  They have to do a job with probity and integrity, as I am sure they will endeavour to do, but are they fitted for this job? There is nothing obvious to say they are.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the commission proposed will commission the preparation of statements on the issues arising in the referendum.  From whom will they commission such statements?  I counsel against relying only on eminent legal persons because they produce legal documents unreadable by the general public.  The Amsterdam Treaty is a perfectly legal document but it is totally indigestible to the general public.  It has to be that way.  We cannot produce the simplest Bill in this House without using a rather complex text which is beyond the normal experience of the <Col N="891" /> average citizen.  I am not sure that sending out presentations prepared by legal people will necessarily be an addition to public comprehension of the issues which will face us in the referendum.</P>
    <P>Will academics, experts and lobbyists be asked to prepare statements?  Anyone who is asked to prepare a case for or against a referendum can be criticised.  Lawyers can be criticised for producing unreadable statements, while everyone else can be criticised for some kind of partiality.  Is the commission being set up because the Government believes that as a result of the McKenna judgment we must have a parallel debate commissioned by people who are beyond reproach?  This is supposed to be of more value and more illuminating than a debate which takes place among people who are not beyond reproach because they are up to their oxters in political mud and up to their eye balls in political argument.  Is there something wrong with a debate which involves people in the political process?  Is there something about it that needs the sanitisation of having some other group who are beyond that kind of reproach involved in the preparation of information for the public?  I do not blame the Minister for this as the real problem goes back to the Supreme Court which seems to believe there is something essentially wrong with the political process because it is political.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the commission shall prepare and publish brochures, leaflets, pamphlets and posters and shall distribute them to each presidential elector or household.  It is not obvious that this commission will have any particular expertise in the preparation, publication or distribution of any of these documents.  We had a bad experience on the last occasion and I wonder how people who are not engaged in the argument can produce or assess material relevant to the debate in a way which is responsive to what is going on in the mind of a public which does not really want to read much tedious and detailed documentation.</P>
    <P>The commission will also be charged with fostering, promoting and, where appropriate, facilitating debate or discussion in a manner which is fair to all interests concerned.  I do not see anything in the qualifications of the proposed members of the commission which fits them to foster and promote debate or discussion in this way.  The Minister dealt with this when he commented on the functions set out in section 3.  He said the commission will have access to the broadcast medium.  It is important that there should be a lively debate in the broadcast media given that it seems to have a greater impact on a larger part of the population than the printed medium.  I do not see anything in the qualifications of these people which gives me confidence they can handle this matter which is so completely outside the ken of their normal activities that it is like a foreign country to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> The commission will have a budget of £2.5 million. This is a very substantial budget and much information can be given out and much facilitating can be done with it.  However, if it is badly done then a large part of the expenditure will be wasted.  If the Government is bent on setting up a commission, on having information distributed and on ensuring that debate is facilitated then surely the commission should be given powers to turn to organisations which have a track record in these matters and then decide which of those organisations should be entrusted with such tasks, the criteria which should be applied to them and their methods of work and the accountability required of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the recommendation in the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution that there ought not to be a constitutional barrier to the public funding of a referendum campaign provided that the manner of equitable allotment of such funding is entrusted to an independent body.  He went on to say, in essence, that he is too bothered and pressed and in too much of a hurry at this stage to give that any consideration, although, by implication, it might be considered at a later stage. Having quoted the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, he said: &ldquo;I am aware that the all-party committee is currently reconsidering the matter and I welcome its views but I must proceed with the present Bill.&rdquo; This is outrageous. He said his attention has been drawn to another way of doing this but he is in too much of a hurry and does not have time to think about it and he will bash ahead with what he proposes.  This is entirely unsatisfactory and it is not the way a <Col N="893" /> Government should go about dealing with an important issue such as this one.  The Government should now consider allowing the commission to farm out work on the advocacy in the way I suggested, satisfying itself as to the bona fides, standing and capacity of organisations which could carry out the work.</P>
      <P>On the dissemination of information, my understanding is that the Government will publish separately the overview section, chapter 3, of the White Paper as a stand-alone public information document, and that will be useful.  The Government intends to print 200,000 copies of that document. In a rather old-fashioned and charming way, members of the public were invited yesterday by notice in the public press to apply for a copy of the document, which will be as Gaeilge agus as Béarla and will be placed in public libraries and so on.  There will be 200,000 copies of that document for more than one million households, which is not an adequate circulation list for that material.</P>
      <P>There are many ways of ensuring wider distribution, one of which would be to give a large stock to every Member of the House to send to our constituents together with the multitudinous letters we send every day.  Every Department has a comprehensive network of contacts with bodies such as community development groups, voluntary agencies, non-governmental organisations and so on which are involved with people who would like to have information on this treaty. Will the Government consider making stocks of the document available to such bodies, many of whom have members who at some stage in their activities will ask each other what they are going to do about the Amsterdam treaty.  There is no difficulty in finding ways to disseminate the document much more widely than is intended by the Government.  For example, political parties could mail it to their members.  It would not be difficult to ensure the document goes to every household.</P>
      <P>The ban on political advertising currently in force is to be lifted in regard to advertisement taken out by the commission, and that is welcome.  If the Government took a different view of the work of the commission and agreed it should commission organisations to carry out work on its behalf in the campaign, equally the ban on political advertising should be lifted for those organisations acting in a way that is approved by the commission.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in section 7 to approve bodies for the purpose of the referendum for the various functions the Minister has indicated.  That section is entirely appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister raised the question of fairness during the course of his comments.  As an observer and a participant in the political scene for a long time, I have found there are a few dodges that are frequently used.  One of the best ways of getting publicity is to complain loudly that the media are being unfair.  If one complains loudly enough one will get much exposure in the <Col N="894" /> media, and appearing on television or radio one does not have to say the media are being unfair but simply put forward one's message.  Many people who have taken issue with my views on treaties up to now have used that dodge to very good effect.</P>
    <P>Another good dodge is to say that there are very few people who are active on one side of the argument, that one is oppressed by the fact that everybody else is against.  That ensures much publicity.  It scares the media so much that the few people who take that view and are clever enough to make that contention get about half the media space in a referendum campaign.  They spend part of their time complaining they do not get as much attention as everybody else.  We have talked ourselves into a position where time after time the media have been persuaded it is fair that people who seem to represent the views of considerably less than half the population get at least half the media exposure.  Regardless of the way this Bill turns out, the media should wake up to that fact this time around and not fall for the old dodge of people who say they are not getting fair coverage in the media, that they are oppressed by the number of people against them, and therefore they get half the coverage.  We should not fall for that in the way we have previously.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not an answer to the various issues that have arisen in recent years about the fairness of the referendum procedure.  It is a half-baked Bill based on an incomplete, pseudo-sophisticated reflection of the issues that arise.  I regret very much the Minister, who has indicated there are other ways of handling this matter, cannot be bothered with them or has not enough time.  The present course is the wrong way to proceed.  It will do serious disservice to the democratic rights of the public to information and to an informed debate in a referendum on an important issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister concluded his remarks by urging politicians to accept their share of responsibility to generate public interest.  I agree with that sentiment and hope all of us in this House seriously takes on that task.  I appeal not as a politician but as a citizen to our politicians and the media not to forget that every citizen has a duty to take steps to inform himself or herself on this matter. If we operate on the basis that people will vote in an informed way only if they are spoon-fed with information, we are insulting the people.  I bet my bottom dollar that about two weeks before referendum day &mdash; this illustrates the problem &mdash; people will say that not enough information has been made available on the matter and there has been no debate on it.  I predict that in the print and broadcast media most of the people who make that remark will be those who have extensively covered the reflection group, the intergovernmental conference and all the public debates on the issue.  I warn the public not to be put off by that nonsense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>Rather than be dragged into debate on the merits or otherwise of the specific <Col N="895" /> proposal which imminently will be put to the people to validate the Amsterdam treaty, I will focus on the Bill before us which deals with how we will conduct referenda in the future.  I am a little disconcerted in that I am much more in agreement with the comments of the Minister than the comments of the spokesman for the Fine Gael Party.  On the proposition we are faced with &mdash; I have clear views on electoral law and the way we should deal with it &mdash; a decision by four of the five judges of the Supreme Court, with Mr. Justice Egan dissenting, clearly interpreted the Constitution. There is an obligation on all of us to address that Supreme Court judgment.  It seems there are three options.  We may decide the Supreme Court should be overturned and advocate a constitutional referendum to do that.  The second option would be to accept the Supreme Court judgment and produce a Bill on the lines of the one the Minister has produced.  The third option would be to decide to do nothing, not to advocate one side or another or any case in any future referendum and if we do not spend public money we are clearly within the confines of the Supreme Court judgment.  However, we cannot simply say we do not like the Supreme Court judgment without being determined to overturn it.</P>
      <P>It is an important landmark judgment.  There were many aspects of the judgment I did not like and some with which I did not agree, but we are obliged to address the issue of fairness in conducting referenda.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Dukes stated, many countries have looked at this issue.  The Danish experience is one I would not favour.  I do not agree with the notion of handing funding to political groups or political advocates of an issue, and this could be very difficult in our context.  I could envisage, for example, a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and there are some organisations who might be actively involved in that campaign for whom I would not be anxious to provide funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be realistic and decide there will be an acceptance of the Supreme Court decision which means we must have some balanced way of advancing the case for and against a measure to be put to the people by way of referendum. We have looked at this over a period of years. An <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement was in place for three referenda.  I was responsible for devising that arrangement in response to the initial Supreme Court judgment and I accept readily that it was not an ideal mechanism.  Ironically, I also believe the first referendum we dealt with in an <i>ad hoc</i> way, the divorce referendum, was dealt with best. The production of a pamphlet, delivered to every household, was much more informative, constructive and helpful to people deciding on their views than placing an advertisement in the print media, which was the mechanism used in the two subsequent referenda.  Incidentally, it was also, by a significant measure, the cheapest way of doing it. I understand the insertion of an advertisement in <Col N="896" /> the print media in each case cost in the region of £400,000 whereas the production and dissemination of a pamphlet in the divorce referendum cost in the region of £143,000, so one got a much better impact for the expenditure of moneys.</P>
    <P>It is important that we look at this measure in the context of referenda generally rather than how we will deal with the issue of the Amsterdam Treaty referendum.  I draw to the attention of the Minister an important issue.  We gave the task of looking at the conduct of referenda to a committee reviewing the Constitution.  We asked it to look at international best practice, the Constitution and the judgment in the McKenna case, and to come up with recommendations.  To say that it is a discourtesy to produce legislation in the absence of the committee's final conclusions is to put it extremely mildly.  We are given tasks and we take them on with enthusiasm &mdash; the All-Party Committee on the Constitution undertook its work in a constructive non-partisan way &mdash; and we are all fed up to find that the work of the committees is basically irrelevant to the thinking of the Executive working in parallel with scant regard to the conclusions of the committees.  It is not good enough for the Minister to come into the House today and say that the All-Party Committee on the Constitution is currently reconsidering the matter and he would welcome its views.  What good are the views of the committee if we have enacted legislation?  Is there an urgency about this legislation that it could not wait for the views of the committee?  The Minister says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, and refers to the Amsterdam Treaty debate.  However, the Minister today and originally in his press release announcing this Bill on 27 January said that, because of the time constraints and the complexities of the Amsterdam Treaty, the Government has approved the establishment of a commission on a non-statutory basis pending enactment of the Bill.  Therefore, the Bill is irrelevant to the Amsterdam Treaty because the commission will already be established on an <i>ad hoc</i>, non-statutory basis.  I have no difficulty with that, but at the same time the Minister should give us time to reflect on how best to deal with the rather complex issues involved in allowing a fair debate on the amendments being proposed to our basic law.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is the fundamental law of the land.  It is the preserve of the people who make the decision.  They are entitled to be given the broadest possible base of knowledge on which they can make a decision.  Certainly, every political party has a responsibility to present its case to its supporters, and there is no prohibition, good, bad or indifferent, on that happening.  There is, however, a prohibition on the expenditure of public moneys by the Government in advocating one side.  That is a good thing.  It is important.  It is a nuisance and an irritant for Government, but it is an important principle of democracy that there be advocacy of issues on a balanced basis.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the case put forward by Deputy Dukes and there is merit in his argument, <Col N="897" /> that a consensus among 80 per cent or 90 per cent of the Members of the House should be reflected in the campaign.  It is a moot point.  There is always a requirement for a balanced debate so that all the issues can be teased out and that balanced debate should not include the direct funding of any advocate group.  The notion of an independent commission handling the dissemination of that information is a safer, better and, ultimately, more democratic proposal.</P>
    <P>I have clear strong views on the proposal before us.  They were touched on in passing by the Minister when he talked about the current work being undertaken by the Minister for Finance in considering the establishment of a single commission.  Let us look at the commissions currently in place and the functions the Oireachtas assigned to them.  The Registration of Political Parties Appeals Board was established by section 25 of the 1992 Act and it consists of a judge of the High Court nominated by the President of the High Court, the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach.  The Constituency Commission was established by Part II of the Electoral Act, 1997, and it consists of a judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Ombudsman, the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>One will find, when we go through all these various commissions, that the same characters and officer holders appear in more than one slot. The Public Offices Commission, established by part V of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 &mdash; it is also referred to in the Electoral Act, 1997 &mdash; consists of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Ceann Comhairle and the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad.  As we discovered recently, these bodies have a range of onerous responsibilities that are set out in the legislation to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Section 2 envisages the establishment of a referendum commission, the membership of which will comprise a former judge of the Supreme Court or a former or current judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.  It seems the commission will be made up of the same group of people wearing different hats and carrying out different functions and it will involve itself in areas of electoral law and policy which overlap or dovetail into each other. In addition, a number of functions reserved for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government are improperly conferred on a political personage.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Dukes was present, I am sure he would fundamentally disagree with my last statement. I react in the same way to people who state that politicians are the only people who cannot be trusted completely when it comes to politics. However, it is improper that there are specific roles assigned to the Minister for the Environment <Col N="898" /> and Local Government in respect of matters of electoral law.  For example, the Minister or his nominee act as returning officer for referenda. In presidential elections, he can make orders in respect of special difficulties which may arise.  In his contribution the Minister offered the example of a blizzard on polling day.  I recall such an order being made when problems arose in respect of an offshore island.</P>
    <P>Are such decisions appropriate to a partisan person?  I raise this in the context of the presidential election when the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who had functions to perform in respect of the election, served as director of elections for the candidate who subsequently became President.  I do not believe there was any impropriety on the part of the current officeholder at the Department of Environment and Local Government, but it was wrong that such a situation should arise.</P>
    <P>The time is ripe to establish, on a permanent basis, a single commission which would have all the functions currently farmed out to various commissions, boards and the Minister.  This simple proposition would be more rational and much better.  Will the Minister reflect on that proposal and not pursue the Bill to a conclusion?  There is no urgency about the Bill because the Minister can establish, on a non-statutory basis, the commission to deal with the Amsterdam Treaty.  As far as I am aware, there is no referendum imminent other than that dealing with the Treaty.  In a matter of weeks we could discuss, design and publish a consolidation Bill which would encompass the powers the Minister envisages will be given to the new referendum commission and the various other powers given, under the Electoral Acts, to the committees, commissions and boards to which I referred.  He could also rid himself of the residual electoral powers he retains.  I strongly urge the Minister to do this.</P>
    <P>I considered tabling an amendment in order that the House would divide on Second Stage.  On balance, I thought it would be more constructive and more likely to be successful if I made the case logically to the Minister.  I am aware the Minister was obliged to leave the House but I hope the Minister of State will put my views to him.  The Minister should reflect that there is no urgency on this matter and he should consider a more fundamental consolidation of electoral law than adding a further commission to the plethora which already exist.</P>
    <P>I will tease out a number of other matters at the Select Committee on Environment and Local Government before the Bill is brought to a conclusion. How will the mechanism governing the expenditure of money work?  For example, £2.5 million is to be allocated to the commission to deal with the Amsterdam Treaty.  Will the commission decide how much of this money is to be spent or must it spend the entire amount?  Will the commission decide how much RTÉ should be paid in respect of advertisements or are these expected to be offered free of charge?  Is the divide <Col N="899" /> between the expenditure on television, radio and the print media to be set in any way or will it be at the commission's discretion?  Will a large part of the £2.5 million be spent on the services of the consultants to whom the Minister referred earlier?  Will guidelines be put down?  Will the commission be able to decide that its work should only cost £500,000 and return the remaining £2 million to the Exchequer?  How will the mechanism work and on what basis was the figure of £2.5 million decided?</P>
    <P>There are clear accounting measures which cover every shilling spent.  I know from experience that if a person seeks £100,000 for a project the accountancy measures put in place are extremely arduous, and rightly so.  However, there seems to be no mechanism to control the expenditure of the £2.5 million to be given to the commission.  This will be an invitation to some consultants to make a small profit from the pool of £2.5 million which must be expended so that the perception of fairness can be seen to exist.</P>
    <P>In terms of our experience to date, in the three referenda where the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements applied, the most effective communication of the issues took the form of individual pamphlets delivered to each household.  This cost less than half the amount spent on newspaper advertisements, which, as Deputy Dukes stated, were largely a waste of effort.  Those advertisements, which appeared in two languages, were crammed into one page and proved illegible because of the minuscule print used.  They were almost designed to discourage people reading them.  I do not suggest there was an ulterior motive behind this but the advertisements were illegible to most people.</P>
    <P>This argument forms a value for money caveat to my contribution and I am interested to hear the Minister's views on it.  I hope he will express those views in a dispassionate way at the Select Committee on Environment and Local Government over a period of time rather than rushing the Bill to a conclusion in a matter of days on foot of the artificial argument that it must be in place in advance of the Amsterdam Treaty debates.  The Minister acknowledged this is not necessary because he intends to proceed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of sections of the Bill.  The notion of establishing a clear legislative way of deciding who can appropriately appoint agents at referenda is an important development.  I am familiar with the difficulties which arose in November 1995 when application was made by outside groups and bodies to have the right to nominate agents.  I was surprised by the High Court decision in respect of the special difficulty order under section 164 of the 1992 Act.  Most people did not envisage that a special difficulty would encompass the right to appoint agents.  Since the High Court decided the Minister had such a power, it does not rest comfortably with him to be the referee in deciding what group has an interest and should appoint agents.  In any referendum <Col N="900" /> there could be a number of people on the same side of the argument for very different reasons.  It is right and proper that there be a statutory mechanism for dealing with that and I understand the Minister's requirement that his role be modified so that he is taken out of such a bind.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy Dukes' views on European integration which are well stated, understood and knowledgeably articulated, but his views on how the Amsterdam Treaty should be conducted should not be mixed with general issues which will be put to the people over the next ten or 15 years by way of referendum.  There was a blurring of those distinctions in his contribution. I am surprised he said Fine Gael believe the Government should be allowed to use its resources and public money to advance its point of view because that was not the view the party put to me when I devised the <i>ad hoc</i> mechanisms subsequent to the McKenna judgment.</P>
    <P>There was no clamour from Fine Gael at the time to amend the Constitution to allow an advocacy role using public money by the Government. It is an honourable position but it was never argued or articulated to my knowledge until now. One cannot have it both ways.  One cannot say there should not be a mechanism to provide a balance if one does not believe the Supreme Court decision should be overturned.  If one advocates that, one should put forward a constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill, clear in its intent.  By and large, it puts on a statutory basis the arrangements we have explored on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis over the past three referenda.  It advances some and is extraordinarily wide and discretionary on how the commission should work.  That is a great cause of concern and I wish to tease it out.  The Bill basically says the commission will be established, given a wad of money and may use consultants, the broadcast and print media and even organise meetings.  This is too broad a remit for the commission.  If there are difficulties arising from the commissions established to examine electoral law, it is that their remits were not specific enough and they found difficulties in understanding specifically what the Oireachtas wanted them to do.</P>
    <P>There should be a single commission charged with these electoral functions.  Time should be taken to debate it and we should try to build a consensus in the House on such matters which affect our democracy and how we conduct one of the most important aspects of it &mdash; the decision making power of the people in regard to basic law.  I hope the Minister of State will put the case for a consolidated commission to his senior colleague and that the Bill will remain on hold until that sensible suggestion can be acted on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a major disappointment as in many ways it is just a warmed up version of the Private Members' Independent Referendum Commission Bill circulated by the <Col N="901" /> Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in 1996.  It puts on a statutory basis the work being done by the current <i>ad hoc</i> commission in dealing with information about referenda.  It is a Pontius Pilate type Bill which does not deal with the essential issues that confront us.</P>
      <P>We need to have a well informed electorate &mdash; informed by fact and not emotion &mdash; dealing with proposed constitutional amendments.  We are concerned with the low turn out in recent referenda and the fact that people complained about not having been sufficiently informed.  One informs in two ways, by providing basic information and advocacy.  The Bill does nothing about advocacy and it merely puts in statutory form what already exists on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis with regard to disseminating basic information.</P>
      <P>It is not informed by the detailed discussions taking place at meetings of the All Party Committee on the Constitution chaired by the Minister's colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I cannot understand why there has not been rapport between both.  As vice chairman of the committee, I know there has been very detailed discussion and research on matters in Ireland and internationally relating to the running of referenda. Why then was the Bill rushed without any reference to the committee?  I have no doubt Deputy Lenihan will have a question or two for the Minister about that.  The purpose of the research was to try and look at all issues so that ultimately we would produce, preferably on an all party basis, a report that would cover a great deal of ground rather than this very simplistic, minimalist approach.  The Bill deals with the question of approved bodies and the recognition of same to appoint personating agents.  That is an irrelevant relic of a bygone day.  What personation will take place during a referendum when hundreds of thousands are involved?  Will the Minister have individuals in Ballydehob checking to see whether a person is voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&ldquo;?  It is rubbish and should be considered as such.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a timid response to the main problems created by the McKenna judgment.  It deals solely with information and there is no need for any such Bill.  Any Government is entitled to issue information on any issue.  The McKenna judgment does not affect that in any way, provided the Government issues it fairly, and there is no reason it should not.  What is the purpose of the Bill, what has it got to do with the Amsterdam Treaty and why the rush?  The approach adopted by the Government is wrong because essentially the Bill does not tackle the main point as it does not resolve the issue of the entitlement of a democratically elected Government to advocate a point of view in a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Government is answerable to the Dáil, which is answerable to the people, and a Government, provided it does not break the law, should be entitled to advocate a view in a referendum. We should try to see how that might be best done in compliance with the Constitution whether by <Col N="902" /> way of a constitutional referendum or by way of a Bill which could be referred to the Supreme Court to ensure it is acceptable.</P>
    <P>The issues to be addressed by referenda in the future include not only the Amsterdam Treaty, but are likely to involve decisions, for example, on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and other constitutional changes which may arise from the Northern Ireland talks.  We must take the long and not the short-term view adopted by the Minister in this Bill.  This is apart altogether from the issue of the general programme of constitutional reform.</P>
    <P>To evoke a vigorous democratic response and a reasonable turnout in a referendum it is necessary to work out how to underpin referendum campaigns with adequate promotional and informational resources.  I do not accept that minority or <i>ad hoc</i> groups springing up overnight in reaction to a particular proposal are entitled to equal funding to the Government or the political parties represented in the Dáil.  The philosophy in this regard must be based on fairness rather than equality and that should be our aim in examining the issue.</P>
    <P>What can the Government do despite the McKenna judgment?  The Government is not precluded by the Supreme Court from presenting information to assist in the exercise of informed choice by the people.  It has rightly issued a White Paper on the Amsterdam Treaty.  There should be an obligation to produce a White Paper as a forerunner for every Bill to amend the Constitution. If necessary such a provision should be in statute or incorporated in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The special status of a Bill to amend the Constitution should be recognised from the point of view of time.  I recall debating the Bill on Cabinet confidentiality which was rushed through the House in about six hours of debate all told.  That was a bad mistake.  Debates in the Dáil are useful for informing the people.  There should be a minimum time of six or eight weeks required by statute or by the Constitution to ensure that legislation on referenda cannot be rushed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Special funding should be available for such legislation.  There is no funding restriction in the McKenna judgment on referenda Bills prior to their being passed by the Oireachtas.  Funding can and should be made available for research by the political parties or surveys to ascertain the views of the people.  Thus, the Oireachtas may make an informed view on constitutional change.</P>
    <P>With regard to any such procedures the committees of the Oireachtas should be used.  Submissions could be sought and oral hearings held as part of a wider legislative process.  Such measures would help ensure more information was available to the public so that they might be fully appraised of issues before a Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>If these proposals were accepted the situation would be in stark contrast to that which pertained last September when the Cabinet confidentiality Bill was rushed through the House.  I do not think <Col N="903" /> there was one report in any of the newspapers the following day on that debate, although there were other well-publicised events taking place here on that day, in the form of a personal statement by a Minister.  We need to use the system better so that by the time a Bill has been passed by the Oireachtas people know what it is about.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Government takes a restrictive view of the effect of the McKenna judgment. Funding for research by political parties and others prior to the passing of a Bill is not affected by the Supreme Court judgment.  Thereafter, it is possible to provide funding if it is thought necessary. When a constitutional Bill is put to the people it is like the monarch of old exercising a right of veto.  The people do not influence what goes into the Bill but it is presented to them having been passed by the Oireachtas and they have the right of veto.  The people act in the role of a judge making a decision on the basis of the evidence put before them.  Dry information on such matters will filter through to some people, but to stimulate debate and to get people engaged in the process it is necessary to promote the debate and fund that promotion.</P>
    <P>In this regard the Government should not be compared to a small interest group under an impressive title.  It is possible to discuss and arrive at procedures to achieve fairness if the Government wishes to fund the promotion of a particular point of view.  It is possible that there may be a role for a commission to adjudicate on the fairness or otherwise of the campaign adopted by the Government.  However, this Bill does not even touch on these issues, rather it ignores them.  It is a disastrous failure which will lead to a low turnout in the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>We do not wish a repetition of the debacle that was the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality and that is why I want a Bill which addresses the points I raise.  I am trying to be constructive but this Bill does not advance the debate.  If we incorporated these and other ideas into a decent Bill and it presented problems there would be two courses of action open.  The House could make clear its desire for the President to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality or we could propose a constitutional amendment. It may be argued that there is a time constraint and we must rush the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty.  Why is that?  We have a year in which to ratify it.  The only other country which has fixed a date for a referendum is Denmark and that is for the end of May.  Why are we rushing? We should deal with the matter properly rather than rush through a Bill which will not deal with the wider problem.</P>
    <P>On the information issue, the <i>ad hoc</i> commissions had neither the time nor the mandate to distribute information in previous referenda. They put together advertisements giving the cases for and against and that was all they could do. They were not dealing with the provision of information. However information is disseminated, by <Col N="904" /> the Government or by a commission, every polling card should be accompanied by a pamphlet explaining the issues in the referendum.</P>
    <P>The report of the first all-party committee on the Constitution, which I chaired, dealt with the information issue.  The committee felt there should be one electoral and ethics commission. There are far too many commissions.  There is a public offices commission, a constituency commission and a commission set up under the Electoral Bill.  There should be one commission instead of the plethora that exists.</P>
    <P>We envisaged from the report that the commission would be set up on a constitutional basis and as such would have powers to deal with cases, such as the McKenna case, that arise under the Constitution.  I have my own ideas on the powers it should have, but that cannot happen with a commission set up on a statutory basis unless a Bill is referred to the Supreme Court.  Otherwise, we are bound by the current judgment of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Because of time constraints I can touch on only some of the issues involved.  This is a serious matter. We are dealing with the question of reforming the Constitution for the years ahead. Therefore, we must ensure that proper procedures and funding are in place and that sufficient time is allowed to discuss the legislation and to prepare documentation when it is passed. The commission will have no resources or staff. Who will deal with the documentation?  Essentially, we are talking about people who know something about the Bill.  The Minister did not deal adequately with that matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not address the main issue.  The Minister did not refer to the different approach adopted in Denmark.  Did he examine the position in the states of the United States where a number of referenda have taken place?  Did he examine the research carried out in those states on the different ways the public can be involved in a referendum debate?  Did he examine the relative merits of advertising through the print media, the radio or by circulating pamphlets?  There is ample evidence of the best way to disseminate information.  There is also evidence on the best way to arouse a public debate on the matter. There should be advocacy on both sides and the necessary funds should be made available.  A major defect of the Bill is the Minister's failure to address that issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be viewed as a green paper and not rushed through the House.  The commission has already been set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  All it requires is the nod from the Minister for Finance that the Dáil has approved the necessary funding, which is not a matter for the Bill.  I strongly recommend that we do not proceed with the Bill. There should be detailed discussion not only in the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution but in the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government.  Experts should be consulted and submissions sought on the matter.  The Government could then formulate <Col N="905" /> a Bill that would have the support of the House and would be effective in dealing with the problems that confront us.  Pending that, there is only one answer to this timid effort and minimalist approach &mdash; to vote against it.</P>

      <P>I was surprised to hear the Fine Gael Opposition spokesperson indicate that his party proposes to oppose this measure.  It represents a practical step in the right direction. While I accept a number of points have been canvassed by Deputies Dukes and O'Keeffe, the measure represents a practical advance on what preceded it.  It is clear from what Deputy Howlin said on behalf of the Labour Party there will not be all-party agreement for the type of approach Deputy O'Keeffe advocated.  In a matter that touches on the electoral system, the franchise, the rights of citizens and the proper conduct of a referendum, a measure of agreement between all parties is desirable.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents a certain minimum, but I thought that minimum would be intrinsically acceptable, even to the principal Opposition party.  Whether we as legislators should go beyond that minimum is a subject for further debate.  The basic minimum provided for in the Bill is desirable.  Therefore, it is curious that it is intended to force a vote on the matter at the conclusion of the debate.  In forcing a vote on it, the principal Opposition party is opposing the merits of the proposal.  Yet it has considerable merit and builds on some of the experience in this area to date and on some of the recommendations in the earlier progress report of the all-party committee on the desirable persons in the composition of a commission that should police a referendum.</P>
      <P>The referendum is of great importance under our constitutional system.  When the Constitution was repatriated to the people in 1937, and Mr. de Valera gave them an opportunity to pronounce on it, they adopted it.  It remains the birthright of the citizens and since 1942 it cannot be amended without their expressed consent, freely given in a referendum.  It is extraordinary that for many years our referendum legislation did not provide in great detail for the conduct of referenda or the dissemination of information.  A section in the current and earlier legislation gives the citizen the right to purchase in the local post office, for the nominal sum of two and a half pennies, a copy of the Bill passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is all that is provided for by way of information, apart from the polling information card which is also referred to in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When formulating legislation in this area, the Government must respect the landmark decision in the case instituted by Patricia McKenna at the time of the referendum on the amendment to the Constitution that led to the introduction of a divorce facility.  I have no doubt the Minister was conscious of the obligations imposed on the Government in the McKenna judgment when formulating this legislation.  However, there is a <Col N="906" /> danger in taking too literally the judgment of the judges of the Supreme Court in that case.  There is scope for development in the interpretation of that judgment.  For example, it is clear the judgment prohibits the Government appropriating public moneys to promote a particular result and, therefore, behaving in a less than even handed way in the promotion of a result.  It is not clear, however, that the McKenna judgment prohibits the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; the Houses which adopt a proposal to amend the Constitution &mdash; from proceeding to promote their point of view with the electorate.  When a proposal to amend the Constitution is submitted to the House in the form of a Bill, it is discussed by Members.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a modest but important measure.  If enacted into law it will add an additional essential building block to the legislative provisions currently in force designed to provide protection for children at risk from or suffering abuse or who are victims of neglect.  The Bill's objective is to ensure that no barriers or obstacles exist which prevent reporting of suspected child abuse or neglect to the appropriate authorities. The Bill can properly be described as a &ldquo;whistleblower's charter&rdquo; which facilitates the reporting of child abuse by any person who has reasonable grounds for believing a child is at risk.</P>
      <P>No extravagant claims will be made by me with regard to the Bill.  The measure merely addresses one area of our law which has been ignored by this House for far too long.  If we are to have a modern, comprehensive and informed child care system which is responsive to the needs of children and designed to protect the welfare of the most vulnerable children within our community, a great deal more needs to be done than merely the enactment of this Bill.  I will return to this theme later.</P>
      <P>The Bill will implement recommendations made in a variety of reports and it has widespread support.  I will say something about its origins and then refer to its substantive provisions before turning to the politics of the Bill and discussing how it should be dealt with by this House.  Finally I will address a number of other issues with relevance to the child care services and the protection and welfare of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> Many people within the community in their professional or ordinary lives have regular contact with children and on particular grounds may conclude that a particular child or children is or are suffering abuse.  A large number of cases of children at risk come to the attention of health boards due to referrals from doctors, nurses or teachers and others whose professional work brings them regularly into contact with children. Other referrals derive from a variety of different individuals as a consequence of what they are told by children or from events they witness and feel obliged to report to the appropriate authorities.</P>
    <P>Over ten years ago, when preparing a consultation paper on child sexual abuse, the Law Reform Commission concluded that fear of being sued for defamation is a barrier to the reporting of abuse.  In this consultation paper, published in August 1989 and dealing essentially with the area of child sexual abuse, the commission stated that legislation should be enacted expressly conferring immunity from liability for &ldquo;bona fide reports of child abuse made with due care&rdquo;.  In its subsequent report on child sexual abuse published in 1990, the commission repeated its recommendation and stated:</P>
    <P>we would emphasise that the need for the statutory immunity arises whether or not mandatory reporting laws are introduced.  At present, fear of legal proceedings, though frequently misplaced is operating as a serious disincentive to the reporting of suspected child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The need for such legislative reform was also reiterated in the Kilkenny incest investigation report in 1993 and by the committee of inquiry into the death of Kelly Fitzgerald, whose report was finalised in 1995 and published in 1996.  The latter report did not confine this recommended law reform to child sexual abuse and other reports published in recent years by a variety of groups and organisations have stated that fear of legal proceedings can act as an obstacle to the reporting of suspected child abuse or neglect. Similar concerns have been expressed by a variety of professional organisations such as the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, both of which have called for laws to grant immunity to either doctors or teachers who, on valid grounds, report suspicions of child abuse to a health board.</P>
    <P>It is a policy commitment common to all parties in this House to improve awareness of child abuse among the public and to create an environment which will help facilitate the reporting of child abuse.  It is also an objective of all parties in this House to improve co-operation between professionals and agencies dealing with children in identifying and responding to the needs of children at risk.  This Bill will help create an environment that facilitates the reporting of child abuse and improves co-operation between professionals <Col N="908" /> and agencies dealing with children who are suspected of being at risk.</P>
    <P>The Bill is tabled by me on behalf of Fine Gael to address a fundamental gap in our law that must be addressed.  It has the single objective of seeking to ensure that no person who genuinely believes on reasonable grounds that a child is a victim of, or at risk of, abuse is in any way inhibited from reporting such concern to the appropriate authorities by a fear that making such a report may rebound to his or her serious detriment.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains the short title.  Section 2 is the interpretation provision.  It should be particularly noted in this context that the &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; to whom it is envisaged under the Bill that reports of child abuse will be made means &ldquo;any statutory or non-statutory body concerned with the welfare and care of children and includes each health board in the State and an Garda Síochána&rdquo;, and an &ldquo;appropriate person&rdquo; to whom the Bill envisages reports of suspected child abuse will be made means any person who is a member of or an employee of a statutory or non-statutory body concerned with the welfare and care of children and includes an employee of a health board and a member of an Garda Síochána.  Under the Bill, cover is provided for those who report suspicions of child abuse to specific non-governmental agencies concerned with the welfare of children such as the Irish Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Children and Barnardos.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides protection from civil litigation for a person who, acting reasonably and in good faith, reports or communicates that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a child is a victim of abuse or neglect or that a child's health, development or welfare is at risk.  It should be specifically noted that the phraseology of this section reflects similar provisions in the Child Care Act, 1991 which provide the present statutory basis for the making of care orders and supervision orders under that Act.  The protection from civil litigation for a reporter of child abuse or neglect under the section specifically applies to those who &ldquo;in good faith&rdquo; make such report to an &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; or to an &ldquo;appropriate person&rdquo;.  The good faith requirement directly derives from the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission on this issue which was intended to ensure that the legislation it recommended did not provide immunity from civil liability to those who made malicious and vexatious allegations of child abuse for which there were no reasonable grounds.  It is important that such legislation does not provide a licence to make false allegations of abuse and the technical phraseology of the section is designed to ensure no such difficulty can arise.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 to render a dismissal an unfair dismissal within the meaning of that Act where an employee's employment is terminated as a consequence of the employee in good faith reporting that there are reasonable grounds for believing a <Col N="909" /> child is a victim of abuse or neglect or that a child's health, development or welfare is at risk. It is of essential importance that those who work in the professions which regularly have contact with children and those who are employed by sporting bodies and who, on reasonable grounds, suspect a child may be the victim of abuse will not, through threat of loss of their employment, be put under pressure by their superiors not to report their concerns to the appropriate authorities. The need for legislation with regard to sporting bodies has become self-evident in recent days.  Under our present law, if someone were dismissed from their employment for making such a report on reasonable grounds, it is arguable that such dismissal would be held to be unfair. However, existing exemptions contained in the Unfair Dismissals Acts exclude the Acts' application to employees of State bodies.  The existing protection is grossly inadequate.  A specific amendment is required to the l977 Act to establish this principle in clear and cogent terms.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is merely a commencement provision. Under it this Bill would become law and come into force one calendar month following its enactment. The Bill comes before the House in the wake of three major court cases concerned with the most gross and barbaric types of child sexual and physical abuse.</P>
    <P>Just 11 days ago the North Western Health Board settled the civil damages action brought by the McColgan children as a consequence of that health board's gross negligence in failing, over a period of 14 years, to provide them with the type of protection from their father to which they were entitled.  It comes just eight days after Fr. Ivan Payne pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an altar boy in Dublin and some five days after he pleaded guilty to 11 further charges of indecent assault on a number of children from 1968 to l987. These assaults were committed not only on altar boys but also on children who were patients in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin when visited by Fr. Payne.  It is now also a matter of public knowledge that the extraordinary step was taken of placing Fr. Payne in a highly responsible and sensitive position within the Marriage Tribunal in Dublin, subsequent to allegations of child abuse having been made against him.</P>
    <P>Also it is just five days since the sentencing to 12 years imprisonment of Derry O'Rourke, who grossly abused his position as national swimming coach, sexually preying on the children under his care.  We have learned in recent days what was suspected for some years, that the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, the sport's controlling body, failed abysmally to act on reports that its employees were behaving inappropriately towards children who were being coached and failed to put in place procedures to ensure that the children for which it was responsible were not abused.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that if this Bill were enacted none of the horrors experienced by the children who were the victims in each of these three appalling <Col N="910" /> cases would not have occurred.  I am simply saying these cases illustrate in a stark and public way the extent of child physical and sexual abuse and the impact of such behaviour on those who are the victims.  These cases give stark and public illustrations of instances of abuse that occurred during the l970s, l980s and l990s.  Can there be any Member who would not agree that any existing obstacle to the reporting of child abuse should be dismantled and no longer be part of our legal system?</P>
    <P>This is a modest but important measure.  It is also a brief Bill lacking in complexity with a simple objective.  It is proposed as a constructive initiative to reform an aspect of our law relating to children which should have been addressed long ago.  It is a measure that deserves the support not only of Opposition parties but of the two parties in Government as well as independent Deputies.  I take this opportunity to thank those independent Deputies who have contacted me in recent days to express their support for the Bill. It is of some considerable symbolic importance that all Members use this Bill as the vehicle to join together to express our abhorrence of child abuse and our commitment to ensure all necessary measures are taken to provide the protection for our children to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I was informed late this afternoon by the Minister for Health and Children that the Government is not opposing this measure.  I welcome the Government's constructive response which I assume will be confirmed later this evening by the Minister.  Upon the Bill passing Second Stage, there is no reason Committee Stage should not be taken by the Committee on Health and Children at the end of February or early March and the Bill enacted into law by Easter.  This would afford the Government parties reasonable time in which to propose any constructive amendments deemed desirable by them to be included in the Bill and allow them to be amply considered in the course of the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>A great deal more needs to be done than merely enacting this measure if we are to have a child care system which is responsive to the needs of children and which provides children at risk with the protection to which they are entitled.  For decades Governments were paralysed by inaction due to fragmentation of political responsibility for child care services and legislation between a variety of Government Departments.  Reforming legislation that should have taken months to prepare took over a decade to enact.  Services for vulnerable children were fragmented and lacking in cohesion.  Government action was driven by piecemeal fire brigade interventions and lacked the integrated and comprehensive policy overview necessary to ensure children's law and services met the needs that truly had to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The previous Government, for the first time, appointed a single Minister with overall responsibility for child care services and legislation whose brief straddled the Departments of Health, Education <Col N="911" /> and Justice.  Sadly the Government turned the clock backwards by returning to the old system of fragmenting responsibility for children's law and children's services among a variety of senior and junior Ministers.  As a consequence there has been no coherent Government policy in this area for over seven months and we have witnessed Ministers with different areas of responsibility contradict each other on a variety of issues of vital concern to vulnerable children.</P>
    <P>I was sorry for the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Liz O'Donnell, a constituency colleague, as she squirmed with embarrassment before the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child trying to defend the indefensible.  The beneficial consequence of that public and embarrassing event was the announcement that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Frank Fahey, was being conferred with the same co-ordinating functions with regard to children's issues as previously invested in my party colleague, Deputy Austin Currie, during the lifetime of the previous Government. However, to date no order has been laid before the House devolving responsibilities to him in the same manner as responsibilities were devolved to Deputy Currie when Minister of State with responsibility for children.</P>
    <P>It has become clear in recent days that the announcement made with regard to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is no more than cosmetic window dressing.  I would be delighted to be proved wrong in this.  As recently as last Thursday, when queried during Question Time on the discrepancies between the statistics detailing reports of child abuse to health boards and the comparatively small number of such cases that had resulted in Garda prosecutions, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, washed his hands of the query and solemnly stated the question of prosecutions was a matter for the Department of Justice and Law Reform and the Garda.  It did not occur to the newly appointed ministerial co-ordinator of children's law and children's services that the huge discrepancy between the number of children abused and the number of prosecutions brought was a matter on which he should have had some knowledge and should have been in a position to supply substantive information.</P>
    <P>To date the Government's policy with regard to children's law and children's services has been a scandalous disgrace.  There is not a policy commitment in the Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats election programmes or in the so called programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, which is being progressed with any sense of urgency or commitment.  There is no sense that providing essential protection and services for children is a Government priority.</P>
    <P>Before the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, it was admitted that the Government, when addressing children's issues, had no overall strategy, despite the enactment <Col N="912" /> and coming into force of the Child Care Act, l991, and the expansion of child care services within our health boards.  The criticism voiced in l980, by the task force on child care services in its final report, that during the preceding 150 years services for deprived children and children at risk were initiated and developed piecemeal and were the result of fragmented planning and lacked cohesion, has validity in describing the position today.  There is not in place a comprehensive national strategy for children detailing overall ascertainable objectives.</P>
    <P>Health boards still lack the resources required to fulfil their obligations under the Child Care Act, l991, and health board staff confronted by annually increasing reports of suspected child abuse and neglect are operating a fire brigade service which is on the verge of disintegration in some parts of the country with the staff employed overwhelmed and unable to cope.  As we speak there are hundreds of reports of suspected child abuse made to health boards awaiting investigation and children already reported to health boards as being at risk remain at risk with little hope of their family circumstances being investigated until many weeks have passed following such reports being made.</P>
    <P>The essential in-service training social workers require to develop the necessary expertise in this area is still sadly lacking.  Health boards remain bereft of the resources they need to fulfil their obligations to children as statutorily prescribed by the Child Care Act, l991.</P>
    <P>From comments made last Thursday by the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, it is clear that at central Government level there is neither the commitment nor the will to provide the comprehensive professional child care services that are so badly needed, nor the political commitment to allocate the essential funding and resources.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed in the House last week, rightly, by the Minister for Health and Children about the tragedy suffered by the McColgan children. Concern has been expressed about the failure of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association to protect children from the paedophiliac tendencies of some of those employed by the association to coach them.  We have been informed that the association has been asked to meet with the Minister for Tourism, Recreation and Sport.  The calls for an inquiry into the behaviour of the association deserve a swift and positive response from the Government.  In the absence of the Government prioritising children's needs; implementing policies long since recognised as being necessary and demanded by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, and allocating the resources health boards require to address children's needs, such comments should be seen as nothing but public relations political play-acting and the shedding of crocodile tears.</P>
    <P>Despite the horrific inadequacies of the child care service and the failure to provide protection <Col N="913" /> for children, as illustrated by the Kilkenny incest report, the death of Kelly Fitzgerald, the tragedy that befell the McColgan children, the victims of Fr. Ivan Payne and Derry O'Rourke, there is no discernible sense of urgency on the part of the Government to take the initiatives which are so badly needed in this area.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any public demand or economic need, the Government reduced capital gains tax in the budget from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. According to the Government's estimate, in a full year this change will result in a loss to the Exchequer of £20 million.  At a time of extraordinary economic buoyancy there was neither a need nor any public demand for this change in our taxation laws.</P>
    <P>By contrast last Thursday it was admitted on the Government's behalf that, if we are to have the full comprehensive services necessary to provide protection for children, there is a shortfall in Government funding in this area which over a three year period comes to a figure in the region of £100 million.  Where are our priorities?  If capital gains tax legislation had been left untouched, the income derived over the next three years would have gone a long way towards bridging this financial gap.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the lack of a sense of urgency on the Government's part in addressing issues that affect children.  This was illustrated by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children at Question Time last Thursday when he informed the House that he had identified the establishment of a social services inspectorate as a top priority with regard to children. He proposes to establish the inspectorate this year.  However, no legislation to provide for such an inspectorate is to be enacted for at least three years and no date has been given for when the inspectorate will commence its work.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the inspectorate weighs so heavily on the Minister of State's shoulders that thinking about this issue renders it impossible to appoint an ombudsman for children this year.  An ombudsman for children was identified as being necessary by the Children's Rights Alliance and the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child.  The Government's confusion on the issue was clearly illustrated by the Minister of State last December when he announced that the Government did not intend to establish such an office and by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, who informed the United Nations committee six weeks ago that the Government would do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for co-ordinating children's services it appears is not able to co-ordinate anything on this issue.  He informed the House last week that it has &ldquo;implications for a number of Departments dealing with issues relating to children and it will be necessary to clarify the departmental roles and responsibilities in this regard&rdquo;.  Having regard to the redefinition of his ministerial status, I would have <Col N="914" /> expected the Minister of State to be in a position to rapidly unravel these so-called interdepartmental implications.  The functions and role of an ombudsman for children are not mysterious. They appear, however, to remain something of a mystery to the Minister of State.  It is clear he is not playing a co-ordinating role and appears to lack the capacity to do so.</P>
    <P>The reforms needed extend beyond blaming Ministers for policy and children's services failures. There is a need to radically reform the Civil Service structure which is responsible for children's law and services and to provide a central focus for what is often referred to as the permanent government.  Is there not something visibly wrong with a Civil Service structure which requires a Minister of State to be accompanied to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child by 15 civil servants from a variety of Departments to ensure they are equipped with all the information necessary to respond to queries raised?  Is not the sight of a Minister of State accompanied by so many officials an eloquent, self-evident testimony to the need for basic structural administrative reform?  How can there be a co-ordinated system and policies where related issues are administered by so many people who have separate staffs working with them?</P>
    <P>The last comprehensive guidelines on child abuse to ensure uniformity of approach by social work personnel attached to health boards were published in 1987.  It took the Oireachtas over two years to enact the Child Care Act, 1991, which did not come into operation until four years after its enactment in autumn 1995.  In 1995 minor adjustments were made to the guidelines with regard to the procedures applicable for informing the Garda Síochána of allegations of child abuse but the principal guidelines put in place in 1987 remain in force.  Due to the substantial legal changes effected by the 1991 Act these guidelines are grossly out of date.</P>
    <P>Since the enactment of the Child Care Act, 1991, there have been a number of Governments of different political persuasions in place.  Why is it that from the beginning of 1991 to the end of 1997 nothing was done to update at national level guidelines relating to child abuse?  Why is it that the Government is only now considering establishing a committee to look into updating these guidelines?  Outdated provisions in present guidelines have resulted in some health boards producing their own local guidelines leading to the reasonable conclusion that the nature of the protection afforded to children at risk may vary and depend on the health board area in which a child at risk happens to be resident.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the Kilkenny incest investigation report recommended that the Department of Health and Children prepare revised procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse to be contained in new guidelines. The report of the committee of inquiry into the death of Kelly Fitzgerald in 1996 also recommended that an agreed national standard and format <Col N="915" /> be established by the eight regional health boards to allow the transfer of information from one board to another where a board is aware that a family whose children are or are suspected of being at risk has moved to another area.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous and inexcusable that new national guidelines have not been put in place. The lethargy with which this issue is being addressed makes it unlikely that we will have new national guidelines on child abuse until 1999 at the earliest.  This is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>A further problem is the absence of coherent research or monitoring by a single Department of the manner in which children's law and services are operating.  In the absence of the appointment of an ombudsman for children, it is essential that the relevant Department assumes a more active and dynamic monitoring role in relation to children. For example, in reply to a question last Thursday the Minister of State with responsibility for children's law and services was unable to tell me how many reports of alleged child abuse had been received by the Southern Health Board in 1996 or how many such reports had been confirmed. As a consequence, it is clear as we enter February 1998 that the Minister of State concerned does not know the total number of children in respect of whom allegations of abuse were made or confirmed in 1996.  Such information is essential for policy making purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State was able to inform me that 2,386 reports of child abuse were received by the Eastern Health Board in 1996 of which 833 were confirmed but he did not have available information on the extent to which the abuse, alleged or confirmed, related to physical, sexual or emotional abuse or neglect.  In the context of policy planning, social work training and the provision of backup services, such information is essential.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday when asked by me for the number of applications made to each District Court by health boards pursuant to the Child Care Act, 1991, and the number of court orders made under that Act for the legal year 1 August 1996 to 31 July 1997 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not have available the relevant statistical information for the Dublin metropolitan district area in which a large number of such applications are brought and granted weekly.</P>
    <P>On the same day the Minister for Health and Children did not have available any information on the total number of court orders sought or obtained by health boards under the Child Care Act, 1991, since it came into force in autumn 1995.  The response I obtained was that the Minister was requesting the health boards to provide the information sought.  It is clear that if I had not raised these issues by way of parliamentary question, much of this information would never have been sought by or, probably, been available to Government.  In this day and age it should not be necessary to have to emphasise the need for coherent research and monitoring the workings <Col N="916" /> of our child care system.  I would have expected it to be a central function of Government to monitor the workings of the Child Care Act, 1991, to ensure that legislation is working in the manner originally envisaged.</P>
    <P>There are other issues that deserve to be addressed for which I do not have time but which will be addressed by my colleagues.  There is one specific issue about which this House is in denial and which we must confront.  Just as we are entitled to be critical of the failures of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, we are also entitled to be critical of the failures of the Roman Catholic Church to address the problem of paedophile priests in its midst.  We are entitled to ask how it came about that priests who were reported to have abused children were moved from one parish to another in past years and their activities covered up by those in authority.</P>
    <P>In the context of Fr. Ivan Payne finally admitting his crimes last week, we are entitled to ask the church why this man was appointed to an extraordinarily sensitive position in the Marriage Tribunal in Drumcondra after it was known he had abused Andrew Madden.  We are entitled to ask for public assurances that there is no one in the priesthood in this State who has a paedophile history and who currently has access to children in his work as a priest.  I say this as someone who has viewed with great sadness recent events in this area and has some intimate knowledge of the extent of the problem with which Members of this House may not be fully aware.  My concern is for all the children of this nation.  It is hypocritical of us to call to account the Irish Amateur Swimming Association and to turn a blind eye to the litany of sexual horrors that have been disclosed by a series of court cases in which members of the clergy have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>As someone who works in the area of family law I find the Fr. Payne case particularly appalling. I should make a declaration of interest by stating that the law firm of which I am a member, but not myself personally, represented the courageous Andrew Madden and processed the civil court proceedings brought on his behalf which were ultimately settled in his favour.  Without Andrew Madden's persistence and courage, Fr. Payne would never have been investigated by the Garda.  He would never have been brought before our courts and successfully prosecuted and would still be sitting in the Marriage Tribunal in Drumcondra, in Archbishop's House, as men and women discussed in his presence the intimate details of their married life to facilitate his determining whether there was any basis for granting them a church decree of nullity.</P>
    <P>In making a declaration of interest, I should also state that the law firm of which I am a member is currently representing two people who are seeking financial compensation as a result of alleged sexual abuse by Fr. Payne.  What is not generally known is that there are in the region of 120 separate civil actions currently pending <Col N="917" /> against a variety of religious defendants in our courts in which it is alleged by the plaintiffs in those proceedings that they were victims of sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the McColgan children were treated during the course of the recent court proceedings by the North Western Health Board is indefensible.  We are entitled to ask in this House that no plaintiff who is a victim of sexual abuse be again similarly treated by either a State body or by the church.  As the number of such civil actions mounts, the time has come for the hierarchy to address this issue and to determine the church's stance in the interests of the church and those who have fallen victims to abuse, and to do so with generosity, insight and sensitivity.  It is an issue that the church, following a number of court cases, was forced to confront in other countries.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a wide variety of issues must be addressed if we are to truly have a children friendly society.  The Bill I bring before the House this evening is merely a small step in the right direction in addressing one area of concern.  It is the first Bill relating to child care we have seen during the lifetime of this Dáil.  I hope the debate on its provisions will act as a catalyst for a variety of other badly needed initiatives to meet the needs of our children, and I am pleased the House is not to divide on its provisions.  I again thank the Minister and the Minister of State for agreeing that Second Stage will proceed, that the Bill will pass through Second Stage and that we will thereafter move on to Committee Stage.  I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Timmins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Kirk) Acting Chairman (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed? Agreed.  There are five minutes remaining for Deputy Timmins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for sharing time with me.  Madonna House, the Kilkenny incest case and the McColgan family are phrases that flow off the tongue just like Greysteel, the Miami Showband and Enniskillen.  There is only one real difference in all of this horror.  The events in Enniskillen occurred in an instant, with no time to call for help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we read daily reports of abuse cases we take great consolation from the fact that the events are over.  They happened in the past, in the so called good old days.  They would not happen now.  The perpetrators have been exposed and someone with similar tendencies will have been scared off.  We wonder how people let it happen when in hindsight it all seems so obvious. People say that if only they had been there they could have taken action, but the record tells a different story.  It appears that the Irish Amateur Swimming Association may have known of complaints about Mr. Derry O'Rourke.  Indeed the Triton Swimming Club in Bray has initiated the process of disaffiliation from the IASA in protest at its handling of recent abuse cases.  How often <Col N="918" /> have we read about clubs or authorities taking constructive steps to verify rumours of abuse? Not very often.  The case usually comes to light when the victims can take no more.  There is an inherent reticence in the Irish psyche to complain about or report something to someone in authority. Perhaps the old informer connotation prevents us taking any steps we might wish to take.</P>
    <P>Watching children walking to school reminds one of the old Connemara picture postcard of the donkey laden down with turf.  Last Friday I was in a friend's house when he weighed the school bag of his nine year old daughter.  It weighed one stone.  Parents who have the means drive their children to school so that they can avoid the hardship involved in carrying an inordinate amount of school books.  We all know this happens but we are doing nothing about it.  Some physical damage will almost certainly occur to the children concerned and I call on the Minister for Education and Science to address this problem immediately.</P>
    <P>The stay safe programme, when introduced, caused difficulties for some schools and parents. What percentage of schools have not implemented the programme to date?  What plans, if any, are there in these schools to facilitate students who wish to attend the programme? What measures, if any, have been taken to discuss the matter with parents who do not wish their children to attend the programme?</P>
    <P>A child's welfare should be of paramount importance to this House.  The activities of a child, however, straddle many areas and the State's responsibility to its children has been diluted in a departmental haze of health, education and justice.  The United Nations report on Ireland's record <i>vis-a-vis</i> the rights of the child was highly critical.  It is a sad day when the United Nations has to tell us how to look after our children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's Bill goes some small way on what is a long road to addressing the difficulties of child abuse.  Its enactment would give us one less excuse for inactivity.  This debate gives us an opportunity to reflect on how weak we have been in this area.  Leaving aside the ISPCC, we do not get many calls from children, the disabled and the elderly but that should not prevent us from putting them at the top of the political agenda.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred in his contribution to the fact that when the Minister of State attended the United Nations, she was accompanied by 15 civil servants.  That is one of the main reasons we have such difficulty with regard to the reporting of child abuse and protecting our children.  The responsibility is diluted among too many Departments.</P>

      <P>Society has been shocked at the horrific reports of child abuse which have come to our attention in recent years.  Some of these cases involved abuse which took place many years ago and others, as in the case of the swimming coach, concerned the more recent past.  I take this opportunity to offer my deepest sympathy to the victims of this callous abuse.  I have great admiration for the courage of the victims in speaking out in this difficult case thus helping to ensure the perpetrator was brought to justice. There is an overwhelming concern to ensure that such depraved events and such exploitation of innocent children will not happen again.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health and Children, I am fully committed to doing everything in my power to protect children from abuse.  The programme for Government contains a number of key priorities on the improvement of services to children.  These include the mandatory reporting of child abuse and the review of all investigative, therapeutic and prevention services to protect children.  I assure the House these commitments will be honoured and legislation on mandatory reporting will be introduced during the lifetime of this Government.</P>
      <P>The Government had intended to deal with the subject matter of this Bill, the issue of immunity from civil liability in the context of comprehensive legislation on mandatory reporting. However, as Deputy Shatter has presented this Bill and there is general support in the House for any such measures to improve the reporting of child abuse, the Government is prepared to proceed separately with this matter.</P>
      <P>The Government accepts the principle of this Bill, which is to grant immunity from civil liability to any person who bona fide and with due care reports child abuse to an appropriate authority. However, in our view there are a number of problems with how the Bill is drafted to provide for what is a complex and specialised matter.  The Government is most anxious to co-operate in regard to Deputy Shatter's Bill to ensure the best legislative proposals are brought forward so that people will be encouraged to report child abuse. On this basis, the Government proposes to accept the Bill on Second Stage and to refer it in due course to the appropriate committee of the House to allow for revised drafting of those aspects of the Bill causing difficulties.  The Government wishes to see the maximum possible agreement in regard to the important issues covered by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the problems with the Bill as currently drafted.  In our view the definition of the abuse to be reported which will be covered by the proposed immunity is too broad.  Deputy Shatter proposes that the abuse covered by his Bill should be the same as the grounds in the Child Care Act, 1991, for a health board taking a child into care.  Those grounds are (a) where a child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused, or (b) where a child's health, development or welfare has been <Col N="920" /> or is being avoidably impaired or neglected, or (c) where a child's health, development or welfare is likely to be avoidably impaired or neglected.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the first and second grounds being included in a Bill granting immunity to those who report their belief that a child is being abused.  However, the third ground which would provide immunity for those who report in good faith that a child's health, development or welfare is likely to be avoidably impaired or neglected raises major problems.  For example, if the reporter considers there is a future risk to the child, he or she would be granted immunity under the Bill if the report was made in good faith.  That ignores the fact that in the case of a child being taken into care, the grounds set out in the Child Care Act must be professionally assessed by the staff of a health board and the case must be sufficiently robust to stand up in court before a judge trained to balance the rights of children, parents and public authorities under the Constitution and the legal system.  The Law Reform Commission was opposed to such an approach.  It did not consider that a suspicion that a child may at some future date be subjected to abuse should be included in any scheme of mandatory reporting or granting of immunity from civil liability.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is defined in Deputy Shatter's Bill as &ldquo;comprising the religious, moral, intellectual, physical, emotional and social welfare of the child.&rdquo; I am aware that this definition is similar to that used in the Guardianship of Infants Acts, but as used in this Bill it could encourage indiscriminate reporting.  For example, it is not difficult to imagine a case where a well-meaning person could take it upon himself or herself to be concerned with the religious or moral upbringing of a child.  That could be covered under the present terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, which was limited by its terms of reference to consider child sexual abuse only, indicated it would like its recommendations for mandatory reporting and granting immunity to those who report abuse, extended to include non-accidental injury, that is physical injury, to children.  It did not propose that reporting and immunity should extend to reports of perceived threats to the religious, moral, emotional or social welfare of the child, presumably because the term &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; under these headings is so difficult to define and may lie in the eye of the beholder.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's Bill would provide immunity to anyone who reports child abuse to an appropriate authority which his Bill defines as &ldquo;any statutory or non-statutory body concerned with the welfare and care of children&rdquo;.  I have no argument with Deputy Shatter that health boards and the Garda Síochána are &ldquo;appropriate authorities&rdquo; for the purposes of reporting child abuse. However, should the definition include any non-statutory body concerned with the welfare and care of children?  Such a definition could conceivably include every creche, boy scout or girl guide <Col N="921" /> troop or junior football team in the country.  Are such organisations appropriate bodies to deal with reports of child abuse?  Is it fair to expect small voluntary organisations to receive such reports?  What are they in turn to do with them? They do not have the expertise of health boards in this regard.  In the interests of ensuring a professional and consistent response to reports of child abuse, such reports, in our view, must be made to a statutory body such as the health boards or the Garda Síochána.  Even then, should the report not be made to a designated officer of a health board or a designated garda, who is trained in the handling of such reports and has sufficient regard to the confidential nature of the information received?</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's Bill provides immunity from civil liability for those who, acting reasonably and in good faith, report child abuse to an appropriate authority.  The Bill does not define the phrase &ldquo;acting reasonably and in good faith&rdquo;.  The Deputy departs from the wording recommended by the Law Reform Commission which proposed immunity for those who bona fide and with due care reported child abuse.  It seems that the phase &ldquo;with due care&rdquo; imposes a greater responsibility on the incautious reporter who, under Deputy Shatter's wording, might feel secure in reporting information which he or she may have been told by another person for malicious reasons.</P>
    <P>I can think of few more damaging accusations against anyone in our society than that he or she abused or abuses children.  Under the Constitution, a person is entitled to the protection of his or her good name.  Article 40.3.2 provides that: &ldquo;The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.&rdquo; The Supreme Court has held that the State has a duty under this Article, by its laws, to prevent the infringement of personal rights.  While it is obviously important to protect the child's constitutional rights, it is also important to protect the personal rights of the parent from unsubstantiated attack.  This Bill allows anyone &ldquo;reasonably and in good faith&rdquo; to report to any group &ldquo;concerned with the welfare and care of children&rdquo; an allegation of abuse or an allegation of likely abuse.  There are no criteria in the Bill to define an action which is taken &ldquo;reasonably and in good faith&rdquo;.  We have to assume that it will be up to the person making the report to decide what it means.  Thus, the Bill seeks to protect a person making a report who makes an allegation, using his or her own definition of reasonableness, to any group in the country concerned with the welfare and care of children and seeks to confer complete immunity on that person from any liability to the child, the parent or any other party for that matter.  What of the trauma suffered by the child's parents if an unfounded allegation is made against them?  What of the loss of the parents' good name?  I am not convinced that the Bill, as presently structured, strikes the right balance <Col N="922" /> between the need to protect those who report child abuse with due care and in good faith and the need to protect the good name of our citizens.</P>
    <P>We believe the immunity proposed is too wide. Deputy Shatter's Bill proposes not only that anyone who, acting reasonably and in good faith, should be under no civil liability for reporting but that no civil proceedings should be initiated against him or her.  On a technical point, I have been advised that the wording &ldquo;no civil proceedings shall be initiated&rdquo; should be replaced with &ldquo;it shall be a defence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that persons in employment who believe on reasonable grounds that a child is a victim of abuse or neglect cannot be dismissed from their employment as a result of reporting such belief.  It appears to be the Deputy's intention that all employees, not just employees of the health boards and members of the Garda Síochána, should be afforded this protection.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has responsibility for the administration of the unfair dismissals legislation, while sympathetic to the objective of this proposal would have some doubts as to its effectiveness in achieving its stated intention.</P>
    <P>At present, officers of a health board and members of the Garda Siochána are excluded from the coverage of the Unfair Dismissals Acts, such persons having access to their own disciplinary and grievance procedures.  The Bill proposes that such persons be brought within the coverage of the unfair dismissals legislation, specifically and solely for the purpose of their protection from dismissal in circumstances where they make reports of their belief that a child is the victim of abuse or neglect.</P>
    <P>This is a complicated and cumbersome approach to providing for the protection of persons finding themselves in such circumstances.  In addition, it is not comprehensive in that, even if proceeded with, it would only protect persons from direct dismissal.  It would not provide safeguards for persons who are not dismissed but who are otherwise victimised by an employer, for example, by being demoted, or by being ruled out of consideration for promotion etc.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, while being supportive of the idea in principle, would have reservations as to whether this proposal would operate effectively in practice.  They would want to examine the drafting in detail as well as considering whether there might not be alternative approaches better suited to achieve the objective sought.</P>
    <P>In his explanatory memorandum Deputy Shatter suggests that the Employment Equality Bill, 1997, should be amended to provide protection from discrimination for a person who believes on reasonable grounds that a child is a victim of abuse and reports this belief.</P>
    <P>That Bill which is currently before the Seanad, prohibits discrimination in employment on nine distinct grounds &mdash; sex, marital status, family <Col N="923" /> status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community. It is intended to proceed with enactment of the Bill to provide protection against discrimination on the nine grounds.  Any extension of the scope of the proposed legislation beyond those grounds at this point would give rise to an unacceptable delay in processing the Bill, which has been awaited by the interests concerned for some time.</P>
    <P>Section 6(4) of the Bill provides for review of its provisions after enactment and within a two year time period of its coming into operation.  The question of extending the scope of the Bill will be examined in this context, including, if it remains appropriate, protection from discrimination in employment for people who comply with future statutory obligations relating to mandatory reporting of child abuse.  If, when mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse is introduced, it places a statutory obligation on a person to report such instances to an appropriate authority, with a related statutory immunity and protection, it would appear superfluous to provide additional protection in employment equality legislation as suggested by Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <P>I will be bringing proposals to the appropriate committee of the House concerning amendments to the Bill.  However, I would like to make some preliminary comments which may be helpful.  The definition of what constitutes abuse is very important and this is one of the key issues to be teased out in preparing this legislation.  I will return to this point later.</P>
    <P>Another important issue is to whom people should report.  In my view, reporting should be to the statutory authorities &mdash; the health boards or the Garda.  The health boards have statutory responsibility for the protection of children under the Child Care Act.  They have the experience and expertise to deal with these sensitive reports and to make judgments on what action should be taken.  The current guidelines issued by my Department stipulate that all reports should be to a designated officer in each community care area. One obvious advantage of this approach is that very often a pattern may emerge where a number of people express concern about a particular family. The fact that the reports come to one central point facilitates the identification of such a pattern. There are strong policy arguments therefore for the centralisation of the receipt of reports.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress to the House the complexity of drafting legislation to introduce mandatory reporting of child abuse.  A detailed consultation process was carried out during 1996.  The discussion document contained 17 questions on key issues in considering whether or not to introduce mandatory reporting.  The question of granting immunity from civil liability was one of those questions.  The discussion document states:</P>
    <P>It can be argued that fear of legal proceedings operates as a disincentive to the reporting of suspicions of child abuse.  The purpose <Col N="924" /> of granting an immunity would be to encourage reporting by professionals.</P>
    <P>Over 200 submissions were received in response to the discussion document.  There was widespread support for granting an immunity to all professionals who reported abuse in good faith. The issue of extending this immunity to all persons and not confining it to those mandated to report was more contentious but again many submissions supported this measure.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the fact that 17 questions were posed in the discussion document on mandatory reporting.  The first and most crucial question is the definition of abuse.  I have already outlined the difficulties posed by Deputy Shatter's Bill in terms of the very broad definition of alleged child abuse.  In its consultation paper the Law Reform Commission referred to the fact that the phenomenon of over-reporting was associated particularly with expanded or over broad reporting laws.  It states:</P>
    <P>If mandated reporters are obliged to report potential as opposed to actual cases of abuse, or if the definition of abuse is vague or uncertain, professionals may seek to protect themselves and avoid prosecution or penalty by reporting every possible case of abuse, leaving it to the health board to distinguish between fact and fiction.  The answer may lie in ensuring that the definitions of reportable elements of abuse be as specific and as simple as possible.</P>
    <P>The general principles put forward by the Law Reform Commission are also relevant in this context. It states:</P>
    <P>The law should be specific enough to discourage over-reporting, whether by the overzealous or the defensive reporter; it should, on the other hand, be broad enough to facilitate identification of children who are genuinely at risk.  It should be based on a definition of child sexual abuse which lays down a minimum rather than an optimum standard of care towards children.  This derives from the need to recognise that methods of child care may properly vary between different families, and that the capacity of the child care services to respond to reported abuse is limited by finite resources.  Finally, a mandatory reporting law should be readily understood and easily applied.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that the Law Reform Commission's recommendation referred to immunity for persons reporting child sexual abuse only.  Other types of abuse, particularly emotional abuse and neglect, are far more difficult to define.  What would be the position concerning children begging?  Experts refer to the &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; of abuse, or in other words the stage at which it is considered necessary for the statutory child protection agencies to intervene.</P>
    <P>What would be the position concerning corporal punishment by parents?  The Irish College of General Practitioners in its submission gave <Col N="925" /> the example of a harassed mother with a crying, cranky child in a doctor's waiting room.  She slaps the child and he cries further.  The doctor sees this and knows that physical abuse has taken place. Would he be obliged to report this?</P>
    <P>Another difficult issue linked to the question of definitions is the position concerning reporting of underage sexual activity.  At present the age of consent to what may be termed lesser forms of sexual activity is 15 years and the age of consent to sexual intercourse is 17 years.  The discussion document asked whether all underage sexual activity should be subject to reporting.  Most submissions felt that subjecting consensual underage sexual activity between two young people to mandatory reporting would not be advantageous.</P>
    <P>However, the situation was seen to be different if there was a large age differential between the two people or if there could be seen to be any other abusive element to the activity.  Some organisations believed that all underage sexual activity should be reported and the issue of consent examined in each instance.  This is an issue which needs to be clarified so that people know the circumstances considered to constitute abuse.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recommended that all reports should be made to a designated officer, a director of community care, within each health board.  It considered it should also be open to a mandated reporter to submit his or her report to the Garda.  In the discussion document the question was raised whether there were circumstances in which reports might be made to other agencies, such as the Medical Council, An Bord Altranais or the Dental Council.</P>
    <P>As a further indication of the complex nature of child abuse, I refer to recent research findings on our child protection services.  The social studies department in University College Cork carried out research with the Mid-Western Health Board on how the Child Care Act, 1991, works in practice.  In a recent paper on this research Dr. Harry Ferguson looked at the balance between child protection work and family support and treatment oriented services.  He found evidence of a trend of a narrowing of social work services relating to child protection.  His study showed that information relating not just to child abuse but to a broad range of child care problems flows into social workers in the health boards.  Some 45 per cent of referrals in his study were categorised as child welfare type cases.  That is to say they did not involve allegations of immediate threats of harm to children in the sense of abuse by their caretakers or others.  Thus, these welfare matters relate to children not receiving adequate care, as opposed to adequate protection.  Very often they tend to concern issues of parenting style.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ferguson concludes that:</P>
    <P>There is a real tension within the system because of how community care social work has effectively been reconstituted to deal with child protection while at the same time teams are receiving information and accepting <Col N="926" /> referrals that apply to a broad range of adversities to children.</P>
    <P>Research by Ms Helen Buckley and others in the South-Eastern Health Board mirrors these findings. Findings from this study showed that clients referred to the South-Eastern Health Board's social work service are likely to be experiencing both financial and material pressures, as well as significant personal or family difficulties including mental health problems or problems with the management of their children.  This research showed that families who were referred for child abuse reasons were more likely to receive an ongoing supportive social work service than those referred for other reasons, even if those reasons impacted negatively on their children or their capacity to care for their children.  The research points to the desirability of a more holistic approach to the problems of families in need.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the objective of introducing immunity from prosecution is to encourage people to report child abuse.  In 1987 there were 1,646 reports of child abuse to health boards.  By 1996 this had increased to approximately 8,500 reports &mdash; an increase of more than 400 per cent.  There is no doubt this increase in the number of reports is linked to a greater awareness among both professionals and the general public of the existence of child abuse.  This growth in awareness has been due in no small measure to the many shocking cases of abuse coming before the courts.</P>
    <P>The Government is taking a broad approach to improving the reporting of child abuse.  I take this opportunity to outline a range of measures we are taking in this area.  Deputies will be aware that during 1996, following the publication of a discussion document on mandatory reporting, there was considerable debate and discussion on the issue.  This process included debate on other aspects of child protection services and was most useful in teasing out the principal pros and cons of the argument.</P>
    <P>A conference on the subject was held in September 1996 which was also helpful in terms of open constructive debate.  The contributions to the conference reflected the broad range of opinion from organisations as diverse as large statutory and professional organisations to individuals with particular viewpoints.  It was agreed by all that further development of our child care services was required to ensure that children and professionals can report abuse in the knowledge that appropriate investigation, treatment and support services are available to the victims.</P>
    <P>In response to the views expressed by a large majority of child care professionals and others who participated in the consultative process, the previous Administration decided on a series of initiatives to best promote and protect the rights of children and a commitment was given to evaluate their impact over a three year period.  This Government has reiterated its commitment, outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium, <Col N="927" /> to introduce mandatory reporting during the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>This is a complex sensitive area where we will proceed with due care and caution.  As I have previously told the House, we will implement and build on the worthwhile initiatives which arose from the previous consultative process.  I will outline these developments and the progress made in implementing them for the information of the House.  First, my Department has agreed with the regional health boards that designated officers, to be known as child care managers, be appointed in each community care area to co-ordinate inter-agency approaches to child protection and to manage services for children in that area.  Funding for half of these posts was provided last year and I have provided further funding in 1998 to complete this process.  This fulfils one of the main recommendations of the Kelly Fitzgerald report. These managers will play a pivotal role in strengthening and developing our child care and family support services in the future.  Second, my Department has requested health boards to arrange for the establishment of regional and local child protection committees which will co-ordinate policy developments, review procedures and monitor inter-agency and inter-professional responses to child care issues.  They will also serve to enhance working relationships between social workers, gardaí, the probation service, medical practitioners, nursing staff and other relevant professionals who have a common aim to protect children.  Third, health boards are also expanding multi-disciplinary training.  This has also been identified as a useful means of increasing inter-agency and inter-professional approaches to child protection.  Additional funding was approved in 1997 towards the expansion of this form of training. Fourth, it had initially been suggested that the review of the 1987 and 1995 child abuse guidelines would be a matter for the Social Services Inspectorate.  However, I have decided to establish a working group to address this issue now.  I will make an announcement shortly regarding the terms of reference and membership of the group.  The working group will be representative of all the key statutory and voluntary agencies and will have an independent chairperson. Fifth, the previous Government had proposed a public information campaign to heighten awareness of child abuse.  I have allocated £100,000 to the Children's Rights Alliance in 1998 as a contribution towards the cost of an awareness campaign on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Sixth, the provision of support services by health boards for the victims of past abuse has been assisted by the provision of £100,000 in 1997. Seventh, the Department of Health and Children has asked health boards to ensure that funding to voluntary agencies dealing with children is conditional on those agencies having procedures in place to deal with allegations of child abuse.  I am informed that most voluntary agencies with responsibility for children in the health area have <Col N="928" /> well developed procedures in place and work closely with health boards when such allegations arise.</P>
    <P>This is an area about which we cannot be too careful and it is relevant to all voluntary agencies working with children.  My colleague the Minister, Deputy McDaid, is stepping up efforts to ensure effective procedures for dealing with allegations of child abuse are in place in all sports clubs.  I would like to support his call for clubs and sports organisations to ensure that proper attention is given to the care and security of children involved in their sports.  These organisations should offer a safe positive and encouraging atmosphere for their young members.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has a major role to play in educating children about the danger of abuse and how to protect themselves. I am conscious of the major strides in promoting awareness which have been made as a result of the introduction of the Stay Safe Programme. The Department of Education and Science, in conjunction with the Department of Health and the regional health boards, has introduced the Stay Safe Programme into primary schools.  Its aim is to prevent child abuse by equipping parents and teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect the children in their care.  Children are taught safety skills in the normal classroom context and these skills are reinforced through discussion with their parents. This programme has the support of all the main interests in education and most especially managerial bodies, teachers and parents.  This level of satisfaction with the programme is reflected by the fact that 80 per cent of schools have implemented the programme.  There is a nation-wide network of part-time teachers who are targeting schools that are currently not teaching the programme.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Stay Safe Programme material has been updated in line with the guidelines of the National Council for Curriculum Assessment on social personal and health education.  The introduction of the updated Stay Safe pack to primary schools throughout the country will take place during this school term.  Arrangements are also being made for the development of further teaching materials on the theme of personal safety skills for children with learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>A working party has been established by the Department of Education and Science, representative of all the interests in primary education, to examine the procedures for dealing with suspected cases of child abuse.  My Department and the health boards are represented on this working party.</P>
    <P>The brief of the working party is comprehensive and is worth outlining to the House.  It is to review existing guidelines in light of experience, particularly as they relate to disclosures to teachers and to revise them as necessary; to consider the particular mechanisms needed to cope with any allegations against school personnel; to explore the mechanisms that would ensure <Col N="929" /> offenders are not re-employed in schools; and to produce new guidelines for dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse which concern school employees and personnel.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the motives of Deputy Shatter in bringing this Bill before the House.  It is important to have maximum co-operation to ensure that we have the best possible legislation on this issue.  I am confident the approach the Government proposes, involving consideration by a Committee of the House, will ensure this is achieved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I commend Deputy Shatter for introducing it.  It is a comprehensive Bill which seeks to address one aspect of an issue which is causing grief and heartache in our society.  In common with the rest of society, Members of this House have been shocked and disgusted at the revelations over recent years of physical and sexual abuse of a considerable number of children.  We have been disgusted by the horrific details of cases which have come before the courts and been reported in the media.  We have been shocked by the prevalence of abuse that has become clear over recent years.</P>
      <P>I express my deep admiration of and gratitude to those victims of abuse who have had the courage and strength to speak out against their abusers. They have shown enormous bravery and their actions have led to the conviction and imprisonment of evil and pernicious individuals. Their actions have also brought the issue of child abuse to the forefront of public consciousness. Many of these victims have spoken out in the face of enormous personal and social pressures.  Often they have to do so in an adversarial court situation which is not equipped to deal with the myriad of emotional and psychological implications of sexual abuse.  Thanks to the actions of these victims, child sexual abuse is now at the forefront of the political agenda where I hope it stays until the matter is dealt with adequately.</P>
      <P>Political answers need to be provided to the problems which have come to the fore in recent years.  This Bill is an important part of that process. As an Opposition Bill, it seeks to implement the recommendations in the 1990 Law Reform Commission report on child sexual abuse, the recommendations repeatedly brought to the attention of policy makers in the 1993 Kilkenny incest investigation report and those made by the committee of inquiry into the death of Kelly Fitzgerald. It also seeks to fill the legislative vacuum which undoubtedly exists at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before coming into office, the Government parties were in favour of the mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse.  They went before the electorate with this as one of their core policy commitments <Col N="930" /> and promised to introduce it.  They portrayed this as a straightforward and simple issue and sought support on the basis of promises to provide quick fix solutions.  However, when they attained office, the complexity of the issue soon dawned on them.  They realised that a more considered approach was necessary and that there were considerable funding implications to be considered.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides comprehensive legislative reform.  It is important to ensure that people who have reason to suspect that children are being abused report their concerns to the appropriate authority.  It is traumatic for an individual who suspects or realises that abuse is taking place.  It is imperative, therefore, that people can report their concerns in the full knowledge that they will be immune from legal action after they make their report.</P>
    <P>This Bill will have two meaningful and constructive effects.  It will protect people who report alleged abuse or ill-treatment from legal action and it will send a clear and definitive message to the public that we are serious about protecting our children from the perpetrators of evil and damaging acts.  We need to create a culture in our society where the safety and protection of children is of paramount concern and where citizens feel safe if they report their fears and concerns to the appropriate authority.  This Bill will create such a culture of openness.</P>
    <P>Child abuse is no longer a taboo subject among the public.  People are deeply concerned about the issue and want the State, the health boards and other agencies to implement policies to protect children and convict those who are guilty of these horrific crimes.  This Bill will assist in that process.  However, it is important to note that it will provide no protection for those who maliciously make false allegations of abuse.  Many Members have encountered individuals against whom false and damaging accusations of abuse have been made by persons who wished to inflict damage on their personal or professional lives. Individuals, who are the victims of such malicious allegations, are plunged into a nightmare which can impinge on every aspect of their lives.  This Bill will afford no protection in law to individuals who make such claims in bad faith.  This Bill has managed to strike a careful balance.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Bill seeks to confer immunity on people who report suspected abuse to the appropriate authority.  According to the Bill, the appropriate authority will be a statutory or non-statutory body.  I would prefer if it was restricted to a statutory body which understands how the law works and would be in a position to report such abuse if necessary.  I am concerned about the number of different people to whom such abuse may be reported.  There could be difficulties attached to conferring such immunity on people who report suspected abuse to non-statutory bodies.  I hope that will be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the Department of Health and Children realises the extra workload <Col N="931" /> which the passage of this Bill and the culture of openness it seeks to create will place on the child care services in the community.  I am not suggesting that should stop people from reporting child abuse because we all have a duty to work towards an open culture which has been sadly lacking for many years.  However, we must do so in the full knowledge that there are significant cost implications involved.  The Minister mentioned the need for us all in this House to recognise that and to give the necessary priority to spending in this important area.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress was made during the lifetime of the last Government in implementing the Child Care Act and providing extra resources for child care workers and other support services. This initiative must continue and we must also ensure that our commitment to tackling child abuse remains a priority.  The Labour Party has always made the argument that we must invest in services such as child care if we want to create an equal and just society in which families and people can thrive and where the instruments of the State will protect them if they are violated in any way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comments made by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, during Question Time last week about child care and child abuse.  It is important that we quantify the current demand and provide the resources necessary to meet it.</P>
    <P>In the event that the Government accepts this Bill it is likely that the volume of reports to health boards of alleged abuse and mistreatment will increase significantly.  The strain that this will place on our services as they currently exist will be considerable.  At the moment there is severe strain on resources and personnel.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has come to understand and appreciate this problem and is starting to take the necessary steps to analyse our current level of service provision and to seek funding from the Minister for Finance to augment and improve the services available to children in danger.  He can be assured of support from this side of the House in doing that.</P>
    <P>It is possible to take a cynical view of the lead-in time to introducing mandatory reporting.  Cost implications could be used as an excuse for long-fingering its introduction, but I am not accusing the Minister of that.  He is making genuine efforts to come to grips with this considerable problem and to put in place a coherent plan to tackle it and lead us to a point where we will be able to introduce mandatory reporting.  Deputy Shatter and I will be interested to hear reports of progress made in that area from time to time.  It would certainly be our duty to question what progress is being made and to ensure that this item does not slip off the agenda.  It is Deputy Fahey's duty as Minister and our duty as Opposition Deputies to keep working at this until such time as the services are adequate.  It is imperative that everybody in this House and people outside the House <Col N="932" /> who have an interest in the welfare and protection of children ensure that this issue is given priority and the necessary funding.  We have a responsibility to ensure that child protection is a priority issue for this and all future administrations. We have a duty to support Ministers who are making serious and diligent efforts to legislate and to provide funding for child support, and we have a duty to castigate those who fail to do so.  The children of this country deserve nothing less.  Equally, we have a duty to support Opposition politicians who make serious and diligent efforts to legislate for this area.  This Bill from Deputy Shatter is a genuine attempt to assist in that process.  Minister Fahey is treating the issue in a serious and diligent way.  His job would be made easier if the Progressive Democrats were not snapping at his heels every step of the way.</P>
    <P>There are clearly no easy or quick solutions to the ill-treatment of children.  We have in place a framework that seeks to support victims of abuse. Legislative reforms need to be introduced to augment our current body of law and this Bill is an important step in that direction.  However, legislation alone will be of no use to families where the horror of child abuse occurs unless resources are targeted at improving our current level of responsible support.  The Minister is aware of what could be described as a close to crisis situation which obtains in the Eastern Health Board area.  I have heard of health board social workers literally having to prioritise cases of suspected child abuse.  Many cases that I would regard as significant and urgent are not necessarily regarded as such by health boards.  I have come across many cases of people being put on a waiting list for two or three months until a social worker can be allocated to them.</P>
    <P>The area of personnel dealing with reported child abuse needs urgent attention because many social workers working in health board areas where the problem is most acute are under severe stress and have extremely heavy workloads. There is proof of that in the difficulty health boards, particularly the Eastern Health Board, have in recruiting and retaining staff in the services. In one area of Dublin City where there are significant child care problems a reasonable service is provided at the beginning of the year, which is in September, because the social worker posts are filled and people are seen reasonably quickly.  However, come January or February, social workers have moved on because they cannot stand the pressure of the job any longer.  In addition the many other services we are developing are trying to attract social workers to jobs which are less stressful and which often pay more money.  Social workers leave to take up these jobs and the services are left understaffed, with all the implications that has in the context of child welfare.  Urgent action is needed in this area.  I am concerned that we are not training sufficient numbers of social workers and general health staff to work in this area, in the probation <Col N="933" /> and welfare services and in the many new services which are being developed.  The fact that social workers are leaving the services compounds the problem because the workload is increased for the people who remain.  It is quite unsatisfactory and I am seriously concerned about the situation in a number of community care areas in the Eastern Health Board region.</P>
    <P>For many years we ignored the growing problems in the area of child welfare.  This Government, like the last Government and its predecessor, has been engaging in a process of catching up, trying to put in place much needed services which were not provided in the past when they should have been.  Now we have problems which are close to being out of control.  In the process of catching up we are discovering increased demands in the various areas which we are not capable of meeting.  We have to start providing important new services and the significant resources that are required, but I am seriously concerned that very little in terms of resources and staffing is going into family support services when there are so many cases where early intervention would have made a huge difference.  Neglect is a huge and often unrecognised problem and in this context there is a need for adequate supports for parents.  We are doing very little in that area and ending up with very serious problems at a later stage.  There is a concentration on the fire brigade type of service, and we are not doing enough in the area of prevention.  I will return to some of those issues later.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement tonight in relation to the establishment of a working group to review the current guidelines.  In relation to the Bill, I hope Members of this House will work constructively together to ensure that appropriate legislation and resources are provided for our voluntary and statutory agencies who deal with child abuse on a daily basis.  This Bill forms a very important part of this process. It can be difficult for a Government to accept Opposition legislation, but we did so when Fianna Fáil was in Opposition, and this is a genuine attempt to deal with an aspect of an issue which is of concern to us all.  I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Closure of Cork Textile Company.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to investigate the circumstances surrounding the sudden closure of Millfield Textiles in Cork with the loss of more than 100 jobs, the accumulated debt to the Revenue Commissioners of approximately £700,000 and the failure of the company to meet its legal obligations to the workers who lost their jobs with the resultant cost to the State in paying those liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> I sympathise with the workers in Millfield Textiles who have lost their jobs in such tragic circumstances. The unusual aspect of this case is that the workers were only given between two and three hours notice that the company, which employed more than 100 people in an area of high unemployment, was closing down.  It was subsequently revealed that the company owed approximately £700,000 to the Revenue Commissioners. The money due to the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs was deducted from employees' wages every week but was not handed over to the State.  I question this type of white collar crime.  If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or I deducted payments from an employee and did not hand them over to the intended source we would be treated as criminals.  The circumstances surrounding this case must be investigated by the Department as they are happening all too often. As the company did not pay its employees' entitlements to the Revenue Commissioners, the State has had to pick up the tab.  I am glad the Tánaiste indicated at a recent meeting that the payments to workers would be made as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>These well trained and highly motivated workers have been treated in a shabby manner by the company.  Why was the company allowed to accumulate liabilities of more than £700,000? The Minister must appoint an inspector to examine the accounts of this company and related companies.  Forbairt made a number of investments in the company, but we have been told that a related company owned most of the plant and the site on which it was located.  The Minister must appoint an inspector who will discuss these issues with the liquidator and examine how the taxpayer has been left to pay this hefty liability. The accounts of the company must be examined in detail and the related companies must also be investigated.  If a similar case arose in another sector the people involved would be treated differently. There seems to be double standards in this case.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the workers receive their legal entitlements as quickly as possible and that the rights of the taxpayers and the State are protected.  I wish to share my time with my constituency colleague, Deputy O'Flynn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Allen for sharing his time with me and support the points made by him.  I was shocked to hear about the closure of this company and the short notice given to the workers.  At meetings I raised questions about the outstanding moneys owed by the company to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is difficult to understand how the Revenue Commissioners allowed the company to accumulate a debt of £700,000 in unpaid taxes and unpaid PAYE receipts which had been taken from employees.  No other businessman or businesswoman would be allowed to owe the Revenue Commissioners so much money.  I support Deputy Allen's calls for a full <Col N="935" /> investigation after the statement of affairs has been produced by the liquidator.</P>
      <P>Other questions arise in regard to grants given to the company in l995 by the previous Minister. This money which was supposed to be used to restart the company has been spent.  Questions arise as to how the money was spent, whether it was used properly and whether there was any misappropriation of funds.  These may sound like serious charges but there is considerable public disquiet in Cork about this saga.  I hope these questions are answered quickly.</P>

      <P>I concur with the Deputies' comments and will have them further analysed by the Department.</P>
      <P>At a meeting with a delegation comprising public representatives and SIPTU representatives from Millfield Textiles Limited on Wednesday, 28 January the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment expressed her regret at the announcement that the company was to close. She also expressed her disappointment at the swiftness of the closure announcement and the manner in which many of the employees became aware of the company's decision.  She said she would have further discussions with ICTU about this general issue in the future.</P>
      <P>On Friday, 16 January Millfield Textiles announced that, as it had not been able to achieve the necessary viability to stay in business, it was left with no alternative but to close.  The company also announced that approximately £750,000 had been invested since it was formed in July 1995 following the acquisition of the assets of the former Sunbeam operation.  The company acknowledged the role of the State agency Forbairt with which it had worked closely and which had been very supportive of its development efforts.  The promoters had recently undertaken an extensive reassessment of the business, aimed at achieving additional sales over a three year period.  Forbairt had indicated its agreement to support the company provided a viable option could be devised for its future operation.  However, given the extent of its difficulties, the company was not in a position to avail of the support on offer from Forbairt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately following the announcement by the company to close the Millfield Textiles operation, the Tánaiste instructed Forbairt to co-ordinate the activities of the relevant State agencies in finding suitable alternative employment for the workers.  FÁS is giving priority to the assessment of the skills of the workers with a view to identifying suitable training courses and has targeted clothing companies in the area to find alternative employment.  Forbairt has also made similar approaches to a number of industries in the Cork area.  This has already resulted in a number of workers being offered jobs in clothing and electronics companies.  Millfield Textiles' representatives have expressed their appreciation of the <Col N="936" /> speed with which the State agencies responded to the closure.</P>
    <P>On the question of the debt to the Revenue Commissioners, the Deputy will appreciate that any investigation of this nature is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  A meeting took place today with a view to appointing a liquidator who has certain responsibilities in the context of winding-up a company.  This includes following up allegations and possible breaches of statutory legislation.  Any information affecting this liquidation should immediately be brought to the attention of the liquidator.</P>
    <P>As agreed during the meeting with the representatives of Millfield Textiles, all statutory redundancy entitlements will be paid without delay from the social insurance fund.  I have been informed that all the forms for these statutory entitlements have been completed and are being sent to the redundancy payments section of the Department for immediate processing.  I expect that all payments will issue direct to the workers within three to four weeks.  The appropriate 40 per cent of the total amount paid will be sought from the liquidator by the Department's redundancy recovery section in due course.</P>
    <P>I thank both Deputies for their interest, profound sincerity and commitment to representing the difficulties the workers have encountered as a result of this drastic and sudden closure.  I express my personal sympathy to the workers and the people of the area where the company is located.  I will take the Deputies' grievances to the Tánaiste and the relevant officials in the Department.  We will be speedy and compassionate in the decisions at which we arrive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme is designed to provide farmers with an incentive to farm in accordance with environmental protection and conservation measures.  It is a five year scheme whereby part-time or full-time farmers enter into a contract with the Department of Agriculture and Food and certain measures are implemented which are directed towards controlling nitrogen use and stocking rate, controlling effluent and waste around the farmyard and protecting the water quality, hedges and features of archaeological or historical importance on the farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum amount of land for qualification is three hectares and payments are made on lands up to a limit of 100 acres.  Where a farm exceeds 100 acres the measures specified in the plan must be complied with on the entire farm area.  Certain areas are not included for payment under the scheme, among which are commercial forestry and set-aside lands.  I am concerned, however, with two specific areas that are not included, one of which is land held in fee simple subject to turbary or grazing rights.  Under the Land Acts, 1870 to 1939, the transfer to the former tenants of lands in mountain areas was dealt with in two <Col N="937" /> different ways.  On the one hand the fee simple of the enclosed land was transferred to the tenants as individuals and the appurtenant mountain grazing land was transferred to the common ownership of the tenants in fee simple.  That was generally the case, and such land qualifies for inclusion under the REPS.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, while the fee simple of the enclosed land was transferred to the tenant farmers as individuals, the fee simple of the appurtenant grazing rights on the mountain lands was retained by the landlord.  That was usually the case in Wicklow.  The enclosed lands were registered in the Land Registry.  In most cases, however, the appurtenant grazing rights were not mentioned on individual folios.  Those grazing rights are not, therefore, recognised by the Department of Agriculture and Food for the purpose of REPS payments.  That problem affects approximately 300 farmers in the Dublin-Wicklow mountains and is partly responsible for the slow uptake of REPS in County Wicklow as the State, based on a historical procedure, refuses to recognise those grazing rights when determining entitlement to REPS payments.</P>
    <P>To ensure an uptake of REPS in Wicklow and in view of the fact that much of the land is proposed for SAC and NHA designation, I request the Minister to have such grazing rights included in qualification for the scheme.  There is another group of farmers in County Wicklow who traditionally have had grazing on lands belonging to the Defence Forces, Coillte and some private estates.  They are not recognised by the Department of Agriculture and Food for inclusion in the scheme.  I request that the Minister address that problem.  The purpose of the REP scheme is to protect the countryside, and the inclusion of the two groups to which I have referred would greatly enhance this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to deal with this Adjournment debate on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Since this is the first opportunity I have had to do so, I wish Deputy Timmins a long association with this House.  I know his father very well and have had close connections with the Timmins family over a long period.</P>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash; is a highly important scheme.  More than 31,000 farmers participate in the scheme.  In order to be eligible for the scheme applicants must have a five year agri-environmental plan drawn up for the farm by an approved planning agency.  In addition, they must be farming at least three hectares owned or leased or at least one hectare in the case of smallscale organic fruit or vegetable producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are more than 300 farmers participating in REPS in County Wicklow, with payments totalling £2.2 million to date.  I understand, however, that a significant number of farmers in the county wish to join REPS but have land on which they are exercising grazing rights which are not registered. <Col N="938" /> Grazing rights allow farmers access for grazing on land not owned by them.  In general terms, lands of this nature are eligible for REPS payments subject to the following conditions: the land is registered in the applicant's name; copies of the land documentation submitted with an applicant's area aid application is enclosed; the grazing rights can be converted into an area entitlement; documentary evidence of farming in the year prior to application can be provided; the application is accompanied by a sworn affidavit stating the number of folios together with a map signed by the applicant and listing all claimants to the area, outlining the boundaries of same and leased grazing rights are not eligible for REPS.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with farmers in Roundwood, County Wicklow, on 20 January 1998 officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food agreed to review these rules with a view to determining whether grazing rights which are vested in the Land Commission or those listed on county council rates documentation can be included for REPS payment.  This review is ongoing and an announcement will be made on the outcome in the near future.  Our approach to this scheme is to be balanced and fair and to have reasonable rules but at the same time to protect the interests of the European taxpayer and ensure the purpose and spirit of the scheme is protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance is present to listen to this demand from thousands of building workers and their families. The C45 system of tax collection for subcontractor employment in the construction industry should be ended in the forthcoming Finance Bill. At present building workers on Crampton building sites around the city who have fought hard against the injustice and unfairness of the system have had interlocutory injunctions taken out against them, have been photographed on building sites, have been harassed and are facing the prospect of jail.  Despite the country's prosperity, it is impossible for many building workers to get direct employment in the city.</P>
      <P>For many years serious allegations of abuses of the tax and social welfare codes have been made against employers and subcontractors who use the C45 system.  More than 250,000 C45 forms were issued in 1997 for about 100,000 building workers.  Many commentators and distinguished financial journalists pointed out discrepancies in the issue of the forms taking into account the numbers of unemployed in the construction industry.  The C45 system is a godsend to employers who wish to operate in the black economy and evade paying tax and social insurance. There is also the prospect of massive loss to the Exchequer as a result of abuses in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are disturbing allegations of the use of workers from Northern Ireland to facilitate the abuse of the social welfare system.  The mass of <Col N="939" /> carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers and their assistants wish to return to the PAYE and social insurance system.  With the C45 system there is no provision for sickness, holidays, unemployment, retirement or pensions.  Because of the iniquitous C45 system, the taxpayer must carry the can for those employers and provide for construction workers.  In the long period of Tory rule in the UK the Conservative Government realised its system was a total disaster which facilitated the black economy and it abolished it.  Even Mr. Major regarded such an approach as unfair and unjust.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, a growing number of Irish builders, such as Rohan Holdings Limited and John Sisk and Sons Limited have returned to the PAYE system for their trades persons in recent years. However, the Crampton organisation, which is our biggest builder, has refused to negotiate with workers representatives in BATU and OPATS and have successfully sought injunctions to have workers sent to gaol.</P>
    <P>There have been remarkable allegations.  One document relates to a dispute on a £30 million Smurfit development using one of the oldest and biggest builders in Dublin.  The bricklayers were employed by &ldquo;Mickey&rdquo;, a 19 year old who went by no other name, who told them there would be no deductions for tax or PRSI, just cash in hand. When the workers disagreed with this illegal proposition, they were sacked on the spot.  All those workers wanted was the right to work legally and pay tax like other workers.</P>
    <P>We also had the unedifying spectacle of the national media being intimidated by rogue employers in this industry.  The <i>Sunday Business Post</i>, for example, has also been prevented by injunction from photographing Crampton sites and there have been restrictions placed on RTÉ. Yet serious allegations of false identities, the 19 year old subcontractor and promises of cash in hand, have been made about these sites.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of health and safety.  The Minister will remember the Taoiseach reacted vigorously to the death of a building worker in this city a few weeks ago.  We brought to his attention and that of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, that there have been 41 fatalities in this industry in three years.  Many people believe the root cause of the problems with health and safety on sites is the illegal nature of the work practices there.  This is a huge issue to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Cathal MacDomhnaill, to investigate these serious allegations immediately.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks there have been disgraceful allegations about offshore money and rampant £100 million tax evasion funds, yet down through the years there have been serious allegations <Col N="940" /> about this industry.  The Minister for Finance is the Minister responsible for this; he is the one in the hot seat.  In the coming Finance Bill, I urge Minister McCreevy, who I know to be a fair politician, to abolish the C45 system for bricklayers, plasterers and carpenters and their assistants, for the trades which go on to a site and only offer the service of their labour, because there does not seem to be any logical basis for it other than to defraud the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be useful in responding to the Deputy's request to give a resumé of the system of tax collection as it has developed in the construction industry over the past 20 years or so.</P>
      <P>Persons employed in that industry are classified for tax purposes either as employees or subcontractors, and tax is deducted from each group on a different basis.  Subcontracting itself is, of course, an integral part of the construction industry. Payments to subcontractors come within the relevant contracts tax system commonly referred to as the C2 or C45 system.  Under this system, where a principal contractor makes a payment to an unregistered contractor, he or she is required to deduct relevant contracts tax from those payments at the rate of 35 per cent.</P>
      <P>The RCT system was introduced in the 1970s to counter the growing incidence of black economy activity in the construction industry.  Workers operating under the system known as &ldquo;the lump&rdquo; were being paid without tax being deducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is still going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This happened because the workers in question &mdash; mainly groups of tradesmen &mdash; were not employees of the main contractor making the payments and, accordingly, were not in the PAYE system.  Under RCT tax is deducted at the rate of 35 per cent from relevant payments except where the subcontractor has produced a certificate of authorisation &mdash; C2 &mdash; to the principal contractor and the principal contractor has received a relevant payments card &mdash; C47 &mdash; from the inspector of taxes authorising him to make payments without deducting tax.  To get a C2, a subcontractor must operate from a fixed place of business in the State and, for a period of at least three years prior to the issue of the C2, must have fully complied with all his/her taxation and reporting obligations under the tax code.  The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that RCT continues to play a vital role in combating tax evasion in the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the forms of evasion to which the Deputy may be referring arises where an individual is working and also claiming social welfare benefits.  To combat this type of evasion Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regularly conduct joint investigations under the joint investigation programme to ensure that those engaged as employees fully <Col N="941" /> comply with the tax system and to ensure that employers are not facilitating &ldquo;working and signing&rdquo; arrangements.</P>
    <P>Following a comprehensive review in 1995 and 1996 Revenue issued guidelines to the industry setting out the criteria under which a person may be regarded as an employee as distinct from a subcontractor.  Principal contractors and subcontractors creating self-employment contractual arrangements must sign a joint declaration to the effect that these guidelines have been considered by them and they are both satisfied that the contract created is a contract of self-employment.</P>
    <P>This joint declaration was introduced in line with a recommendation of a subcommittee of the black economy monitoring group which looked at the construction industry.  It is of interest at this stage to list the current membership of that group.  Its members are drawn from IBEC, the CIF, ICTU and the SFA as well as the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Both parties to the joint declaration certify that they have considered the guidelines issued by the Revenue Commissioners as to the difference between contracts of service &mdash; employment contracts &mdash; and contracts for services &mdash; self-employment &mdash; and are satisfied that the contract which they are about to enter is a contract for services.</P>
      <P>RCT applies only to payments to self-employed subcontractors.  PAYE applies to payments by an employer to employees.  The application of the RCT regime to genuine employees would deprive such individuals of social welfare benefits to which they are entitled.  It would also mean a loss in PAYE, PRSI and levies.  Some employers may consider that, by operating the RCT system, the nature of the payments is changed from wages to payments to self-employed subcontractors.  Of course, this is a mistaken view.  Even where a joint declaration has been completed, the question as to whether the contract is one of self-employment or of employment will depend on the nature of the facts of the case.</P>
      <P>Where the relationship between a builder and a person to whom he or she makes payments is that of employer/employee, the builder is liable for the PAYE, PRSI and levies which should have been deducted from those payments, even where the parties have completed the joint declaration &mdash; form RCT1 &mdash; and the builder has deducted RCT from the payments and issued a C45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revenue has advised me that it is currently engaged in a nationwide campaign to ensure that declarations made by principal contractors and subcontractors represent the true situation. Where an employment is considered to exist and PAYE/PRSI and levies are not being deducted, the principal is being advised to put matters on a <Col N="942" /> proper footing.  Where this is not done, the principal will become liable for the PAYE/PRSI and levies.  Each principal classified by Revenue as an employer can have that decision reviewed internally in Revenue and has a statutory right of appeal to the Appeals Commissioners.</P>

      <P>No. We must wait until the Labour Party is back in Government to have another amnesty.</P>
      <P>In its ongoing drive to identify the correct basis of deduction of tax in respect of each individual, Revenue is happy to receive information from other organisations or individuals.  In this context, for example, facilities have been made available to trade union representatives to report any cases where they consider that PAYE should have applied instead of RCT.</P>
      <P>Revenue has received a number of representations about the growth in self-employment in the industry.  There is a strongly held view that a great number of persons in the construction industry who supply labour only services, and who are currently being treated as self-employed by principal contractors, should be reclassified as employees.  There have also been campaigns on certain construction sites to ensure that employers take on people as employees rather than as self-employed subcontractors where such people are more correctly classified as employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did too. This is the background against which the nationwide compliance campaign is being mounted.  The Revenue Commissioners are determined that the prescribed RCT procedures will be complied with.  However, Revenue cannot dictate the terms under which workers are engaged in any industry.  RCT is in place to ensure that subcontractors in the construction industry do not escape their tax liabilities.  While the increasing incidence of the RCT may mirror a drift to self-employment within the industry, it is not the cause of the drift.  It mirrors the worldwide trend towards contracting out and reflects the increased flexibility of work practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In this regard it is worth bearing in mind that, of the total estimated numbers at present employed in the construction industry, approximately 35,000 are employees compared to <Col N="943" /> an estimated 21,000 certified subcontractors and 12,500 uncertified subcontractors.  It remains the case, therefore, that, notwithstanding the drift to self-employment, the majority of persons employed in the construction industry continue to be taxed under the PAYE system.</P>
      <P>The Revenue campaign to investigate possible abuses started in the Dublin area last November. Areas outside Dublin are being included in the campaign.  Some staff have been moved from other duties to accommodate the campaign.  It is intended that all principal contractors will be visited.  The first phase, which consists of visiting the principal contractors and advising them of Revenue's view on the correct treatment of payments being made by them, is expected to take up to six months.  Phase 2 will involve monitoring the response of principal contractors to the earlier visit and follow-up action, for example, entering assessments on the principal contractor.  Early indications are that the compliance campaign started in November will be effective in regularising the employment status of individuals in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>To end RCT for certain trades in the construction industry would mean that no system of tax deduction would operate in relation to self-employed subcontractors in those trades.  The Revenue Commissioners consider the abolition of the RCT system would lead to an increase in black economy activity within the construction industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise, I thought my matter was due to be called later.  I wish to place on record my concern about the developing situation at the Chernobyl reactor site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that, in the aftermath of what was probably the world's greatest environmental disaster, given the tragic effect on the lives of those living in the catchment area of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, the international community came to the rescue to the best of its ability.  Excellent work is being undertaken at international level to assist those who were affected or are likely to suffer in the future.  However, concerns <Col N="944" /> have emerged from the region in light of the international community's and the local authorities' recognition of what needs to be done to make the nuclear station safe.  A substantial outlay has been projected as being necessary to carry out construction safety work on the site.  Unfortunately, with the exception of Ireland and a number of other countries, the financial commitment to meet this responsibility has been less than forthcoming, particularly from some of the larger nations.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to use her offices, particularly during the British Presidency of the European Union, to ensure that the necessary resources and technical construction support are forthcoming from the EU.  This will ensure that there will be no risk of a major disaster at this nuclear power plant in the future.  Those attempting to provide assistance to people living near Chernobyl have reported that the progress of the construction safety work is less than productive and is falling behind schedule.  As a result, greater risks have arisen in respect of the contents of this deteriorating nuclear power station.  There is a need for a concerted effort by the international community to provide the resources which were projected as being necessary to make the station safe and avoid what could be another major international environmental disaster.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware that, in light of prevailing winds, etc., radioactive materials which escape into the atmosphere do not recognise national or international boundaries.  Repeated problems have occurred at Sellafield, which is considered one of the best managed nuclear sites.  That was not the case in the former Soviet Union.  Taking account of the engineering standards, the level of investment, the controls systems, the lack of sophistication and safety procedures and the technical aspects involved, the Chernobyl project never reached a standard which justified the type of risk that can arise from a nuclear power station of this kind.</P>
    <P>This matter is of major international concern. Commitments were given by the international community which do not appear to have been honoured in certain cases.  I ask that this House and the Minister for Foreign Affairs endeavour to reinvigorate the efforts of the international community and ensure that the necessary resources are made available to ensure that another environmental disaster does not occur at Chernobyl.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Lawlor for raising this important matter with which I was directly involved in December last when I approved funding for the project from my international co-operation budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is well known, on 26 April 1986 an explosion ripped apart the fourth reactor unit at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukraine, giving rise to human tragedy, economic hardship and environmental challenges on an <Col N="945" /> unprecedented scale.  The disaster had consequences far beyond the immediate contamination of the surrounding region and it provided graphic and alarming evidence, if such were needed, that harmful radiological exposure respects no regional or national boundaries.  The consequences of the explosion for the health of the people of Chernobyl, those further afield and the environment in the immediate area, in neighbouring countries and in many parts of Western Europe, have been extremely serious.  The suffering of the people of Chernobyl &mdash; adults and children &mdash; has touched everyone, including Irish people whose response has been very generous.</P>
    <P>Within a year of the explosion in 1986, a speedily designed shelter, or sarcophagus, was constructed over the ruined reactor site.  This shelter, which has stood for over a decade, was never intended to be permanent and is now in urgent need of repair and partial reconstruction.  The Ukraine has since become an independent state and has assumed the burden of dealing with this tragedy, which it inherited from the former Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the Government of the Ukraine, the European Commission and the G-7 &mdash; the group of seven leading industrialised countries &mdash; signed a memorandum of understanding to support the decision of the Government of the Ukraine to close the Chernobyl nuclear plant by the year 2000.  Under the terms of this memorandum, an international project to repair the sarcophagus &mdash; the Chernobyl shelter implementation plan &mdash; was initiated.  The aim is to stabilise the present structure and develop a strategy for dealing with the radioactive waste it contains.  The estimated cost of this undertaking &mdash; more than $750 million &mdash; far exceeds the resources of the Ukraine and considerable external help is needed to pursue it.</P>
    <P>The efforts proposed in the plan will stabilise the existing shelter over the ruined unit 4 reactor, build a new protective structure and remove portions of the existing shelter to ensure its long-term stability.  The project will also investigate the need for removal of the fuel containing masses, the residual melted fuel and concrete, inside the shelter.  Transforming the remains of the Chernobyl disaster into a stable structure will be one of the largest and most important engineering challenges ever undertaken.  I agree with Deputy Lawlor that it needs and deserves the support of the international community.  It is not expected to be completed until 2005, five years after the planned shutdown of unit 3, the remaining operating reactor at Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>The G-7 and the European Commission together pledged $300 million to repair the sarcophagus at the Denver Summit in June of last year.  They called on the international community for additional help to meet the cost of the project, more than $750 million.  A special Chernobyl <Col N="946" /> shelter fund was proposed which has since been formally established and is being administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</P>
    <P>Under the joint chairmanship of Vice-President Gore of the United States and President Kuchma of the Ukraine, a pledging conference to seek commitments of support from the international community was held in New York on 20 November 1997.  Both Vice-President Gore and President Kuchma wrote to the Taoiseach and myself asking Ireland to participate in the pledging conference and to contribute to the fund.</P>
    <P>Ireland was represented at the pledging conference by its Ambassador in Washington. Donors were invited to contribute a minimum of at least 2.5 million ecu, approximately £1.97 million. This was the minimum pledge required to sit in the assembly of contributors which will supervise the administration of the fund by the EBRD.</P>
    <P>Ireland's nuclear policy objectives place a heavy emphasis on safety, radiological protection and recognition of the concerns of third countries which are exposed to safety risks.  We have consistently expressed concern about the risks inherent in the use of nuclear power.  Against that background, Ireland was particularly pleased that the EU had been to the forefront of the international effort to address the consequences of the Chernobyl tragedy.  It supported the EU's position in favour of a substantial financial contribution to the shelter implementation plan.  The Union's contribution will be 100 million European units of account, 100 million ecu, and of this 70 million ecu will be paid this year, and the balance of 30 million ecu next year &mdash; 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition, over and above our share of the 100 million ecus pledged by the European Community to the Chernobyl shelter fund &mdash; in the region of £800,000 &mdash; the Government was able to pledge an additional sum equivalent to 1.5 million European units of account, 1.5 million ecu, to the fund at the pledging conference in New York.  This amount &mdash; equivalent to £1.037 million &mdash; was paid last December to the special Chernobyl shelter account at the EBRD.  Other contributors, in addition to the EU and members of the G-7, included Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>It was possible to respond quickly to the appeal for funds from savings which arose in 1997 in the Vote for International Co-operation.  The circumstances were exceptional, but the Government was pleased to be able to respond quickly. Budgetary resources permitting, the Government hopes to be in a position to make further a contribution of 1 million European units of account over the next few years, but in any case by the year 2001.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4 February 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 64 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted on 11 December 1997, sets, <i>inter alia,</i> a legally binding target for the member states of the EU to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases &mdash; carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride &mdash; by 8 per cent below 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012.  It is intended that the EU will meet the target using provisions in the Protocol concerning joint fulfilment and on the basis of agreed internal burden sharing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the preparation of the EU negotiating position in advance of the Kyoto Conference, the Government adopted an indicative national target of limiting the increase in the emissions of three gases together &mdash; carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide &mdash; to 15 per cent above the 1990 level by the year 2010.  The internal burden sharing arrangement, to which the indicative <Col N="950" /> national target relates, is now subject to review in the light of the Kyoto outcome, with particular regard to the inclusion of three additional gases &mdash; hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride &mdash; the different timeframe involved and the provisions regarding the use of sinks to absorb carbon dioxide.  It is expected that the review will be finalised by June this year.  In the discussions in this regard at the EU Council of Environment Ministers, I intend to adhere to the level of ambition reflected in the indicative national target.</P>
    <P>With regard to energy implications, Ireland's second national communication under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change indicates that energy consumption, through the combusion of fossil fuels, is responsible for more than 95 per cent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland; a copy of the communication is available in the Oireachtas Library.  In order to limit the increase in emissions, a range of policies and measures have been put in place to improve general levels of efficiency in energy production and consumption.  These include energy efficiency and conservation measures in the industrial, residential, commercial, transport and institutional sectors, improving the efficiency of, and reducing the level of carbon intensity in, electricity production through fuel switching and the development of renewable energy resources, and managing growth in electricity demand.  The range of policies and measures is discussed in the second national communication, together with policies and measures in other relevant sectors.</P>
    <P>In addition, new building regulations, with enhanced energy efficiency requirements, have been recently introduced and the 1998 budget announced the introduction of tax reliefs for corporate investment in renewable energy products such as wind and biomass.</P>
    <P>A consultancy study to identify and evaluate the scope for intensifying existing and developing additional policies and measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions is expected to be completed shortly.  It will be necessary for future policy development in all relevant sectors, including the energy sector, to have regard to climate change considerations, including the obligations in the Kyoto Protocol and developments at EU level.  The conclusions of the consultancy study to which I have referred will assist in this regard.</P>

      <P>Sustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland recognised <Col N="951" /> the need to facilitate participation in the achievement of sustainable development.  In January 1998, my Department published a consultation paper on proposed structures and terms of reference for the national environment partnership forum.  Establishment of the forum is a key commitment in the Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to obtain maximum participation and consultation in environmental policy for all those interested in or affecting the environment.  I intend that the forum will be influential in advancing the national agenda for sustainable development and will incorporate the role previously envisaged in the national strategy for a national sustainable development council.</P>
      <P>Alongside the establishment of the forum, I will pursue specific arrangements to monitor progress on sustainable development objectives, including the designation of task managers in other Departments and agencies, and the refocusing of the green network of Departments.  While my Department will continue to monitor overall progress, these arrangements will also underline the reality that sustainable development cannot be the sole responsibility of one Department or Minister, but must be progressed in a comprehensive way across Government, economic sectors and society.</P>

      <P>Overall policy in relation to waste management is outlined in the Goverment programme An Action Programme for the Millennium <Col N="952" /> and related policy documents.  It is based on a commitment to the waste hierarchy: first, the prevention and minimisation of waste; second, recovery; and third, environmentally sustainable disposal.  A full statement on national waste management policy will be published this year to address in detail the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of Government policy objectives in this area.</P>
      <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996 requires the Environmental Protection Agency to make a national hazardous waste management plan.  The Act also requires each local authority to make a waste management plan in respect of its functional area.  Proposed plans must be published and a period of at least two months allowed for public comment.  Comprehensive strategy studies are at present being initiated or carried out by local authorities and the EPA to assist them in the development of plans.  The proposed policy statement will support and further inform the preparation of these plans.</P>
      <P>Detailed information on the types and quantities of waste arising in Ireland is contained in the national waste database report published by the EPA, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>Tenants who purchased their dwellings under the terms of the 1993 and 1995 sales schemes had the option of obtaining mortgage finance from commercial lending agencies or by way of loan facilities from the local authority.  The necessary funds for the local authority loans are provided by the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
      <P>The interest rate on local authority variable rate housing loans is determined by the Housing Finance Agency by reference to rates prevailing in the financial market.  The rate is linked generally to building society mortgage rates and is at present 7.2 per cent, exclusive of 0.7 per cent for mortgage protection insurance.  This compares favourably with current building society rates generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following an increase in early May 1997 of 0.5 per cent in the Central Bank short-term facility rate, commercial lending institutions, including building societies, increased their mortgage lending rates by, on average, 0.5 per cent.  These increases in some cases would have become effective <Col N="953" /> for building society borrowers from as early as June, 1997.</P>
    <P>However, a corresponding increase in local authority variable interest rates was delayed until September, 1997 when the rate was increased by 0.45 per cent.  The Housing Finance Agency is keeping the interest rate under review in the light of trends in the market.</P>

      <P>The communication raises a broad range of issues impinging on many different aspects of urban development.  It recognises that member states have primary responsibility for developing urban policy, but expresses the view that the EU should play a complementary role in addressing urban issues.  It is the Government's intention to make additional contributions as necessary to the debate which the communication was intended to initiate in the period leading up to the urban forum which the Commission intends to hold later this year.</P>

      <P>The phasing in of integrated pollution control licensing for activities covered under the First Schedule to the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (No. 7 of 1992) commenced in May 1994 and will be completed as soon as possible. Licensing has been commenced for all new activities and in the case of established activities will by 9 June 1998 have commenced for approximately 75 per cent of all categories of licensable activity.  I will shortly extend the licensing system to further categories of established activity.</P>
      <P>It has been stated Government policy that integrated pollution control licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency should operate on a self-financing basis.  In this context, and having regard to the substantial cost of processing and determining licence applications, I am satisfied that the current schedule of licence application fees is reasonable.  Other costs whcih may be associated with making a licence application will vary with individual cases.  In general, these costs are related to the type of activity involved and the environmental management and polluting potential of its operation.</P>

      <P>The forum has met on two occasions to date and it is hoped to conclude its work by June 1998. My Department has been represented at both forum meetings and has contributed to the discussions and by way of a background paper. Further contributions are likely to be made by all parties.</P>
      <P>No recommendations have yet been addressed by the forum to me or any other party concerned with taxi services in Dublin.  Pending recommendations from the forum, I have no proposal at present to amend the current regime regarding the issue of taxi licences in Dublin, much of which now stands devolved to Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the forum are, within the overall requirement of improving public transport services in the Dublin area, to assist the regulatory authorities concerned and service providers towards an agreed vision for small public service vehicle operations in Dublin.  For this purpose the forum may consider reports, submissions and views from interested parties on measures to improve the operation of small PSV services.  In this connection, the forum will be able to avail of work being carried out by consultants appointed by Dublin Corporation, on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities, to undertake a comprehensive examination of taxi-hackney services in Dublin.  Following its own deliberations, the forum will address recommendations to the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>The Government has provided substantially increased funds for the provision of waste and water infrastructure, as is evidenced by the extensive water and sewerage investment programme for 1998 which I announced on 2 February.  This programme provides for capital expenditure of almost £185 million on water and sewerage projects throughout the country, and represents an increase on 13.5 per cent on the 1997 expenditure of £163 million and an increase of 50 per cent on the 1996 figure. Sixty major water and sewerage schemes are scheduled to start construction in 1998, a further 61 schemes will continue construction and 79 schemes will be advanced through planning.</P>
      <P>Included in this year's provision is an amount of over £28 million for the rural water programme, which will provide funding for public schemes, water and sewerage, costing less than £250,000, and for grants for group water and sewerage schemes and for houses with individual water supplies.  The allocations to individual local authorities for 1998 under the rural water programme will be notified shortly.</P>

      <P>I have seen a press report along the lines referred to.  By reason of its commercial sensitivity, definitive information is not available to my Department in relation to builders' margins. Moreover, because of wide variations in circumstances particularly in relation to the timing of land acquisition, holding charges and so forth, it would be difficult to draw valid general conclusions from specific cases.  However, it is generally true that margins tend to increase in periods of high demand and to weaken when demand is relatively low.</P>

      <P>One-stop shops create the opportunity to provide integrated, customer centred public services from a single site. While the concept embraces many possible combinations and levels of service, the aim is to provide the fullest possible range of public services, in addition to information and advice.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are in a unique position to lead this process because of their geographical coverage, familiarity to local communities, multipurpose remit and experience in delivering a range of services.  For this reason local authorities have been asked to establish and lead project teams, involving agencies directly involved in service provision at local level, to develop suitable projects.  As recognised in the detailed guidelines issued by the previous Government, the precise composition of one-stop shops will vary in each area depending on local circumstances.  It is my intention to provide financial assistance to enable several pilot or demonstration projects to proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Waste management policy aims to promote the prevention, minimisation and recovery of all wastes, including hazardous waste, and the safe disposal of wastes which cannot be prevented or recovered.  In relation to waste management infrastructure, our policy objectives are to expand the facilities available for waste recovery and to develop self-sufficiency in relation to waste disposal facilities, serving the twin objectives of promoting a high level of environmental protection and supporting Irish industry and economic activity.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for dealing with hazardous waste lies with the holder or producer of the waste.  In the case of largescale industrial activities, on-site facilities are generally provided for the treatment of waste.  The direct provision of such facilities may be uneconomic or technically inappropriate for individual small and medium size enterprises which generate smaller quantities of waste.  It is more usual, therefore, for these to avail of the services of an outside waste management contractor here or abroad.  However, the absence of adequate facilities in Ireland can inhibit competitiveness.</P>
      <P>I recently approved grants for the provision of facilities to deal with hazardous waste and, in the selection of projects for approval, I gave high priority to the needs of the small and medium size enterprise sector, which is an important contributor to national economic growth.  The grants are funded by the EU under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-99.</P>
      <P>The EPA is at present carrying out a comprehensive review of national strategy for the management of hazardous waste.  It is envisaged that a proposed national plan on hazardous waste will be published by EPA this spring.  The plan, when adopted, will provide comprehensive guidance for further development of policy and performance on hazardous waste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the comments to which the Deputy refers do not apply in the case of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Our record of implementing and complying with EU environmental legislation is creditable. The European Commission's 1997 report on implementation of Community legislation shows that, at end 1996, Ireland had implemented 96 per cent of directives due to be implemented at that time.  Work is in hand to transpose the remaining directives as soon as possible.  It is our policy to respond constructively and substantially to correspondence from the Commission regarding implementation and compliance.</P>
      <P>Ireland has fully implemented the terms of the nitrates directive.  As required under the directive, an extensive programme of monitoring was carried out by local authorites in 1992-3 to establish a baseline for assessing and combating nitrate pollution problems.  The results of this monitoring showed that, in general, nitrate levels were well below the standard of 50 milligrammes per litre set in the directive for designating vulnerable zones.  As a consequence, no such zones were designated here.</P>
      <P>As required under the directive, a repeat programme of monitoring of nitrate levels in surface waters and groundwaters is currently being undertaken by local authorities and will be completed shortly.  In addition, a comprehensive code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates was published in July 1996 and has since been promoted extensively within the farming community.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to waste plans is that the waste management planning system is being very substantially developed and improved, under and in accordance with the Waste Management Act, 1996, and subsequent regulations.  The EPA and local authorities are currently subject to legal obligations regarding waste planning which significantly exceed those imposed under relevant EU waste directives, and are making good progress in discharging these obligations.</P>
      <P>We will maintain ongoing liaison with the Commission services in relation to the preparation of strategy studies and the making of waste plans.  Overall this planning process is likely to be completed by the end of 1998.</P>

      <P>Evaluation of options for access to Dublin port was carried out as part of the Dublin Transportation Initiative.

A provision of £11 million is available in 1998.  In addition standard houses are let to travellers under the ongoing local authority housing programme.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 100 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>Final returns on house prices for the quarter ending 31 December 1997 have not yet been received from all mortgage lending institutions. Information in relation to house prices to 30 September 1997 is contained in my Department's Housing Statistics Bulletin, September Quarter, 1997, copies of which are available in the Library. My Department does not publish forecasts of house price trends; in any event the value and reliability of such forecasts is questionable.  I anticipate that the study into the factors underlying the recent increases in house prices will be completed by the end of March.</P>
      <P>Certain measures have been undertaken in the light of increases in house prices in advance of the conclusion of the house prices study, including the establishment of a £15 million fund over three years, £5 million of which is available this year, specifically for the purpose of providing water and sewerage services which are required to open up land for house building and improvements to a range of social housing measures to increase affordability of housing for shared owners and other low income house purchasers and to enable the voluntary housing sector to meet increasing tender prices.</P>
      <P>I would also refer to my reply to Question No. 75 on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <P>The Litter Pollution Act, 1997, came into effect on 1 July 1997 and provides local authorities with an expanded range of powers to take more effective, targeted action to tackle the widespread problem of litter pollution.

      <P>The extent of enforcement action and the number of litter wardens employed will be quantified nationally when my Department, in accordance with established practice, receives statistical information from the local authorities on their 1997 anti-litter operations.

I am, in addition, considering appropriate measures to support effective local authority action, and local awareness, on litter this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Economic and monetary union, EMU, is set to begin on 1 January 1999.  On that date the single currency, the euro, will come into being and the conversion rates of the currencies participating in EMU will be irrevocably fixed against it.  Planning and preparation in Ireland is proceeding on the basis that Ireland will qualify for membership of EMU from the outset.</P>
      <P>The euro will be useable for non-cash transactions, for example, cheques and credit transfers, from the start of EMU but euro notes and coins will not be available for three years so Irish pound notes and coins will continue in circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 1 January 2002, euro notes and coins will be put into circulation and the withdrawal of Irish pound notes and coins will begin.  By 1 July 2002 <Col N="969" /> at the latest, legal tender status will be withdrawn from Irish pound notes and coins and the changeover to the euro will be complete.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give an estimate of the likely changeover costs to business of entering the single currency as any incremental costs that may be incurred in individual cases will depend on a number of variables.  The main business areas where changeover costs are likely to occur are in information technology, accounting systems, marketing and merchandising operations, and payroll and training systems.  No two businesses are the same in this respect.  The impact of the changeover in these areas will depend on issues such as the size of the business, its customer base and whether this is predominantly domestic or export, the level of administration in the business and the sophistication of its business systems.</P>
    <P>The key to a successful transition to euro based systems is early preparation by the business sector. This is one of the central messages of the EMU business awareness campaign which is managed by Forfás on behalf of the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>The issue of preparedness among the SME sector has been a particular focus of attention for the business awareness campaign over recent months. The campaign undertook a number of initiatives designed to specifically target smaller companies. These included preparation of a short, user friendly brochure summarizing the key issues for SMEs in relation to EMU and the changeover to the euro.  Over 53,000 copies of this brochure have been distributed to SMEs through their representative organisations, State agencies, etc.; distribution of campaign material, outlining how SMEs should deal with EMU issues, to over 140,000 businesses as part of a mailing with the Revenue Commissioners and company VAT returns, and an initial advertising campaign on the radio and offering businesses the opportunity to telephone a dedicated euro line for information.</P>
    <P>The Government has, therefore, been to the forefront in encouraging and facilitating the business community to make adequate preparations for the changeover.  In addition, the Government has published its own national changeover plan outlining the arrangements that will be made by Departments, the Central Bank, the NTMA, and the Revenue Commissioners as well as banks and building societies and the Irish Stock Exchange. This will be a very useful guide for businesses of all sizes as they prepare for their own changeover.</P>
    <P>I have no plans, nor do I consider it appropriate, to make financial assistance available to business in the context of the changeover.  The costs to business of the changeover are variable and the key to minimizing costs that may occur is early preparation.  The Government is playing its part in facilitating that early preparation.</P>
    <P>It must also be borne in mind that the single currency will also bring benefits to companies. Interest rates should in general be lower in EMU <Col N="970" /> than would apply if Ireland were not to join. Exchange rate uncertainty and transaction costs will be eliminated for trade, tourism and investment among the member states participating in EMU.  The single currency will mean that the need for currency conversion will no longer arise within the euro area.  Furthermore, such benefits will be permanent, while of their nature changeover costs will be once-off.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would point out that the present economic climate of high growth, sound public finances and falling rates of income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax are providing a very favourable climate for enterprise.</P>

      <P>I understand that a receiver was appointed to Squash (Ireland) Limited on foot of a debenture held by Lower Mount Limited, previously known as Lower Mount Nominees Limited.  Where there is a charge or contract between the company and the lender, the entitlement of the lender to appoint a receiver is largely governed by the contactual terms.  In addition, I am advised that, on 9 February next, an application will be heard by the high Court on the petition of a creditor for the appointment of a liquidator.  The creditors of companies in receivership may enforce their rights under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, by applying directly to the High Court.  It is also open to such creditors to appear when the petition for the winding up of the company by means of a liquidation is heard.</P>
      <P>As the case is before the courts at present, and as creditors have the right to have their views made known at this juncture, it would be inappropriate to initiate action under Part II of the Companies Act, 1990.  Amongst the duties of a liquidator is that of investigating the reasons for the liquidation and subsequently to apprise the court on the pertinent issues.</P>

      <P>Compensation claims arising from the incidents in question are currently being mediated and verified by a sea fishery officer of my Department within the framework of the code of practice for inshore fishermen and trawlermen which was introduced to minimise the risk to local fishing gear from trawling activities and to facilitiate compensation in cases of verifiable gear losses.  I hope an agreed and equitable settlement can be achieved shortly in this particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations by Forfás in relation to the provision of broadband communications are based on the need for a significant increase in investment by telecommunications operators.  This is a rapidly developing market and there have been significant increases in the levels of planned investment in telecommunications networks both by Telecom Éireann and recent entrants to the market such as Worldcom, Esat Telecom and British Telecom even since the Forfás analysis was carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> The market opportunities arising from the liberalisation measures already implemented in the sector and the prospect of full open competition from 1 January 2000 will continue to drive investment in the development of broadband communications. Given the level of interest being expressed in the Irish market it is somewhat premature to predict the extent to which normal commercial criteria will lead to development gaps or to consider how these should be addressed. However, my Department will shortly carry out an analysis of the development plans of operators in order to build a more detailed picture of prospective development.</P>
    <P>In the case of Telecom Éireann, I am informed that having completed its research and development phase, the company plans to commence the provision of broadband services this year. Initially, broadband services will be targeted at the main business communities throughout the country.  Thereafter, the provision of such services will be subject to demand, commercial viability and capital investment funds available. The provision of broadband services in County Meath by Telecom Éireann will be subject to these criteria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm electrification grants scheme is designed to subsidise the installation of electricity to farms which previously had no supply or where supply is inadequate in order to <Col N="975" /> facilitate the development and modernisation of farms in disadvantaged areas of the country.  The scheme, in the first instance, has been designed as one of a number of measures, to redress the disadvantages caused to certain farmers by poor land, small holdings and remoteness from stronger electricity networks.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions of this scheme is that farming must be the applicant's main occupation and principal source of income.  For the purposes of the scheme &ldquo;An eligible person shall be deemed to have farming, as his-her main occupation, if at least 50 per cent of the income is gained from farming (subject to the allowable off-farm income) and more than 50 per cent of his working time is spent on farming activities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The scheme recognises the need for certain farmers to sustain themselves through part-time work and to this end allows off-farm income in certain cases to be reckoned up to a maximum of £16,000.  Farm income, however, must still exceed off-farm income to fulfil the qualification criteria.</P>
      <P>A sympathetic approach has been adopted in the case of start-up farmers who may, initially, not have the financial resources to provide for themselves from farming.  In these cases, my Department accepts a farm plan, detailing farming activities and projected income for the next five years as evidence of farming.  In these circumstances and in the light of the information supplied by the Deputy, I will arrange for a re-examination of the position if he will provide me with specific details of the applicant involved.</P>

      <P>Following the political changes in the international environment in the late eighties, there has been a reorientation of Civil Defence towards providing community based services on a current basis.  As a consequence, provision of capital expenditure for control centres or other purpose built buildings has not been possible and, accordingly, no new buildings have been sanctioned since 1990.  It is considered that each local authority should, as far as possible, provide adequate accommodation and training facilities for its own Civil Defence organisation. Some local authorities have done this by utilising existing buildings, as Civil Defence training usually takes place outside of normal office hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Defence is, however, anxious to assist local authorities in this respect and is examining military accommodation to see if it is adaptable to Civil Defence use.  In this regard, Wexford County Council has been requested to examine the feasibility of utilising <Col N="976" /> Wexford barracks for joint Civil Defence and military purposes, thus obviating the necessity for capital expenditure on a new facility.  This matter will be further pursued with the council in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 119, 141 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>Mullinahone Co-op commenced distributing the current automatic supply of eartags to farmers from early in January.  As was the case of supply in 1996 and 1997, farmers in the main dairying counties in the southern part of the country will receive tags first.  All farmers who are deemed to require supplies of tags will receive them within the next few weeks.  Tags are scheduled to be sent to herdowners in County Mayo during the week beginning 9 February 1998.  In addition, the Department has made a special arrangement with Mullinahone Co-op whereby they will produce an emergency supply of tags on their premises in Mullinahone.  Under this arrangement, tags will be supplied to farmers who demonstrate an urgent need to move calves born on the holding to sale or on animal health-welfare grounds.  In County Mayo 31 farmers have availed of this arrangement to date.  Any costs associated with brass tagging an animal to avail of the calf processing premium scheme when that scheme commences this year will continue to be payable by the farmer to the veterinary practitioner.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements for the issuing of cattle identity cards-passports came into operation in all parts of the country on 1 Janaury 1998.  Under these arrangements, a cattle identity card-passport is issued by South-Western Services Co-op Bandon on receipt by them of a validly completed birth registration form from the owner-keeper of the new born calf.  To date, a total of 22,603 cattle identity cards-passports have been issued in respect of calves born on or after 1 January 1998. Some 573 of these were issued to farmers in County Mayo.</P>

The person named made a claim on a parcel of land to which he was not entitled to claim. This has been considered to be a false declaration and as such the person named has been disqualified for the current year in accordance with clause six of the terms and conditions of the area aid scheme.</P>

As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 454 of 28 January, the making of payments can only follow the determination of entitlements for each applicant on a case by case basis.  These arrangements are proceeding with a view to making payments at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for grants under the 1995 suckler cow premium scheme on 31 May 1995.  He contacted the local office of my Department on 8 August 1995 stating that he wished to withdraw this application as he did not have sufficient suckler quota and wanted to apply under the second application period.  He subsequently applied for premium on 22 cows under the suckler cow premium on 14 November 1995. At an unannounced inspection of his herd on 10 April 1996 only four cows and seven weanlings were found on the holding.  Notification of a further inspection was given for 12 April 1996 and when the inspecting officer of my Department called, no cattle were collected for inspection and the person named was not present.  Consequently, he was deemed ineligible for payment of 1995 suckler cow premium and he was notified of the decision on 7 May 1996.</P>

The north-west would benefit by reduced travel time, a stimulus to industry and tourism, and reduced peripherality; minor roads (especially those serving tourist areas) must be improved and a percentage of post-1993 funding should go to improve roads and sanitary facilities in rural areas.</P>

      <Quest>the issues of concern that have been brought to his attention in connection with Ireland's entry to EMU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2431/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy of the benefits of EMU which are the reason the project was undertaken by the European Community in the first place. These include: (i) elimination of transaction costs and exchange rate risk for trade, tourism and investment among participating member states; (ii) low and fairly uniform interest rates among participating member states; (iii) consolidation and further development of the internal market; (iv) promotion of price stability, sound public finances and sustained low-inflation growth in participating member states; (v) increased attractiveness of participating member states to foreign investment and (vi) a voice for Ireland in EMU decisions.</P>
      <P>Such benefits do not come without some potential costs.  The obvious one is that a single monetary policy will involve some pooling of sovereignty of participating member states.  This disadvantage will probably, however, be felt more keenly in the larger member states, as the discretion over monetary policy enjoyed by smaller member states is considerably less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, also, the exchange rate can play an important role in adjusting national competitiveness <Col N="990" /> and stabilising national output following an economic shock.  In EMU, with the permanent fixing of exchange rates this instrument will no longer be available to us at a national level.  In these circumstances, the international competitiveness of the Irish economy must be secured through other means.</P>
    <P>While it might be argued that the limits of budgetary policy, as a consequence of the EMU provisions in the treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, may be a disadvantage, the reality is that the financial markets would more than likely impose a penalty in the form of higher interest rates on any country which was not participating in EMU and, in particular, if that country was pursuing policies which would lead to an excessive deficit.  In any case, the measures necessary to meet the qualification criteria for EMU are desirable and, indeed, necessary in themselves.  The policies pursued by successive Governments clearly demonstrate that sound Government finances are an essential foundation for sustainable and non-inflationary growth and for creating employment.</P>
    <P>The move to EMU will necessarily entail transition costs for business, public administrations and the financial institutions.  However, it is important to bear in mind that these costs are an investment aimed at producing long-term benefits for the whole economy.</P>
    <P>In the case of financial institutions, there will also be an ongoing loss of revenues arising from the elimination of transaction costs and exchange rate differentials between EMU participants. However, this ongoing loss of revenues to the financial institutions will be an ongoing gain to business in general as well as consumers, which should help boost business performance and in turn be of long-term benefit to financial institutions. EMU will also bring new opportunities and a larger marketplace in which institutions can do business.</P>

      <P>The procedure for the move to stage three of EMU is set out in the treaty and the timetable is as follows. Economy and Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, will assess whether each member state fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency, on the basis of a recommendation from the European Commission and convergence reports from the Commission and the European Monetary Institute.  ECOFIN will recommend its findings to the Council, meeting in the composition of Heads of State and Government, who will, after consulting the European Parliament, confirm which member states fulfil the conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> The reports and the Commission recommendations will be published on 25 March 1998.  The European Parliament will be consulted following publication of the reports and recommendations. ECOFIN is expected to meet to decide on participation in the third stage on 1 May 1998, with Parliament's formal opinion on 2 May, and the final confirmation by the members of the Heads of State and Government later on 2 May.</P>
    <P>Stage three of economic and monetary union will begin on Jaunary 1999 when the euro will come into existence and the European Central Bank, ECB, will begin operation of the single monetary policy.</P>
    <P>Under Article 109k of the treaty, those member states with a derogation, that is, which are considered not to fulfil the necessary conditions for the single currency, shall be the subject of convergence reports by the European Commission and the ECB every two years after the beginning of the third stage or at the request of a member state concerned.  After consulting the European Parliament and discussion in the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, the Council shall, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, decide which member states with a derogation fulfil the necessary conditions for adoption of the single currency.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the United Kingdom has an opt-out from the provisions on EMU, under a Protocol attached to the Maastricht Treaty.  Ireland chose not to have such an opt-out. Under the terms of the Protocol, the UK has notified the Council of Ministers that it does not intend to move to the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999.  Consequently, the United Kingdom is under no obligation to move to the third stage.  The UK may, however, reverse its notification at any time after the beginning of that stage, provided only that it satisfies the necessary conditions.  The Council, acting at the request of the United Kingdom and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 109k, shall decide whether it fulfils the necessary conditions.  It is a matter for the UK whether and when it may decide to change its notification.</P>
    <P>Denmark also has an opt-out from the EMU provisions, under a different Protocol.  Denmark has also notified the Council that it will not participate in the third stage.  The procedure referred to in Article 109k shall only be initiated at the request of Denmark.</P>
    <P>The policy of the United Kingdom on EMU is a matter for the British Government.  While a decision by the UK to enter EMU would be welcome from an Irish point of view, it is a matter for the UK Government to exercise, as they wish, the discretion they are afforded by the treaty.</P>
    <P>My priority remains ensuring that Ireland qualifies for EMU and will take part in the third stage from the beginning.  When the Maastricht Treaty received the endorsement of the people, this was given without qualification or any provision <Col N="992" /> for Ireland to opt-out from the provisions for economic and monetary union.  Membership of EMU, irrespective of what the UK does, will on balance be of benefit for Ireland &mdash; an assessment borne out in studies by both the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The net receipt of income tax paid under the PAYE system in the calendar years 1996 and 1997 is estimated at £3,894.4 million and £4,357.0 million respectively.  These figures include tax receipts attributable to company directors which cannot be distinguished in the overall totals.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that to provide a breakdown of the figures between directors and other PAYE taxpayers would require a detailed examination of all the relevant tax records.  Such an examination could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>
      <P>The relevant information available relating to directors is that pertaining to directors of close companies, whose total income tax liability for the income tax year 1994-95, the latest year for which the relevant statistics are available, is estimated at £360.7 million.  This figure includes tax payable on income which is liable to tax under the Self Assessment system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the information requested by the Deputy for the five year period from 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1997.</P>
      <P>The total value of all payments made to the named companies amounted to £32,145,078.80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This represents 10.73 per cent of the capital allocation of the Office of Public Works for the years in question.  For the purpose of this response, the Office of Public Works capital allocation is taken to mean the capital allocation in the Office of Public Works Vote together with the moneys fowarded to the Office of Public Works in these years from the Votes of other Government Departments and-or Offices under <Col N="994" /> their auspices to meet commitments for contracts entered into by the Office of Public Works on their behalf albeit not necessarily for capital works.</P>
    <P>The number of individual contracts these payments represent is 82, a portion of which (27) were for minor works valued at less than £10,000 (marked *).</P>
    <P>The Deputy inquired about instances where extra works were added to existing contracts and the total value of these extra payments.  Under the terms of Government Construction Contracts, provision is made for adjustment of the contract price in relation to the price variation clause, prime cost and provisional sums and variations (extras and omissions including measured work).  It is not feasible at short notice to examine each contract in such detail in order to extract any additional works not envisaged at the time of invitation of tenders.  However, if the Deputy wishes to receive such information in relation to a specific contract he may contact me.</P>
    <P>The total value of payments made for contracts where competitive public tenders were not invited was £3.1 million.  Of this £2.1 million relates to Collins Barracks.</P>
    <P>The rest of the information sought by the Deputy is contained in the following tabular statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has statutory responsibility for the provision of service for out of home young people. In this regard the board operates an out-of-hours service for homeless youngsters who require a service outside working hours.</P>
      <P>On average 12 young people per night present to the out-of-hours service.  The number of referrals to the out-of-hours service for each of the years 1993 to 1997 was as follows: 1993, 679; 1994, 1,367; 1995, 1,441; 1996, 2,756; 1997, 2,569.</P>
      <P>The board estimate that approximately 400 young people presented to the service as being out of home in 1997.  Approximately 50 per cent of these young people are known to the Eastern Health Board services.</P>
      <P>Currently the Eastern Health Board has a total of 160 emergency places available for out of home young people.  A difficulty experienced by the out-of-hours service is that many young people who cannot be placed by community care teams during the day, because of a shortage of placements, present to the out-of-hours service at night.  Where a youngster cannot be accommodated to regular emergency places efforts are made to place them in bed and breakfast accommodation accompanied by a nurse.</P>
      <P>To respond to this problem the Eastern Health Board intends to create more foster care and residential care places in the region.  Late last year I approved a special allocation of £2 million to fund a number of initiatives for homeless children in Dublin under the auspices of the Eastern Health Board.  Included in measures to proceed immediately is a ten bed emergency residential centre for children under the age of 12.  This centre will be operational on a 24 hour basis and will provide a workable alternative to social admissions to hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has immediate plans to open an additional ten bed emergency residential centre <Col N="999" /> for children over 12 years of age who are out of home.  A further ten emergency carer families are also being made available to provide emergency care for children during the out-of-hours period. The measures amount to 30 additional places for homeless young people.</P>
    <P>The board also operates a day project which offers care, welfare and recreation support to approximately ten young people who are considered to be at risk during day time.  Plans are advancing for a day-and-night reception centre in Dublin city centre to facilitate homeless young people in accessing Eastern Health Board services. This will replace the current unsatisfactory arrangements whereby young people make contact with the Eastern Health Board out-of-hours service via Garda stations.  The reception centre will provide a base for the day project where meals can be provided, as well as recreation, laundry and bathroom facilities.  This centre will have a small number of emergency beds available for young people where no other placement is available.</P>
    <P>While there is no easy solution to the problem I am confident that these new measures will make a major contribution to helping this very vulnerable group of young people.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165, 166, 167, 168 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible children at Saint Finbarr's Hospital, Cork and the maintenance of waiting lists is the statutory responsibilty of the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Southern Health Board that the current number of patients awaiting assessment at the orthodontic unit at Saint Finbarr's Hospital is 5,915 while the number awaiting treatment at that hospital is 2,432.</P>
      <P>Children in Category A, the category of greatest need, receive immediate treatment.  For other children on the treatment waiting lists the waiting period for treatment is approximately two years.</P>
      <P>The waiting time for assessment varies, depending on the community care area in which they are resident.  The waiting period for assessment in south Lee, north Lee and west Cork is approximately two years.  The waiting period for Kerry community care area is approximately six to nine months and north Cork three months approximately.</P>
      <P>Some 211 children were deemed ineligible for treatment following assessment in the four months September to December 1997 in the south Lee and Cork city community care areas.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board agreed to the appointment of a Senior Registrar on a sessional basis at the end of 1997.  A Senior Registrar is now to commence working with the board enabling an increase in the number of outreach clinics being provided by the board.  As a result the board will now be commencing regular clinics in west Cork which up to now have not had such a service.</P>
      <P>The position of Registrar was also advertised by the board but regrettably there were no applications and the board is now making arrangements to fill this position by seconding a Dental Surgeon to the unit.  The board is confident that these appointments will enable an improvement in the overall orthodontic service.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> The second part of the Deputy's question is taken to refer to in-patient beds in publicly funded acute hospitals and in district hospitals where the average length of stay is less than 30 days.  Data for 1960 are not available and the following figures indicate beds per 1,000 population in the Eastern Health Board area for each of the years 1970, 1980, 1990 and 1995 respectively: 7.1, 5.9, 4.0 and 3.9.</P>
    <P>In looking at acute hospital service delivery I feel it is inappropriate to focus solely on bed numbers as a measure of hospital resources.  In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on an overall levels of service provided in acute hospitals rather than on the provision of a specific number of beds.  This is a reflection of the major changes in medical practice which have resulted in a reduction in the length of stay for in-patient care and a marked shift towards day case surgery and treatment of patients at out-patient level.</P>

      <P>At present there is a total of 12,499 designated beds in acute public hospitals.  This figure is made up of of 9,190 public beds, 2,541 private/semi-private beds and 768 non-designated beds.  Using population figures from the 1996 Census, there are 2.5 public beds and 0.7 private/semi-private beds in acute public hospitals per 1,000 of population. Private hospital bed numbers are not collected by my Department.</P>
      <P>Because of the differences in the structure and delivery of health services in EU countries and consequent difference in definitions and interpretation of statistics in this area, it is not possible to provide accurate comparative figures for beds per 1,000 of population.  In addition, in looking at acute hospital service delivery I feel it is inappropriate to focus solely on bed numbers as a measure of hospital resources.  In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on overall levels of service provided in acute hospitals rather than on the provision of a specific number of beds.

      <P>The original Tallaght Hospital building project was completed in May 1997.  However, the Deputy will be aware that, following submission to the Department, a number of additional construction projects were approved early last year so as to enhance the new hospital.</P>
      <P>Additional capital funding of £4.1 million for improvements in the following areas was sanctioned in March 1997: out patients department &mdash; alterations and extension; intensive care unit; theatre recovery area; X-ray department and extension to hospital sterile supplies department. The design and construction of these projects to a degree which would be compatible with the functioning of a major acute hospital was the main factor governing the decision of the board of the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children' Hospital to open the new hospital on 21 June next as opposed to an earlier date in 1998.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above improvements, the Department also agreed to the hospital's proposals to develop private and semi-private facilities providing up to 77 additional beds.  This is the responsibility of the board of the hospital to finance and develop at an estimated cost of £7 million.  The facilities will be owned and managed by the board and will be operated as an integral element of the total hospital.</P>
      <P>The Department also agreed to the hospital's proposals to develop a muti-storey car park which will be privately financed and which will bring the total number of spaces to 1,000.  This facility is scheduled for completion in June 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the commissioning process which commenced in recent months, the hospital management has identified a number of additional alterations which it considers necessary. These alterations have been brought to the attention of the Tallaght Hospital board and the <Col N="1004" /> design team.  A full analysis of these issues is currently under way and a strategy is being developed to deal with such matters so as to comply with the June opening date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards make a financial contribution, under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the board's overall responsibilities in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and provision of family support services under the Child Care Act, 1991. Specifically, the Eastern Health Board as part of their child care services contribute via the section 65 mechanism to day care nurseries in the region. The nurseries operate autonomously and are independent of the board in relation to their day to day operation.</P>
      <P>The employees of organisations in receipt of section 65 grants from health boards are not employees of the board and do not accordingly fall to have their terms and conditions of employment directly determined by the health boards.  In matters of recruitment, pay rates and conditions of employment, the arrangements agreed between employer and employee are not subject to control by the local health board or my Department.</P>
      <P>Labour Court Recommendation No. 15671 refers to the pay of 20 Day Nursery Managers and 100 other staff, who are employed in approximately 100 Day Care Centres in the greater Dublin area and therefore relates to the Eastern Health Board area specifically.  The recommendation makes provision for the revision of salary for these staff in line with the Department of Education's &ldquo;Early Start&rdquo; programme.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the award is a matter for the management of the day nurseries and the Eastern Health Board.  I understand that this is currently the subject of discussions between the management of the nurseries, the Eastern Health Board, the Health Service Employers' Agency and the trade union IMPACT.  Final costings will be calculated by the Eastern Health Board when these discussions are more advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding has not been provided for within the estimates as it is a matter for health boards to determine specific funding arrangements for voluntary agencies supported via the section 65 mechanism.  The board will be considering the implications in the context of its <Col N="1005" /> overall funding of child care services within the board.  As further meetings are scheduled to take place between the parties, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determining of <Col N="1006" /> a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  It should be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision it is felt it is not justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means, as a general rule, particulalry in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  It would appear that in most circumstances a person whose sole income is a contributory social welfare pension would be entitled to a medical card.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the arrangements referred to above the Government has identified as a key priority in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families and my Department has made the necessary arrangements to advance this review with the health boards.</P>

      <P>A Methadone Treatment Services Review Group was set up by my Department in January 1997. Its brief was to assess the use of methadone in the treatment of opiate dependence.  The group's report examines the protocols for good practice in the prescribing and dispensing of methadone and points to appropriate controls which might be put in place.  It also sets out the basis on which methadone treatment should continue to be developed and recommends a concise framework for the future operation of the scheme.  The report has been circulated nation-wide to every general practitoner and pharmacist.</P>
      <P>The report's recommendations include the following: the continuation of the central treatment list of patients being prescribed methadone. Under this arrangement a general practitioner who is considering prescribing methadone for a patient can check whether the patient's name is on this treatment list and so minimise the possibility that the patient concerned is receiving methadone from more than one source; the provision of a personalised treatment card to each patient &mdash; this card is in turn presented to a local pharmacist who holds it for the duration of treatment; support to GPs and pharmacists through the appointment of a GP facilitator including close liaison and communication arrangements with health board services in the event of a patient destabilising; contractual arrangements with GPs, pharmacists, etc.; the provision of supervised administration of methadone cases where a general practitioner feels the need for this; the introduction of regulations to require that the prescription and supply of methadone be restricted to official prescription forms specifically designed for the purpose; specific training and information for GPs and pharmacists on the treatment of opiate dependent persons and methadone monitoring to be placed on a statutory basis by regulation under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>

The committee's main objective will be to ensure that all general practitioners and pharmacists providing methadone treatment, do so in accordance with the arrangements in the report.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations in the group's report will result in strict control on the prescribing and dispensing of methadone in the treatment of opiate misuse.</P>

      <P>Value for money is an integral component in this Government's proposals for the reform of local government.  I intend to link proven improvements in efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of local authority services, with increased control for local authorities on how they spend the funds allocated to them.  This link will actively encourage local authorities to pursue the value for money agenda. Some measures are already in place to achieve this aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my visits to local authorities in the last six months, I have continually emphasised the <Col N="1010" /> importance of achieving value for money and quality of service to the customer.  The reaction that I have received has been very positive.</P>
    <P>On a more statutory and formal basis, the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997 established on a statutory basis, a value for money unit in the Department and widened the role of local government auditors in auditing local authorities to examine economy and efficiency in the use of resources.  However, there are barriers to comprehensive value for money audits which will deliver performance indicators which can, in turn, be used for fundamental decisions on resource allocations.</P>
    <P>First of all, modern financial management systems, based on accrual accounting, must be in place in order to obtain a clear picture of the financial performance of local authorities, on a comparative basis.  A project team has been established to carry out this task and work is under way.  The first phase involves the creation of a high level code of practice to facilitate the introduction of accrual-based accounting.  Work on this phase, which involved a short external consultancy exercise, is nearing completion.  This is a complex project to implement and my Department is working closely with local authorities on all aspects to ensure that success is achieved.  This is not just a consultative process, it is a partnership approach to fully involve local authorities in the process.</P>
    <P>As one element of this project, a consultancy study on the costing of local authority services has recently commenced.  The results of this study will form part of the impetus towards achieving value for money, through giving management and elected officials the true cost of delivering their services, measured in a standard way across the local authority system.  The study, and the subsequent implementation of its recommendations, will underpin the development of a range of performance indicators.  Local authorities will be required to publish their performance across a range of indicators, thus providing consistent comparative figures.  An in-depth consultative process with selected local authorities will be a core activity in this study.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, while these projects are under way, work will continue on the planning and completion of new VFM studies.  In addition, local government auditors will continue to assess the performance of individual local authorities in implementing the recommendations of the studies already published.  I also intend to review the value for money unit's work in order to maximise its potential in leading the way in the drive for increased effectiveness.</P>

It is not possible to reduce the interest rate on these loans as the cost involved would be substantial and would have to be borne by either the Exchequer, the Housing Finance Agency or local authorities.</P>
      <P>However, borrowers of these loans may redeem them without penalty, which is a significant concession in the case of fixed interest rate loans, and refinance in the private sector, if they consider it advantageous to do so.</P>

      <P>Financial assistance by way of grants is available for waste management purposes in two measures under the Waste Management Sub-Programme of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services.  Measure 1 provides support for the provision by the private sector of facilities for the recovery or disposal of hazardous waste.  Measure 2 provides support for the provision of waste recovery infrastructure by the private sector and by local authorities and for the carrying out of waste management strategy studies by public authorities including local authorities, regional authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency.

    <P>A decision to reduce the European Regional Development Fund funding for the Waste Management Sub-Programme by 8 MECU was taken by the Community Support Framework (CSF) Monitoring Committee at its meeting on 29 July 1997.  This decision was part of an agreed package of changes arising from the mid-term review of the CSF 1994-99, announced jointly on the same date by the Minister for Finance and the EU Commissioner for Regional Policy.  The total reduction of 8 MECU was applied by way of a reduction of 3 MECU in measure 1 and 5 MECU in measure 2.  The decision does not represent any change in policy regarding the management of hazardous and municipal waste and will not affect applicants for whom grants have been approved.</P>

      <P>Overall responsibility for the SWA scheme rests with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>The assessment of housing need carried out by local authorities on 29 March, 1996 identified 2,207 households who were seeking local authority housing but whose housing needs were being met by rent supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme operated by health boards.  Apart from those who applied for local authority housing, there are an unquantified number of further households, who but for SWA rent supplementation, would have looked to local authorities to meet their housing needs.  The rent supplementation scheme has been shown to be the most appropriate and cost effective means of providing housing for certain categories of people who are unable to meet their housing needs from their own resources, for example, single people.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to continuing the local authority housing programme at a high level as evidenced by the increased provision made for the programme in the 1998 public capital programme.</P>

      <P>Major capital investment by successive Governments over the past 60 years has greatly increased the storage capacity of our public water supply schemes.  The 1991 Census recorded that over 85 per cent of households in Ireland had a piped supply of domestic <Col N="1021" /> water from public or group schemes.  In terms of quality, the latest EPA report on Irish drinking water confirms the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water.</P>
      <P>To meet future needs in relation to domestic water suppy, a major investment programme to upgrade and extend public and private water supplies is under way.  Since the start of the National Development Plan in 1994, over £217 million has been expended on this programme.  The recently announced investment programme for water and sewerage services, which provides for an overall increase in spending for 1998 or 13 per cent over 1997, will allow for further improvements in public and group water supplies.  As part of this investment programme, funding is provided for subprogrammes dealing with leakage reduction and rural water supplies.</P>
      <P>Economic progress in Ireland has meant there is an increasing demand for good quality water supplies for both industrial and domestic purposes. The Government is providing the investment to ensure that this demand is met and that Ireland will continue to enjoy a modern, efficient water supply system.</P>

      <P>The application in this case took longer to process than normal, due to a number of factors.  The deciding officer considered it necessary to refer the claim to an investigation officer for inquiries before making a decision and this process gave rise to delay.  The claim form itself was unsigned and this had to be <Col N="1023" /> returned for signature.  Also, there were overlapping payments being made in respect of the orphan in question which had to be adjusted before the net amount of arrears due could be finalised.</P>
      <P>The claim was decided on 26 January 1998 when an orphan's contributory allowance of £45.60 per week was awarded for the period from 25 July to 29 August 1997 inclusive, and from 17 October 1997 onwards.  The child in question was in London from August to October 1997.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made to issue the arrears of orphan's allowance to the person concerned this week, less the amounts of dependent child increase paid on her spouse's unemployment assistance in respect of the child, and less the supplementary welfare allowance paid to her on an interim basis.  Further payments will be made by direct credit to her bank account, as she has requested, starting on the next normal lodgment date of 27 February 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position described by the Deputy arises from the extension of class A PRSI to community employment workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996.  The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them. However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.  The social welfare secondary benefits, including butter vouchers and the free fuel allowance, are payable only with long-term social welfare payments.  Unemployment benefit claimants do not therefore have an entitlement to these benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondary benefits can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a community employment scheme to a back to work allowance scheme or jobstart, etc.  It is important to note also that <Col N="1024" /> as regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance or mortgage supplements, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former community employment workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment should continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>
    <P>While I recognise that CE workers who re-qualify for unemployment benefit when their period of CE finishes can face difficulties as a consequence of no longer having entitlement to certain secondary benefits, I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for such people without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.  Any such concessions would, accordingly, carry an extremely high cost and could only be considered in light of available resources and other priorities.</P>

      <P>Voluntary and community groups play an important part in improving the quality of the lives of people by helping them to develop the capacity to change their situation for the better.  However, disadvantaged communities require support to enable them to realise this potential and to play a real part and have a real say in their own development. Acknowledging this my Department has, for a number of years, supported local self-help and community development initiatives through its many programmes and grant schemes.</P>
      <P>This year there is an enhanced emphasis in my Department's programmes and grant schemes on supporting families and parenting, and as provided for in the 1998 budget, my Department now has responsibility for a range of family services. These include the following:</P>
      <P>an extra £600,000 for marriage and child counselling bringing the total provision to £1.5 million; an extra £600,000 for the family mediation service bringing the total provision to £900,000; an extra £700,000 for family and community resource centres; and £1,456,000 for the scheme of grants to community and family support groups.</P>
      <P>In addition, a new family affairs unit is being established to co-ordinate family policy generally, to initiate research, to developing parenting information and a pilot local office project.</P>

    <P>As many of these groups provide supports for the family my Department has this year introduced a new integrated scheme of grants to community and family support groups, integrating the former schemes of grants to locally-based women's groups, locally-based men's groups and lone parent groups.</P>
    <P>Scheme of Grants to Community and Family Support Groups: This scheme will provide grants to locally-based community and family support groups involved in programmes of self-help and personal development designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage and improve family life.  This scheme will continue the existing supports for women's, men's and lone parents groups, while also giving the Department the flexibility to respond to the needs of local community development groups that comprise both men and women, family support groups that focus on helping individuals and communities in the family context.</P>
    <P>This scheme, along with the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations and the community development education and training grants scheme, will be advertised in the national and provincial newspapers in early February.  Application forms will be available from the Department's network of regional offices and groups will be invited to submit applications before the closing date in mid-March.  Applications will be processed as soon as possible after the closing date.</P>
    <P>In addition to the once-off grant schemes, three year core-funding in the range £8,000 to £20,000 is available for more established and developed groups with a specific anti-poverty focus who work with a wider group of disadvantaged people and have the potential to make a substantial impact in their local communities with enhanced funding.  Groups wishing to be considered should apply directly to the voluntary and community services section of my Department providing details as outlined in the previously mentioned SW85.</P>
    <P>In addition to the new initiatives being introduced in 1998, my Department will also continue to support families in the community through the community development programme and through the money advice and budgeting service. The year 1998 will see the expansion of both these programmes to ensure the provision of continued support to the most vulnerable in society through a range of practical initiatives.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme is a means tested payment and is not age-related.  The scheme at present is confined to recipients of mainly long-term social welfare or health board payments. The purpose of the fuel scheme is to relieve fuel poverty and the main criteria for eligibility is need.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to extend the fuel scheme to any group who do not meet the present qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in view of the financial implications any extension of the scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.  Under that scheme a person who may have exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating allowance.  An application for a heating allowance may be made by contacting a community welfare officer at a local health centre.</P>

      <P>Self-employed persons are covered by class S social insurance which provides cover for old age (contributory) pension, widow's/widower's pension, orphan's contributory allowance, maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.  They pay PRSI at 5 per cent subject to the same cumulative annual earnings ceiling as employees.  This 5 per cent rate is considerably less than the combined employer and employee class A contribution rate (13 per cent or 16.5 per cent) applicable to employees in the industrial, commercial and service sectors.  There are no proposals, at this time, to extend class S coverage to include contingencies such as illness or invalidity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> The National Pensions Board in its final report published in 1993 considered the question of the extension of invalidity pension to the self-employed. The board recommended against the extension of social insurance cover in respect of invalidity to the self-employed.  In making this recommendation the board cited the different circumstances which apply to the self-employed who own their own businesses or farms as distinct from employees and the cost of extending such cover to the self-employed.</P>
    <P>Self-employed people who are unable to work due to illness or disability and who satisfy a means test may qualify for supplementary welfare allowance (in the case of a short-term illness) or disability allowance (in the case of a long-term disability).</P>
    <P>The anomaly referred to by the Ombudsman relates to a specific group of self-employed people who formally paid class A social insurance.  The sub-category in question encompasses those with substantial existing records of full rate social insurance prior to becoming self-employed.  The Ombudsman has suggested that the possibility of an arrangement to provide optional full rate cover to self-employed persons who have a prescribed minimum period of full rate cover be examined by the Department.</P>
    <P>This proposal will be considered further by the Department.  In the context of any such examination, regard will have to be given to the likely cost of the proposal, the numbers of self-employed who would be affected and the issue of introducing anomalous social insurance cover to different categories of the self-employed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Social Insurance in Ireland&rdquo;, a discussion document on social insurance, was published by the Department in October 1996.  One of the issues relating to the future development of social insurance, which was identified in the document, is that of coverage, both in terms of the type of occupation included and the type of contingencies provided for.  It is proposed to undertake a consultative process relating to social insurance which will involve seeking the views of contributors such as employers, employees and the self-employed, their representative organisations, and the public generally.  The initial phase of this process has now commenced.  The purpose of the consultation is to inform future policy development of the social insurance system, including the degree of cover provided for the self-employed and others.</P>

      <P>The social welfare system as originally developed, was based on the traditional pattern of the husband being the main breadwinner and the wife being mainly dependent on him for income support.  The social and economic realities in Ireland have altered considerably over the decades and the social welfare system has sought to respond to these changes. Notably, the automatic presumption of a wife being dependent on her husband was replaced in 1986 with the introduction of the equal treatment provisions which provided for a genuine test of dependency applying equally to both men and women.</P>
      <P>A person in receipt of a social welfare payment can qualify for an additional allowance known as &ldquo;qualified adult allowance&rdquo; in respect of a spouse who is not claiming a social welfare payment in their own right, and whose earnings, if working, are less than £60 per week.  A reduced rate of qualified adult allowance is paid where earnings are between £60 and £90 per week.</P>
      <P>In addition, a spouse who meets the relevant conditions, e.g. in relation to unemployment, disability or old age may apply for the relevant payment in their own right.</P>
      <P>The entitlements of qualified adults will vary according to the different circumstances in each household.  They may, for example, be entitled to &ldquo;homemaker credits&rdquo; which protect the pension entitlements of an insured worker who has withdrawn from the open labour market in order to engage in home duties.  Where a person is receiving unemployment assistance and a qualified adult allowance, the dependent spouse may opt to take up a place on schemes such as community employment in place of the person.</P>
      <P>The treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare systems is currently being examined by a working group established for that purpose in May 1997. Underlying the necessity for such a review was a need to examine the concept of adult dependency, in addition to ensuring fairness in the way that the State supports families, whether the parents concerned are married, cohabiting or parenting alone, while at the same time providing assistance for families who are at particular risk of poverty.  The establishment of the group also marked the first stage in meeting the commitment, contained in the national anti-poverty strategy, to examine the individualisation of social welfare payments.  This working group, which includes representatives of all the relevant Government Departments as well as the Combat Poverty Agency and the National Social Services Board is due to complete its work in the summer of 1998.</P>

      <P>The other free schemes, such as the free electricity allowance, the free telephone rental allowance and free TV licence are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition.  In addition, widows/widowers between the age of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had entitlement to the free schemes, retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>To extend the free schemes to all widows/widowers in receipt of a widow's/ widower's (non-contributory) pension who are under the age of 66 would involve additional expenditure which could only be considered in the light of the resources available.</P>

      <P>Following the death of a recipient of a social welfare payment or his or her spouse the payment is continued at the same rate for six weeks in circumstances where both spouses have a separate entitlement provided one or both of the entitlements is a non-contributory old age pension, a blind pension or a carers allowance or where the payment includes a payment for a qualified adult.  The payment does not arise where each spouse has an independent entitlement to an insurance-based contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Allowing a surviving spouse to retain 75 per cent of joint pension after the death of their spouse, as suggested by the Deputy, would have cost implications and would also raise equity issues as a surviving spouse would then be in receipt of a greater payment that a pensioner on a personal rate only.</P>

      <P>I understand the site for which planning permission exists involves a proposed residential development to the south of the river referred to by the Deputy and that no planning permission exists for development to the north of the river.  The development for which planning permission exists was first brought to the attention of the national monuments and historic <Col N="1032" /> properties division of Dúchas, the heritage service, by the planning authority, Westmeath Councy Council, at the beginning of last year.  It was recommended subsequently to the planning authority that, owing to the location of the site in an area of archaeological potential, there should be an archaeological assessment carried out.</P>
      <P>An archaeological assessment, under licence, was carried out by the developers' archaeologist last April, involving the digging of extensive test trenches where site development works were to be carried out.  Nothing of archaeological interest was uncovered and it was concluded that the proposed development has no archaeological implications.</P>
      <P>Having consulted the planning authority, I am aware of only two further applications for (a) a variation to the original scheme involving doors and windows which has no archaeological significance and (b) a bridge which was submitted and referred to my Department last November.  In relation to the latter, it was confirmed by the developers' archaeologist that the area for the proposed new bridge had already been included in the area of testing originally carried out by the developers' archaeologist.  It was agreed, therefore, that further testing in this area was not necessary.</P>
      <P>The site was assessed and tested in accordance with proper archaeological standards by a professional archaeologist and no evidence of archaeological remains on this site has been proven. Although the archaeologist's report was submitted to me in accordance with the terms of the licence, the report remains the property of the developers and access to it is a matter for them. I am satisfied, however, that there was no need to augment this site appraisal with archaeologists from my own Department and that there is no need for any further archaeological input while work is in progress.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware of the significance of the nearby site referred to by the Deputy, where extensive skeletal material, dating from the medieval period, was uncovered in 1996, and of the fact that it is located in an historically important part of Mullingar.  In recognition of this, my Department has requested on numerous occasions that archaeological conditions be inserted in planning permissions for developments in this area.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department that proposed developments in all sensitive sites should be subject to an archaeological assessment and I can assure the Deputy that my Department will be adhering rigidly to this in the case of any new development occurring in the zone of archaeological potential in Mullingar.</P>
      <P>I should point out that all functions regarding heritage matters have been transferred from the Office of Public Works to my Department since 1996.</P>

      <P>As I indicated before Christmas in the Second Stage debate on the Film Board (Amendment) Bill, 1997, I am generally satisfied with the operation of Bord Scannán na hÉireann.  The board is making a key contribution to the development and production of films which tell Irish stories in an impactful and entertaining way, thereby contributing to Irish cultural expression.  Films supported by the board have attracted substantial market-based investment and pre-sales and have won international critical and audience acclaim at film festivals throughout the world.  For example, three of the four last films to win the prestigious San Sebastian Best Film Award were Irish films supported by the board.</P>
      <P>The film industry in Ireland has, since the early 1990s, undergone a period of strong growth, driven by incentives provided by the Government. Clearly, the circumstances of the industry are now very different from those in the early 1990s.  Accordingly, it is an appropriate time to review policy generally in regard to the industry and it is my intention, shortly to establish a think tank to draw up a strategic plan for the next ten years for the industry which will provide the basis for appropriate, timely and effective policy decisions.  Clearly the future role of Bord Scannán na hÉireann will be one of the principal issues to be considered in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 248 together.</P>
      <P>The operation of the petitions procedure fundamentally changed in April 1995 as a result of a High Court judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Geoghegan in the matter of Patrick J. Brennan <i>v</i> the Minister for Justice, Ireland and the Attorney General.  The judgment was on foot of a judicial review sought by the applicant, a retired senior judge of the District Court, who contended that the then Minister in purported exercise of her powers under section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, had been improperly reducing or remitting fines which he had imposed.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Geoghegan upheld the constitutionality of the power vested in the Minister but he ruled that the exercise of the power by the Minister was <i>ultra vires.</i>  He held the view that the petitions procedure was not an alternative or parallel system of justice to that provided by the courts and that the power exercised by the Minister should be used sparingly and for special reasons with proper maintenance of records.  In this respect the judgment clearly indicates that petition should be granted only in &ldquo;special cases&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> The processing of petitions virtually ceased while the implications of the judgment were considered. New guidelines and procedures to give effect to the judgment were issued in late February last year for the purpose of assisting both members of the public and public representatives in ascertaining whether a case exists for the opening of a petition or not.  By the time I took up office a backlog of approximately 5,200 unprocessed petitions had built up.</P>
    <P>Last November, in an effort to tackle this backlog, I directed that a petitions clearance programme be undertaken with a view to having all outstanding petitions, including applications to have a petition opened, finalised in the shortest possible time.  Substantial progress is being achieved and decisions are now in the process of issuing to petitioners.  It will be appreciated, however, that given the very substantial task involved it will be several months before the process is completed.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, unfortunately, it does not appear to have been appreciated by correspondents how very restricted the scope for intervention under the petitions procedure now is, having regard to the 1995 High Court judgment dealing with the petitions procedure.  The reality is that intervention cannot be a regular or frequent occurrence and that a humanitarian or other reason does not necessarily qualify as a special case nor can it be deemed to constitute exceptional circumstances, in accordance with the judgment.  From the cases which are being referred to me for consideration, it would appear that very few are likely to be successful and that in future, in order to meet the criteria laid down by the High Court, the exercise of clemency under the petitions procedure will have to be very much the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise the High Court finding that the petitions procedure is not a parallel or alternative system of justice to that provided by the courts.  I, as Minister, have no function in determining the guilt or innocence of a defendant or the appropriateness or otherwise of penalties imposed in the light of evidence presented in court.  Such matters and other legal issues are properly the subject for appeal to a higher court. In addition, matters which have not yet come to court or are still before the courts, that is to say, where the original case is not yet finalised or where an appeal to a higher court has been lodged, are inappropriate for consideration under the petitions procedure.  Other matters excluded are civil and Revenue cases, disqualification from driving and endorsement on driving licence, community service orders, costs and expenses awarded by the courts, on-the-spot-fine tickets and requests for time to pay or to pay by instalments. In addition, it will not be possible to give favourable consideration to cases which indicate no significant change in financial and other circumstances <Col N="1037" /> since the court hearing, where insufficient information is provided, etc.</P>
    <P>With regard to future applications to have a petition opened, I would caution that if the information is incomplete or does not establish a probability that the matter may be a special case or be deemed to have exceptional circumstances, then a petition will not be opened.  It is imperative, therefore, that individuals' expectations are not raised in the future in respect of cases which do not appear to meet the requirements of the 1995 High Court judgment, notwithstanding that they themselves may well consider that the case in which they are interested meets the relevant criteria.</P>
    <P>In essence, as indicated above, the 1995 High Court judgment on petitions precludes the petitions procedure from being used as a parallel or alternative system of justice to that provided by the courts and it would be <i>ultra vires</i> for me to intervene in anything other than a very special case or one with exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>The petitions referred to by the Deputies are among the large number which I have already referred to and will now have to be considered in accordance with the criteria outlined above.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 254 and 255 together.</P>
      <P>The case referred to by the Deputy was, among other matters, the subject of an application to the central authority which operates in my Department for the purposes of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.  Central authorities under the convention have certain specified functions.  These include initiation of arrangements for the tracing of a child who is wrongfully removed to another state by one of its parents; to seek the child's return; the institution of judicial or administrative arrangements for return of the child to his or her place of habitual residence; and the provision of legal aid and advice to the applicant parent to secure return of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention operates on the principle that the custody of a child who has been abducted should be determined by the courts in the place where the child habitually resides.  Hague Convention proceedings in our courts take precedence over custody proceedings that may relate to the child in question in our courts.  Convention and custody proceedings are normally held in camera.  The Garda has power to detain a child who it reasonably suspects is about to be or is being removed from the State in breach of custody orders or while proceedings for such an <Col N="1041" /> order are pending or an application for one of those orders is about to be made.</P>
    <P>While I would, of course, wish to be of whatever assistance I can to the House in giving information about operation of the Hague Convention, it would be inappropriate of me as Minister to comment on the details of the civil law aspects of individual cases.  I am not in a position to comment on those civil law aspects of the case that are the subject matter of these two questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question was arrested by the Garda, in accordance with the provisions of the European Convention on Extradition and the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended, following receipt on 21 November 1997 of an urgent request from the German authorities for his provisional arrest, with a view to extradition.  The request was in respect of the offence of keeping a person under the age of 18 from her parent or guardian, from 20 August 1997 to the date of the request, contrary to an order of the German court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following his arrest, the person in question was remanded in custody by the Dublin Metropolitan District Court pending receipt from the German authorities of a request for his extradition in accordance with the convention and the Act.  On 2 December 1997 the request for extraditon was received from the German authorities via the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That Department sought advice from the Attorney General's office as to whether the request was in order.  The Attorney General's office, having examined the request, advised that the offence specified in the extradition request did not correspond with the offence specified in the provisional arrest request or with an offence in Irish law and that consequently Ireland would not be in a position to extradite the person concerned to face the charge specified in the request for extraditon.  The Department of Foreign Affairs brought this difficulty to the attention of the German authorities who, in response, indicated that the offence in the request for extradition included in its terms the offence in the request for provisonal arrest.  The office of the Attorney General advised that, as the offence in the request for extradition included additional elements which were not part of the offence in the request for provisional arrest and were not an offence in Irish law at the relevant time, the request for extradition lacked the necessary correspondence.  Consequently, I had no option but to order the release of the person concerned <Col N="1042" /> on 5 December, 1997 immediately on receipt of advice from the Attorney General's office that it would not be possible for Ireland to extradite the subject to face the charge specified in the request for extradition.</P>

However, the Government has agreed to the restoration of the Bill to the Dáil Order Paper.  This Bill proposed the placing of the Garda juvenile liaison programme on a statutory footing.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources inform me that the resources allocated to the juvenile liaison programme are continually reviewed in the light of the demands placed on the programme and their national juvenile office is currently examining the likely implications of enactments of the Bill.  However, a response cannot be finalised until the Bill is published.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the next school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>A total of 54 remedial teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools, with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for remedial tuition.</P>
      <P>I am reviewing provision across the special needs area, including current responses to remedial needs, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be fully considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>I recently launched the national forum on early childhood education and the question of the recognition of qualification from St. Nicholas' Montessori College and other early childhood qualifications will be considered by the forum in the overall context of childhood education services throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The national forum will be representative of all groups involved in providing early childhood education services.  The forum will bring together service providers and experts in the field for the purpose of advising on a strategy for the future development of early childhood education service. It will provide an opportunity for all interested groups to engage in a full exchange of views and for each group to put forward their own particular concerns and objectives.  At the same time, it will take account of the objectives and concerns of the other partners in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the student support schemes operated by my Department is that St. Nicholas' Montessori College is not an approved college for the purposes of the schemes.  In this regard, the scope of these schemes is being considered as part of an ongoing review of the existing arrangements.  This review will be completed in advance of the 1998 student support schemes. I should point out to the Deputy that any extension of the existing arrangements can only be considered in the light of available resources and in <Col N="1050" /> the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I would point out that tax relief is available in respect of the National Diploma in Humanities in Montessori Education and the Bachelor of Arts in Humanities in Montessori Education offered by St. Nicholas' Montessori College.</P>

      <P>In the current school year, of the total of 762 schools at second level, 190 schools have disadvantaged status.  In designating these schools as disadvantaged regard was had to a range of criteria including the number of first year pupils whose parents are in receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit; the number living in rented local authority housing and non-permanent accommodation; the number living with lone parents; the number whose parents hold a medical card; the number with significant literacy and numeracy difficulties; the number of rural pupils from a deprived economic background and the percentage of pupils who drop out of school at or about 15 years of age without any formal education qualifications.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I would like to clarify that the students in question are pursuing courses which are approved for the purposes of the ESF-aided maintenance grants scheme and that their grant applications were processed by County Meath Vocational Education Committee.</P>
      <P>The VEC raised the question of the assessment of means with my Department, which advised that it is the normal practice, when calculating reckonable income for grant purposes, that evidence of income for the previous financial year is required.  This method is used as income from the previous year will generally reflect income in the current year.  However, in accordance with the change of circumstances clause of the ESF-aided maintenance grants scheme, a candidate's eligibility for grant aid may be reassessed in the event of a change in reckonable income which is likely to be permanent.  This change in circumstances may be positive or negative and in either situation the revised income is annualised and the grant entitlement assessed thereon.</P>
      <P>In the particular case referred to by the Deputies the reckonable income for grant purposes was calculated by annualising current weekly income as a positive change in circumstances, which was likely to be permanent, had occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the calculation of reckonable income in the case of the self-employed, it is normal <Col N="1053" /> practice, as in the case of employees generally, to accept evidence of income relating to the preceding financial year.  Similarly, where a change of circumstances has occurred which is likely to be permanent, the grant entitlement may be reviewed.</P>

      <P>The mid-term evaluation of the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development (1994-99) by Goodbody Consultants highlighted a number of concerns relating to the advanced technical skills programme.  My Department has been in contact with the Higher Education Authority in relation to the concerns raised in this evaluation.  I understand that the authority has had subsequent discussions with the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities in this regard.  My Department is currently awaiting the advice of the authority in relation to the finalisation of the programme arrangements for the 1998-99 academic year and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of school attendance legislation rests with school attendance committees in certain parts of Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Cork and Waterford.  In all other areas, responsibility rests with the relevant Garda authorities.  Data on the number of cases which came to the attention of school attendance officers and the gardaí is not readily available to my Department.</P>
      <P>The cost of operating the school attendance service in areas covered by school attendance committees in 1997 was £1.2 million approximately. The cost of enforcing the School Attendance Acts by the Garda Síochána is not available, as it is not possible to segregate this cost from the overall cost of the wider range of functions carried out by the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently engaged in the preparation of draft legislation to deal with the complex issues involved in non-school attendance. I hope to be in a position to publish draft legislation before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The question of the future organisation of school attendance services will be among the matters addressed in the legislation.</P>

      <P>Special arrangements are intended to allow an examination candidate every opportunity to demonstrate his-her level of attainment. The nature of these arrangements must also be such as to ensure that no candidate is given an unfair advantage over other candidates in the same examination.  This is essential in the interests of equity and fairness to all candidates and is, of course, vital to the integrity of our examinations.</P>
      <P>As Minister I have responsibility for the framing and review of policy in this sensitive and difficult area.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that the actual decision in an individual case, involving as it does a careful balancing of needs and responsibilities, is not one which should be taken by a Minister.  For this reason while the initial application is considered by my Department, the candidate has a right to appeal to a special arrangements appeal committee.  The majority of the members of this committee and its chairperson are external to my Department and it exists to consider individual cases in a thoroughly impartial manner.</P>
      <P>I am informed that following its consideration of this case the committee upheld the original decision and the school has been notified of this.</P>

    <P>The second-level course for the subject Irish, which is provided at foundation, ordinary and higher levels, has the capacity to cater for pupils <Col N="1058" /> with a wide range of abilities.  However, certain pupils may be allowed to substitute any other subject, from the list of approved subjects, for Irish in limited special circumstances which are outlined in Circular letter M10/94.  These pupils include those who have a specific learning disability of such a degree of severity that they fail to achieve expected levels of attainment in basis language skills in the mother tongue.</P>
    <P>School managements are authorised to grant exemptions from the study of Irish in accordance with prescribed procedures.  These include a written application made by a parent or guardian to the principal of the school, the preparation of a written report on the student by the school authorities in consultation with relevant teachers and, in the case of an application for exemption on the grounds of specific learning disability, the provision of a report from a qualified psychologist. Circular M10/94 sets out the criteria for determining whether a specific learning disability exists.  I am arranging for a copy of this circular to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In order to obtain an appreciation of the circumstances of this case, I have requested a report from the school authorities and on receipt of the necessary information my Department will deal with the matter on a priority basis.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the current school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are 193 one teacher primary schools with ten or more pupils in the country, which includes the school to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>Since there are no teaching posts available for allocation to these schools.  I am examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to one teacher schools.</P>

      <Quest>if the capitation charge for entry to third level colleges will be increased in 1998, in view of the fact that last year's substantial increase from £150 to £250 caused severe financial hardship to both students and their parents.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years and set for review this year.</P>
      <P>The universities have argued that the true cost of these charges would on average amount to £400 in the 1997-98 academic year and that, increasingly, the services have required subvention from other areas of their income.  The need for improved student services has also been highlighted by both the universities and the technological sector.  In the light of these arguments and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
      <P>I would point out that students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>I also requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The working group has now completed their work and the Higher Education Authority has recently issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions.  I have asked the authority to co-ordinate the review after six months, recommended by the working party, of the consultative procedures and their outcome.</P>
      <P>I have not taken any decisions about the future arrangements in relation to this charge.</P>
