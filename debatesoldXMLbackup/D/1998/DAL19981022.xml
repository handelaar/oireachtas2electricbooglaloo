        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil on the following issue of grave national importance, the jailing of two construction workers yesterday who were participating in a campaign against the black economy, tax evasion, the pressure that sees workers killed on building sites and public anger over the treatment of these building workers in contrast to the perceived leniency for others alleged to be involved in widespread tax evasion in the amount of tens of millions of pounds.</P>

Does the Government intend to refer this matter to the Law Reform Commission?  Will the Minister agree that is a delaying tactic on an issue that is extremely important to many house-holders?

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the gazumping Bill in the light of the very sad case that arose yesterday, which is one of many.  It is rumoured that the Government is proposing to refer this to the Law Reform Commission.  Everyone knows that will be a very lengthy process and will only delay it.  I would like clarification of the Government's intentions.  Also, if we reintroduced our Bill to the Order Paper, would the Minister be willing to refer it to Committee so that it could be dealt with speedily?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that legislation will be necessary to deal with gazumping since the voluntary code of practice said to be operating in the building industry is clearly not working and is highly unlikely to work?  The only way to give protection to house buyers is for the Government to introduce legislation which will tilt the balance away from builders and developers and back towards people who are trying to buy a home of their own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>One area of this industry that is causing great concern is small family owned hotels.  I do not accuse the Minister of sole responsibility for the problems in this area because I also tried to get his predecessor to take a more serious view of the matter.  It is unfair that family owned businesses such as these, many of which have been owned by the same family for generations, cannot get the necessary help to upgrade their premises and compete with larger concerns which have received grant aid through different structures.  If the Government is to be even handed in its dealings, it is essential that this group is looked after by whatever means are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred last Tuesday to the problem of roads, particularly the lack of progress on the N2 with regard to improvements and by-passes.  Today, I wish to put on record the marked improvement that has taken place in county roads in the region, especially in Cavan-Monaghan.  The previous Government more than doubled the funds available to those areas and, thankfully, the current Government has continued that policy.  The <Col N="1214" /> improvements certainly make life easier for people who live there.</P>
    <P>This is an even more important development from the point of view of tourism.  Tourists will no longer be stuck in potholes and ditches because of dreadful roads.  If we are to promote inland fisheries, particularly on the lakes and rivers in the Cavan-Monaghan area, the regional, county and by-roads are extremely important.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the increase in funding in the past three years is maintained and that further increases are made.  If significant progress is to be made to prepare these areas for the next century, particularly when there is reasonable funding available both through Europe and as a result of our buoyant economy, it is important that road infrastructure is developed.</P>
    <P>The road from the west through Clones and Monaghan to Omagh is as important as the road from Donegal and Derry to Dublin.  These are the two main axis routes that pass through Monaghan town.  The Omagh road will be extremely important if tourists are to be brought to Monaghan through Belfast, Larne and Stranraer.</P>
    <P>Tourism in Monaghan is in its infancy.  There are no tourist figures available for Monaghan, as the county tourism officer confirmed to me this morning.  The only figures available relate to the north-west region, which comprises Cavan-Monaghan, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.  The Minister will be relieved to hear that the figures indicate that 70 per cent of visitors to the region visit Donegal.  That shows how difficult the situation is for the tourism industry in Cavan and Monaghan. Another large percentage of those tourists visit Sligo as well, so only a small percentage visit Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>These counties have a long way to go.  They must seek more aid for their promotion, independent of the region, in the tourism market.  There are unique tourism possibilities in Cavan and Monaghan.  There is potential in working through cross-Border groups, such as the eastern and mid-Border regions.  More money should be invested in those sectors to ensure the area gets its fair share of the national tourism cake, which is extremely impressive at present.  Unless that income is spread more evenly, the lot of those who are committed to tourism in the Border area will not be improved.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about extending the holiday season.  Of relevance in this regard are the St. Patrick's Day parades and celebrations and the local organisations which are involved in them.  Through the activities of its county council and other organisations, Monaghan has built up strong relationships with parts of Canada and North America.  This morning I learned that 50 people in New Brunswick have organised to come to Monaghan to help us celebrate St. Patrick's Day next year.  At present a group from Monaghan is in Toronto and Peterborough trying to attract visitors.  In the Prince Edward Island-New Brunswick area we are talking about people who left Ireland in the 17th and 18th centuries.  People <Col N="1215" /> think most emigrants left Ireland as a result of the Famine, but those people left long before the Famine.  The fourth and fifth generations of descendants still want to know about their Irish roots.  The President spoke in Ballybay yesterday morning, and she has just returned from Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick.  She referred to the fact that there are so many Irish placenames in Canada such as Emyvale, Inniskeen and Ballybay.  In the Peterborough area there is North Monaghan, South Monaghan and Cavan.  I spoke once to over 100 people in the vocational school in Bailieboro, South Monaghan, Toronto, not in Cavan, Ireland.  The postmistress there sometimes gets letters for Cavan in Ireland rather than Cavan in Canada.</P>
    <P>We must spend money in promoting our activities among the descendants of those who went to New Brunswick in the 17th and 18th centuries, as well as among those who went to Toronto in the early part of this century.  The latter group is now retired and many of them live in Peterborough. They want to come back to Ireland, and tour operators in Canada are willing to set up charter flights for them.  We must do what we can through Bord Fáilte and other agencies to facilitate them, as it does not suit elderly people to go from Peterborough to Toronto, fly to London and then get another flight to Ireland.  If we can get them to come directly from Toronto to Aldergrove airport, for example, then we have a much better chance of co-operation with our friends and colleagues in the North.  The situation in New Brunswick is even worse, as people must get a flight to Halifax or Toronto first before flying to London in order to come to Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must look at these issues if we are to realise our tourism potential.  The President not only remarked on placenames but pointed out that one finds Irish names such as McKenna and Traynor in Canada.  The Peterborough newspaper carried an article about the visit I and my group made there.  We visited the Lord Mayor's chamber one morning and an old man was waiting outside the chamber who had left Monaghan at 13.  He just wanted to meet some friends from Monaghan, as he said.  Even at his great age he is considering a visit to Ireland.  This can have a spin-off effect if we use it properly.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing his bit in Cabinet to ensure that we get Objective One status, which is very important to the future of the Border and western regions.  There are major structural and aid deficits in our area and Objective One status gives us an opportunity to come into line with the rest of the country.  It is amazing to see the number of new hotels going up in Dublin, particularly those of the bigger consortiums.  However, one worries about the prices some of these groups charge, as overcharging will militate against return business.  Objective One status will provide better grant structures for our region that will allow facilities to be brought up to the standard necessary for the next century.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> The Leader, INTERREG and EU Peace and Reconciliation initiatives as well as the enterprise boards have helped, but in my experience there are so many committee structures involved with these programmes that there can be long delays in getting projects off the ground.  I hope that the new structures brought in after 1999 will mean that those regimes will be examined to ensure that areas get those funds as additional rather than replacement moneys.  I also hope we get them in the simplest possible way.  I know there must be accountability, which I favour, but if there are different groups such as INTERREG and the International Fund for Ireland involved a proposal can go from one committee to another before losing out.</P>
    <P>The Tidy Towns competition has played a major role in improving the appearance of our towns and villages.  That body and FÁS have been brilliant in helping our towns and villages enter the next century in good order, not derelict as they have been for the last 50 years.  I pay tribute to all those involved in the Tidy Towns groups as well as FÁS for using the talents of people who were unemployed but who may now get jobs as a result of these schemes.  That can only improve the country's economy.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill, which increases the statutory limit on the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid that may be paid to Bord Fáilte to support tourism capital development works from £22 million to £50 million.  I congratulate the Minister on providing an additional £5 million for special international marketing on a specific regional basis.  The western region has been provided with £185,000 for 1998, and that is the first time I have been aware of marketing money being spent in the west.  This is very important.  The activities the Minister mentioned, such as angling, golf, equestrian sports and walking holidays, are available throughout the whole country, but we have been marketing only the well known places for too long.  I am glad that money is now being spent on areas like east Galway and other parts of Connacht and the northwest that were not marketed in the past.  Facilities like the new interpretative centre in Aughrim, County Galway, have been well marketed and have proven very popular with tourists, together with golf courses, equestrian centres and the attractions of the rivers Suck and Shannon.  It is important to continue this so that when we link up with Shannon, our nearest international airport, tourists do not just go to Connemara but to other areas in the west.  For example, the interpretative centre that deals with the Battle of Aughrim is a great way for children to learn about the history of the area.  It is welcome that <Col N="1217" /> the benefits of the growth of tourism are spreading throughout the whole island.</P>
      <P>The cost of car hire is an area that concerns me.  The difficulties for tourists are obvious.  At Dublin Airport the signs for western routes are very poor.  The Government should examine that problem with a view to resolving it.  There is almost a conspiracy to bring people into Dublin city.  The sooner we have a rail link to Dublin Airport, the better, but we should have an improvement in road signs in the meantime.</P>
      <P>On the question of rail links, the Minister will be aware that the railway from Sligo to Limerick is in a bad state of repair.  The line is used mostly for pilgrimage traffic although increasingly it is being used for the carriage of timber to plants in Clonmel and the Louisiana Pacific plant in Waterford.  More money should be spent on this type of rail link, which is a both a regional and European rail link because Sligo-Limerick-Rosslare is a European route.  Tourists arriving in Rosslare, many without transport, complain about the difficulty in getting to the western region because of the lack of public transport. Tourists have to go to Dublin to get train connections to the west.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the draft discussion document on the development of tourism in the next round of EU Structural Funds.  While it is important to obtain Objective One status for the western, Border and midland regions, we must also get the funding necessary for infrastructure in the area.  The progress of the peace process is important also in the context of the Structural Funds.  The Minister should be congratulated on his preparations in that regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the funding given by successive Governments for the seaside resorts initiative, although I am aware there has been a conflict of opinion on the building of holiday homes and apartments in tourism areas.  Some local authorities were successful in planning these apartments and holiday homes but unfortunately others were not.  Criticism has been expressed that many holiday homes are vacant for most of the year, while too many holiday homes and apartments have been built in some areas.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the question of the holiday season, to which other speakers referred.  In some areas of the country the holiday season is short, although Galway is a good example of a city where some form of tourism event or festival takes place from St. Patrick's Day until the end of the year.  Planning for these events is done on a continuing basis and Galway should be congratulated on that.</P>
      <P>I support the small, family owned hotels which are the equivalent of small industries in many towns throughout the country.  They employ many staff and are a type of social centre for both young and old because of the no name clubs, discos, and various meetings held in them.  These hotels need support.  In the past they were not given adequate funds for marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand Dublin Corporation has a proposal <Col N="1218" /> for a hotel tax about which the Irish Hotels Federation is extremely annoyed.  The federation has a point because it is not fair that hoteliers should pay this tax when, for example, publicans and other business people in Dublin city who benefit from tourism will not have to pay it.</P>
    <P>A similar proposal was made regarding a £1 levy on visitors to the Aran Islands but that case is slightly different because the people living on the Aran Islands felt something should be done to provide a waste disposal system on the island. I understand there is a proposal currently before Galway County Council to bring all the refuse to the town of Ballinasloe, including waste from the Aran Islands.  It is important that this matter be resolved as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The real difficulty on the Aran Islands is the shortage of accommodation.  Tourists visit the area on day trips but fewer people stay on the islands because of the shortage of accommodation. That is also a difficulty in many parts of rural Ireland because there is insufficient marketing of short-term breaks to attract people to the western region.  Will the Minister ensure that some money is spent on this type of marketing?</P>
    <P>Additional money should be spent on regional airports.  More air carriers are needed at airports like Shannon and the international airport at Knock.  In my county of Galway, enormous benefit would be obtained if better road links could be provided to Shannon, our nearest international airport, and the airport at Knock.</P>
    <P>A great deal of money is spent on Dublin Airport which serves all the major air carriers and now has a new terminal.  When I visited Dublin Airport recently, there were five car parks in operation.  I welcome the enormous development taking place there but I hope that will not mean other airports throughout the country will be forgotten because these airports have proven to be very beneficial for industry and for people commuting to Dublin and on to the United Kingdom. More money should be spent on these airports.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals set out by the Minister in relation to EU Structural Funds and also the announcement made in August of £1.6 million in EU grant-aid for tourism projects countrywide.  I particularly welcome the fact that £65,000 will be provided for the Inisbofin Activity Centre.  I hope the Minister continues to promote the islands and the gaeltacht areas which are important.  I welcome also the Minister's announcement of grant assistance of £100,000 for the Shannon Oaks Hotel and Leisure Centre in Portumna, County Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the capability it will give Bord Fáilte of spending up to £50 million on capital projects.  That is an acknowledgement of the value of the work of Bord Fáilte but, more particularly, of the value to Ireland of the tourism industry which is fast becoming our largest industry.  When one considers that ten years ago we had 2.5 million visitors and that we now have five million, with revenue <Col N="1219" /> of £3 billion annually, it proves that the direction we took five or six years ago in developing our infrastructure is now paying dividends. It is also encouraging that, despite some of the difficulties the country faced this year, our targets are already up by 11 per cent.</P>
      <P>That is the reason we should focus on the role of Bord Fáilte in helping the tourism industry. Given that the money available to Bord Fáilte under this scheme is for capital projects, it is important to highlight the need for proper signs in towns, villages and cities.  We seldom see adequate signs for art galleries, museums, heritage centres or other attractions.  Despite the fact that we are in the Houses of Parliament, Oireachtas Éireann, I do not know if there is a sign anywhere in the city indicating where one might find Leinster House, unlike other capital cities where all roads lead to parliament.  It might be difficult to get in at the gate and it is certainly difficult to get a seat here.  If tourists are coming they should be able to observe this beautiful House, formerly owned by the Earl of Kildare.</P>
      <P>In many areas, particularly around Dublin, there are signs indicating where you are going but not where you are.  You know you are in Blackrock because there is a sign for Blackrock Shopping Centre.  You know you are in Sallynoggin because of the pub, The Noggin Inn.  You must be in Deansgrange if you are going past the cemetery.  If the local pub happens to be called the Wicked Wolf or the Horse and Hound, where are you?  There are no signs around the villages of Dublin to tell you where you are.  There is an area called Kill-o'-the-Grange in my constituency.  It has two churches &mdash; a Church of Ireland and a Catholic Church &mdash; and a Garda station but there is no sign to indicate it is Kill-o'-the-Grange.</P>
      <P>To advise people where they are, Bord Fáilte should encourage expenditure on signage, particularly around the Dublin area.</P>

Nuair a thagann tú isteach chomh fada le Leeson Street feiceann tú &ldquo;Sráid Chill Mhochairgáin Uacht&rdquo; ar thaobh amháin agus &ldquo;Sráid Líosáin&rdquo; ar an taobh eile.  Ní ceart go mbeadh sin ar siúl, mar tá stair, cultúr agus eolas na háite le feiceáil ins na logainmneacha agus ins na comharthaí bóithre.</P>

    <P>Nuair a fhéachann tú ar áit cosúil le Foster Avenue, fear ba ea é Foster, ach an Ghaeilge atá ar an áit ná Gleann na Mine atá i bhfad níos áilne agus i bhfad níos cruinne don áit mar a bhíodh fadó.  Ba mhaith liom freisin go mbeadh Gaeilge le feiceáil ins na hainmneacha dos na heastáit nua, eastáit tithíochta.  Smaoiním ar áiteacha ar <Col N="1220" /> nós Monaloe nó Meadow Vale, ainmneacha álainn ach níl aon Ghaeilge le feiceáil iontu. Molaim do Bhord Fáilte airgead a chaitheamh ar an nGaeilge a úsáid sna comharthaí bóithre chun na logainmneacha áitiúla a chaomhnú.</P>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire, which it is my pleasure to represent, is a seaside town, a resort in its own right which has about 150,000 to 170,000 day visitors each year travelling on the Stena Line and countless visitors coming by car.  The first thing you see when you get off the boat is a sign to tell you how to get out of Dún Laoghaire.  There is a large green sign which shows Belfast to the North, Galway to the west and Cork to the South.  Surely people should be encouraged to stay in Dún Laoghaire when they arrive.</P>
    <P>On the far side of the sea in Holyhead one can buy an inclusive ticket for the boat and train to a city centre.  If Bord Fáilte is to respond properly to the needs of local areas it should encourage people to stay in and around their landing point of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>If you follow the small sign &ldquo;tourist office&rdquo; and arrive at the Bord Fáilte office you will find it is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., six days per week. The first boat arrives at 6.05 a.m. &mdash; four hours before the tourist office opens.  The last boat arrives at 8.05 p.m., two hours after the office has closed.  What kind of service is Bord Fáilte providing to visitors arriving in Dún Laoghaire?  If you wish to telephone the local Bord Fáilte office you cannot do so.  It does not have a direct line and one can only get through to a central Dublin office.  It will make the reservations and provide basic information.  I telephoned the office yesterday to ask for basic tourist information about the Dún Laoghaire area.  It was able to give me phone numbers to contact the Dalkey Heritage Centre because it did not know the opening times.  It was not able to tell me about forthcoming events, such as the Dún Laoghaire 1500.  It was able to list the events which had taken place but that is not much use to a tourist coming to Dún Laoghaire in October 1998.</P>
    <P>A local tourist office, properly manned with a direct telephone line, would be able to give this information and everything should not be channelled through a central Dublin office.  Bord Fáilte is failing in its duty to Dún Laoghaire, an area which has its attractions and a thriving business. I understand that years ago there were 16 hotels on the seafront of Dún Laoghaire, a time when the pier area was lit up and people were encouraged to come and spend time there, bands played and there was general entertainment. There are no more than three hotels now but there are a number of excellent hotels in the outlying areas.  There are some excellent bed and breakfast facilities but no encouragement is given to those arriving in Dún Laoghaire to stay there.</P>
    <P>There is a threat that the Maritime Museum based in Dún Laoghaire is to be moved to the city centre.  I see no reason why that museum which has been situated by the sea in Dún <Col N="1221" /> Laoghaire for a number of years should be under threat of moving to the city centre.  As a tourist attraction and a welcome addition to the area, it should remain there.</P>
    <P>There are many other attractions such as the Joyce Tower, but it takes a long time to find the sign indicating how to get there.  Gentlemen still manage to find their way to the forty foot which displays a lovely sign &ldquo;gentlemen's bathing place&rdquo;.  I understand it is an attractive place for Japanese tourists to take photographs.</P>
    <P>These are the facilities the thriving town of Dún Laoghaire has to offer which are being ignored by Bord Fáilte.  I suggest the Minister ask Bord Fáilte to look at the service it is offering all seaside resorts throughout the country, including the Dublin area.  We have an ideal opportunity to develop our tourism industry.  The peace process will bring benefits to the whole of Ireland.  Now is the time to capitalise on that agus chun fíor chaoin fáilte a chur roimh thurasóirí chun na tíre seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tourist Traffic Bill.  The increased allocation from £22 million to £50 million to support tourism capital development is welcome.  It is an indication of the type of development and level of commitment and buoyancy in our tourism industry.  Many speakers have said the tourism industry is the second largest sector in our economy and the second largest employer.  I have no doubt it will continue to grow, given the developments which have taken place in the past years.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Hanafin on the issue of signage but I could give similar details of counties Sligo and Leitrim.  Signage is a major aspect of tourism.  We are a small country but if we are to attract 5 million visitors per year it would be beneficial if they knew where they were going, at least part of the time.  If the Minister and his colleague, the Minister of State, can secure more funding for local authorities for the provision of signage this would be worthwhile.</P>
      <P>The decision taken a number of years ago by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte to market Ireland as one entity was a very courageous and correct one.  We are a small island on the periphery of Europe with a unique tourism product to sell.  We have all spoken about the peace dividend and those of us from the Border region can see the benefit of the peace process. We hope that process will continue to develop and that the present difficulties will be overcome so that people can be assured peace will come to the entire country over the next few months and years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A shining example of the co-operation between the tourist operators North and South of the Border was the development of the Shannon-Erne link, or the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, which has been up and running for five or six years.  I come from Ballinamore and there is a large amount of tourist traffic in both directions on the canal between the South and Enniskillen <Col N="1222" /> and Lough Erne.  There was great difficulty at the start in getting tourist operators to trust one another and very few cruise hire craft came across the Border from Northern Ireland in the first year.  However, this traffic has increased dramatically over the past couple of years, which shows the good work that can be done by tourist interests on both sides of the Border when trust is established.  The Border is only an imaginary line in terms of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal and no one has any great difficulty traversing it, which shows how tourism can develop through the peace process.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Crawford, spoke about Belfast Airport, which can play a very effective role in bringing tourists into Northern Ireland and the Border regions, and also into the Minister's constituency.  I assume the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte will work together on bringing tourists to that airport, in the hope that they will also go as far as the Border counties and the rest of the South.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry must examine what is necessary for its further development.  Some amazing capital projects have taken place over the past ten years.  The people involved in the development of magnificent hotels in every region must be complimented.  The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation must also be congratulated on grant aiding those fine establishments. There are now good four or five star hotels with leisure facilities in every part of Ireland.  It was very necessary to develop such hotels but I am not sure we need any more of them.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have referred to small, family-run establishments.  There is a difficulty in that sector.  Ireland's unique selling point is that it is green and the people are friendly, which allows us to sell a different tourist product from that on the international market.  Family-run hotels can play a major role in that regard.  Coarse fishing is a major tourist attraction in my area and proprietors of B&amp;Bs and small family-run hotels there are very dependent on British and continental tourists.  Bord Fáilte and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation ignored family-run hotels in order to create larger hotels, of which we probably now have enough.  However, family-run hotels should not be grant aided. Many operators in various industries received grants over the past 50 years to establish businesses but five or six years later the business was gone because they were thinking of how to get a grant rather than how to run a sustaining business.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the concept of giving low interest loans to family-run hotels. Interest rates are currently low for commercial loans, but the owner of a 20 bedroom family-run hotel who wants to extend it and is really interested in sustaining their business would take the opportunity of a loan which is guaranteed at 2 per cent over ten or 15 years.  That would be better than giving them a grant of £50,000 or <Col N="1223" /> £60,000 which they would put against their capital outlay for some time and would then find themselves in financial difficulties.  I ask the Minister to consider the concept of low interest loans instead of grants.</P>
    <P>Members have spoken about infrastructure development.  Access to the regions is extremely important.  The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation does not provide funding for infrastructural development, that comes within the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  However, good road and rail links into the regions would greatly improve accessibility.  If one takes the example of the Dublin to Sligo rail line, some money will be spent on the section between Dublin and Carrick-on-Shannon but there is a difficulty at present between Carrick-on-Shannon and Sligo.  If that infrastructural development does not take place it will be more difficult to attract tourists into the area.</P>
    <P>There are regional airports in most large provincial centres.  Sligo regional airport at Strandhill, with two flights a day during the summer, has played a great role in bringing both tourists and industry into the area.  The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation can play an important role by stating how important access and regional airports are for the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>Coarse fishing in my area provides difficulties for local authorities.  There is a large number of lakes with poor accessibility from small county roads, some of which have no one living along them, which means they are not a priority for local authorities.  However, it is a major priority for tourism interests.  If I, as a member of Leitrim County Council, ask the local engineer to resurface a certain road he will tell me that another road on which ten families are living also needs to be resurfaced.  The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation used to make grant aid available to local authorities for that type of work.  Perhaps it is something which should be reconsidered in the context of grant aid given by the Department of the Environment and Local Government for county road developments.  Some of this money should be specifically made available for tourism accessibility.  These are the types of issues which the tourism industry and the Minister should look at.  We have the potential to grow much further. The tourism industry will probably become the most important indigenous industry.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the internet and modern forms of communication and technology we must be at the forefront in marketing.  Marketing Ireland is not a difficult job but an important one. There is great reluctance to provide much money for marketing because people do not see a structure where £10 million or £20 million is spent on marketing.  The world is becoming a smaller place and Ireland is becoming more accessible.  More work needs to be done and marketing is extremely important.</P>
    <P>The Minister visited Sligo last week to launch <Col N="1224" /> the new plan to market County Sligo.  The work undertaken by Colette O'Brien, the marketing officer, Sligo Corporation, Sligo County Council and the private tourism industry was very worthwhile. I was very impressed with the progress they made and the idea behind it which was very modern.  It is necessary for all counties and regional tourism areas to adopt that marketing ploy in the indigenous and world markets.</P>
    <P>Much work remains to be done in the tourism sector.  Although we have five million visitors per year, we can increase that number significantly. There are many sustainable jobs in the industry. I wish the Minister well in his portfolio and welcome the increase from £22 million to £50 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am conscious that it is about 26 years since I, in my first Cabinet responsibility, was appointed Minister for Transport and Power in late 1972.  It is significant that the Minister before the House today has responsibility not for transport and power but for tourism, sport and recreation.  It has now been recognised as a vital component not only in the national economy, but also in the development and projection of our national image &mdash; our culture and attraction to other people &mdash; which is essential if we are to explore and realise the full potential here.</P>
      <P>The Minister's comprehensive address covers almost all aspects of this very dynamic sector and gives a positive signal of the Government's priorities in not only maintaining the momentum of recent times but in ensuring that we continue to stay ahead of even our keenest competitors in Europe, as we are doing in so many other sectors.</P>
      <P>My contribution will be broad, although many colleagues will refer to specifics.  Perhaps the best contribution I can make is to highlight broad parameters which will undoubtedly encourage the Minister, his Department and the Government to continue in what they are doing.  What attracts people to go to a country?  The first thing will be character and culture of the place and the general impression of the people.  Is it the type of place in which one could relax and be replenished after a visit?  That is a focus we should not forget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For me, the country other than Ireland, which offers that is Italy.  Each time I get the opportunity to go abroad, it will be to Italy because of its history, culture, friendship and the general disposition and excitement of the Italian personality. It is important for us to see ourselves as others see us and it is vitally important that we continue to project a positive imagine.  We have a tendency, as Chesterton said, to be very honest people and never speak well of each other.  The other way to look at that is to consider what Robbie Burns, the Scottish poet, said, &ldquo;would that God give the gift to see ourselves as others see us!&rdquo;.  When he said that he wanted to bring the Scots down a peg.  It is ironic that if we applied it, it would give us a boost because the attitude to Ireland of those outside is very much warmer <Col N="1225" /> and more positive than that which we get at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister must continue to work effectively on our positive image.  In the areas of tourism, sport and recreation, we should continue to project a positive image on all occasions.  That will be the real guarantee of the wish and readiness of people to spend a time here and to go back having experienced something which they could not experience in their own environments.</P>
    <P>Up to some years ago the significance of tourism, recreation and sport was not recognised and the Minister is playing a dynamic role in that regard.  I pay tribute to the unknown supporter.  I remember listening to a radio interview when the Irish soccer team, under Jack Charlton, was doing very well and Irish supporters were travelling around the world conveying the impression of happy people who even in defeat could celebrate the fact that they were a sporting, generally generous and happy people.</P>
    <P>I recall listening to a Dub on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; show.  He said in his own inimitable style that football supporters were doing great work for Ireland and that everywhere they went people said they were a very sporting crowd and were doing a lot for Ireland following the team around the world.  He said he thought they should be subsidised by the Government.  Our immediate reaction was to say that the Dubs would try anything. In a sense, there was something to that comment, although not in terms of giving a subsidy from the Government.  We could not overestimate the impact made by these sporting Dubs or those from Cork, Donegal or wherever and I was privileged to see it in Stuttgart and Rome.</P>
    <P>I remember in Rome when we were eventually defeated by Italy in the World Cup one could not buy all the talk about Ireland on Italian radio and television.  I was watching all the coverage and listening to the radio &mdash; I was even interviewed myself &mdash; and we could not have bought all the talk on Italian radio and television about the <i>quaesto sportivo Irlandeses</i>, the sporting Irish crowd.  If we had beaten Italy they might not have had the same view, but one could not overstate the impact on the Italian people.  I appreciate it is only one element of the market but the increase in tourists from Italy to Ireland, which will continue, derives to a large extent from that time.  This is why it is important to promote the general image.</P>
    <P>The other image which is of considerable importance is one of a people who are deeply rooted in their past, have a great sense of heritage and culture and a great sense of confidence for the future.  This applies particularly to our young people.  Undoubtedly, the impression abroad, which may cause problems for us in terms of Structural Funds and other areas, is of a dynamic, efficient and exciting country.  This is hugely important and is where the collective role of Government comes into play.  The Minister's role is to prioritise that aspect and exploit every opportunity with Bord Fáilte to make people conscious <Col N="1226" /> that when they come to Ireland they will get only the best.  Therefore, it is essential to minimise and eliminate the barriers which are imposed occasionally and which obstruct that positive image.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a number of positive dimensions, including our environment, our culture, the fact that it is an island country and part of Europe, our dynamic young people and the <i>sportivo Irlandeses.</i>  We also have a different climate from the rest of Europe, but this should never be viewed as a negative aspect.  I have friends from the south of France and Italy who come to Ireland every year.  If they did not experience the unique climate in the west, which would not necessarily attract me to County Mayo at this time of year, they would feel they has missed a very special feature.</P>
    <P>The weather should be considered as an escape for people who are not stimulated by the dreary pattern of the sun coming up in the morning and going down in the evening every day with almost intolerable heat and oppression.  What appears to us to be a negative aspect can also be presented as a positive aspect.  Walking the by-roads and hills of County Mayo or County Galway in lovely soft rain is celebrated in many of the films made about Ireland.  They focus almost exclusively on the variety of shade, culture, mist and rain which may be an unwelcome feature for us of this beautiful land.  However, we should build on the good points and present as positive what some of us see as negative aspects.</P>
    <P>It is important to avoid man made obstructions. I remember a Dutch colleague of mine on the Council of Ministers saying to me that if the Irish people lived in Holland they would have poisoned themselves out of existence years previously. He loved Ireland and came here regularly, but he said there are only four million people on the island, which is three times the size of Holland, and he could not understand how we allowed such awful pollution in our cities.  He wanted to know how we could tolerate the pollution caused by our public transport service.</P>
    <P>Dublin is a very attractive destination, but I am tired beyond belief of acting as a one man environmental custodian in respect of Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath.  I have telephoned the maintenance department and engineers of Dublin Bus innumerable times to complain about the poison being poured onto our streets from buses which are not properly maintained or which are gone well beyond their active and useful life. Some of these buses are still on our streets.  The last time I telephoned I said I was tired of getting the same explanations all the time.  I note the time of each bus and its location so there can be no doubt about it, but I receive almost the same response every time, that they will look into the matter and that it should not have happened.</P>
    <P>It is time a definite signal was sent to all the transport authorities, particularly those subsidised by the State, that this is unacceptable and penalties will be imposed.  People who come to <Col N="1227" /> Ireland in the summer get for their pleasure a channel of poison from buses in front of them.  I heard this morning on the radio about a conference which is being held at present on the effect of traffic fumes and the point that they contain significant carcinogenic elements.  The fumes poison the atmosphere and this cannot be tolerated further.</P>
    <P>If we can produce the best standards on many fronts, we should be ruthless in protecting our environmental inheritance.  There are guardians of the peace and other areas.  Perhaps it is time to have guardians of the air and our environment. It would be a positive step if people who use cars, trucks and buses which are poisonous pollutants were watched regularly and penalised.  It is not only a matter of the environment and attracting visitors, it is also an offence to the character of the country and a serious health hazard.</P>
    <P>Although it is not the Minister's immediate responsibility, another feature with which we must cope is, I am sure, a matter of constant concern and priority for him and his Department. The congestion on our roads has become a huge problem in addition to the adequacy of our infrastructure for people who come to Ireland.  It is a matter of considerable regret and sadness that a high proportion of those killed in the increasing number of fatal road accidents are visitors.  This aspect must be a source of concern.  The problem is not exclusive to Ireland, but it is essential to take every possible opportunity to open new networks or restore old networks that will remove traffic congestion from the roads, improve driving standards and guarantee safety and stability.  This is vitally important.</P>
    <P>We have a rail network to the west and north-west. The network to my area of Tipperary is supposed to be priority one, but I have doubts about that in the context of north Tipperary.  In common with Deputy Ring, I have an affinity for Mayo and I will not knock the priority given to that area.  In my area, there is a direct line to Lough Derg and its surrounding beautiful area which could be developed.  The rail service from Dublin to Portlaoise, Roscrea, Nenagh and Limerick belongs not to the last century but to the century before.  An improvement in the standard and comfort of the carriages would encourage people to use the service.  This would also take traffic off the roads.  Instead of driving to Killarney it should be possible to take one's car by train.  This is the norm in Europe and the Minister should raise this issue with his colleagues.  It is worth looking at the potential for increasing the capacity of our rail network.  It is clean and could be very efficient, and would get rid of the negative image created by congestion and pollution.</P>
    <P>I have some experience of travelling around Europe by scooter and car.  However, the signage is so effective that I never risk losing my way, even given the large amount of traffic.  When one enters a large city one sees signs reading &ldquo;<i>Toutes Directions</i>&rdquo;.  Our signage is totally inadequate by <Col N="1228" /> these standards.  I wonder how foreign tourists find their way around as I sometimes find it difficult myself.  One has to strain one's eyes to see the signage at junctions on the new arterial roads, especially at night.  This is the case on the Portlaoise road which I know well and it is difficult to identify which road is the slip road to Dublin. This is not good enough.  Directions should be writ large &mdash; way ahead and way behind.</P>
    <P>The traffic lights on these roads are also inadequate. Everywhere else one travels, there are large traffic lights overhead.  I do not know how tourists make their way at night given the small traffic lights at the sides of roads.  How are they expected to see these lights?  This is an obvious disability which is self-imposed and must be corrected. Let us follow the example of other countries and put clear signs overhead, particularly on motorways, rather than small signposts and traffic lights which one must strain one's eyes to see.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the peace process is of vital importance.  I acknowledge that English visitors have always formed the basis of our tourism business and that there is a special friendship between our two peoples.  I would encourage the Minister in this direction.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you and I are members of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and are conscious of the deep font of goodwill which exists among our colleagues.  I am sure this is the case at every level at which the Irish and English meet, whether in sport, politics or elsewhere.  Hopefully the peace process will continue to succeed.  It is important that we generously acknowledge that the British people are especially welcome.  They have given a welcome to Irish people over the years when they needed it and they appreciate it when that welcome is returned.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement.  I have made some broad comments and will leave it to others to be more precise.  The unique projections for Ireland will be realised if we continue on this path.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I met Deputy O'Kennedy in Stuttgart when he was a Minister and I was travelling with the Irish supporters.  I was not a Member of this House at that time.  It was the only time I ever went on holidays outside Ireland.  The Deputy is correct that the Irish people are wonderful ambassadors.  On that occasion they sold the country well and gave a very positive image.</P>
      <P>In a shop in Dublin yesterday the lady behind the counter never said &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; or &ldquo;Goodbye&rdquo;. She talked to her colleagues and threw out my purchase.  When she gave me my change she did not say &ldquo;Goodbye&rdquo;.  That is a bad image.  I hope we do not lose our friendly image as a result of the Celtic tiger.  Such an incident would not happen in the west.  The people there are lovely and I am glad that Deputy O'Kennedy likes visiting the west.  We have a marvellous product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy's comments on signage.  The largest number of complaints <Col N="1229" /> received by Bord Fáilte over the past 20 years have concerned signage, yet no Government has addressed this problem.  Deputy O'Kennedy spoke about traffic lights.  When one is driving and there is an adjacent road, one cannot distinguish which set of traffic lights refers to which road.  One does not know whether to stop or go as the lights are so close together.  These signs are clearly marked overhead in Europe.</P>
    <P>From experience in my own county, I know that the greatest resistance to tackling this problem comes from county councils.  If councils will not do something about this problem, I cannot understand why they will not allow business people or community groups to erect signs.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and this House should issue a directive on this matter and proper funding should be put in place for signage.  The current situation is disgraceful. We encourage people to come here to spend their hard earned money.  I have made this point at many county council meetings.</P>
    <P>There is a small area in the west where the council will not even cut the hedges.  People bring cars from the Continent and visit tourist attractions. Some of them have accidents and have a bad impression of Ireland when they leave.  If we bring people to this country we should cut the hedges and erect proper signage.  People should be encouraged to come here but they should be helped and not have obstacles put in their way.</P>
    <P>I wish to be critical of Bord Fáilte.  Successive Ministers for Tourism have stated that Bord Fáilte would be revitalised, yet no one has had the courage or ability to do so.  Bord Fáilte must be shaken up from top to bottom.  Over the past number of years it has failed to bring tourists into this country.  The Minister's report points out the major increase in tourism figures.  However, as someone who comes from the west and sees what is happening on the ground, the last three years have been disastrous for tourism.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte gets its figures from the Central Statistics Office.  However, if one travels to England in the morning and returns that night, one is counted as a tourist.  This is how Bord Fáilte justifies its figures.  I do not care what it says &mdash; we have had three disastrous years.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte insists that we have had marvellous growth in tourism.  It also points out that we have a great product and that large amounts of money have been generated for the Exchequer.  This is not true.  Bord Fáilte has failed over the past three years in my region.  I do not care if it tries to justify its figures; it has failed the people in the west and the tourism industry for many years.  I hope the Minister takes on Bord Fáilte as it needs to be shaken up.</P>
    <P>I recall going into a tourist office in New York in 1984; the small office which was located at the front of a big building was staffed by one person and stocked a few brochures on Killarney.  It probably cost a fortune to keep that office open. I hope it has improved since then because I was not at all impressed by the facilities on offer.  No <Col N="1230" /> brochures at all were available on the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Tour de France was the greatest con job ever to come into this country.  We derived no benefit from it.  The French wanted to move the tour out of France for the weekend in question because the World Cup final was being held in Paris.  I suppose somebody had a good time but there was no tangible return from it.  In spite of what the experts in Bord Fáilte may say, the event was a waste of Irish taxpayers' money .</P>
    <P>One of the greatest disasters in the west of Ireland relates to the Shannon stopover and we, in the west, have paid the penalty for that in recent years.  Since the advent of direct flights into Dublin, the number of visitors, particularly Americans, into the west has decreased.  It is wrong that everything is oriented towards Dublin. I note that the new national conference centre will be located in Dublin.  If one left this House this afternoon, it would take half an hour to reach Heuston station; if one left at six o'clock, it would take an hour and a half.  Why could the national conference centre not be located in Knock or somewhere else in Mayo?  The county is served by an airport.  Such a move would reduce some of the gridlock in Dublin and would benefit tourism in Mayo and the west.  The west should be given a chance.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Taoiseach spoke about the proposed new national stadium.  The stadium will not be located in Westport, Castlebar, Knock or Kiltimagh, but in Dublin.  The Leas Cheann Comhairle comes from rural Ireland and is Chairman of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party; he should tell the Taoiseach there are other options aside from Dublin.</P>
    <P>I come from the beautiful town of Westport. Thousands of visitors come into the town each year, no thanks to Bord Fáilte.  The people of Westport and Westport Tourism Organisation are responsible for that.  The organisation collected money locally and marketed Westport with very little assistance from Bord Fáilte.  Members of Bord Fáilte might visit the town for an AGM and stay in the best of hotels but the Westport Tourism Organisation is responsible for the promotion of tourism in the area.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte can no longer be depended on; I, for one, have no confidence in it.  I hope the Minister will direct some of the increased funding into the regions.  County Mayo and other counties should have their own tourism committees in order that they could sell their regions.  Bodies such as Bord Fáilte and Ireland West are mere talking shops.  I would love to see regional committees being given the funding to sell their own counties.</P>
    <P>Visitors come to Westport on a year-round basis.  I compliment the former Minister Deputy Kenny on the seaside resorts scheme which, although it had some faults, also had its good points.  Some difficulties were experienced in regard to housing and rented accommodation. There are several top of the range family run <Col N="1231" /> hotels in Westport.  I compliment all of the families involved, who, with some assistance from the State, put their own money up front.  The hotels in Westport are as good as any worldwide.  We had to battle with Bord Fáilte for grant aid towards the development of a leisure centre, which would not have been forthcoming but for the efforts of the former Minister, Deputy Kenny. I hope the facility will be opened sometime next year.  I would be delighted to welcome the Minister to the opening.  The Taoiseach turned the sod although he did not help in the provision of funding.</P>
    <P>It is time family run hotels were given greater assistance.  Some of these, particularly in rural areas, are only open for 14 or 15 weeks of the year.  Yet the county councils and the State expect them to pay rates for the full 12 months of the year.  That issue could perhaps be examined with the possible application of a half year rate.  Grants should be made available to upgrade these hotels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Daly will have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  He spoke a great deal about the Shannon stopover but changed his mind when a decision was made.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see there is a shortage of people to take up jobs in the tourism industry. For many years, people were not fairly paid in the industry and chefs, waiters and barpersons will have to be fairly paid now.  The tourism industry got away with murder for too long and people were not getting just reward for their time and effort.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the roads infrastructure and train service in the west Deputy O'Kennedy referred to Objective One status and it is important that it is secured.  The west must get its fair share of the national cake but that has not been the case to date.  Funding is required for the Westport to Athlone road which is one of the worst stretches of road in the country.  It is difficult to attract people into the region when there is no proper roads infrastructure.  I hope the Minister will use his influence to get action on this matter.  The National Roads Authority is responsible for roads infrastructure and development but its members are not publicly elected.  I read the NRA report and if we have to wait for it to take action, we will not have many tourists in the west for the next 20 years.  The NRA do not have many plans to spend money in the west, it is all for the east coast.  We will fight that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a report on the Cabinet table on the Athlone-Dublin railway line.  We got away with a warning on this issue a number of months ago. The budget and Estimates are currently being drafted and I hope the Minister for Public Enterprise will receive a major allocation of <Col N="1232" /> money for that line.  This Government and the next will be held responsible if anything goes wrong.  I know what is contained in that report, as do other Members of the House, and I hope funding will be put in place.  We have waited long enough for it.</P>
    <P>Knock Airport is a wonderful resource in the west.  I hope this Government will support and assist its development in regard to water, sewerage and other infrastructural facilities.  The airport can become the Shannon of the west.  People no longer want to be inconvenienced; they want to be able to reach their destinations without difficulty.</P>
    <P>Another issue is bed and breakfasts which are not registered with Bord Fáilte.  I hope the Minister, the Government and Bord Fáilte never take the bread out of the mouths of the small people. I know the Government has not been too helpful to the small people in the context of the last budget and I have seen what has happened in relation to social welfare.  I am referring to unregistered bed and breakfasts run by those who have one or two extra bedrooms in their house. The money generated by providing B&amp;B accommodation has educated many sons and daughters. Why should they be registered with Bord Fáilte?</P>
    <P>I know people who are registered and to whom no tourists have been sent by Bord Fáilte for the past ten years.  These people are beginning to realise there is no need to register with Bord Fáilte.  I have encouraged many of them not to register but rather to sell their service themselves. Now there is talk about outlawing B&amp;Bs which are not registered with Bord Fáilte.  I and many others will oppose any such move and I hope it will never happen.  What is wrong with an individual who has a spare bedroom or two keeping a few tourists?  Is this not the image of Ireland and are these not the people who will be talking to tourists and encouraging them to visit?  These are the real Irish people and I see nothing wrong with them making a few pounds.</P>
    <P>Over-pricing has been creeping into the industry in recent years.  We must give people value for money.  People start overcharging because certain regions and areas are doing well and they know visitors will come.  There is plenty of competition in the market and people can fly all over the world at a reasonable price.  Those in the tourism industry must realise people will not come to Ireland if they do not get value for money.  I hope those in the industry will not clean out people whom they get for five, six, ten or 12 weeks in the summer but that they will give them value for money.  Over-charging people will damage the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy spoke about the English market, which we have ignored in recent years. England is the nearest country to us and the people have much in common with us.  We should be marketing Ireland there.  It should be easier to get English people to visit here given the Agreement in Northern Ireland.  In the past they had visions of trouble and bombs which no longer <Col N="1233" /> exist.  I hope Bord Fáilte will try to market Ireland in England and encourage people to visit. English tourists spend money and enjoy themselves and it is great to see them coming here.  I hope they will be targeted in a special way this year as we are not getting the number of English tourists we should because Ireland is not being sold in the way it should.  Please God we will never see another bomb in Northern Ireland and I hope we will have many more English visitors coming to the country.</P>
    <P>In relation to grant aid, there are many organisations, including Leader programmes, promoting their own areas.  We depend on tourism.  The west has not got many jobs from the IDA or the last few Governments, and that is borne out by statistics. The west has the most beautiful product in the world and the most beautiful people.  All we are asking of the Government and Bord Fáilte is fair play.  We are not out with the begging bowl. We have what it takes and those who come to the west return again.  I ask the Minister and Bord Fáilte to give us a fair share of the national cake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Daly.  It was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning that more than 11 million passengers used Cork, Dublin and Shannon airports during the first nine months of the year, according to figures released by Aer Rianta.  The largest increase was in Dublin Airport through which more than nine million passengers passed, an increase of 12 per cent compared with the same period last year. This is phenomenal by any stretch of the imagination. The tourism policy being pursued by the Government is obviously attracting many visitors.</P>
      <P>We were and hopefully are still known as Ireland of the welcomes, of the céad míle fáilte. However, the product is so successful and so intensively marketed there is a grave danger of us becoming quite impersonal.  Deputy Ring mentioned his experience yesterday of an attendant in a shop who hardly thought it worth her while to pay attention to his needs.  This is becoming increasingly prevalent in many aspects of the tourism industry, be it in restaurants, shops, hiring a taxi or travelling on a bus.  The training agencies charged with training staff for the tourism industry ought to examine this issue very carefully.  I am not suggesting it is necessary to return to the colour postcards of the John Hinde era, but we have a very interesting and warm product and we should ensure it is sold in as open and welcoming a manner as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the very high increase in passenger traffic through Dublin Airport and this brings to mind a number of key issues for the city.  Outgoing passengers at Dublin Airport find the place is filled with surface carparks.  It is necessary to leave home at least an hour earlier than normal in order to find a suitable parking place.  The surface carparks on the northside of Dublin look dreadful. Surely Aer Rianta, in conjunction with the planning authorities, can come up with a more <Col N="1234" /> suitable form of stacking cars in multi-storey car parks so people can access flights quicker.</P>
    <P>The bus link between Dublin Airport and the city is nothing short of disgraceful, as mentioned by Deputy O'Kennedy.  It is wholly and totally inadequate.  Time after time I have seen backpackers in particular trying to board the bus with rucksacks, having to stand in often damp and hostile conditions.  Surely Bus Éireann or Dublin Bus, whichever provides the link to Dublin city, can do better.</P>
    <P>Getting a taxi at Dublin Airport is almost like a lottery.  I hear constant complaints from tourists who claim it is next to impossible to get a taxi.  I have heard complaints from taxi drivers that they are not allowed queue where they used to and that, therefore, people have to wait longer.  The taxi driver is often the first contact a tourist has with Ireland and the city.  It is critically important that taxi drivers have good quality cars which are well maintained, that they are friendly, conversant with the city, can tell tourists about the good places for eating out and entertainment and do not take tourists all over the city on a tourism trail.  We have heard stories of rip-offs by taxi drivers. Such occurrences are isolated, but all that is necessary for the city to get a very poor reputation is one isolated incident.</P>
    <P>It has taken a hell of a long time to promote Dublin as a tourism destination.  I remember when Dublin celebrated its millennium and when it was European city of culture.  Many of us worked very hard with the company established at the time to promote Dublin as a tourism destination. Tourists flew into Dublin or came through Dún Laoghaire or the North Wall and headed straight down to Deputy Ring's part of the country. I find it very hard to be sympathetic with people from the west and south-west.  Dublin city has been only recently a beneficiary of the tourism boom.</P>
    <P>It is critical that when tourists make their way into the city they can find affordable accommodation. There is a proliferation of hotel accommodation in Dublin city, but I am not sure it is as well regulated as it should be.  At the upper end of the market there are high quality service, good standards and well trained staff and one could not ask for more, but at the budget end of the market I am not sure the same effort is put into training staff, monitoring standards and marketing the product.  Bord Fáilte, Dublin Tourism and others involved in tourism should examine this area.</P>
    <P>Regarding the contentious subject of marketing the tourism product, the City Manager, John Fitzgerald, examined options to raise finance for Dublin city.  One proposal is a levy on bedroom occupancy in the city.  No one is anxious to introduce another tax, but we need to promote the city's attractions and make it cleaner.  The level of litter in the city is appalling.  Unlike French cities where the streets are washed every morning, our streets are filthy.  Grafton Street and Henry Street are embedded with chewing gum and the cobbledstone paving which were put down ten years <Col N="1235" /> ago is coming apart.  The city authorities need the freedom to raise additional finance to make the city more attractive, affordable and to develop additional tourism products.</P>
    <P>The city ought to be involved as partners in the proposed national conference centre and the national stadium.  I welcome the Government's proposal to establish a national stadium.  It is an excellent idea and it would be a good idea to locate it along the rim of the M50, adjacent to Dublin Airport.  That is an accessible location and would attract many more tourists to the city.</P>
    <P>The Acting Chairman through his many involvements will know that the city has been a beneficiary of the Bacon bequest to the Hugh Lane Gallery, a very significant bequest in the artistic world.  We are also in the process of developing a municipal theatre for the city.  We should not have to go cap in hand to the Minister for Finance to seek £500,000 or £1 million from lottery funds.  Much more money is required to provide what is needed in this city and throughout the country and access to resources is required to ensure what is needed is provided.</P>
    <P>I am not certain the public have got the message that plastic bags in bushes and hedgerows, overflowing rubbish bins and full ashtrays in hotel foyers are unacceptable.  Standards which apply in other countries ought to apply here.  Our population is well travelled and there is no reason our people cannot do at home what they do abroad. People know that if they infringe litter laws abroad they will be prosecuted on sight, but litter laws here are not enforced to the same extent.</P>
    <P>Linked to the litter problem is the atrocious state of many of our beaches.  We have a number of very fine beaches in the Dublin area, but how many of them attract blue flags?  I am not sure any do.  Many tourists visit beaches in the Dublin area and throughout the country.  I visited a beach in my home area in Inch, County Kerry, which was awarded a blue flag, but I was saddened by the amount of flotsam and jetsam on that beach.  I am not sure we understand the standards tourists expect us to maintain.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way in catering for tourists by extending the season.  The Minister referred to the St. Patrick's Day celebrations and he must be commended for the support he has given to the St. Patrick's Day Parade committee. There is also the Cork Jazz Festival and initiatives such as the 1798 celebrations.  Those are great initiatives and have attracted many tourists to this country.  Heritage tourism has not been sufficiently tapped into.  American and Australian tourists are attracted to this country because they enjoy tracing their ancestors through archival material available in churches and schools.</P>
    <P>There is a skills shortage in the hotel and tourism sector.  It was not today or yesterday that the phenomenon of low wages was raised in the tourism industry.  It is long past time the tourism sector faced up to its responsibilities and paid all those employed in the sector a level of wages <Col N="1236" /> similar to that which applies elsewhere in industry. It is also long past time that the conditions under which those staff work were similar to those that apply elsewhere.  I have no doubt that at the top end of the market satisfactory standards apply, but at the lower end of the market there is proliferation of flexible employment arrangements and a lack of training opportunities for staff.  Training opportunities must be provided. The Minister should examine the opportunities available through CERT courses to train young people in areas, such as my constituency, where there is a high level of unemployment and where traditionally they have gravitated towards work in the hotel and catering sector.  He should consider providing training opportunities for those people at community level.  Community training workshops in some instances are able to link in with CERT level one and level two training and graduates can gain access to jobs in the hotel and catering sector, but we are not doing nearly enough in that regard.</P>
    <P>When will we grapple with the signage problem in this city and throughout the country?  I do not want to labour that point because it has been well made.  Tourists trying to find Glasnevin Cemetery or the Botanic Gardens do not realise where they are until they are on top of them.  The issue of signage needs to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>We need to develop additional attractions that appeal to the family, particularly children.  I compliment the promoters of the Ark and developments in the Dublin Zoo.  Outside of the pub atmosphere, there are is not enough for teenagers in the city and that area needs to be examined.  I compliment the Minister on the Bill which is a far-sighted initiative.  I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The tourism industry has had a dramatic impact on our economy in recent years. Indications of the number of tourists who could be attracted to Ireland in a Government strategy published a few years ago were believed to be pie in the sky, but the 1997 figures reveal more than five million overseas visitors, an increase of 10 per cent on the previous year.  The quarterly figures for this year show a continuing increase in that figure.  Expenditure figures for 1997 reveal a net inflow of £2,115 million in earnings from tourists. The growth of tourism has provided employment and there is further scope for development. In that regard I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and the Minister of State.  In May this year they published the document, A Statement of Strategy, which is a forward-looking method of identifying weaknesses and areas with potential for further development.  We have seen dramatic increases in the number of visitors.  In 1997 there was a 12 per cent increase in the number of UK visitors.  There is no doubt that with the peace process in Northern Ireland and the new partnership arrangements between the authorities here and in Northern Ireland, we will see significant movement of people between the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and the <Col N="1237" /> Republic of Ireland in the next few years, and this will create further opportunities for employment and development, with a consequent need for further investment, particularly in marketing.</P>
      <P>Although we have made dramatic strides in tourism, there are opportunities for increased investment in marketing.  At a time when other organisations are investing heavily in marketing it is fundamentally important that Bord Fáilte and, in my region, Shannon Free Airport Development Company, increase their activities and devise new methods and strategies.</P>
      <P>I am not certain, for example, that we are utilising the embassies to their full potential in developing tourism and the economy generally. There has been some discussion over the years about involving embassies more.  Apart from diplomatic work and making foreign policy, embassies have an opportunity to develop a greater awareness of the attractions of Ireland as a holiday destination.  A limited amount of such activity is going on in some embassies.  The Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, might look again at this area to see whether it is possible to revamp the embassies and make them centres for economic and tourism promotion overseas.  This would have a positive impact on tourism generally.  As a member of the Council of Europe, I have travelled to many foreign destinations and have found there is still a very great love of and awareness of Ireland as a very small island near the United Kingdom. However, there is still a huge amount of work to be done in promoting Ireland's image abroad.  To do this it is necessary to devote more money to marketing.  It is not wise to cut budgets in mid-term as has been happening in recent times.  All Governments have to do this in drawing up Estimates and there are often fairly dramatic reductions in expenditure in such areas as tourism, as a cost-saving measure.  This is undesirable, especially at mid-term.  Long-term strategies need to be put in place.  For that reason it is important that further finances should be devoted to that area.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute also to some of the work done by the local authorities in promoting tourism, in particular by Clare County Council in promoting County Clare as a tourism destination.  Through the good offices of Councillor Flann Garvey, Clare County Council has organised a tourism forum each year &mdash; the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation addressed the forum last year &mdash; where they endeavour to link with people in tourism overseas.  There have been links with towns in Brittany and in the United Kingdom.  In Clare, Councillor Flann Garvey, the Clare Tourist Council and Clare County Council have been very forward-looking in linking with the North of Ireland, and this has fostered keen awareness of the attractions of Northern Ireland for the people of Clare and the attraction of Clare for the people of Northern Ireland, and this is something that must be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make a final plea in connection with <Col N="1238" /> the resort renewal scheme.  That scheme has made a dramatic impact in towns like Kilkee where investment of about £16 million is currently under way.  I want to see this scheme continued, and I want to see a further range of towns included.  There is a strong case for the introduction of the resort renewal scheme in the only spa town in Ireland, Lisdoonvarna, County Clare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: Listening to Deputy Daly traversing the scene in Clare makes me nostalgic.  He forgot to mention the tourist attraction of Kilmihil, but it is well known.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo mar taispeáineann sé go bhfuil fás mór ag teacht ar líon na gcuairteóirí ag teacht chun na tíre seo.  Agus má tá airgead ag teastáil ó Bhord Fáilte chun breis cuairteoirí a thabhairt isteach, cuirim fáilte roimh an leasú seo. Tá sé ríachtanach go mbeadh airgead acu chun cabhair a thabhairt do dhaoine atá ag obair go dian, agus is iontach an rud é go bhfuil cúig mhilliún duine ag teacht chun na tíre seo mar chuairteoirí, agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh siad ar aghaidh ag teacht agus go mbeidh fás ar an méid sin agus faoi mar a deirtear as Béarla &ldquo;you must speculate to accumulate&rdquo;.  It is very important that we do not cut back because of financial difficulties. Now that things are going so well, we must invest money to bring in tourists.</P>
      <P>We are very fortunate that Ireland has such appeal for so many people.  Many millions of people abroad have Irish ancestry, and we want to welcome them back to their native place.  We have a duty to make sure that when they come it is not just a question of getting their money but of having facilities for them and giving them a holiday they can remember.</P>
      <P>We are lucky that Ireland has such a high standing in so many different countries.  We may regret that the summer was so bad, but many tourists have no interest in sunshine when they come here.  They come from warm climates from which they want to get a break.  If one mentions that it is unfortunate their holiday is being ruined by the weather, they say it is wonderful to have rain because they do not have it back home.  It is a sign of a change in the type of tourist who wants to visit Ireland.  I was heartened to hear from Carlow Rural Tourism that Carlow had a big increase in tourist numbers this year.  It could be that because the weather was not fine enough for the seaside, tourists were prepared to visit the midlands. We are inclined to think that all tourists come to Ireland to go to the seaside, to Ballybunion, Kilkee, Lahinch, Mayo and Rosslare. Irish people are inclined to go to those places if the weather is fine, but visitors to Ireland are not so centred on them.  We have to target this niche market of people who are not interested in the seaside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The welcome or lack of it in shops was referred to.  Receptionists and other people dealing with the public in hotels are extremely courteous. They know that their job is to please people.  It is unfortunate if others, who gain from tourism on <Col N="1239" /> the periphery, in shops that might appear not to be involved in tourism, do not keep up the high standard.  It is very off-putting to be faced with discourtesy when a smile could do much to bring people back to an area.</P>
    <P>The bad publicity generated whenever a tourist is mugged does untold damage to our image abroad.  Whenever an Irish citizen is attacked while on holiday abroad Irish people are inclined to say that they will not visit the country in question.  Tourists are easy targets for thugs.  There should be warning signs that they should mind their handbags and belongings.  Hotels should also give advice on places to avoid at night.</P>
    <P>The availability of brochures is raised regularly at meetings of the regional tourism organisations. There are two aspects to this.  One could have a good feeling if there is a plentiful supply of brochures in the local tourist office or hotel, but it may be that no one has bothered to take them.  It is a matter on which Bord Fáilte cannot win, if brochures are not available, it will be accused of doing nothing about the matter.</P>
    <P>On the change of logo, there is no advantage to be gained in various people putting their stamp on the shamrock.  It should not be changed for the sake of it on the say so of a whiz kid.  It is recognised as a symbol of Ireland all over the world.  What is needed is a strategy to attract visitors.</P>
    <P>If peace is achieved in Northern Ireland and there is a return to democracy, the tourism industry can prosper.  Even though industry is booming, there is always the danger that the Celtic tiger will flounder but tourism is the one industry on which we should cash in as it is money for jam.  It is up to each area to promote its tourist attractions.  Tourists cannot be expected to visit every region.  It is only the Yanks who believe they can cover the entire country in three days.</P>
    <P>Those who dump garbage are doing their best to kill tourism.  It is embarrassing to read in the newspapers the occasional letter from visitors on the subject.  There is an obligation on corporations and councils to ensure there is an adequate number of rubbish bins and that they are emptied. I fail to understand why school children throw rubbish on the street when they are told off for doing so in the schoolyard.  This is inexcusable.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: On Sundays one would think that most towns in the country had been hit by an earthquake given the number of chip cartons to be found on the street.  Various excuses have been given for not appointing litter wardens.  If people were fined £25 for throwing rubbish on the street, the message would eventually get through.  We can organise all the trade fairs and publish all the brochures we want but if tourists go away with the wrong image, they will <Col N="1240" /> not return.  The matter should be examined seriously.</P>
      <P>I compliment the tidy towns committees on the work they are doing.  It never ceases to amaze me that they can find the strength to pick up the rubbish left behind by their fellow citizens.  They have done much to create a good image.  I encourage Bord Fáilte to find a way to reward them &mdash; perhaps it could offer more prizes &mdash; to show that we appreciate their efforts.  They should not be taken for granted.</P>
      <P>The image the competition creates is vital and it should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>It is important that we utilise modern technology, particularly the Internet.  Most people are now computer literate and tend to use their computers to check out what is happening in all areas of life.  I am sure Bord Fáilte makes great use of the Internet.</P>
      <P>I spoke earlier about niche markets.  Golfing in Ireland is now a major attraction as there are so many golf clubs in the country.  Some of them, such as Portmarnock and Lahinch, are quite famous but there are many equally good clubs in other areas.  The leading inland golf course in Ireland is Carlow and it is near a number of outstanding clubs such as Mount Juliet, Mount Wolseley and Kilkea Castle.  These outstanding grounds are a major attraction and should be used by Bord Fáilte to target a niche market.</P>
      <P>Fishing is another such market.  In my constituency the rivers Nore and Barrow are good fishing waterways.  There are many such rivers throughout the country.  Fishing could be an important tourist attraction.  It is certainly not affected by the weather.  Anglers will sit on the bank of a river, festooned in waterproof gear, and fish to their hearts' content regardless of the weather. There are plenty of fish in our rivers.  English people come here to fish because the rivers in their country have been destroyed.  They are amazed at the number of fish in our rivers.  The fishing market could be geared towards group sales.  However, it is as important to prevent pollution of our rivers as it is to prevent litter, muggings and other crime.  If anglers come to fish but catch nothing, they will not return.</P>
      <P>Boating could be an important niche market in my constituency.  The River Barrow is navigable from Waterford and people can travel from there to Northern Ireland or to Limerick.  Boating is the ideal way to spend a week if the weather is fine. It is a pursuit that should be encouraged by the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Selling Ireland as a nation is one matter but it can also be sold into different niche markets. Historical sites are an important attraction.  My constituency is the location of Kilkenny Castle and the biggest dolmen in Europe is located in Carlow.  It is amazing how many foreigners come to Carlow to see it.  I taught in a school only half a mile from the dolmen but some of the locals did not know it was there because it is in an estate. This type of attraction should be used to attract tourists to different areas of the country. <Col N="1241" /> Car hire was mentioned earlier.  I met an Irish man who had returned to Ireland on a visit from the United States.  He was being fleeced by one of the car hire firms and had to switch companies. Practices such as that are wrong because tourists are sitting ducks for abuse.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is signposting to warn tourists to drive on the left hand side of the road.  There are a number of such signs but many people have been killed on the roads because there are not enough signs to remind them. Hotels and airports should carry more of these notices.  The accidents happen when the tourists leave these places.</P>

      <P>The Government is well on its way to achieving the targets in the EU operational programme. Overseas visitor numbers have doubled in the past ten years from 2.4 million to 5.2 million.  Foreign revenue earnings have almost trebled over the same period to £21.1 billion.  Taking domestic tourism into account, the industry generates about £3 billion annually and employment for more than 120,000 people.</P>
      <P>This success story must be acknowledged. Tourism has been transformed as a result of the priority successive Governments have afforded the sector and, especially, by the availability of substantial EU Structural Funds.  I welcomed the Government's decision to create a single Department for tourism, sport and recreation.  Fianna Fáil gave a commitment in its 1997 election manifesto that it would create such a Department.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the House has this opportunity to assess and acknowledge the tourism industry. It should equally acknowledge and give credit to the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and the members of his relatively new Department.  The Department is still in its infancy but it is already one of the strongest and most vibrant spokes of the Government wheel.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry has enormous potential. We must be vigilant in ensuring that it is built on solid foundations, is visionary about market demands and that investment and development is encouraged in the appropriate sectors.  The industry is not just driven by Government and EU incentives.  Its future development will be achieved through a partnership approach between the Government of the day and the people who work in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU operational programme envisages a total investment of £650 million.  Of that figure £370 million will come from the EU, £75 million will be contributed by the public and £200 million will be contributed by the private sector.  That clearly indicates the necessity for a partnership approach.  This investment and the upward trend in visitor numbers, domestic and foreign revenue <Col N="1242" /> and employment confirms that tourism has been an outstanding success.  It is the fastest growing sector of the economy and is now its second biggest industry.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and his staff on their success in making the industry such an important and vibrant part of our economy.</P>
    <P>The most important issue for the future is not to become complacent given the success of the industry to date.  The challenge is to create further growth in tourism through sustaining and building on what exists and expanding market share across the world.  Bord Fáilte has provided details of Ireland's performance in various markets. Britain continues to be the strongest performing market.  Growth remains strong in North America and Europe while the market in France is relatively good.  The German market remains weak.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of Bord Fáilte's chief executive, Mr. John Dully.  He has a wealth of experience and made an enormous contribution to the tourism industry as Assistant-Secretary with responsibility for tourism in the Department.  I wish Mr. Dully and Bord Fáilte every success in the challenging times ahead.  Mr. Dully joins Bord Fáilte on the crest of a wave, though I appreciate he has a very difficult task in sustaining the development of tourism and in encouraging other markets, such as Germany.  We should provide the resources to tap into that market successfully.  I am pleased that Mr. Dully is already revising senior management structures in Bord Fáilte both here and overseas to ensure that the right structures and people are in place.</P>
    <P>The Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative plays an important role in tourist destinations. Ireland's marketing effort will have to be more focused and we will have to assess our successes and failures in such marketing initiatives.  With an extra £25 million being spent by Bord Fáilte, does the Minister agree that a large amount should be set aside for destination advertising?  We compete with many destinations that are less expensive and we will have to focus on what we in Ireland are proud of.  We should be boasting that Ireland is the place to visit.</P>
    <P>We spoke in the past of having approximately 60,000 people employed in tourism, but now in excess of 120,000 people work in this area.  Some of those people have been key developers in bringing the industry forward, but these market gurus, who spend so much time marketing their product outside Ireland, should perhaps spend time on the board of Bord Fáilte on a rotating basis.  Their experience in marketing abroad is of enormous potential and we should allow them to participate in this fashion.</P>
    <P>Some Members have explained why they feel the national conference centre should be located outside Dublin.  I represent a Dublin constituency which has Dublin Airport &mdash; the premier airport in the country &mdash; on one side and two of the premier seaports in the country on the opposite side.  These are places where people tend to come <Col N="1243" /> into the country; I acknowledge that there are other air and seaports, but there is an attraction to the capital regardless.  I pay tribute to Mr. Frank McGee and Dublin Tourism on the degree to which they have changed with the market and enhanced the experience of tourists in Dublin, a beautiful capital city with a lot to offer.  It is a place people should visit.</P>
    <P>There has been massive investment, but not necessarily by the State.  Investment has come from the private sector, and I pay tribute to those who had the vision to invest.  They have taken risks and have made Dublin a huge success.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food questions that reflect my concern at the billions of pounds being given to farmers, as some of that money is for schemes encouraging them not to use their land, such as the set aside schemes.  Under that scheme people are receiving thousands of pounds a year not to utilise their land; others are given headage payments because of the number of cattle they have.</P>
    <P>Here in Dublin there is a unique ethnic mix that provides a fantastic range of restaurants and food retail outlets which gives the city great character.  People can visit top class restaurants and have a choice of foods from across the ethnic divide.  Those who invest in these ventures do not get one penny in grants, despite the billions of pounds given out by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to farmers.  We should focus on this issue; people are investing individually, but collectively they are making Dublin a finer place to visit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Limited has been given Government support in making a submission to the European Commission for the crucial final approval in the grant process to get the project under way.  For some time this project was bounced from one side of the capital to another; now the Spencer Dock group is prepared to go ahead with this massive development, which will be of enormous benefit to the city.  It will have an ideal geographical situation between the seaport and the airport in the heart of the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Irish Distillers Group &mdash; for which my brother works &mdash; which is very active and has invested massively in Dublin and elsewhere. I pay tribute to the vision of Mr. Richard Burrows and others in Irish Distillers for investing heavily in the old Jameson distillery in Smithfield, despite the fact that buildings in the area were falling down around them.  Most Members will recall that Irish Distillers started its work approximately ten years ago, long before the authorities focused on that area.  It has now one of the finest visitors' centres in Dublin and attracts the largest number of foreign as well as domestic visitors.  It is an historic and entertaining place to visit, and I congratulate Irish Distillers on its development, particularly Mr. Burrows.  I also congratulate the company on the development <Col N="1244" /> of the Midleton and Bushmills distilleries as well as on its business success.</P>

      <P>I know John and Deirdre very well and they are doing a super job.</P>
      <P>Most of the traffic chaos in my constituency is being created by the lack of a direct rail link between the sea port and the airport I mentioned. I ask the Minister to work with his colleagues in Government to ensure that rail link is put in place.</P>
      <P>People travelling into the city from the airport pass through the junction in Fairview.  Fairview boasts one of the finest parks in Dublin, which many people admire as they travel through the area.  I congratulate Gerry Barry and all those involved in Dublin Corporation's parks department for the work they do on the parks.  On one side of the Malahide Road, where Dublin Corporation has created chaos, there is a group of shops which used to pay rates but which are now closed.  The only business remaining there is Kavanagh's pub, where one of the best pints in Dublin is served.  Many of the other shops along that section of the road are closed also because of a measure introduced by Dublin Corporation in relation to the bus lane.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to Clontarf Castle in which a private investor, Mr. Gerry Houlihan, a friend and constituent of mine, has invested over £13 million in a private hotel and conference centre which will be of enormous benefit to my constituency. This person made that investment without the support of grants of any kind.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers referred to the taxi industry.  I want to acknowledge the excellent work done by taxi drivers in this city.  They display a high level of professionalism despite the unsocial hours they work.  It is easy for us, particularly at this time of the year, to criticise taxi drivers because we may have to wait a little longer, but it should be remembered that many taxi drivers provide a very professional service.  I pay tribute to those involved in setting up the taxi forum, particularly the Taoiseach.  That forum produced an excellent report.  It highlighted many difficulties for the industry including the additional licences it is proposed to issue.  Those in the industry recognise that change is inevitable and I acknowledge the courage of those involved in producing the taxi forum report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to acknowledge also the work of Philip <Col N="1245" /> Smith of Templeville Developments who entered into negotiations with Dublin Corporation two or three years ago and purchased a site in Fairview for the Westwood Swimming and Leisure Club. Templeville Developments are building what will be the largest club in Dublin, over 13,000 sq.  feet, involving massive investment.  The club will cater for all age groups, including children.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the tourism industry which is so important to this country.  Other speakers indicated that the industry is second only to agriculture and that the revenue from it is £2 billion per year.  I understand <Col N="1246" /> over five million people visit the country every year although Deputy Ring, in his contribution, cast some doubt on that figure.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation comes from Donegal.  He is a good friend who recognises the potential in the county and also what needs to be done to attract more tourists to the county.  Despite the fact that five million tourists visit the country it is generally recognised that the north, the north-west and the Border counties are not getting their fair share of the revenue generated by these tourists.  The Minister recognised that fact when he took up office over a year ago and I hope he avails of every opportunity to ensure more tourists are attracted to these areas.</P>
    <P>I am expressing the views of many people employed in the tourism industry in Donegal when I say that 1998 was not a good year for the industry.  There was no significant increase in the numbers on last year.  That can be put down to a number of factors, including the weather, the World Cup and so on.  We did not have a good season.  One of the difficulties is access to the county.  Foreign visitors did not have the courage to make their way to Donegal through Northern Ireland.  Given the prospect for permanent peace, I hope there will be a dividend for us in Donegal so far as tourism is concerned.</P>
    <P>Access is important.  We do not have rail links with other parts of the country but we have an excellent regional airport, Donegal International Airport, at Carrickfinn, which should be promoted. It should be developed and more use made of it to bring visitors to Donegal.  There is a regular scheduled daily flight between Donegal and Dublin seven days per week.  It should be developed further to cater for visitors from Britain and other parts of Europe.  We should also consider package tours.  The hotels with the assistance of Bord Fáilte should be able to arrange flights into Donegal on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Donegal has been dependent to a great extent on the Northern Ireland and UK market.  For obvious reasons there was no significant growth in that market during the past 20 or 30 years. Americans and others coming to Ireland usually draw a line from Dublin to Galway and concentrate south of that line.  I hope the Minister, Bord Fáilte and those responsible will address that problem to ensure a more equitable distribution of the 5 million tourists coming to our country.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy McGahon, who is a regular visitor to the county will have something to say, along with my colleague, Deputy Barnes, who has visited many parts of Donegal in recent years.  She recognised what we had to offer when she honeymooned in my area of Gweedore, Bunbeg.</P>
    <P>Donegal has much to offer.  Credit must go to the Office of Public Works and various Governments for investments in projects, such as Glenveagh National Park, which usually attracts about 100,000 visitors per annum.  The investment in that project is paying off.  There are a number of <Col N="1247" /> other places such as Newmills, outside Letterkenny, and Fort Dunree, in Inishowen.  One of the first centres which attracted visitors was the folk village in Glencolmcille, the brainchild of the late Fr. McDyer.  It is an attractive place to spend a few pleasant hours.  There are also a number of castles such as Doe Castle, which is being renovated, and Donegal Castle, both of which are magnets to attract tourists.  Visitors to Ireland are not willing to walk around aimlessly, some activity must be organised for them.  In my parish there is an excellent centre which started out as an interpretative centre, a small farmhouse at the foot of Mount Errigal in Dunlewy, Ionad Cois Locha, which attracts 40,000 to 60,000 people per year.  The idea started in a local community and it is doing excellent work in attracting tourists to Donegal.  People on holidays want something to do.  There are excellent facilities for hill-walking. Most people do not mind the weather.  If people want a sun holiday they go to southern Europe or elsewhere but not to Ireland.  If one happens to get good weather in Ireland, it is regarded as a bonus.</P>
    <P>Last August I took a few days off and went to northern Scotland and visited the islands.  The weather was no better there than at home but it was most enjoyable.  We could learn a few things about how Scottish people operate and organise their tourism industry.  They have interpretative centres in the Highlands and on the islands, located at battle sites such as Glencoe, Bannockburn and so on.  We are fortunate here to have many bed and breakfast establishments.  The same applies in Scotland.  It is made convenient for the prospective customer driving around in Scotland, when it comes to booking into a bed and breakfast house.  Outside every such house is a bed and breakfast sign.  If places are available, vacancy signs are displayed.  If there are no vacancies, they hang a notice to that effect on the B&amp;B sign.  When I returned home I suggested that practice should be adopted here.  If one has visited a half dozen houses which are full it can be very frustrating, a &ldquo;no vacancies&rdquo; sign on the B&amp;B sign would be of tremendous help.</P>
    <P>Activity related holidays, such as fishing, has already been mentioned.  The Gaeltacht in my constituency should not be overlooked.  When people on holidays hear the Irish language spoken they know they are away from their own area.  Some of the ambassadors from Donegal who have worked hard in attracting visitors, are singers such as Clannad, Enya, Altan and Daniel O'Donnell.  A festival in Kincasslagh, a fortnight ago, attracted visitors from all over the country and from the UK.  Every hotel room from Donegal town to Dunfanaghy was full.  Daniel O'Donnell was the main attraction.  I could continue to sing the praises of our county and emphasise the importance of the industry but, as agreed, I will allow the remainder of my time to Deputy McGahon.</P>
    <Col N="1248" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has said Deputy Barnes and I are regular visitors to the loveliest county in Ireland.  It is not just Deputies who go there.  I understand one of the ushers, Mr. Pat Neary, is a frequent visitor and is a standing dish on Saturday nights in Glencolmcille.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with Donegal, as referred to by other Deputies, is the lack of signage.  County Donegal, the second largest county, 100 miles long, is sadly in need of adequate signage.  I have no intention of seeking election in that lovely county.</P>
      <P>It is not to Donegal I want to direct my comments today.  For almost 17 years I have criticised all Governments because of the lack of recognition of the difficulties confronting the smallest county in Ireland, Louth.  It has been nothing short of scandalous.  The lack of recognition for this war-damaged county, is one of the reasons I want to get out of politics.  I cannot accept that that fact is not recognised in this Assembly.  That is the reason I ask for a share of the national cake for my constituents &mdash; the people of County Louth who vote for me and those who do not vote for me.  We have borne the brunt of the Ulster troubles for all those years.  We have gone from the pinnacle of employment to the unacceptable figures of double the national average of unemployment without any help or recognition being given.  Now that the prospect of peace is upon us, I ask for specific help for County Louth.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on doing a good job but I look askance at the money spent by Bord Fáilte.  It might be doing a good job nationally and globally but it has not made its presence felt in my county over the years.  We have been consigned to hell or to Connacht in regard to tourism. I look askance at the money spent in prime tourism areas such as Kerry, Cork, Clare, Wexford, Mayo and Galway, which are synonymous with Ireland all over the world and do not need any more promotion.  However, tourism backwaters, such as County Louth, also need help.</P>
      <P>As a result of our proximity to the Border, even people from Dublin were afraid to come to County Louth.  There is scenery in Louth on a par with that of anywhere else in the country.  We have the delightful Cooley peninsula and the wonderful, old world town of Carlingford, the Kinsale of the east coast.  However, we do not have enough punters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a great source of disappointment to me that the Government did not include Carlingford in the very laudable seaside resorts scheme.  Carlingford has a very nice little family run hotel, but it needs a five star hotel with leisure facilities to give that lovely town the impetus it warrants. That town is crying out for help but when my party was in Government it designated Clogher Head instead, which does not have the attractions of Carlingford.  While that designation was welcome at the time, I hope the Government will restart that scheme in the future with a view to creating the right conditions in Carlingford for an <Col N="1249" /> entrepreneur to build a five star hotel there which would allow us to compete with other lovely areas.</P>
    <P>Tourism is extinct in Louth, despite the efforts of some business people to breathe some life into it.  We need help from Bord Fáilte and I hope the Minister will take my words on board.  We have been forgotten.  The Minister is a very photogenic man and his picture is in the newspapers most days, but he is never photographed in my county. I know from personal contacts that he has many admirers there and I look forward to him visiting County Louth with a meaningful mission because, as I said earlier, we have been consigned to hell or to Connacht.  That is true not only of tourism but of all other aspects of Government help.</P>
    <P>Almost every speaker, regardless of political affiliation, has lamented the lack of road signage. The elementary problem must be overcome.  I do not know whether it is a function of the county council, the Office of Public Works or Bord Fáilte.  While I know that county councils will not flush a toilet unless they are provided with money to do so, they do not get enough money from central Government.  That problem has been ignored over the years.</P>
    <P>Other problems are the amount of vandalism around the country and the failure of county councils to cut hedges.  I do not know whether it is the responsibility of county councils or landowners, but there should be increased concentration on cutting hedges in scenic areas.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for a slice of the national cake.  No Deputy could dispute my claim that County Louth has suffered greatly from the Troubles in Ulster and has not got its fair share from Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by telling a true story.  Some years ago a Canadian booked a holiday in Carlingford, which, as I told the Minister, is a delightful spot.  He came <i>via</i> London and stopped off at a tourism exhibition.  He went to the Bord Fáilte stand and asked how he would get to Carlingford. He was told by the young lady in charge that Carlingford was in Northern Ireland and that he should go to the Northern Ireland tourist board stand.  We must wonder how anyone working for the Irish tourist board could be so unaware of her own country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the co-operation between the Northern Ireland tourist board and Bord Fáilte in selling Ireland as a 32 county nation, which is a practical and commonsense step.  It is a hands across the Border venture which can succeed.  I congratulate the Minister on his success in the past 18 months and hope he will find his way to County Louth &mdash; the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, can show him the way.</P>
    <P>I wish to gently criticise my friend and constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for donating a political bribe of £780,000 to the aged of Cork as a ploy to win the by-election. There are also aged people in Louth and charity should begin at home.  However, my main reason for raising this is that political inducements <Col N="1250" /> or bribes by any party are wrong and are a serious contributor to the cynicism which people feel about political parties.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on the work he has undertaken since he took office.  He has brought a great deal of vitality to the job, as did his predecessor.  Tourism has been a huge success in this economy. When Fianna Fáil went into Government in 1987 tourism was one of the areas it targeted.  Many people, mainly outside Leinster House, asked how we could develop the tourism industry. People should be congratulated for responding to the challenge.  They have developed an industry which is an enormous success and is of huge benefit to the country.  We should recognise those people in the tourism industry, in hotels, bed and breakfasts, pubs and restaurants around the country.</P>
      <P>A previous speaker on the opposite side of the House mentioned the role of our embassies in promoting Ireland, an issue which is very important and which I would like the Minister to take on board.  As far as I know, our embassies do not promote Ireland.  They may have a do the odd time, perhaps on Paddy's Day, and invite people to attend.  We are very good entertainers and people like going to St. Patrick's Day events at an Irish Embassy because they are always good but the embassies are not being used for tourism and trade purposes.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Callely, said something very interesting about Jameson whiskey.  I would like the Minister to ask one of his colleagues in Government about a promotion for Jameson whiskey held in a certain European capital in recent days and about the attitude of the Irish Embassy to it.  I will give him the details later.  I did not know Deputy Callely would mention Jameson whiskey but it is a very good example of what we are not doing through our embassies.  I am not criticising the embassies which generally do a good job in the diplomatic area.  We could, however, use them more to promote Ireland in terms of tourism and trade.</P>
      <P>I will focus on Dublin which is a great success tourism-wise.  Urban tourism has become popular and Dublin has done well out of it.  There is a huge market for weekends in Dublin and it has had a beneficial effect on the city.  The Minister has finally got agreement for a convention centre which I welcome and which will add to the city and will benefit the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People visit Dublin for many different reasons, including the people, pubs, restaurants, theatres, music gigs and the normal tourist attractions such as art galleries and so on.  They also come here because they get a package.  They go out at night to pubs or restaurants and many eventually end <Col N="1251" /> up in night clubs.  There are many night clubs in my constituency for which we do not have proper legislation.  Night clubs in this city have won awards in Europe and America on the standards they have set, but for some reason, we seem to think there is something wrong with night clubs.</P>
    <P>If we are out on the town at night in Dublin or in another urban centre, we often end up in a night club.  The majority of people have a good time and go home or to a wine bar.  There is total confusion as to when a night club can or cannot open and whether it is legal or illegal.  If we want to press home our advantage as a modern city, we must sort out the problem.  A night club owner came to me about it as recently as this week.  They are sick and tired of being told they must close at a certain time and of having to throw their customers out.  That is not an attraction for tourists. When promoting Dublin, will the Minister along with his colleagues in Cabinet try to sort out this problem?</P>
    <P>The committee I chair, the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, sent a report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on licensing laws and pubs. There must be a two hour differential between when pubs and night clubs close otherwise night clubs will go out of business.  If we want to provide a package to young tourists coming here, we must do so.  We must be enlightened in the way we approach this matter.</P>
    <P>I was in Prague earlier this year where pubs may stay open for 24 hours per day.  I was very interested in this because our committee was dealing with licensing laws at the time and I asked a few people about it.  The majority of pubs close between 2 a.m. and 2.30 a.m. because they want to do so.  There are three pubs in Prague which do not close at all.  I am not saying we should do the same but the pubs, night clubs and licensing issue must be sorted out if we are to press home our advantage in terms of young weekend visitors and others.  There are queues outside many of these clubs at night so nobody can say they are not wanted.  They are wanted not only by tourists but also by young Irish people.  Will the Minister look at this issue?</P>
    <P>Another issue mentioned was litter, which is an endless problem and one we do not seem to be able to sort out.  I do not know how we will solve it but we cannot give up and must press ahead. Blackspots around the country and in cities were also mentioned.  I cannot remember if a list of blackspots was compiled &mdash; a competition for the 50 worst blackspots which we would tackle.  We could have a wonderful competition in drawing up the worst blackspots and in providing money to clean them up.  When considering the demand for weekend and urban tourism in Dublin and Cork, will the Minister look at the licensing laws and the situation which wine bars, night-clubs and pubs face, and try to sort it out?</P>

      <P>The Tourist Traffic Bill was introduced to increase the statutory limit on aggregate Exchequer grant aid to Bord Fáilte and gives us an opportunity to air our views on tourism.  I remember when the previous Minister, Deputy Kenny, introduced a similar Bill seeking an extension of the limit to £22 million.  There was a great debate on that occasion and there is a huge demand for speaking slots today.  Tourism is an area of interest and benefit to all.  At that time none of us would have considered it likely that a Minister would have to return after three years to seek to more than double the limit to which Deputy Kenny had raised it.</P>
      <P>A factor must be the peace dividend and it would be remiss of us not to mention it and express our appreciation to all those involved in its success to date.  It also offers potential for the future and everyone who listened to Deputy McGahon or the Border Deputies would have had that brought to mind.  The Minister would also be acutely aware of the benefit which could flow in that area.</P>
      <P>We also need to acknowledge the work of CERT, the training agency, the various Institutes of Education, which used to be Regional Technical Colleges, many of which have catering and hotel related functions, and the Shannon hotel college.  They have played a tremendous role in providing the tourism industry with competent, well trained and professional staff.  Those who have travelled throughout the country would be acutely aware that over a short period a hugely improved level of service is available to the casual traveller and to ourselves if we are visiting Dublin, Cork, Donegal or wherever.  It has been a tremendous success story.</P>
      <P>The steady growth from the 1970s to 1985 seemed to be the optimum which could be achieved but the growth since 1986 to 1996 and since then has been tremendous.  There has been a 370 per cent increase in total foreign earnings. If one had come into the House and made such a prediction at that stage, one would have been considered to be off the wall.  It is particularly good in the context of European growth where there is a variation of about 100 per cent to 200 per cent &mdash; a little less than that across European countries.  We have massively outperformed our European neighbours in terms of attracting tourists. It has become the second biggest industry in the State and an excellent regional spread is possible. We have not yet achieved that, but we have made some progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also made substantial progress in extending the season.  It is interesting to note that the major failure in that regard has not been in the foreign market, but the domestic market.  This is related to employees having traditional holiday times and being effectively forced to be in the marketplace for a holiday during the limited period from the end of July and the month of August.  This was adverted to in a report in 1971 and various suggestions were made.  None of <Col N="1253" /> these would be impossible to implement, but they were never taken seriously.  It is one area of tourism which could be addressed because it is within our control.  I would like the Minister to pursue it and to examine what progress, if any, has been made or is possible.</P>
    <P>The impact of tourism spend in rural areas is dramatic.  In spite of its success story, it is a little less dramatic in Dublin because of the huge population background and the size of the economy in the capital city.  A relatively small spend in a rural village or town has a huge impact on the local community and economy.  A difficulty in some circumstances is that they must depend on part-time staff or are in the position were they can only afford to employ staff part-time.  There are also areas where it is an advantage to employees to have part-time work available.  The real scandal is the rates of pay available to part-time and full-time workers in the tourism industry.  This will be addressed to some extent by the introduction of a minimum wage, but I have great reservations about the current position because it undermines the integrity of the tourism product in a way that is ultimately damaging to the country and the individual hotel or guesthouse.</P>
    <P>In relation to hotels and guesthouses, there is a danger of providing excellent products at the higher and budget ends of the market but allowing the middle, which traditionally includes small family-run hotels or guesthouses, to fend for itself with little success.  A scheme of grants or tax incentives needs to be introduced because there is poor infrastructure and super-infrastructure, particularly in the west.  This may also be the case throughout the country.  We tend to assume that a problem only applies to the west, but closer scrutiny may reveal that the same problem exists in Dublin and the east.  There has been a huge increase in the number of hotel beds in the Dublin area.  One hopes that the boom continues because if there is a downturn, there will be a glut of bed spaces on the Dublin market.  This will be difficult for hoteliers and whoever is charged with responsibility for the industry at the time to address.</P>
    <P>We could at little cost revitalise the small family hotel which tends to be run by two or three family members and four or five local staff.  It offers something of the Irish experience which is difficult to deliver in the bigger hotel environment. It enables tourists to meet local people in their community.  Irish people are very giving of their time and experience and they enjoy talking to foreign visitors and visitors from other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There is an expectation that every contributor to the debate will give a tour of their constituency because Deputies are best informed about their own areas.  The experience in smaller areas is frequently reflected elsewhere.  In County Clare a natural resource which is well known internationally is the Cliffs of Moher.  This continues to attract a huge number of visitors.  However, anybody who has visited there in the last four or <Col N="1254" /> five years will agree that the capacity of the infrastructure for visitors, while improved a little, is still truly appalling.  It is embarrassing.  While that continues to be the case, inevitably the experience of visitors from abroad is diminished.</P>
    <P>There have been improvement plans for many years.  I blame Shannon Development for the fact that the plans have not been progressed, but it would probably blame the county council.  It is one of the areas where there is a product which is very well known and attracts a huge number of visitors, but many people go away dissatisfied because of the lack of provision for them in the immediate Cliffs of Moher area.  The visitors centre is too small, there is a lack of toilet facilities and parking is badly organised.  All these matters could be addressed at low cost.</P>
    <P>The artificially created Bunratty Folk Park also continues to attract a huge number of visitors. Much money has been spent on upgrading it and it continues to be an exciting experience.  It is professionally presented and continues to be a good attraction.  Lahinch and Kilkee benefited from the tourism resort scheme.  In both areas there was a good deal of adverse comment about various structures and buildings.  Approximately 5 per cent of that was merited, but the impact in general was positive.  It is a pity that this is so undermined by little quibbles and a number of items which do not fit in exactly.</P>
    <P>The simultaneous development in both resorts of water world type projects has gone unnoticed because of the controversy about the buildings. In the summer of 1998 in the west, the investment in both projects was more than saved in entertainment value for parents who at least had somewhere to bring children.  Otherwise, they would have had to entertain and tame them in mobile and holiday homes.  It was brought home most dramatically this year that the facilities in family resorts must cater for rainy days.  Unfortunately, there are rainy days in Ireland and in traditional resorts, such as Lahinch and Kilkee, a high percentage of the visitors are domestic holidaymakers who realistically would have the option of spending approximately the same amount of money and enjoying a holiday in a sunny clime where children would be much less trouble to them.</P>
    <P>There has been an absolute failure to develop the Burren in a way which protects it and simultaneously makes it reasonably accessible to visitors and allows them to feel that they are not imposing.  My view is that the national park route is the best way forward.  There must be a public access point.  There are arguments about where it should be, but there would have been the same hullabaloo no matter what place had been chosen.  There was much uninformed comment from people who had never visited the Burren.</P>
    <P>It is one of the resources in environmental and tourism terms that we have been most remiss in not addressing more actively.  Most of the blame for that undoubtedly lies with the ongoing conflict and the failure to resolve it.  The losers are <Col N="1255" /> on all sides in that area and I earnestly wish that it was resolved.  Any resolution must involve a public access point of some meaning.  This would have been provided under the proposal and will be provided by the current proposal on a different scale.  I am aware of the negative impact of the entire controversy because it is taking place in my parish and on my doorstep.  I am in the middle of it and nobody could know more about it.  Even if I have a strongly stated position on one side, I understand all the other considerations involved.  The same difficulties would have arisen wherever the attempt had been made to provide access.</P>
    <P>The same type of problem exists in relation to a proposal for a golf club in Dunbeg.  It is ironic in the context of the debates about Structural Funds and the ongoing battle for them that the two projects in Dunbeg and the Burren which probably would have attracted the most funding in the county have been undermined by bickering from outside to a lesser or greater degree.</P>
    <P>County Clare has some of the difficulties in relation to signage.  Fortunately a signage project in the north Burren area went ahead in 1990.  It has been a huge help, although it requires some supplementary work now.  It has had a positive impact without being expensive, and could be built on elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The results of consumer research frequently tell us that what we think about ourselves is not what others think of us.  Anyone who is studying Irish tourism seriously must look at the findings of the behaviour and attitudes study undertaken in 1995.  I would like to see that study updated.  It would not have to be as extensive as the initial survey.  That study indicated how others perceive us and may come as more than a surprise to those who thought they knew better.</P>
    <P>The biggest negative aspect about Ireland which emerged from the study was that many people outside the country see Ireland as a destination for male visitors, and as being fairly unfriendly towards women and children.  This means that we are losing out in the context of where money is being spent on holidays.  We have resources for family holidays which could be better presented and developed and which could improve the impact of Irish tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate which concerns every Member of this House.  The Minister may think he is on overload when the debate is over. The Department and the Minister can achieve a certain amount, but progress requires the co-ordination and co-operation of other Departments. Has such a co-ordinating committee been set up or are there plans to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers have referred to signage.  It is bewildering for Irish people trying to find a location with which they are unfamiliar.  What must it be like for a foreign tourist, driving on the opposite side of the road and trying to interpret <Col N="1256" /> a foreign language while attempting to drive carefully? Sometimes it must be almost impossible. The Minister must have seen how this problem is handled in other countries, particularly those with large numbers of tourists.</P>
    <P>I travelled in Italy and was impressed by the use of advance signage.  One was warned kilometres in advance of where lay-bys, service stations and turn-offs were located.  This latter point is very important now that we have motorways. This advance signage ensured that one did not make a mistake and have to pull over onto a hard shoulder which is dangerous.</P>
    <P>This signage was achieved in the main by painting signs on roads.  This does not involve much cost, it is easy to do and we should take it on board in Ireland.  Dublin and other locations in Ireland now use computerised, electronic signage which indicates the number of parking spaces available and so on.  People find these signs very helpful.  Similar signs were used in Italy on bridges and over roads to signal directions and other traffic information.  Thankfully we now have a good technological base in this country and we should introduce a technologically advanced way of using existing structures to locate such electronic signs which are so necessary.</P>
    <P>There is nothing worse than to come across a signpost which is hidden by the branch of a tree. There has never been a better time to address this problem as we are completing work on many by-passes and motorways.  We have the technological know-how to set up computerised signage and paint signs on roads, making life easier for ourselves and tourists.  This is one of the most frequent criticisms tourists make of otherwise pleasurable visits.</P>
    <P>There have been many horrific accidents on our roads.  This makes it essential that we erect signs for quite a distance from airports and ferry ports reminding tourists to drive on the left hand side.  People lose concentration and forget, and this has been the cause of accidents.</P>
    <P>It is wonderful to read in today's newspapers that nine million people travelled through Dublin airport.  Millions of people travelled through our other airports and I applaud that also.  However, we now face a problem moving people from airports and ferry ports to their accommodation.  We need a high speed rail link to Dublin airport.  We also need feeder bus services from the airport to some of the DART stations on the northside. This would avoid the problem of trying to transport everyone to Busaras.  We must give greater thought to the use of feeder systems until we have a direct rail link to the airport.</P>
    <P>Matters may be different on the northside of Dublin than on the southide.  However, I cannot accept Deputy Callely's praise for the taxi service and his claims that it is adequate.  It is outrageous that taxi drivers can choose which passengers to transport from airports and ferry ports.  This is not just the Minister's problem, it is an issue which must be addressed by way of a co-ordinated <Col N="1257" /> approach by Departments and local authorities. This would ensure that our tourism industry is given every support to allow it to move forward at every level.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government issued a very helpful policy statement called Waste Management &mdash; Changing Our Ways.  We have all talked about the problems of rubbish.  However, the difficulty is not caused by a lack of will or awareness on the part of local authorities and community groups, but by a lack of resources to address this issue.  This policy statement has been very helpful.  It highlights that local authorities have traditionally managed the functions in isolation from each other and from other service providers.  This meant that the few resources available were overstretched.  Part of this policy is that there would be far better co-ordination and co-operation between the various local authorities under the auspices of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, community groups and private companies and services.  That is the macro way in which this issue should be processed.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has over the next three years to increase the teaching resource in primary education beyond that released each year by falling population; and if he has set a target level for the primary capitation grant for three years hence.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.  I can assure the Deputy that, in the context of the 1999 Estimates, the Minister for Education and Science is currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate ways to fulfil this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most valuable resource within the primary education system is the cohort of teachers who work within the system.  The Minister is aware that in recent years, boards of management have had difficulties in securing the services of trained teachers.  Accordingly, since coming into office last year, he immediately focused attention on this pressing problem.  The Minister implemented a broad range of measures to increase the supply of fully trained teachers, including significantly increasing the intake into the colleges of education. This year alone, he ensured that over 1,000 places were available in the colleges of education. <Col N="1258" /> He intends to maintain this high intake level over the next few years.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister has decided that from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education will be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service provided they have Irish to grade C at higher level leaving certificate standard or its equivalent.  He is determined to ensure that the demographic dividend arising over the next three years is retained in full in order that the pupil teacher ratio may be still further reduced.  He is especially anxious to divert resources towards pupils with special needs to ensure that special needs pupils may fully benefit from the educational system.</P>
    <P>Any requirement for resources over and above that released from the dividend will be pursued with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  As regards the level of capitation funding, the Government's commitment in this regard was clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates, which provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant represented an important step forward in the process of improving funding of the primary sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the demographic dividend is rapidly diminishing? According to figures published by the Department, in three years' time only 35 teachers will be released by the demographic dividend.  Against that background, does he accept he cannot give priority to primary education resources and deliver his promise without significant additional teaching resources over the demographic dividend in the next three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to me is that the number of teachers released by the demographic dividend this year will exceed what was released last year.  The Department is obviously committed to benefiting from the demographic dividend over the next three years but we do not accept that is sufficient.  If we thought it were, we would not be negotiating with the Minister for Finance for additional resources to take on extra teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that in the first year in which he and his Department were supposedly delivering this commitment to primary education, not one single teacher over and above the demographic dividend was provided to the primary sector?  Does he accept that <Col N="1259" /> 12 per cent of children are in classes of more than 35, in excess of the Department's guidelines? How can he say that reflects a priority to primary education?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That increased funding reflects the Government's commitment in this area more clearly than anything I could say here today.  The initiative of retaining the demographic dividend was introduced by Fianna Fáil and has yielded tremendous results.  The action taken by this Government during its 15 months in office compares extremely favourably to what its predecessors did.  That improvement, which is reflected in the figures allocated to primary education last year, will continue.  The Minister and I are fully committed in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>Children suffering from these conditions have access to a range of education services. In some cases, the severity of the condition is such that placement in a special school or special class is required.  A range of such facilities is available.  Each special facility is dedicated to children in a particular disability range and each enjoys special reduced pupil/teacher ratios and other support services.</P>
      <P>In some cases, the condition may be sufficiently mild to allow the child to function successfully in an ordinary school setting with the assistance, if necessary, of a remedial teacher, a resource teacher or a visiting teacher.  Particular supports provided by the Department for the conditions mentioned by the Deputy include the following. The Department has been operating a pilot education programme for autistic children in Beech-park, Stillorgan, Cratlow, County Clare and Dundalk. This programme delivers a specially devised education programme for autistic children.  Each class enjoys a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 and a child care assistant.  Arrangements are currently being made to establish further special classes for children with autism in various locations around the country.</P>
      <P>Fully qualified primary teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those accompanied by perceptual difficulties, namely, specific learning disabilities or dyslexia. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.  Where more serious conditions arise, provision is made in special schools and special classes dedicated to such children. There are four such special schools at present. Special classes can be established as required.</P>
      <P>In the case of children who manifest symptoms of dyspraxia, these children can be catered for in special schools and special classes, depending on their particular needs.  The Department will arrange for the establishment of additional special classes to cater for children with attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder if adequate numbers of suitably assessed children emerge.</P>
      <P>Where special needs children are concerned, the needs of each child must be considered on an individual basis and provision made accordingly. I can assure the Deputy that policies in this area are kept under review in light of emerging knowledge and research.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.  Does he agree the time <Col N="1261" /> has now come to move on from the findings of the review group on special education in terms of addressing these particular conditions?  It is necessary to address the anguish and stress of parents who have to go outside the public system to have these conditions diagnosed, sometimes when the children have been through virtually all their primary school education.  It is not much more than 50 years since autism was first identified. Special attention is necessary to find out the extent of the conditions and there is need for more specialist provision in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of the point being made by Deputy O'Shea.  A task force has been established in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children to establish a database on autistic children which will allow us identify pockets of such children throughout the country.  This will allow us establish special classes to cater for their particular needs.</P>
      <P>Much research is being done and contact has been made with education departments in other jurisdictions in relation to research on how best the education system can respond to children who have the misfortune to suffer this condition.  The Department's inspectorate has been directed to establish the parts of the country where children with the various reading difficulties referred to in the question such as dyslexia or behavioural difficulties like attention deficit disorder are located so we can establish extra special classes for those concerned.  We are conscious of the problem.</P>
      <P>There is a separate question concerning the special education review group, but substantial progress has been made by successive Governments since 1993 when the group reported on implementing the recommendations of the report.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The basic point I ask him to address is the importance of finding out the extent of the problems within the education system.  I am alarmed by the number of diagnoses in the private sector and that people who can ill-afford it are paying as much as £20 per hour for extra tuition for these children.  I ask the Minister of State to address these issues.  There is an urgency about this matter and I ask him to reconsider his position and put a more practical resource in place.</P>

      <P>We are taking action on two fronts to establish the extent of the problem.  In relation to autism we are getting the co-operation of the Department of Health and Children to establish a database which will give us the exact figures.  In relation to the other difficulties referred to in the Deputy's question, the inspectorate is, as I speak, investigating the situation in various parts of the country and I am sure that on concluding its investigations there will be accurate figures on which to work.</P>

      <P>The guidance and remedial allocations to second level schools have remained constant since 1995.  Currently there are 350 remedial and 567 guidance posts within the second level system.</P>
      <P>In the school year 1997-8 enrolments stood at 368,400 and teacher numbers for that year were 23,558.  In the current year projected enrolments indicate a reduction of about 4,000.  Teacher numbers in the current year are broadly in line with those for 1997-8.  In summary, therefore, the pupil-teacher ratio which stood at 15.64 in 1997-8 is anticipated to reduce further in the current school year.</P>
      <P>The issue of additional resources for the second level sector is one the Minister for Education and Science will discuss with the Minister for Finance in the context of this year's Estimates.</P>

Does he recall that Fianna Fáil's election manifesto, which is perhaps a work of fiction at this stage, made an explicit commitment that in Government it would appoint a certain quota of remedial and guidance teachers at second level? Where now stands that commitment and why was it not delivered on in the first year in Government when there was an opportunity to do so?</P>

      <P>I am committed to the development of a framework for lifelong learning.  In that context provision for adult literacy has doubled this year and projects have been supported under a national literacy development fund designed to inform future policy and practice in this area.</P>
      <P>A women's education initiative has been introduced under which community based projects are funded which address gaps in provision for educationally disadvantaged women.  A new childcare measure has been introduced to support access for participants in VTOS, Youthreach and senior traveller training centre programmes.  The scheme is flexible and allows for direct provision of cre ches, purchase of places in existing cre ches and payment of child minders.  The conditions governing payment of allowances to participants on VTOS and back to education schemes have been equalised.</P>
      <P>Work is being finalised to publish a Green Paper on adult education which will make recommendations on future developments in the context of expanding access to lifelong learning.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with key interests and the establishment of a project selection committee, the additional funds have been allocated exclusively for adult literacy over a range of pilot actions which test models and innovatory approaches in certain key priorities as follows: public awareness promotion; outreach strategies to target those most in need; the establishment of referral networks; flexibility in terms of ensuring the service is provided in accessible locations at a range of times including, mornings, night time, weekends and during the summer; a continuum from one to one voluntary tuition to tuition in small groups, with the option of national certification; and innovation in terms of new approaches to basic literacy provision, including family based literacy programmes targeting parents and their children, new outreach strategies, intensive programmes targeted at those most in need, a small number of demonstration open learning centres and distance learning.</P>
      <P>The question of further increases in expenditure for adult education and adult literacy is being pursued in the context of the Estimates for 1999 and subsequent years, and I am confident there will be an increase in expenditure.</P>

      <P>A departmental committee report launched by the Minister recently indicated that adult education was seriously underfunded. One of that committee's terms of reference was that there would be no or minimised effects on employment or Exchequer costs in respect of the adult education programme.  How does the Minister of State relate that to what he said about seeking more funding for adult education in the next budget?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little hazy about the second part of the Deputy's question.  Last year funding for adult education provided through VTOS, adult literacy and community education, special initiatives for disadvantaged adults, grants to adult education organisations, the women's education initiative, and child care provision amounted to £33.265 million.  Those are the items we can readily identify, but they do not include expenditure on the cost of mature students attending third level education, PLC courses, education provision for participants in the back to education allowance scheme, the prison education service, and other provisions.  There is a tendency to focus on the literacy provision when referring to funding for adult education, but funding is provided over a wide range of areas.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper will be ready for publication in the next week or two.  It will contain radical back to education initiatives, which will involve increasing access to education for those who have left the system and substantial Exchequer expenditure.

    <P>The adult education programme will require additional Exchequer funding.  Irrespective of what is stated in any report, adult education will <Col N="1266" /> require a substantial extra commitment of Exchequer funding.

      <P>The recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee are being implemented on an ongoing basis as resources permit.  Significant progress has already been made across a range of special needs areas since the report was published in 1993 &mdash; for example: the pupil-teacher ratios in special schools and special classes have been reduced; a significant <Col N="1268" /> number of additional remedial and resource teachers have been appointed; additional funding has been provided for specialised equipment for children with special needs; a pilot scheme has been introduced for the provision of escorts and safety harnesses on certain special school transport services; pupils enrolled in special classes in ordinary national schools are now also counted on the ordinary roll for the purpose of staffing allocations; additional child care assistants have been appointed to help children with disabilities and additional psychologists have been appointed to the school psychological service.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the total lack of psychologists to evaluate children who are in need, and that those who have the money can have instant access?  There is also a lack of communication between the health board and the Department of Education and many children have to wait months if not a year for an assessment.  This is extremely serious and will lead to problems in the long term.  I would like the Minister's assurance that this situation will be dealt with as a matter of urgency, especially in the Border areas where there are no psychologists.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Crawford that people who are financially able to afford it can make their own arrangements and people who are not are thereby disadvantaged.  It is the job of the Government and the Department to ensure the playing pitch is as level as possible.  On the breakdown between the health boards and the psychological service of the Department, I take the Deputy's point.  I have come across a number of cases which give cause for concern.  I have discussed the matter with the Minister and we are determined to obtain the necessary resources to improve the service.  That is the key to resolving the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On children who do not fall into any specific category, who are disadvantaged because of their social or financial background, as Deputy O'Shea is aware, we have concentrated considerable <Col N="1271" /> resources on areas of disadvantage.  The pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced while we are committed to expanding and intensifying the various programmes in place, including the Early Start programme.  They have been designed to deal with children who come from a socially disadvantaged background.</P>
    <P>On the link between the ordinary school system and special schools, I take Deputy Hayes's point.  I have made suggestions on how the linkages can be improved.  The Minister is aware of the situation.</P>

      <Quest>the short-term, medium-term and long-term proposals, if any, he has for the development of the recent large land acquisition by Waterford Institute of Technology; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Waterford Institute of Technology's initial proposal indicated that the existing campus lands were inadequate for future developments, particularly for outdoor student recreational facilities.  In the circumstances the Minister gave the go-ahead on 5 June for the acquisition of an additional 50 acres of land by the institute.  As the vendor was only prepared to sell the 170 acres of the property as a single lot, he allowed the institute, as an exceptional matter, to acquire the entire lot subject to a feasibility study being undertaken of the 170 acre site to identify lands surplus to the needs of the institute and amounting to approximately 100 acres for disposal as directed by the Minister for Education and Science; moneys received from the disposal of any lands being refunded to the Department of Education and Science; freehold title to the lands being confirmed and full vacant possession being obtained.</P>
      <P>The short, medium and long-term development proposals for these lands are dependent on the completion and approval of the development plan for the main campus which is being prepared; the findings of the feasibility study of the lands recently acquired to establish the area most appropriate for meeting the institute's space requirements; the outcome of planning applications to the local authority for possible developments on the main site and the lands recently acquired and also the results of the Department's normal economic studies relating to both developments to ensure value for money is achieved. The Deputy will appreciate that at this early stage there are no detailed plans for the development of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year the Minister announced a series of initiatives for the development of facilities at the institute which represented the largest ever investment since its foundation.  These developments include the progressing of two major building projects and the early start of planning <Col N="1272" /> of a number of others.  The Minister also gave final approval for the institute to proceed with the preparation of tender documentation for an extensive new library building which had been delayed for a number of years and is a much-needed facility.  The Minister also gave the go-ahead to the institute to appoint a design team for the new tourism and CERT facilities to be located on the main campus.</P>
    <P>Since then excellent progress has been made with the implementation of the institute's capital programme.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the institute recently received tenders for the new library building which are being examined by the Department.  The Minister hopes to be in a position shortly to sanction the award of this major building contract bringing the institute's library facilities into line with other major higher education institutes.  It will provide for the needs of over 5,000 users with facilities to connect to information worldwide, for the business community through the use of state-of-the-art technology and will facilitate access to research and communications systems.  The new library will act as a focus for the south-east and facilitate open learning projects through working closely with other community enterprises.  I am also pleased to advise the Deputy that the planning of the new CERT facility for the institute is proceeding satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>These main developments clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment to ensuring the institute can meet the challenge of the year 2000 and beyond.</P>

      <P>The purchase has not been completed. A price of £2.2 million has been agreed. It is estimated that no more than 70 acres will be needed by the institute, the balance to be sold off and the money refunded to the Department.  A feasibility study is being undertaken to identify the use to which the land will be put.  No specific use has been identified.  It will be used to provide car parking facilities for staff and students as well as recreational facilities.</P>

      <P>We welcome this initiative enormously. While it is a tremendous fillip for the institute, it is disappointing that it is being asked to dispose of 100 of the 170 acres being acquired. If a university is to be developed in Waterford, the immediate objective, 170 acres at least will be required for the campus, encompassing playing pitches and car parking facilities.  The site on which the magnificent University of Limerick is located is at least 170 acres and we wish to emulate its achievements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In the discussions that took place prior to the acquisition the institute authorities indicated their requirements to the Department. Sanction was given to acquire 50 acres of land initially.  I am not familiar with Waterford city but it seems the most suitable site, a short distance away, comprised a single lot of 170 acres, of which the vendor apparently was unwilling to sell a portion.  The institute was not of the view at any time that it needed the entire 170 acres&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department failed to find a site of between 50 and 70 acres.  It could not get that amount because the land available comprised a single lot of 170 acres.  The Department decided, as an exceptional measure, to sanction its acquisition on condition that the feasibility study was carried out and the surplus was sold with the balance due being paid to the Department.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy Deasy's point.  The amount of land that will ultimately be sold and the amount of money refunded to the Department will depend, to a great extent, on the feasibility study. The ball is now in the institute's court.  It must carry out a feasibility study indicating what it wants and how it will use it.</P>
      <P>The Department has a responsibility to the taxpayer to ensure that its expenditure will give the best possible value for money.  We will not and cannot anticipate the final acreage or how much will be sold until the feasibility study has been carried out.  However, I do not anticipate the institute being allowed to retain the full 170 acres. How much it can retain and how much will be sold will be determined when the feasibility study is submitted to the Department and evaluated.</P>

      <P>The issue of the particular needs of students from refugee families and of those students from families seeking asylum in the State was raised in the course of a meeting which the Minister had with representatives of the ASTI. The value of a departmental circular on these and related issues of racism and xenophobia was also discussed.  The Minister intends to discuss further with the ASTI and other partners in education the need for and the content of any such circular.</P>
      <P>A circular letter, together with an educational resource package on combating racism, was sent to all primary and post-primary schools in September, 1997.  The purpose of the circular was to create an awareness in schools that racism is a widespread and growing phenomenon throughout Europe and to encourage teachers to promote in their schools a greater appreciation of cultural diversity as well as a better understanding of how racism diminishes the humanity of all.</P>
      <P>The circular stated that schools have a crucial role in the formation of attitudes and in the development of critically minded individuals who have the capacity to overcome prejudice, intolerance and racism.  This can be done in an age appropriate manner by building on the sense of fairness felt by children.</P>
      <P>An educational resource package containing ideas, practical suggestions for activities and lesson plans aimed at children of various ages was also circulated to facilitate teachers and schools in the promotion of learning activities related to the year against racism initiative.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State have any plans, perhaps through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, to address the curriculum and establish if there are areas where racism might be dealt with?  How is it proposed to deal with the language difficulties which obviously arise in classrooms where there are children from different national and cultural backgrounds?  Is any additional assistance to be provided to schools in that regard?  Has any progress been made in establishing a language support unit to address the language needs of children from different cultural backgrounds?</P>

      <P>An interdepartmental committee is currently examining how we should deal with this matter at primary level.  The vast majority of refugee children attend primary school.

      <P>The report of the special education review committee, published in 1993, recommended that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association or the World Health Organisation, 1989, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, <Col N="1276" /> should be used in identifying and describing children with autism and, in particular, in reports which are used in support of their referral for enrolment in schools.</P>
      <P>My Department adopted the recommendation of the special education review committee.  Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services.  The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each case.  In some cases, children with mild features of autism are educated in ordinary schools with the support, where necessary, of remedial and resource teachers.  Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in a number of special schools, including schools for children with mild mental handicap and schools for children with emotional or behavioural disorders.</P>
      <P>In the 1995-96 school year, a pilot programme of special services was established for children with autism.  under this programme a number of special classes dedicated specifically to the needs of these children were established.  These special classes are attached to schools located in Beech-park, Stillorgan, County Dublin and Cratloe, Ennis, County Clare.  A further special class was established in St. Bridgid's special school, Dundalk, County Louth, in the 1996-97 school year. A total of 46 children are catered for under the pilot programme.  In the current school year a number of additional special classes catering specifically for children with autism have been established.  To date 14 such classes have been established in ordinary primary schools and in special schools.</P>
      <P>Each class caters for a maximum of six children and has the support of a class teacher and a child care assistant.  Special capitation funding is also provided.  In addition, an outreach support service is provided by the relevant health authority. The establishment of additional classes for children with autism is currently under active consideration in my Department.</P>

Can the Minister of State confirm that the Department is looking at the whole autistic spectrum, in particular at those conditions which we in Ireland have not been aware of for very long and which are causing distress to parents?

In relation to the research we are doing on the best educational response to autism and the database we are establishing, the definition we are going on is the one I outlined, which is the narrower definition.

Is the Minister of State aware that 272 children have been categorised as autistic by the Eastern Health Board but that the Department is providing only 84 beds nationally, according to his reply? There appears to be a huge gulf between provision and the numbers of people in need.  Will the Minister of State be able to demonstrate precisely the extent to which individual needs are being met when this database is operating?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The database we are trying to establish is to tell us how many children in the system are suffering from autism.  The Deputy's other question will have to wait until we see what the database shows us.  We are concerned, as earlier replies have stated, with establishing extra special classes, which require extra funding because the pupil-teacher ratio is lower to treat children unfortunate enough to have this condition. When we look for extra resources from the Department of Finance to deal with this we will be armed with the figures.  We will be able to say what the provision and the needs are, and that we want to close the gap.  I agree with the Deputy that a special plan for each individual should be kept in the Department, and I will forward that suggestion to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>While a record of the number of schools which seek additional teaching resources to enable them to comply with the guidelines on maximum class size is not maintained within my Department, a count is kept of all schools which qualify for additional resources under this heading. As the Deputy will know, schools which experience rapid enrolment growth or schools which are unable to organise their classes within the maximum class size guidelines may qualify for additional staffing as soon as the relevant events occur.  These schools do not have to wait until the start of the following school year in order to make the necessary additional appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maximum class size guidelines in the current year are as follows: 35 in the case of single grade class group; 34 in the case of a class group of two <Col N="1278" /> consecutive grades; 31 in the case of a multi-grade class group; and 29 for all classes in disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>While the allocation of teachers to classes is the responsibility of the school principal and board of management, maximum class size guidelines are designed to ensure that schools do not have excessively large classes.  Where maximum class size guidelines are breached in a school, this usually results from a conscious decision taken by school management with a view to facilitating much smaller classes elsewhere in the school.  To date in the current year sanction has been granted to a total of 28 schools to appoint an additional teacher to enable those schools to organise their classes in compliance with maximum class size guidelines.</P>

      <P>Why does the Department not maintain records of applications so that we can monitor not only those schools that are successful, but the many that are unsuccessful?  Is this not legitimate public information that should be maintained so that the schools which seek but do not get this service are known?  Is the Minister of State aware that there are 54,000 pupils in classes which are bigger than the maxima he has read? That is a dramatic number.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that he is not honouring these maxima and that the reality is that if these schools apply to the Department they will not get additional teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>These sorts of records have never been maintained by the Department and perhaps they should be.  I understand the Deputy's suggestion to be that a record of how many classes exceeded the guideline be maintained for every year, for how many pupils were involved and what the allocation was.  Is that the Deputy's suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that when schools complain about class size they may apply for additional teachers, but the reality is that there are no resources available for the majority of schools?  There are resources for 28 schools against the needs of 54,000 students.  The Department is not responding to this system.  Does the Minister of State agree that this safety net system is only here as a paragraph he can stick on the end of replies to parliamentary questions to make the situation look less bad than it is?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to people's right, if classes exceed maximum class size guidelines, <Col N="1279" /> to apply for an extra teacher.  The chances of getting an extra teacher depend on availability. We have to secure funding to appoint extra teachers to help these schools to solve their problems. Overall in the primary sector the pupil-teacher ratio is reducing.  The demographic dividend is working well and the pupil-teacher ratio will continue to reduce.  That means, however, that a number of schools throughout the country will continue to be afflicted with this problem which, occasionally, is of their own making.  Those schools often ask their local representatives to lobby the Department of Education and Science for additional teachers.  An inspector is then sent out to assess the position, but schools which demonstrate the need for an extra teacher do not automatically get one.  Their prospects depend on the resources available.  We are fully aware of the position and I assure the Deputy we will do everything possible to ensure the problem is alleviated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings us back to the issue raised in an earlier question.  Is it not the case that the Minister is relying exclusively on the demographic dividend and that the demographic dividend will dry up over the next three years?  Is it not the case also that no provision has been made this year for teaching resources over and above the demographic dividend and, despite the multi-annual programmes, the Minister of State cannot give a commitment to provide that extra resource over the next two or three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That might have been the case this year but there are four years remaining and we are not happy to rely exclusively on the demographic dividend.  That is the reason we made an exceptionally strong case for further resources over and above what we will gain by the demographic dividend with two issues in mind; first, the need to deal with class sizes in excess of the guidelines set out by the Department and, second, the need to further reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  I am confident those resources will be forthcoming and that we will address the problem of class sizes which exceed our own guidelines and drive down the pupil-teacher ratio which is set to fall again this year despite the fact that we relied exclusively on the demographic dividend.</P>

      <QRef>[20719/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In broad terms, the Minister for Education and Science is satisfied that the junior certificate science course forms the basis of a good preparation for those who want to study physics and chemistry at leaving certificate level. However, he is of the view that aspects of the current structure of the junior certificate science syllabus, particularly at higher level, can act as a disincentive to some students, who wish to study one or more science subjects at leaving certificate level, to opt for physics and/or chemistry.</P>
      <P>The junior certificate higher level science course has a core element dealing with scientific knowledge, skills, concepts and attitudes as well as physics, chemistry, biology extensions and an applied science extension &mdash; six units &mdash; or local studies extension.</P>
      <P>Given that additional syllabus material in the form of the six applied science units was included in the new syllabus, this led to a reduction in the material in the physics, chemistry and biology extensions.  In addition, two of the most popular applied science units, horticulture and food science, are biologically based and are most likely to be taught by science teachers, particularly as most of them would have taken biology to degree level.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the Minister has requested the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to undertake a review of the structure and content of the junior certificate science syllabus.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Minister has decided to implement a number of initiatives to increase the number of pupils taking physics and chemistry.  As the first phase of this, a survey of science laboratories in second level schools is currently under way.  In addition, arrangements are being put in place for the introduction of new syllabi from next year.</P>

      <P>When was the last review of the senior level science syllabus?

Will the Minister of State agree that students are reluctant to take up science courses because of the difficulty of those courses compared to others?  The goal seems to be to obtain points and not get an A or B in a science subject.</P>

Will he also provide the figures for the number of students who obtained high grades in physics and chemistry in the junior certificate but did not pursue those subjects at leaving certificate level? Students can maximise the number of points they get by taking subjects other than science subjects and that is having a detrimental effect in the context of the subjects taken at leaving certificate level.</P>

      <P>How can the funding provided under this Bill best be used?  I suggest the number of information and advice services be increased in addition to the technological advances in signposting, which I mentioned earlier.  I hope the same type of technology will be used to make tourist information accessible in a broad network, particularly to non-urban areas which may not have the same structures as the larger towns and cities.  There have been complaints from people who have tried to visit Bord Fáilte offices after office hours.  Given that tourists arrive at all hours and are probably in more need of assistance outside office hours than during the day, it is important that an accessible number, a helpline and an information line are always available.</P>
      <P>I was struck by what Deputy Eoin Ryan said regarding our tourist services abroad.  When in New York on holidays a few years ago it was pointed out to me that sometimes the tourist and information offices which promote travel to Ireland, particularly among the Irish-American diaspora, are not situated in the communities attracted to that type of tourism.  Locating such an office in mid-town New York may not be as beneficial as locating it in Queens where there is a large number of Irish people.  That point was made by people who live there.  They suggest, from a practical point of view, that we concentrate on information networks and easily accessible offices in areas of traditional Irish-American neighbourhoods because more people are tracing their roots and are attracted to a better and brighter Ireland than that which their ancestors left.  Deputy Ryan commented on the part our embassies could play.  Perhaps our tourist and information network can be looked with a view to reaching more people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the need for grant funding for CERT and other training, work practices and minimum wages for people working in that area.  Given that tourism is fast becoming our principal industry we have to reward, acknowledge and give status to those who work in that area.  A well paid and highly qualified staff reflect a confidence and an image of Ireland which is part of what Ireland is about.  Badly paid, contract, part-time workers may not think it is worth the effort.  Because of the various needs of staff, including those in the satellite areas of our tourism, further grant funding should be looked at.  A real attempt should be made by tourism interests, hotels and so on to train their staff in the productive use of technology, computers, websites and so on.  Given that we are attempting to attract international tourism we should make an effort to include languages in staff training.  We all applaud the idea that languages should be included in primary and secondary level education. Yet, only a small number of people who have languages enter the tourism industry full time.  An essential requirement should be that those entering the tourism industry have at least one or two continental languages.  There is nothing more frustrating and loss-making on both <Col N="1285" /> sides than not to have a certain number of staff available to interpret and communicate in a given language.</P>
    <P>An increasing number of people complain about the supplement charged to those who wish to have single room accommodation.  There are many advertisements for great weekend breaks but the prices quoted are per person sharing.  A great number of us do not wish to share accommodation. Part of the break is that one would have single accommodation.  This is an inhibiting factor.  The supplement for single accommodation is much too high.  In a society where an increasing number of single people travel as well as many others who do not wish to be coupled together forever, this is a problem for which there is no relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barnes for the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am chairman of the Meath tourism promotional company and I want to make some points which are relevant and important to the development of tourism in the east.</P>
      <P>A decision was made in last year's budget to exclude a number of counties from further hotel development, in other words, that the Department of Finance would not provide extra incentives to people who wanted to provide hotel bedrooms in those areas.  That was a very unfair step, given that although Meath is close to Dublin it is not in the lucrative business of huge numbers of bed nights and hotel bedrooms.  I would appreciate if the Minister would do something about that.</P>
      <P>The Minister's two predecessors promised that tourism promotional companies would be grant aided to some extent.  Ours is a small company &mdash; as is the one in County Louth &mdash; but it is growing and doing a very good job in regard to accommodation, food, golf and so on.  We are spending £200,000, which was hard earned with the help of Leader, the county council and the tourism providers themselves, but we are getting no help from the State.  East tourism is getting help, but the actual county tourism promotional companies are getting no help.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister intend doing anything about unapproved accommodation?  He has run away from it as if it were the plague, as every other Minister has done.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that a person in Oldcastle who applied under the European fund for tourism development to provide accommodation for people with disabilities has been refused.  I know that is not directly part of the Minister's bailiwick, but the committee which decides on the funding has not seen fit to grant aid this project, although the person was promised locally that funds would be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill affords us in the north-east an opportunity to speak about the tourism industry, particularly in County Louth.  Deputy Farrelly has just finished outlining the needs of the industry in County Meath.</P>
      <P>An advantage of by-election campaigning is that one discovers how important the tourism industry is to local economies.  The more I travel around the country canvassing, the more I learn that counties in the north-east, such as Louth and Meath, are not benefiting to the extent they should from the development of the tourism industry, which is very strong in the west and south.  However, we hope that, with the end of the Troubles in the North &mdash; the last 30 years have been traumatic to say the least &mdash; Border counties such as Louth, Monaghan, Meath and Cavan, in tandem with counties North of the Border such as Armagh, Down and Antrim, will take their rightful place in the sphere of tourism development on the island.</P>
      <P>Members who have had an opportunity to visit parts of Louth, particularly the Cooley peninsula, and have travelled northwards into south Armagh, south Down and Antrim, will realise the enchanting beauty of those places.  It would be a great pity if the tourism industry in that area were not to develop and play its role in the development of the local economies.</P>
      <P>It is proposed under the British-Irish Agreement to have an all-Ireland arrangement for the promotion and development of tourism.  That sector is a perfect example of how an all-Ireland approach will bring clear and tangible benefits to the economies of North and South.  The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has done an excellent job since his appointment 16 or 17 months ago.  The idea of developing a worthwhile project on the site of the Battle of the Boyne outside Drogheda has been mooted for some time and some thought has been given to it in various Departments.  I hope it is decided to proceed with that project because, apart from encouraging further reconciliation on the island, it also has a very important historical dimension.  I am not suggesting it can be developed cheaply &mdash; it will obviously cost some money &mdash; but the site exists and has historical significance for the country.</P>
      <P>There is obvious goodwill and support for this project North and South.  I hope it will be seriously considered as one of the projects addressed by the millennium committee because it would be very worthwhile and a major shot in the arm to the development of tourism in Counties Louth and Meath.  The Westferard development group is doing excellent work.  It is an upgraded tidy towns committee which is catering for a fairly wide geographic area in rural south Louth.  It is more than anxious that this project go ahead.  I ask the Minister and his Department to give serious consideration to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the issue of signposting. <Col N="1287" /> There is nothing more frustrating or irritating for people going to a new area than the lack of adequate signposting.  The tidy towns committee in County Louth regularly contacts us to complain about the inadequacy of signposting in remote corners of the county.  I realise it is expensive for local authorities to provide signs and that they are occasionally vandalised. However, if we are serious about tourism development, it is vitally important to get the signposting right.  We may have to provide more resources to local authorities for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Tourism is, by its nature, a seasonal industry. The investment cost in providing bed nights is quite significant and a short tourism season &mdash; which one might well have in our part of the country &mdash; could be demanding for providers operating on a tight budget.  I know there must be uniform policy across the country.  However, if we were to occasionally audit the expenditure of enterprise boards and Leader programmes we might find we could direct some of those funds to providing accommodation for one or two years in areas where there is a clear deficit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Kirk, for allowing me to share time.  I compliment the Minister on the hands-on and common sense job he is doing in the Department.  It is appropriate that in this Government sport and recreation were added to the Department of Tourism because they are an integral part of what we have to offer tourists.  Marketing is of considerable importance and it is important we continue to market our products well.</P>
      <P>I visited the IDA office when in Taiwan and asked the lady who manned it about the most frequent inquiries she got.  She told me the two most frequent inquiries were about tourism and education. Unfortunately, there is no facility in the IDA office in Taiwan to provide the type of detailed information which would be useful to people wishing to come to this country as visitors to learn or improve their English.  I suggest the Minister ask his Department to contact all State offices around the world to ensure they are well briefed on what we have to offer in terms of tourism. Perhaps the Minister for Education and Science would do the same, although I am sure this is appropriate to this Minister's Department.  The people who come here to improve their English are also tourists.  There is a tremendous market in this area.</P>
      <P>From the vibes I received abroad and from what was said to me in a number of countries, people prefer to come to Ireland to learn English because it is a nice country to come to for a few months.  That is an area at which the Minister might look.  In terms of Taiwan, perhaps the lady who mans the office and who is Taiwanese might be brought to Ireland for a couple of months to let her see what we have to offer so that she would be better briefed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a very clean environment and it is <Col N="1288" /> important we keep it that way.  We have clean air and water and we should do everything to ensure we maintain our clean environment not only for tourists but, most importantly, for those who live here.  Some Deputies referred to the pollution problems in Dublin caused by traffic and so on. We should keep pollution to a minimum and maintain our good environment.</P>
    <P>Another subject of interest is sunshine.  There is a view that too much sun is damaging.  We should sell, as one of the features of Ireland, the fact that the sun will do one no damage here. There is a swing away from holidays where people are over-exposed to strong sunshine.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with Deputy Kirk's point about signposts.  Signposting is essential not only for tourists but for ourselves.  I was travelling through the North one night after the Omagh bomb and there was a detour which placed us right into the heart of rural County Tyrone.  However, at every minor crossroads there were four signposts.  They were placed there permanently and not only for the diversion.  It struck me that if somebody got lost in the heart of my county, it would be difficult for them to find their way out.</P>
    <P>I received one positive comment from a former member of the US Congress who visited me while I was on holiday in County Donegal.  He was very positive about the signposting, the fact there was so little of it and that many of the signposts were turned in the wrong direction.  He had time on his hands and said that the bad signposting had brought him to places he would not have seen otherwise, so he was not complaining.  I do not believe that is a good recommendation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the peace agreement will do a tremendous amount for the country, particularly the Border areas.  I do not have to say anything to the Minister about the Border areas because he has been to the forefront in promoting these areas and improving relations on both sides of the Border.  There is an opportunity in this regard.  We must look at the marketing of the country as one unit, particularly in the Border area, including my area which does not have a great tradition of tourism.</P>
    <P>County Monaghan is very much linked with south Armagh where there has been phenomenal development, assisted by the different agencies. In my home village, that in which I was born, a £1.6 million cultural activity centre has been established which is doing very well.  We are very much interlinked with Cavan, Inniskeen, the lakes, fishing and the east Border region.  There is a great opportunity for joint marketing here.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister take an interest in the reopening of the Ulster canal?  Recently, a feasiblility study was produced on this project.  It is not unrealistic and would make a tremendous millennium project.  We all know the benefits of the Ballyconnell-Ballinmore canal.  As a cross-Border project, the Ulster canal would be very successful. I wish to put the following question to the Minister. If five million tourists arrived in Dublin airport on the same day, what would Bord Fáilte do <Col N="1289" /> to channel 1 per cent to Cavan-Monaghan, which have very good facilities to offer but where there is no tradition of tourism?  It is very hard to get tourists to come to these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on the great work he has done in the tourism area in his short time in office.  I listened with interest to the Minister's speech on the Bill in which he proposes to increase the statutory limit on the amount of Exchequer grant aid which may be paid to Bord Fáilte to support tourism capital development work.  The Minister gave the House a detailed and comprehensive account of the need to increase the statutory limits as set out in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Tourism is our second largest industry, with more than 120,000 people employed in it.  The importance of tourism to the economy cannot be over-emphasised.  I compliment Bord Fáilte and its workforce on the great work they are doing and congratulate the 120,000 people working in the tourism industry.  People are extremely nice here and that helps the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal to introduce a regional dimension into the international marketing policy of Bord Fáilte.  I am confident this policy decision will be of particular benefit to less well known regions.  I come from a region which is even less well known than the Minister's county.  I was in Killarney during the summer and was amazed at the number of buses outside the hotels.  One might see one or two buses outside hotels in Sligo.  We are probably not selling our beautiful lake, the Lake Isle of Innisfree, half as well as the Killarney lakes.  It is wonderful to see the number of tourists in the south and south-east. The Minister's efforts with regard to the regional authorities is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry must undergo a cold war. One is always fighting for tourism and the range of facilities offered is vital.  In recent years, hotels have offered facilities all year round and this is wonderful.  The Minister is aware of how the Border region has suffered over the past 30 years up to the British-Irish Agreement.  I thank him for making grants available to the seven Border counties and County Mayo to build new hotels. This tax free incentive is a step in the right direction and I welcome it.  The grants will help tourism no end in the west.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned rail links. Although we would prefer if the trains were better, there is an excellent link between Dublin and Sligo.  A hotel in Sligo does very well as a result. It offers a good deal to visitors of approximately £90 for three nights bed and breakfast and three evening meals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> There are three airports in the region, Knock, Sligo and Carrickfin in the Minister's constituency of County Donegal.  If an aeroplane flew from Dublin and stopped in Knock, Sligo and Carrickfin to drop off and pick up passengers, many more tourists would come to the west.  The majority of people like to travel quickly and that is why the south is doing so well.  Knock Airport is in an excellent location.  It has one of the best runways in Europe and can accommodate aeroplanes of all sizes.  The only problem is the cost of fares.  It is much cheaper to fly from Dublin to various parts of Europe than from Knock.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned signposting.  More must be done in that regard.  If one is travelling from Sligo, there are no signposts for Knock.  I hope this matter will be corrected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Brennan for his good advertisement for the local hotel.  He must give me the name of it before the House adjourns.</P>
      <P>Many of the points made during the debate were interesting and positive.  Much praise and recognition was given to the various changes that have taken place in recent years.  However, I do not intend to be as complimentary.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to note that the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, for reasons which may be best known to the Minister, is one of the three Departments from which it is difficult for Opposition Deputies to get answers to parliamentary questions.  The three Departments often give responses to the effect that the relevant Minister does not have responsibility for a particular matter. This does not give a good impression to the Opposition and it is not a good idea from a Minister's point of view to have a culture growing in a Department that the Opposition should be given as little information as possible.  This is dangerous.</P>
      <P>So far as the development and marketing of tourism is concerned, the most important aspects from the customer's point of view is good quality service, high standards, good presentation and good value for money.  If those objectives are achieved and combined in a single package, half the battle is over.  Unfortunately, those attributes are not always combined.  The quality of service has improved immensely in the past ten years to the extent that it is barely recognisable now.  I compliment the hotels, restaurants and guesthouses throughout the country which now provide a high quality of service which is comparable to anything available elsewhere in the world.  This is how it should be; we should not be second class because we have the ability to be first in the field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much can still be done in the area of presentation. It leaves much to be desired everywhere. If one goes to a town or village in any part of the country and looks over the bridge at the end of a main street, one is likely to observe a number of plastic bags, a supermarket trolley, if not two, one or two prams, the wheel of a bike and the handlebars of another bike in two separate locations. <Col N="1291" /> This presents a bad image of any area.  I did not see anything like it in any other place in Europe I have visited.  It gives an awful image in what is otherwise a good package.</P>
    <P>If one drives along a country road during the summer, one will find weeds about six feet high leaning out across the road.  A number of speakers referred to this matter.  Local authorities no longer cut the weeds, particularly giant hogweed which is the most famous and also dangerous.  I do not understand why nobody has ever suggested that people get together, discuss the matter with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local authority and do something to improve presentation in that regard. This applies to most parts of the country, with one or two exceptions.  It is a serious problem. Will the Minister examine it and consider whether he can co-ordinate the efforts of his and other Departments with a view to addressing this matter.</P>
    <P>The tidy towns competition has been very effective and useful in improving the presentation of various towns and villages.  However, perhaps the format needs to be reconsidered because an incentive to small towns and villages to come from way down the list and achieve something which can be built on the following year is lacking. Areas which are already developed and presented to a high standard have a distinct advantage.  The competition needs to be reconsidered with a view to identifying ways in which each town and village can best present itself.  I do not suggest the competition should be discontinued, but an incentive should be offered directly to towns and villages which are starting off.</P>
    <P>Good value for money is important.  This aspect has also improved immensely.  The value for money available now was not even dreamed of 20 years ago.  I compliment hotels, restaurants, guesthouses and pubs in that regard.  Occasionally one meets someone who is in the rip-off business. The trade is the best way to police this problem. One person ripping off tourists is enough to give the whole area and business a bad name.  There are ways of addressing this issue and the Minister should give it his attention.  Some 99 per cent of service providers are conscious of the competitive nature of the business and do a brilliant job. However, one will always get the 1 per cent who does not.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have mentioned signage.  Sherlock Holmes would have difficulty finding some of our towns and villages.  Worse still is the misleading information caused by people turning signposts in the opposite direction.  One can travel for ten or 15 miles only to come across another signpost indicating that one should have gone in the opposite direction.  The simple way to deal with this problem is to use square instead of circular pillars which cannot be so easily turned.</P>
    <P>As a former member of an Oireachtas committee I have to say that information was not so readily available from the Department via parliamentary <Col N="1292" /> questions.  I hope to see an improvement in this area.  Responsibility for angling is spread across a number of Departments.  However, the Minister's Department is in the tourism business and tourism means attracting people by one means or another.  More salmon were caught in the Moy fisheries in the past 12 months than in all of Scotland.  Surely the Department should be able to obtain that information and use it in a positive way to ensure that the fisheries are developed, assisted and marketed.  The product will sell itself.  That is just one example concerning fresh water fish, and considerable work has also been done on coarse fishing in the past few years.  This is an example of where Departments could beneficially liaise to ensure that efforts are made to co-ordinate activities.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the vista which tourists see when travelling throughout the country.  Considerable successes have been achieved in this area but much needs to be done.  We must recognise the damage caused by eye sores, such as car scrap yards.  There is legislation to deal with this problem but we should resort more to the carrot than the stick to address this issue.  There have been some improvements but many problems remain.  I have referred to cans and bicycles in rivers.  A greater interest is being taken in canals and this is welcome.  Canals are better maintained than rivers which need that kind of attention.  Will the Minister liaise with other relevant Departments so as to co-ordinate efforts?</P>
    <P>Tourism is about successful marketing.  One's ability to sell a product for consecutive seasons depends on a number of issues.  One of the most important is that if the person to whom the product is being sold is satisfied in the first instance, they will tell someone else.  If they are not satisfied they will tell a different story.  All other aspects referred to by speakers are important and form part of the package presented to the visitor. As visitors leave they will look back.  Everyone who has been to a foreign location will always recall their thoughts as they left the country. Were they satisfied with the service?  Was the location clean?  Were the standards high and would they return?  Whatever one's thoughts are when one leaves a location will determine whether one returns.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not rest on his laurels.  We wish to give constructive criticism.  The points raised by speakers need to be attended to and not put on the long finger.  If we deal adequately with a fraction of these issues, tourists will look back and will want to return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone welcomes the increase in the Vote for capital expenditure on tourism.  We all envy the Minister in his lovely job in the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. What did the Minister, and his predecessor, Deputy Kenny, do to deserve that job?  Unfortunately for the Minister he does not play golf.  If he did he would be involved in all the pro-am classics.  He would have the life of Reilly.  Listening <Col N="1293" /> to this debate must be the toughest part of the Minister's job.  There are good and bad jobs in Government, but the Departments of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Foreign Affairs must rate as the best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we sure that some of these drugs are not intended to knobble our athletes or rugby players rather than enhance their performance? A medical person such as the Minister could answer that question.  They do not always seem to have the desired effect.  We do not condone their use.  It is a bombshell but I congratulate Neil Francis who was not afraid to raise this issue.  To a large extent he uncovered this problem as did others in swimming.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate how the £15 million will be spent?  I have always found that funding was not available for a person who wished to expand an hotel.  Funding for bedrooms was excluded.  I would like to know what precisely the £15 million covers; it is a sizeable amount of money and could not be invested in a better area than tourism.  It will only be a short time before tourism becomes our major industry, superseding agriculture.</P>
      <P>The figures the Minister has outlined in regard to the visitor numbers and expenditure on tourism are awesome.  The number of visitors to this country has increased in the space of nine years from 2.4 to five million.  That is a tremendous increase.  A total of 120,000 people are employed in the industry.  I note that in the first six months of this year, the figures are running 11 per cent ahead of target.  Earnings from foreign tourism have jumped by 370 per cent in the space of eight years, making tourism the fastest growing industry in the country.</P>
      <P>I have heard a peculiar complaint from some hotel managers, namely, that they cannot get trained staff.  In a country with in excess of 250,000 unemployed that is difficult to believe. Hotel owners are recruiting employees from France, Spain and other continental countries. That is probably a reflection on the extent of the black economy in Ireland as well as of the current economic boom.  Some people are not prepared to work for a particular wage unless they are being paid under the counter and many genuine people seeking work are unable to secure it.  A certain type of worker is required in the hotel industry; the work would not suit everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the hotel training management schools is located in the Minister's constituency in Killybegs. Some hotel managers and owners feel that graduates are not entering the business here, possibly because they find more attractive outlets in the UK and Europe.  If that is true, it is a serious state of affairs.  We should do everything in our power to channel trained and qualified <Col N="1294" /> people into the Irish tourism industry.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>
    <P>The reason for the explosion in tourist numbers is due to the availability of cheap airline fares for the past ten years due to deregulation.  When I hear people criticising independent companies such as Ryanair, Virgin Atlantic and others which have transformed the industry in this country I get very annoyed.  They may have their shortcomings and some of their chief executives may be somewhat precocious but they get results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the reason the Government has not approved the granting of an export licence to Dromone Meats and to seek an explanation why the Department has no veterinary staff.  The pig meat industry is in a state of chassis and many people are losing their livelihoods as a result.  Last March, the Department was asked to approve an export licence to Dromone Meats.  The company received grants to upgrade its plant but the Department decided to investigate the plant to see whether it was up to standard.  For the benefit of Members I wish to read a letter from government buildings in Cavan to Mr. Hanlon, the owner of Dromone Meats:</P>
      <P>Dear Kieran,</P>
      <P>I have spoken with P.J. Rogan and B. McInerney in Agriculture House.  Your plan has passed all the requirements for export approval and the appropriate stamp.  However, due to the ongoing lack of Department staff to service your operation, there will be a further delay until late autumn.  Agriculture House is in the process of acquiring veterinary and technical personnel.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister decide to open McCarrens in Cavan and provide the staff for it, yet refuse to provide staff for Dromone Meats?  I believe Avonmore has a hold on this Minister and Government and that the pressure exerted by that company has prevented the Government certifying Dromone Meats to slaughter animals for export.  As a result, farmers are going out of business by the new time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The pig industry is in a disastrous state.  A total of 10,000 pigs are being held back from slaughter.  The Minister, to whom I spoke recently, has refused to grant the necessary licence to Dromone Meats which would allow pigs to be slaughtered and exported.  Thankfully, there have been some negotiations in recent days in regard to the reopening of McCarrens.  That plant was significantly financed by successive Governments and it is a disaster it has been <Col N="1295" /> allowed to remain closed for so long.  The main issues for the disposal of pigs relate to the APS scheme and export refunds.  Unfortunately, the much needed export credit scheme was not approved and, as a result the factories have not taken up any of the APS.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGinley told me today that pigs cannot be sold in Donegal where all that is available is 50p per lb.  In Avonmore, a farmer who is a long-term supplier can get about 73p in County Cavan.  If he has been put out because of the burning down of the factory in Northern Ireland he will get 63p if he is lucky.  If he has to keep them an extra week he will only get 40p because they are overweight.  Putting 2,000 tonnes of pigmeat into APS would mean 32,000 pigs could be taken out of the system.</P>
      <P>The Department charges £25 to give a certificate to export pigs to Northern Ireland.  This could be waived in Counties Cavan and Monaghan, something which has already been done in County Donegal.  Why has the Government levy of £1.25 not been waived as a gesture?  This was done by Deputy Yates when he was Minister and surely it can be done again.  Small farmers are being forced out of business.</P>
      <P>In the past few days farmers have been slaughtering baby female pigs.  This shows how serious is the position.  Many farmers are closing their businesses or being forced to close.  Banks, millers and others have been sympathetic but what is being sought now is a little help to reopen McCarrens bacon factory and get the Minister to issue a licence for export purposes for a factory in Dromone which is already State aided and approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Crawford and Farrelly for raising the issue and am glad to have the opportunity to respond on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture and Food who cannot be present.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies are aware the difficulties in the pig sector throughout the EU have come about as a result of a number of factors, the chief one being over-production.  In the EU consumption of pigmeat has not increased to any great extent and this has not helped matters.  Added to this the markets in Japan and Russia, traditionally large outlets for EU pigmeat, have very much under-performed this year.  The Russian market has in fact been closed for the past couple of months due to the turmoil in the financial markets there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A bad situation in the pigmeat sector in Ireland was made worse by a fire at a pigmeat plant in Northern Ireland which was slaughtering about 5,000 pigs per week from pig producers based mainly in the Border regions.  These producers were finding some difficulty having their pigs slaughtered, so to deal with this arrangements were put in place following agreement between the Department, the IFA and the Irish Association of Pigmeat Producers to slaughter pigs on Saturdays and on overtime during the week.  As <Col N="1296" /> a result weekly slaughtering at EU approved plants are showing an increase of between 5,000 and 8,000 pigs per week.</P>
    <P>Referring back to the fire at the pigmeat plant in Northern Ireland, the Minister understands the owners of that premises have since purchased Unipork, a large pigmeat premises also situated in Northern Ireland.  The Minister understands that since the takeover Unipork has increased the number of pigs slaughtered and this should help pig farmers in Border regions.</P>
    <P>With regard to McCarrens pigmeat factory in Cavan the decision to reopen or not is a commercial one for the parties involved.  That said, the Minister is glad to say it is expected the plant will reopen soon for business, perhaps as early as next week.  He understands negotiations in that regard are being finalised and an announcement is expected shortly.  When the plant reopens, it will be able to slaughter a maximum of 6,000 pigs per week.  This will undoubtedly make a large contribution towards alleviating the slaughtering problems of the Border regions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Dromone Meats factory in Oldcastle, it is not possible to grant an EU export licence to the factory at this time.  While the factory has reached the required standard, the increased supervisory requirements involved in the changeover from domestic to EU status have immediate and considerable staff resource implications for the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>

      <P>An EU export licence will be granted to this company as soon as the necessary supervisory arrangements can be put in place. The Minister assures the Deputies that every effort is being made in this regard with a view to having the matter resolved in the quickest possible time.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made every possible effort to alleviate the situation in the pigmeat market and has been successful in putting in place and improving a range of market supports.  The record is there for all to see.  The Commission increased export refunds last May following a request from the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  With the market continuing to be weak, he followed this up at the end of July with a further request to the Commission to increase export refunds.  The request got agreement from the Commission which increased export refunds with effect from 4 August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this the market continued to be weak and he, with a number of colleagues on the Council of Agriculture Ministers from a number of other member states, approached the Commission asking for the introduction of an aids to private storage scheme, or APS.  Once again the Commission responded positively and an APS scheme was introduced with effect from 28 September. This is a scheme worthy of major support from processors throughout the EU.  It provides <Col N="1297" /> for EU funding for the storage of up to 70,000 tonnes of pigmeat with the choice of leaving the product in store for four, five or six months duration. At the end of the storage period the product must be exported to third countries and will attract an export refund where appropriate.  The Minister urges the Irish processing sector to make full use of the support schemes available, particularly the APS scheme now in place as a result of the Minister's efforts.</P>
    <P>As recently as last week at the pigmeat management committee Ireland, with several other member states, successfully got Commission agreement to increase export refunds for fresh and frozen pigmeat products by 33.33 per cent. This is a major achievement, but nonetheless the Minister will continue to keep a watchful eye on the market.</P>
    <P>Regarding disposal, Bord Bia launched a pigmeat promotion programme to encourage sales on the home market.  This should play its part in increasing the level of domestic consumption.</P>
    <P>The Minister is confident that the operation of export refunds, which have been increased substantially on three occasions in the past five months, and the fulsome participation of pigmeat traders in the aids to private storage scheme will lead to an improvement in pigmeat prices and thus help restore balance in the market and give reasonable returns to all involved in the sector.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Hepatitis C Incidence.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this matter.  The House is well aware of the scandal of infection of over 1,600 women with the hepatitis C virus from contaminated blood products.  With around half the cases now dealt with by the compensation tribunal, the final cost of this scandal to the taxpayer will be over £350 million.  To put it in perspective, this sum would build nearly three new hospitals.  All those infected are deserving of compensation and full health care.</P>
      <P>To date, none of those who caused this infection has been brought to justice.  Indeed, many of those criticised in the Finlay report on the blood tribunal are taking legal action to quash adverse findings against them by the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The name of one brave women is etched on the minds of all those who have followed this tragic affair.  The late Brigid McCole was hounded by the last Government &mdash; of which my party was a member.  Only on her death bed did the blood bank settle reluctantly for a miserable sum.  Mrs. McCole was forced to go public as the State used every legal technicality to deny her the right to the truth and proper compensation.  The same approach was used recently in the Mary Quinlan case.  We now have the spectre of the current Minister for Health and Children adopting a hard cop approach to other sick women infected with hepatitis C, particularly in the case of Mrs. Sandra Fallon of Chicago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> In a breathtaking display of inhumanity the Government has refused to provide health care to a woman who, clearly on the evidence presented, received contaminated anti-D product at Castlebar hospital in 1993.  There is a scandal in this case which must be exposed.  The Government came to power on the promise of dealing compassionately with victims of hepatitis C infection. What is the Minister's current attitude?  He asked Mrs. Fallon to prove her case to the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the agency which infected her, covered up the scandal and claimed she had a different strain of the virus to others who were infected.  This claim was made despite a test carried out at the UCD virus reference laboratory which shows Mrs. Fallon has the same virus as others.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked Mrs. Fallon to go to the compensation tribunal.  However, privately he knows it cannot examine the scandal of this case or get to the truth.  What is the Government scared of?  This is the first international case of its kind and what has it revealed?  Since this scandal became public in early 1994 the blood bank has not made any proper attempt to trace Irish women who received contaminated blood products and who subsequently went to live abroad before the scandal broke.  In newspaper advertisements this week the BTSB states that international advertising, which is to follow, will help trace those abroad who were infected.  The blood bank has waited nearly five years to undertake that search of sick and dying Irish women abroad.  This is a scandal.</P>
    <P>The Minister's handling of Sandra Fallon's case is inhuman.  He should ensure that the BTSB provides Mrs. Fallon with the health care she needs until the issues in contention are resolved.  By refusing to do so he runs the risk of allowing a sick woman to die, a woman infected by this State.  She is as deserving as others who have been infected.</P>
    <P>Because she is from America the State seems to want to question her status and morals with snide insinuations about how she might have contracted the virus from other sources.  My daughter had to suffer the same insinuations, yet she considered herself lucky because despite the inhuman things that happened to her she has been receiving treatment.  What future faces my grandson in the unlikely event that tests prove positive?  Will he have to travel this long road for justice?</P>
    <P>The public have seen and heard Mrs. Fallon. She is a genuine person, a mother of a young boy and the wife of a deeply caring father.  The hospital records provide good grounds to support her case that she received contaminated anti-D. We also know that more than 300 batches of potentially contaminated anti-D were sent to Castlebar General Hospital.  There is good reason to believe that her medical records were altered to cover up the fact that she received contaminated anti-D.  Those who are not directly affected by the hepatitis C scandal may feel a little weary <Col N="1299" /> of the subject.  They should remember how this State treated Mrs. Brigid McCole and how the members of the Government criticised the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, over his handling of the issue.  The lessons of the past have not been learned.  That is something which should concern every citizen who may have reason to use the health services some day.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Deputy has taken it that way.  I expressed a genuine sentiment which has not been reciprocated.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Deputy's questions in this case, as there have been a considerable number of inaccurate statements on these matters.  I again express my sympathy for Mrs. Fallon.  It is most unfortunate that she has contracted hepatitis C and from my contacts with other sufferers I can understand the difficulties she is experiencing at this time.</P>
      <P>There is a serious dispute between Mrs. Fallon and the Western Health Board.  The Western Health Board has stated that its medical records show that anti-D was not administered to her while under its care in March 1993.  Mrs. Fallon is of the strong view that anti-D was administered to her following the birth of her child in Castlebar Hospital in March 1993, and has alleged that the medical record was later altered to denote that anti-D was not administered.  This is a serious allegation, and I understand that the Garda have commenced an investigation into the allegation, at the request of Mr. and Mrs. Fallon, and they will examine the board's records <i>in situ</i> next week.  At my request, the Western Health Board has also arranged for the solicitor acting for Mrs. Fallon to gain access to all the hospital's records relating to the case in their original format, and the solicitor will review those records at Castlebar Hospital next Tuesday, 27 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mrs. Fallon tested positive for hepatitis C under the BTSB's blood screening programme in October 1997.  Her test result showed that her virus was Genotype 3, which is associated with the anti-D contamination in 1991-94.  However, a genotype is a broad classification and, using sophisticated technology, viruses from the same source can be shown to be related.  Such tests are <Col N="1300" /> often carried out where a link between the anti-D product and the hepatitis C infection requires to be elucidated, particularly in relation to the anti-D product manufactured in 1991-94, as the level of infection in that product was very low.  In Mrs. Fallon's case, this test was carried out by an independent laboratory which was jointly run by the Scottish Blood Transfusion Service and the University of Edinburgh.  In its opinion, the test result indicated that the source of the hepatitis C in this case was not from anti-D.  This is rejected by Mrs. Fallon on the basis that it is claimed it is possible for the hepatitis C virus to mutate.  It is Mrs. Fallon's contention that her virus initially showed the same sequence, but has changed over time.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the independent laboratory's position is that, while mutations in the virus do occur, they develop at a defined and steady rate, and its judgment is that insufficient time has elapsed to account for the difference between the sequence in the 1991-94 anti-D product and the sequence relating to Mrs. Fallon's virus.  Taking that scientific fact into account, the University of Edinburgh has come to the conclusion that the test result indicated that the source of hepatitis C in this case was not from anti-D.</P>
    <P>I point out to the Deputy that the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme was introduced in 1994 to ensure that persons, who had contracted hepatitis C through the administration within the State of infected blood and blood products made available by the BTSB, did not undergo any undue hardship in availing of treatment for their condition.  The <i>ex gratia</i> payments are made on an interim basis, pending the award of compensation by the compensation tribunal or the courts.  The scheme is administered by the BTSB, not by the Department.</P>
    <P>When Mrs. Fallon wrote to me last June, following the BTSB's decision to discontinue <i>ex gratia</i> payments to her, I acknowledged that she did not accept the basis on which the <i>ex gratia</i> payments had been stopped, and I undertook to request a report from the BTSB explaining its decision.  I also pointed out that the compensation tribunal had the statutory authority to make decisions on causation, and that I would endeavour to arrange an early hearing for her on the causation issue alone, if that was her wish.  When the BTSB submitted its report, giving details of the scientific test results, to which I have referred, a copy of the report was sent to Mrs. Fallon.  The offer of an early hearing before the compensation tribunal on the causation issue independent of considerations of compensation, was also reiterated at that time.  It was also pointed out that the BTSB had notified Mrs. Fallon on a number of occasions that it would review its decision on the <i>ex gratia</i> payments on receipt of medical evidence regarding the administration of anti-D as alleged.</P>
    <P>The reasons I have always proposed the compensation tribunal as the proper forum to have this issue resolved are as follows: the tribunal is an independent statutory authority established by the Oireachtas to determine causation on the balance <Col N="1301" /> of probabilities; it affords the best opportunity of having the issue resolved quickly; approximately 1,000 claimants have availed of the compensation tribunal to date; and the four groups representing people who contracted hepatitis C through the administration of blood and blood products have confidence in the tribunal's ability to resolve claims for compensation, including the question of causation.</P>
    <P>In the media presentation of this case, there have been a number of inaccurate statements made concerning the tribunal's powers and procedures.  It was claimed, for instance, and reiterated this evening, that the tribunal does not have the power to compel witnesses to attend or to give evidence or to produce relevant documents.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the House.  The powers given to the tribunal by the Oireachtas are quite clear.  Section 4(11) of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, provides that a claimant may require the attendance of any person at a tribunal hearing to give evidence in relation to the claimant's claim, or require any person to produce to the claimant any document in relation to a claimant's claim.  Section 3(10)(a) of the Act provides that the tribunal may, on its own behalf or at the request of a claimant, where a person has failed to comply with a requirement of the claimant under section 4(11), give notice in writing to any person requiring them to attend the tribunal or to produce any documents which relate to the hearing.  Section 3(1)(c) of the Act provides that a person to whom such notice is given who refuses or wilfully neglects to attend the hearing, or to give evidence, or to produce the relevant documents, shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, Mrs. Fallon has so far indicated that she is not prepared to have her case heard by the tribunal, even though this could be arranged within three or four weeks.  My whole strategy has been to achieve an early resolution of this case in the interests of all parties, not to take sides on the issue.  There are evidently two sides to the story.  There are a number of parties involved in this case, including the medical and nursing staff at Castlebar Hospital, one of whom is now deceased.  Understandably, the allegations being made have caused considerable upset.  I am very conscious also of Mrs. Fallon's distress as she has been infected with hepatitis C whatever the cause.  In the circumstances, it is inappropriate that the efforts to resolve this issue, which concern many aspects of patient confidentiality, be carried out in the media.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy of my continuing efforts to have this issue resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of tens of thousands of building workers and their families, I am calling on the Minister for Finance to end the C45 system of tax collection in the construction industry. Over six months ago in an Adjournment debate with my colleague, Deputy Tommy Broughan, the Minister was warned that building workers were in danger of being jailed for their principled opposition to the use of the C45 system, particularly on the Crampton's building sites.  The Minister did nothing, and as we speak two building workers are incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison &mdash; not because they failed to pay their tax, not because they were working and claiming the dole.</P>
      <P>I express my support for and solidarity with the building workers, and deplore the fact that two of their members have been thrown in jail.  It is bizarre that the reason is that they wanted to pay their fair share of tax under the PAYE system, just like other PAYE tax-compliant workers.</P>
      <P>Over many years, serious allegations of abuses of the tax system and social welfare codes have been made against certain employers and sub-contractors who use the C45 system.  More than a quarter of a million C45s were issued in 1997 for 100,000 building workers, and many commentators have pointed out discrepancies in their use and in the number employed in construction. These figures tell their own story.  The Minister must finally accept that the C45 system is a godsend to employers who wish to operate in the black economy and evade tax and social insurance.</P>
      <P>To add to this, there are disturbing allegations also of the use of workers from Northern Ireland to facilitate the abuse of the North's and Republic's social welfare systems.  The great mass of carpenters, bricklayers and plasterers and their assistants wish to return to the PAYE and social insurance system.</P>
      <P>With the C45 system, workers have no provision for sickness, unemployment, holidays and, especially, none for retirement.  The general taxpayer is left to carry the can and provide for construction workers because of the inequitable C45 system.  Even in the long period of Tory rule in the UK, the Conservative Government felt their C45 system &mdash; known there as the 715 system &mdash; was a disaster and a huge front for their black economy, and they abolished it.  So even Mrs. Thatcher regarded this approach as unfair and unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A growing number of Irish builders have now returned to the PAYE system for their tradespeople in recent years.  The Crampton organisation, however, has refused to negotiate with workers' representatives, BATU and OPATS, and have successfully sought injunctions to have workers sent to jail.  Indeed, the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> has also been prevented by injunction from photographing Crampton's sites, yet serious allegations of false identities, 19 year old sub-contractors, <Col N="1303" /> and promises of cash-in-hand have been made about these sites.</P>
    <P>Over six months ago, my colleague, Deputy Tommy Broughan, called on Dermot Quigley, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Mary Harney, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Charlie McCreevy, to investigate these allegations immediately.  They have done nothing.  It is clear this Government is not prepared to take on any of the serious issues in the building industry. Why?  I would say it arises from the long-standing cosy arrangement between Fianna Fáil and the building industry, the builders in particular.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Ivor Callely can answer this in the light of the scandalous remarks he made on the Order of Business on Tuesday when my colleague expressed his concern to the Taoiseach that these workers could end up in jail.  Deputy Callely stated: &ldquo;They should be in jail&rdquo;.  Sadly, Deputy Callely's wish has come true, and he is probably now happy at the outcome.</P>
    <P>In the forthcoming Finance Bill, I urge the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy to abolish the C45 system for bricklayers, plasterers and carpenters and their assistants.  This would prevent the current farcical situation of building workers being imprisoned because they want to pay their fair share of tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the central issues here is the complaint about alleged black economy practices in the construction industry, and about pressures on building workers to accept sub-contractor rather than employee status.  Sub-contracting itself is, and always has been, an integral part of the construction industry.</P>
      <P>It will be useful to give a résumé of the system of tax collection as it has developed in the construction industry over the past 20 years or so. Persons employed in that industry are classified for tax purposes either as employees or sub-contractors and tax is deducted from each group on a different basis.</P>
      <P>Payments to sub-contractors come within the Relevant Contracts Tax system &mdash; commonly referred to as the C2 or C45 system.  Under this system, where a principal contractor makes a payment to an unregistered contractor, he or she is required to deduct Relevant Contracts Tax from those payments at the rate of 35 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RCT system was introduced in the 1970s to counter the growing incidence of black economy activity in the construction industry.  Workers operating under the system known as &ldquo;the lump&rdquo; were being paid without tax being deducted.  This happened because the workers in question, mainly groups of tradesmen, were not employees of the main contractor making the payments and, accordingly, were not in the PAYE system. Under RCT, tax is deducted at the rate of 35 per <Col N="1304" /> cent from relevant payments except where the sub-contractor has produced a certificate of authorisation or C2 to the principal contractor, and the principal contractor has received a &ldquo;relevant payments card&rdquo; or C47 from the inspector of taxes authorising him to make payments without deducting tax.</P>
    <P>To get a C2, a sub-contractor must operate from a fixed place of business in the State, and for a period of at least three years prior to the issue of the C2, must have fully complied with all his or her taxation and reporting obligations under the tax code.  The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed that RCT continues to play a vital role in combating tax evasion in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>Following a comprehensive review in 1995 and 1996, the Revenue Commissioners issued guidelines for the industry setting out the criteria under which a person may be regarded as an employee as distinct from a sub-contractor.  Principal contractors and sub-contractors creating self-employment contractual arrangements must sign a joint declaration to the effect that these guidelines have been considered by them and they are both satisfied that the contract created is a contract of self-employment.</P>
    <P>This joint declaration was introduced in line with the recommendation of a sub-committee of the Black Economy Monitoring Group which looked at the construction industry.  It is of interest at this stage to list the current membership of that group.  Its members are drawn from IBEC, the CIF, ICTU and the SFA as well as the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The Black Economy Monitoring Group has been in existence for some time.  It was set up under the PESP, and has continued under each of the subsequent national agreements.</P>
    <P>Both parties to the joint declaration certify that they have considered the guidelines issued by the Revenue Commissioners as to the difference between contracts of service &mdash; employment contracts &mdash; and contracts for services &mdash; self-employment &mdash; and are satisfied that the contract which they are about to enter is a contract for services.</P>
    <P>RCT applies only to payments to self-employed sub-contractors.  PAYE applies to payments by an employer to employees.  The application of the RCT regime to genuine employees would deprive such individuals of social welfare benefits to which they are entitled.  It would also mean a loss in PAYE, PRSI and levies.  Some employers may consider that by operating the RCT system, the nature of the payments is changed from wages to payments to self-employed sub-contractors.  This is a mistaken view.  Even where a joint declaration has been completed, the question as to whether the contract is one of self-employment or of employment will depend on the nature of the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>Where the relationship between a builder and a person to whom he or she makes payments is <Col N="1305" /> that of employer-employee, the builder is liable for the PAYE, PRSI and levies which should have been deducted from those payments, even where the parties have completed the joint declaration &mdash; form RCT1 &mdash; and the builder has deducted RCT from the payments and issued a C45.  The Revenue Commissioners have recently completed a nationwide campaign to ensure the declarations made by principal contractors and subcontractors represent the true position.  Where an employment is considered to exist and PAYE-PRSI and levies are not being deducted, the principal is being advised to put matters on a proper footing.  Where this is not done, the principal will become liable for the PAYE-PRSI and levies. Each principal classified by the Revenue Commissioners as an employer can have that decision reviewed internally in the Revenue Commissioners and has a statutory right of appeal to the appeal commissioners.</P>
    <P>In their ongoing drive to identify the correct basis of deduction of tax in respect of each individual, the Revenue Commissioners are happy to receive information from other organisations and individuals.  Facilities have been made available to trade union representatives, for example, to report cases where they consider that PAYE should have applied instead of RCT.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have received a number of representations about the growth of self-employment in the construction industry. There is a strongly held view that a great number of persons in the industry who supply labour only services and are being treated as self-employed by principal contractors should be reclassified as employees.  There have been campaigns on certain construction sites to ensure employers take on people as employees rather than as self-employed contractors where such people are more correctly classified as employees.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which a nationwide compliance campaign was mounted by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners are determined that the prescribed RCT procedures will be complied with.  They cannot, however, dictate the terms under which workers are engaged in an industry.  RCT is in place to ensure subcontractors in the construction industry do not escape their tax liabilities.  While the increasing incidence of RCT may mirror a drift to self-employment within the industry, it is not the cause of the drift.  It mirrors the worldwide trend towards contracting out and reflects the increased flexibility of work practices.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners campaign to investigate possible abuses was completed recently.  It involved visiting more than 7,000 principal contractors nationwide.  No problems were found in 52 per cent of cases.  Where problems were detected, the vast majority of employers, 74 per cent, agreed to abide by the Revenue Commissioners ruling.  In cases where this ruling was not accepted, these may be subject to further Revenue Commissioners compliance activity, including follow-up visits, possible auditing and, <Col N="1306" /> where necessary, assessments of additional tax.  A further indication of the in-depth nature of the compliance campaign which the Revenue Commissioners undertook is that in the Dublin area alone the status of more than 35,000 subcontractors was examined.</P>
    <P>A Revenue Commissioners ruling may be challenged by an employer who is entitled to appeal to the Appeal Commissioners if he considers a ruling to be incorrect.  In this context, the total of approximately 87 per cent of all principal contractors with whom the Revenue Commissioners would now be in agreement is a significant pointer to the level of compliance in the area.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that there have always been difficulties in the construction industry.  I am confident, however, that the efforts which have been made to counter the black economy in this sector will lead to improvements.</P>

      <P>Fairyhouse special residential school in Clonmel is funded by the special education section of the Department of Education and Science and accepts children referred to it by the probation and welfare service, school attendance committees and health boards.  All the children have special education needs relating to a mixture of tempermental and adverse circumstances which have impacted on their education, emotional and social development.  The majority have suffered various forms of abuse and neglect, physical, sexual and emotional.  The outward manifestations of the cumulative history of abuse and neglect include non-school attendance, delinquency, drug and alcohol abuse, parasuicide and educational under-achievement.</P>
      <P>The average length of stay at Fairyhouse special residential school is between three and five years during which time significant progress is made, though the children remain vulnerable. Most, however, leave the school on reaching the age of 16.  Frequently they return to a hostile dysfunctional environment with little or no support. Because of this many of the hard won gains are dissipated.  The children slide back into criminal activity, drug and alcohol abuse, parasuicide which, in some cases, is completed.  Any educational gains made are not built upon.  Apart from the personal misery involved, there is an increased demand on State services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the opinion of Fairyhouse special residential school that an adequately resourced after-care service would minimise this adverse outcome. The after-care working group at the school is prepared to spend time and energy in producing a proposal for such a service.  It is important, however, that it does not waste its time and energy in producing a proposal which would stand little or no chance of attracting Government funding, either singly or jointly, from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Health and Children. <Col N="1307" /> An after-care service would be a suitable project for collaboration between all three Departments to help these vulnerable, troubled and troublesome children.  The Minister of State should consider establishing a discussion group comprising representatives of the school and the Departments in question to devise a proposal which would attract funding to ensure the children concerned do not encounter further difficulties.</P>

They provide a total of 210 places for boys and 15 for girls.  Programmes of care and education are provided for the children in question.  Behaviour modification programmes are followed with the aim of rehabilitating the children.  Good child care practice demands that proper planning is undertaken when children enter residential care.  This detailed planning addresses the questions of how care is to support and prepare the young person for their re-entry into the community and family.</P>
      <P>Early case reviews and case conferences will identify a detailed care plan and, with the family, probation and welfare service, social workers and other key personnel involved in the life of the child, will work towards the eventual discharge from residential care of the young person.  No child is discharged from a special residential school for young offenders without a discharge plan being in place.  This will normally make provision for discharge on the following basis: returning the child to the family with support; returning the child to the family and joining, for example, a FÁS course; returning the child to a hostel and/or supportive care environment.  The probation and welfare service which works in partnership with the young offender schools often continues to support children when they are discharged from residential care.</P>
      <P>The Department is progressing plans in one of the young offender schools for the establishment of an on campus pre-release preparation facility. This unit will be specifically designed to cater for children who are to be reintroduced to the community. The unit will reflect as far as possible normal domestic living where the young people will prepare to live independently as part of a family and community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has a wide range of supports in place in the areas of socio-economic disadvantage to which the Deputy referred.  These supports include early intervention measures which provide additional supports for young people at risk.  These measures are aimed at optimising their participation in and benefit from the education system.  They include major initiatives such as remedial and home/school/community liaison services, co-ordination with other agencies, guidance and psychological services, and ancillary services <Col N="1308" /> and resources for schools in disadvantaged areas as well as the breaking the cycle initiative.</P>
    <P>A number of youth encounter projects are also provided for young people who have either become involved in minor delinquency or are at risk of doing so and who have become alienated from the mainstream school system.  The pilot scheme under which special counsellor teacher posts have been allocated to assist certain schools in addressing particular difficulties with disruptive pupils is also relevant in this context.</P>
    <P>The strategy at second level includes curricular reform such as the junior certificate schools programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the applied leaving certificate programme. These are all designed to encourage an improvement in retention rates to completion of senior cycle of up to 90 per cent of the total cohort of second level pupils.  There is also a significant emphasis on second chance education and training through the provision of youthreach for unqualified early school leavers over the age of 15 years.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the legislative measures set out in the Children (Juvenile Justice) Bill, which is to go to Committee Stage shortly, will provide the framework for future service delivery in this area.  The Bill provides a range of preventative measures so that custody of young offenders would be a last resort.  However, in the case of children who are committed to the special schools by the court, the Bill specifically makes provision for temporary and short-term leave and placing out on licence whereby the children can be gradually reintegrated into society.</P>
    <P>The making of such orders under these provisions will be contingent upon there being a responsible person such as a parent or guardian willing to receive and take charge of the child. Clearly other agencies such as the Probation and Welfare Service and the health boards will have a significant role to play in these matters.</P>
    <P>The Children (Juvenile Justice) Bill will also provide for much closer co-operation between the statutory bodies with responsibilities for children in these circumstances.  It is well recognised that the provision of an effective after care service for the children in question requires a multiagency response.  This is reflected in the provisions of the Bill which call for improved liaison and co-operation between these agencies.  This requirement is designed to achieve a seamless continuum of care for children at risk and in conflict with the law.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured of the commitment of the Government to providing the resources, facilities and professional personnel to provide care for these unfortunate children.</P>

      <P>Under present arrangements, children enrolled in special schools may continue to attend until the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th birthday.  In exceptional circumstances, the Department will consider sanctioning the continued attendance of a child for a further year where the school authorities confirm that an additional year of schooling would be of particular benefit to the child in question.  Such requests are rare and each application is dealt with on an individual basis.  Usually, the young adult would have particular problems and may have missed a lot of schooling at an earlier age.</P>
      <P>The relevant school inspector is asked to discuss the case with the school authorities and to furnish a report and recommendation.  The inspector's report should state whether there are sound educational reasons for allowing the young adult to attend the school for a further year.  The Department provides funding to vocational training centres which cater for school leavers who have a moderate learning difficulty and those with a mild learning difficulty who are unsuited to open training centres.  The funding in question allows the vocational training centres to employ tutors for literacy and numeracy in respect of trainees between 19 and 25 years of age who may undertake training courses of up to three years duration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to the recognition of the role of parents as the first teachers of their children by ensuring their role at all levels of school management and by the introduction of the Parents As First Teachers Programme.</P>
      <P>The community mothers programme, operated in many areas of the regional health boards, is essentially the same in concept as the parents as first teachers.  Under the Community Mothers Programmes, mothers from the local communities are trained to offer advice and support on parenting skills and child care to first-time mothers and mothers in deprived areas, under the guidance of the public health nurse.  The Minister firmly supports the view that the approach to addressing issues in the education sector must be one of partnership involving all the key players, including parents, who are the primary and natural educators of their children.</P>
      <P>Parents already play a uniquely important role in the education system, at both national and individual school level through the national parents councils, primary and post-primary, parents participate as partners in education.  The councils represent parental interests in schools across the first and second level systems and the Department consults extensively with the councils on all aspects of educational policy.  At individual school level, parents are represented on school boards of management and through local parents' associations.</P>
      <P>It is his intention that the vitally important role played by parents should be recognised and given statutory underpinning in the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997.  The Bill makes a number of specific provisions to protect and promote parents' rights in the education system and to ensure their continued participation in their children's education. In particular, the Bill will establish the national parents councils on a statutory basis.  It will give parents the statutory right to establish parents' associations in schools and will underpin the right of parents to be party to negotiations in regard to the composition of boards of management of schools.  Parents will have a right of access to records relating to their children's educational progress and will have to be consulted when school plans are being drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> The Deputy will be aware that the Minister hosted a National Forum for Early Childhood Education earlier this year.

The importance of parental involvement in the area of early childhood education was one of the issues highlighted at the forum.</P>
    <P>It is his intention to bring forward a White Paper on early childhood education.  The views expressed at the forum will be taken into account in the preparation of the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, the third level colleges levied a standardised charge of £150 in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services.  This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for two academic years.  At that time, the then Minister stated that the level of the charge would be reviewed.' In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, the Minister accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year.  In line with the 4 per cent increase agreed for third level tuition fees for the 1998-99 academic year, he also accepted a similar increase in the level of this charge to £260. The level of the charge is subject to annual review.</P>
      <P>Students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distribution of the charge payable by students for registration, exams and student services, is a matter for the third level institution involved.  When the Minister accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge, <Col N="1312" /> he was concerned about that portion of the charge, which is intended to fund student services and in particular, the lack of transparent procedures. Accordingly, the Minister requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability. The Higher Education Authority issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions in January 1998.</P>
    <P>The framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution should provide information as to the allocation of the charge towards exams-registration and towards student services on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>As recommended by the working group, the Higher Education Authority is currently co-ordinating a review of the consultative and decision making procedures in place in the various third level institutions in relation to the disbursement of these funds.</P>

    <P>As Deputies will be aware, my Department is currently engaged in a very extensive programme of legislation with no less than six Bills at various stages of the legislative or preparatory process.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> One of my priorities regarding third level grants is to ensure that students receive their first maintenance payment as early as possible in the academic year.  With this in mind the Minister brought the recoupment arrangements for the local authorities to a current year basis in 1997, which improved the timeliness of payments to students during 1997-8.  I am confident that the local authorities will make every effort to make early payments to students again this year and I understand that most local authorities have already paid the first of the three instalments of the maintenance grants.  I further understand that all local authorities will have paid the first instalment of the maintenance grant to both new awardees and renewals by the end of October 1998.</P>
    <P>Grants in respect of the charge for student services, registration and examinations are payable under the maintenance grants schemes.  The local authorities and vocational education committees pay the grant directly to the colleges and students qualifying for grants do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I do not consider that any up-front payment of the maintenance grant, as suggested by Deputy Noonan, or a registration grant which would be deducted from the maintenance grant, as suggested by Deputy Stagg, are necessary.  On the contrary, such an approach to further segment the payment of maintenance grants would increase the administrative burden on the local authorities, vocational education committees and the colleges, without any benefit being derived by the students.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to continue to seek ways of improving support for third level students.  In relation to the current administration of the student support schemes, a joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs carried out an examination of various options and the possible role of that Department in any new system.  Towards the end of last year the Minister received the preliminary report of this working group and he is currently engaged in discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, regarding a more detailed review.  This review would involve the participation of interested parties.  He has previously indicated that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements without appropriate consultation with all interested parties.</P>

      <P>Each application was scored on criteria which reflected the core issues identified in the project specification and in the application form made available to all applicants.  The extent of the area based approach to the issue of educational disadvantage was an important consideration.  Regard was also had to the need to select projects in large urban centres, towns and rural areas so as to test a variety of models in these various settings.  Each application was assessed under the following headings: the children being targeted, the strategies currently in use, in-school and out-of-school, the measures proposed, in-school, out-of-school and regarding parental involvement, the extent of integrated actions proposed, the resources being applied for and the costings provided, the status of the proposal in terms of whether it involved a new initiative or an extension to an existing initiative, and the proposals for evaluating the proposed measures.  In addition, an important aspect was consideration in light of the area based partnership boards.</P>
      <P>Projects were selected up to the limit of available funding.  A total of 14 project areas were selected for inclusion in the present phase of the initiative.

His objective in holding the forum was to allow all groups with an interest in the area, including groups representing special needs children, to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the future development of services in this area.  The question of pre-school provision for special needs children received attention at the forum.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the lack of adequate up-to-date data on children with special educational needs.  My Department is currently considering possible measures to identify all the children in question, their locations and the range of special needs involved.  A number of children with special educational needs will require referral for individual assessment by a psychologist.  While there are some studies and estimates available on the nature and prevalence of children with such needs, there are no large scale data available in relation to some disability categories.</P>
      <P>I recently launched the report of the planning group for the national educational psychological service.  It is envisaged that implementation of this report, which I fully endorse, will commence in 1999.  One of the recommendations in the report is that the national educational psychological service will be readily available to all students but will give priority to those with special educational needs.  One of the first tasks of this new service will, therefore, be to liaise with all the agencies which provide psychological services to children in order to identify needs in the special education area and to collaborate in the development of comprehensive assessment services.</P>
      <P>I would be anxious that every effort be made to respond to requests from schools for assistance to cater for children with special needs.  However, unfortunately my capacity to respond in some situations is constrained by resource availability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I announced that I was increasing the number of places available on the higher diploma in education courses for the 1998-99 academic year from 800 to 940.  Of these additional places, 100 are specifically for teachers of Irish, religion, Italian, Spanish and key sciences. I am concerned with the decrease in the numbers taking physics and chemistry at leaving certificate level.  However, a number of measures already taken or planned should increase the uptake in the numbers opting for these subjects at leaving certificate level and help retain physics and chemistry graduates in teaching.  These measures include the IT 2000 initiative, the science programme in the new primary curriculum, the introduction of new syllabi in physics and chemistry from September 2000 and the general awareness initiatives under way to advise young people of the employment potential in science and technology related areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of points for leaving certificate subjects for entry to third level institutions is a matter for the institutions involved.  The CAO is a limited company set up by the third level institutions as an administrative mechanism for dealing with applications and admissions and the CAO operates a common points system.  I set up the Commission on the Points System in October 1997.  An Action Programme for the Millennium sets out as a key priority the appointment of a such a group to examine the points system.  I have set out in the terms of reference for the commission that it should review the present system of entry to third level institutions and make any recommendation that it considers appropriate. The commission has recently published its consultative <Col N="1319" /> document and aims to produce its final report in late spring/early summer 1999.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if his Department has an estimate of the cost of maintaining a student at third level college; the way in which this compares with the maintenance grant payable by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[20776/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has not carried out research into the cost of maintaining a student at a third level college.  The statutory framework for the scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education. For the 1998-99 academic year, the rates of the maintenance grants payable are set at £1,652, at the non-adjacent rate and £660, at the adjacent rate.  I am aware of some concern regarding the level of the grants however, I would point out improvements in this regard can only be considered in the light of overall resource constraints and other competing needs in the education sector.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be interested to note that some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.  In the 1996-97 academic year, almost 48,000 students received grants under these schemes.  The 1996 cost of the schemes was £91 million.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice in recent years to increase maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid February to mid February each year.  The inflation figure as provided by the Central Statistics Office for the period mid February 1997 to mid February 1998 was 1.7 per cent.  The value of the maintenance grant was therefore increased by 1.7 per cent for the 1998-9 academic year.</P>
      <P>It has also been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.  The figures are provided by the Central Statistics Office and are computed in each case to March of the previous year.  The average industrial wage increase for the period March 1996 to March 1997 was 3.2 per cent.  The reckonable income limits for the 1998-99 academic year were therefore increased by 3.2 per cent.  This increase was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.  The definition of eligible courses in this regard has also been extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to ongoing improvements in <Col N="1320" /> the third level student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits as resources permit. My priority in relation to the area of student support has been to honour the commitment given in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses.  I have honoured that commitment by way of introducing a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.  The scheme was issued to vocational education committees in August and it is anticipated that the first payment to students, which will be retrospective to September, will be made not later than January 1999.  The grants payable under this scheme will be at the same level as the third level maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, I have identified the creation of additional third level places as my priority at third level and to this end I have already increased by 8,000 the number of student places available at third level.</P>

This process avoids delays and increased costs later.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional resource teacher or child care assistant posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I have to determine priorities and allocate available resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>I recently allocated 26 resource teacher posts to national schools.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need.  However, my Department has no record of an application for a resource teacher post from the school in question.</P>
      <P>If the board of management of the school considers that the services of a resource teacher are required, it should make application to my Department giving details of all pupils assessed as having special needs.  Such an application, together with the request for a child care assistant, will be fully considered in the event of additional resources becoming available for allocation.</P>

      <P>A new course in Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE) was introduced in the junior cycle curriculum from September 1996.  The new course is part of the core curriculum from September 1997 in all second level schools.  CSPE will be examined at junior certificate level in 1999 and thereafter.</P>
      <P>In addition, the transition year programme and the leaving certificate applied programme offer extensive opportunities for further development in this area, with an increased emphasis on interactive and experimental learning, and a strong focus on the development of social competence and social and community awareness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within adult and second chance education provision, a key objective is the development of the core skills, confidence and competencies necessary for economic and social participation.  This is done through provision of a range of adult literacy and community education programmes, and second chance education programmes such as Youthreach and the vocational training opportunity scheme, as well as access to post-leaving <Col N="1322" /> certificate courses.  While such programmes provide a range of vocational options, these are featured as part of an holistic approach where personal development, communications skills and empowerment are essential aspects of the approach.  Within post leaving certificate courses, elective modules in social studies and political studies are available, and are nationally certified by the National Council for Vocational Awards.</P>
    <P>Third level institutions also offer a range of certificate, diploma and degree level programmes in social and political studies, in youth and community work, in adult and community education, and in public management.</P>

A further special class was established in St. Brigid's Special School, Dundalk, County Louth in the 1996-97 school year.  A total of 46 children are catered for under the pilot programme.</P>
    <P>In the current school year, a number of additional special classes catering specifically for children with autism have been established.  Each class caters for a maximum of six children and is supported by a class teacher and a child care assistant.  A special rate of capitation funding is also provided.  In addition, an outreach support service is provided by the relevant health authority.</P>
    <P>The establishment of additional classes in a number of locations is currently under active consideration in my Department.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider the proposal for an education task force in the north inner city of Dublin 1 in view of the fact it is an area with the lowest level of access to third level education and one of the highest drop out rates in second level education.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19933/98]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy I am fully committed to ensuring equality of access to our third level education system for all socioeconomic groups within the community.  It is generally acknowledged that the scale and concentration of disadvantage in certain areas of Dublin requires a strategic and targeted response.</P>
      <P>Professor Patrick Clancy's report &ldquo;Access to College: Patterns of Continuity and Change&rdquo;, examined patterns of participation in higher education in Ireland.  The report is based on a national survey of all those enrolled as new entrants to full time higher education in Autumn 1992.  In this, the third and latest such national survey undertaken by Professor Clancy, it is indicated that there were nine new entrants from Dublin 1 giving an admission rate of 4.8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the factors underlying this phenomenon go beyond the education system.  Nevertheless, my Department has a range of measures in place to further the promotion <Col N="1325" /> of equality of access to higher education. The need for a holistic approach to promote equality rather than policies focused only on the third-level sector and on the transition from second to third level, is well established.  In this regard, fuller participation in third level depends on measures to ensure access to and retention of students in full-time education at first and second levels.</P>
    <P>The measures in place include the development of early start centres; the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the Breaking the Cycle Initiative; the home school community liaison scheme, a new initiative focused on structured pilot projects in urban and rural disadvantaged areas which test models for the development of an integrated area based co-ordination of services to cater for young people aged 8-15 at risk of early school leaving; the development of second chance education and training options through Youthreach and VTOS.</P>
    <P>In the university sector the Higher Education Authority provided funding of £260,000 in 1996 and £475,000 in 1997 for initiatives in a number of universities specifically relating to disadvantaged students.  Funding will also be provided in 1998. These initiatives build on existing programmes and involve links with second-level schools and local communities.  These initiatives include supervised study facilities, extra tuition, information and advice to both pupils and parents and support teaching in subject areas.  For this reason it will take some time for the effect of the programmes to be reflected in the actual numbers going on to higher education.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to these programmes, one involving assistance to some students to meet the points requirement for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure.  The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for students entering by this method.  Support for the university proposals is very firmly based on the intention of meeting set targets and progress reports will be submitted to the Higher Education Authority on each of the programmes funded.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology has a comprehensive set of activities in which the Institute is interacting with different disadvantaged groups in Dublin city.  There are currently a number of courses in place for mature students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  In addition, the Dublin Institute of Technology authorities are developing arrangements for direct entry for second level students from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not meet the normal admission criteria.</P>
    <P>My Department has approved the appointment of a full-time community education links co-ordinator in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The role of the co-ordinator is to identify, develop and co-ordinate the various initiatives of Dublin Institute of Technology in regard to disadvantaged <Col N="1326" /> communities in inner-city Dublin in order to increase their awareness of and participation in education, particularly at third level.</P>
    <P>The community links programme comprises the following multi-faceted initiatives: (a) supervised study programmes: involving both disadvantaged primary and secondary school pupils and are organised by the staff and students of the Dublin Institute of Technology; (b) educational awareness programmes: involving the participation of staff and students of the Dublin Institute of Technology and disadvantaged schools in order to increase awareness of the benefits of education &mdash; second-third level &mdash; and to remove misconceived notions of third level; (c) computers-equipment: Dublin Institute of Technology has distributed redundant equipment such as computers, microscopes, audio visual equipment, to those disadvantaged groups and schools which are most in need; (d) studentships: the Dublin Institute of Technology awards studentships to financially disadvantaged pupils from inner city schools who attain a place in Dublin Institute of Technology, such students are also supported in regard to study-personal-academic problems that may arise; (e) Pathways Through Education project: Pathways Through Education is a European funded Youthstart initiative, managed jointly by the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Dublin Schools Business Partnership, the main aim of the project is to raise the self-esteem, confidence and motivation of first year pupils in three inner city disadvantaged secondary schools, the consultative group overseeing the management of the project is representative of a wide range of interests, social, economic and educational; and (f) community involvement: in 1996-97 the Dublin Institute of Technology staff developed and piloted a course in women's community development studies through the medium of art leading to a national certificate.  This course is offered annually.  In 1998-99 the Dublin Institute of Technology will provide a training course in basic engineering skills for young people from a disadvantaged area.  The main aim of the project is to re-engage young people in education, and in so doing, to develop their selfesteem and confidence.</P>

      <P>The pilot project on modern languages has commenced in approximately 270 primary schools.</P>
      <P>Seven project leaders have been appointed to assist and advise principals and teachers and to initiate a training programme for teachers.  To date the project leaders have held 25 meetings nationwide for all those involved in the project &mdash; chairpersons, principals, class teachers and language teachers.  These meetings are currently being followed up by individual school visits, a total of 126 of which have been held to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preliminary lists of resource materials have been issued to schools.  These lists include recommendations for multi-media materials.  Schools have been advised to purchase resource materials in accordance with this list.  Each participating school will be given a financial grant to assist in <Col N="1328" /> the purchase of materials for the project.  It is proposed to issue this grant to schools before the end of this school term.</P>
    <P>The project leaders are also in the process of producing of audio materials, which it is intended to give to teachers involved in the project.  These materials will be disseminated at in-career development courses which will take place in the course of this school term.</P>
    <P>My attention has not been drawn to any serious criticism of the adequacy of the planning for this project.  Indeed I have received many congratulatory letters on my initiative in introducing modem languages to the primary sector.  The Deputy will appreciate that this project has only recently commenced in schools and, as for any other new initiative, a certain adjustment period is inevitable as the project moves from the planning to the operational phase.</P>

The review is now almost complete and the revised curriculum will be presented to me for adoption early next month.

A comprehensive programme of in-career development for teachers will support the implementation over a five year period and will begin in 1999.  Training in science for primary schools will form an important part of this programme. My Department also sanctioned the appointment of additional staff to two colleges of education earlier this year in order to improve the provision in these colleges for training student teachers in primary science.</P>

      <P>A total of 138 teachers, consisting of 41 first level teachers and 97 second level teachers, have been granted early retirement under the provisions notified to schools in connection with the 1997-98 school year.  Decisions have yet to be made in the case of five applicants at first level and one at second level.  In the case of one of the <Col N="1329" /> first level applicants, who has applied for early retirement on the grounds that he is experiencing professional difficulties in carrying out his teaching duties, the position is that my Department has received further information from the management of the school and this information is now being considered by the early retirement advisory committee.</P>
      <P>A decision in the case of the remaining five applicants, who have applied for early retirement on the grounds that they are in schools which have posts which are surplus to requirements, is dependent on the outcome of procedures for the filling of vacancies and the redeployment of teachers who are surplus to requirements.

      <P>Since coming into office, I have been concerned at the large number of untrained personnel working within the primary school system. For these reasons, I have introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost substantially the supply of trained teachers.  Specifically, I have ensured there are over 1,000 places available in the colleges of education during the current academic year.  This includes 730 students who will pursue the three year B.Ed. degree programme while 280 degree holders will be admitted to an 18 month full-time postgraduate course.</P>
      <P>In addition, B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
      <P>I am also examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one year conversion course for degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education and who have either Irish as part of their degree or have Irish to grade C at the leaving certificate or its equivalent.  I have further decided that from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education will be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service provided that they have Irish to grade C at higher level leaving certificate standard or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dun Laoghaire which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, will, from 1 September 1998, be granted recognition as fully trained substitutes provided that they have Irish to grade C at higher level leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>Colleges of education provide opportunities for mature students to gain an appropriate teaching qualification.  In-service provision relates to persons who are fully qualified as teachers, and is not intended for those who are unqualified.</P>

      <P>The reasons for drop-out are complex. There is no simple explanation.  Factors such as motivation, capabilities and suitability are all involved.  There must also be a balance between completion rates on programmes and maintaining the necessary objective standards.  The challenge of maximising completion rates, consistent with maintaining appropriate standards is a matter, in the first instance, for individual universities, institutes of technology and the National Council for Educational Awards.  Information is not readily available on the numbers of students who fail to complete third level courses at the universities and institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>In relation to the university sector, the Higher Education Authority carried out a study in 1994 which indicated a completion rate of 81 per cent for those students entering in 1989-90.  This rate is a high completion rate by international standards. The authority has commissioned the Educational Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra to undertake a further detailed study in this area.</P>
      <P>In addition, in February 1998 the Commission on the Points System engaged a team of researchers to undertake a feasibility study of the predictive validity of the points system in relation to the intake of students into third level education in 1992.  Two inter-related pieces of research were undertaken.  The first part aimed to establish the feasibility of accessing material in the institutions and the second part aimed to undertake a study of sample students across the institutions.  The summary of the findings to date is contained in the Consultative Process &mdash; Background Document published by the Commission on the Points System.  The document indicates that 26 per cent of all students who entered college in 1992 had not been awarded any qualification from their college of entry by 1998; most had either left or failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been taken in the technological sector to assist the compilation of a database on attrition-drop-out rates and to develop appropriate strategies to address the <Col N="1333" /> issues as follows.  The council of directors of the institutes of technology has established a national committee on retention and a steering committee for an action research project on retention.  This national committee has set out a menu of initiatives for institutes of technology, particularly in relation to actions targeted at first year entrants in 1998.  Already a number of these actions have been implemented and it is hoped this will increase retention levels in the institutes.</P>
    <P>The action research project will undertake the following: quantify retention levels; carry out a qualitative study, which will include a survey of international literature on this topic, and inform the institutes as to the relative importance of the many factors which cause non-completion of courses; recommend to the institutes an action programme to deal with the findings.  Tenders have been invited by the council for the action research project and it is hoped that the project will begin early next month.</P>
    <P>A system has also been developed for a statistical monitoring of uncertified departures from certificate and diploma programmes and is being applied on a pilot basis in some institutes.</P>
    <P>Other studies, in both individual institutes and in groups of institutes, have also been carried out with a view to developing actions to minimise uncertified departures.</P>
    <P>A computerised management information systems project is being developed as part of the ongoing work to establish modern financial and administrative systems for the institutes of technology. The project has the aim of supporting the efficient and effective administration of the institutions and providing both the institutions and my Department with timely and accurate management information for a variety of purposes. This new system will provide enhanced information on completion and attrition rates and the results from the initiatives above will be fed into this project.</P>

      <P>National surveys of reading in primary schools were carried out in 1972, 1980, 1988, 1993 and 1998 by Department of Education and Science inspectors in co-operation with the Educational Research Centre with a view to monitoring levels of English reading attainment in primary schools on an ongoing basis.

    <P>Primary schools also participated in an international study of reading literacy in 1991.  The reading literacy performance of Irish nine year olds was assessed in the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, IEA, study of 1991.

      <P>The dates on which the results of the certificate examinations are issued are a function of the timing of the actual examinations and the time required for the marking of scripts and processing of the results.  While my Department will continue to make every effort to issue results as early as possible it must be recognised that there are real constraints on making any significant improvement in respect of the junior certificate if the issue date in the case of the leaving certificate is not to be affected.  Given that there is a finite pool of suitably qualified examiners my Department ensures the number of examiners engaged in the leaving certificate marking process is adequate to enable the result deadlines to be met.  This is possible because the later issue of junior certificate results provides some latitude in relation to providing additional time where necessary to the pool of examiners available for junior certificate marking.  Ultimately the time required for the proper execution of the marking process is a direct function of the number of available examiners and the number of scripts to be examined.  The Deputy will agree that priority must be given to the issue of the leaving certificate results.</P>

      <P>All second level schools are assigned to one of the psychologists employed by my Department. Nineteen psychologists are engaged in the post-primary sector.</P>
      <P>The service to primary schools is still in the development stage, although there has been considerable expansion over the past 12 months. There are now 27 psychologists working in the sector.  The psychological service is available to all primary schools designated as disadvantaged in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick; all primary schools in County Tipperary South Riding and between 15 and 30 schools in each of the following counties: Clare, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Offaly, Sligo, Tipperary North Riding and Wicklow.</P>
      <P>The psychologists try to provide a balance between individual casework, including assessment work, and general support and development work in schools.  They engage in casework as the resources of time and personnel allow.</P>
      <P>I am aware that all the needs for assessments may not be met.  It is my intention therefore that all schools should have ready access-to a psychological service through the establishment of a national educational psychological service which will be available to all primary and secondary schools as well as to preschool children.  Plans for this service are included in the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>In 1997, I set up a planning group to survey the current availability of psychological services to students in schools and to make recommendations to me on the developments that would be necessary in order to ensure effective provision in all areas.  The planning group included representatives of all the partners in education, including school management authorities and teachers' organisations.  It met frequently between October 1997 and June 1998.  All members of the group availed of the opportunity to provide evidence of needs as well as their views on the proposed new psychological service.  The planning group set up a technical working group to provide a detailed examination of the current availability of psychological services to children and young people and of the estimated needs for such services.  This group included representatives of the major clients, including teachers and parents.</P>
      <P>The report of the planning group has now been published.  I launched it publicly on 15 September and have now set up an implementation group in my Department to plan the phased expansion of the psychological service to all schools.</P>

The manual was compiled under the auspices of a steering committee which included three representatives from this Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>While I am aware of the ongoing demands for increased resources for primary schools, I very much regret that the INTO considered it necessary to engage in selective industrial action in a number of schools.  The Deputies will be aware that I consider that the action taken by the INTO was unjustifiable and impacted most adversely on the children in the schools concerned.</P>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.  I can assure the Deputies that, in the context of the 1999 Estimates, I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate ways to fulfil this commitment.</P>
      <P>Since coming to office last year, I have made a number of changes which have improved the funding and staffing situation in schools.  With regard to funding, the 1998 Estimates provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education over the 1997 budget allocation.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level represented an important step forward in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.</P>
      <P>I have implemented a broad range of measures to increase the supply of fully trained teachers, including significantly increasing the intake into the colleges of education.  This year alone, I ensured that over 1,000 places were available within the colleges of education.  I intend to maintain this high intake level over the next few years. In addition, I have decided that, from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education will be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service provided that they have Irish to grade C at higher level leaving certificate standard or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>I am determined to ensure that the demographic dividend arising over the next three years is retained in full in order that the pupil-teacher ratio may be still further reduced.  I am especially anxious to continue the process of diverting resources towards pupils with special needs.  In the current year I have allocated an additional 60 remedial teachers and 26 resource teachers to the primary system.  It is my intention to continue to develop these services.</P>
      <P>The recently launched early school leavers initiative, which is targeted on children in the eight to 15 years age group, involves an expenditure commitment of £3.62 million over the next two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> In the circumstances, the Deputies will agree that the introduction of the above measures is indicative of the high priority the Government attaches to primary education, and clearly demonstrates its intent to honour its commitments in relation to this sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 73 and 79 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teacher allocation to second level schools for a particular school year consists of the allocation warranted by the enrolment at the end of the preceding September together with approved <Col N="1340" /> ex-quota and concessionary posts.  School authorities may apply for an increase in the approved allocation to cater for particular circumstances, including projected enrolment increases.  This provision will continue to apply when the school leaving age is increased to 16.</P>
    <P>The standard pupil-teacher ratio at second level is 19:1.  When all pupils and teachers are taken into account, the actual pupil-teacher ratio at second level in the school year 1997-98 was of the order of 15.7:1.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 66 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides capitation grants towards the day-to-day running costs of primary schools.  School authorities are required to supplement the capitation grant with a local contribution, which traditionally amounted to 25 per cent of the State grant.  Since 1995 the local contribution has been frozen at £10 per pupil in the case of mainstream schools and at £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged. In effect, therefore, the required local contribution has already fallen well below the traditional 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.  I can assure the Deputies that, in the context of the 1999 estimates, I am currently examining a range of options, including the level of capitation rates to primary schools, with a view to identifying appropriate ways to fulfil this commitment.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment in this regard was clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates, which provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant represented an important step forward in the process of improving funding of the primary sector.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that I am aware of the concerns of the education partners on this matter and I will continue to give priority to the issue of further increases in the capitation grant to primary schools.</P>

These were used by the NCCA in drawing up a new curriculum in Irish which will be presented to me for adoption in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, when enacted, will empower me to establish executive agencies to carry out functions in respect of support services.  The definition of support services in the Bill specifically includes psychological services. When the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, is enacted I may then establish, by order, a national educational psychological service agency as proposed by the planning group I appointed to make recommendations for such a service.  The order establishing the agency will include such provisions as I consider appropriate to defining the functions of the agency as well as provisions relating to the finances and staffing of the agency.</P>
      <P>As recommended by the planning group I have established an implementation group of officials within my Department to prepare the detailed costings for the additional 131 psychologists, and the support staff, required over the recommended development period of five years beginning in 1999.  The provision of an estimate of cost was not part of the remit of the planning group.  The implementation group will also make the other preparatory arrangements for the establishment of the proposed agency and the initiation of its service.</P>
      <P>I consider that the psychologist staffing and other support resources, as recommended by the planning group, are realistic.  The group has provided a plan which includes clear purposes for an educational psychological service and which also includes a target for the development, within a reasonable period of time, of a service which can be more readily available to all students who need it.</P>

      <P>The overall target of the national anti-poverty strategy in relation to educational disadvantage is to reduce and eliminate early school leaving at second level and to eliminate literacy and numeracy problems in early primary education.</P>
      <P>My Department has a range of strategies in place to help prevent early school leaving.  These include the development of early start centres; the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas; the Breaking the Cycle initiative; the home school community liaison scheme; curricular reforms to allow students to make choices relevant to their abilities and aptitudes; support for junior and senior centres for travellers; the free book scheme, and alleviation of examination fees, for necessitous pupils.  Strategies in place are subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation.</P>
      <P>The primary curriculum is designed to achieve adequate levels of literacy and numeracy among all pupils.  Monitoring of progress towards this objective is achieved through national surveys of achievement and participation in international comparative studies.  The latest national survey of reading in primary schools was carried out in 1998 by my Department's inspectors in co-operation with the Educational Research Centre.  The findings of the 1998 survey are being processed at present.  In addition, Irish primary school pupils have participated in national and international assessments of mathematics performance.  As the Deputy will be aware, plans for the introduction of a revised primary curriculum are well advanced.  Assessment is an integral part of this process.</P>

      <P>Voluntary contributions by parents and others are permissible under the free education scheme.

      <P>Classroom teachers in primary and post-primary schools, in consultation with remedial teachers, have the lead responsibility for the identification and remediation of specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia.</P>
      <P>My Department has supported courses in remedial education for many years.  Since 1994, there has been a national programme of training for remedial teachers.  At present, post-graduate courses for teachers at primary and post-primary levels are held in six centres in universities and in colleges of education.  In the current academic year 99 primary teachers and 64 post-primary teachers are attending these courses.</P>
      <P>These courses in remedial education are supported and directly funded by the in-career development unit of my Department.  The syllabus includes training in the diagnosis and identification of reading difficulties and in appropriate techniques for remediation.  In particular, there is a focus on the problem of specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia, in relation to diagnosis and pedagogy.</P>
      <P>Many shorter courses for remedial and other interested teachers in specific learning difficulties have been supported financially by my Department. They have been mainly provided through the network of education centres, through teachers' organisations and through the programme of summer courses for primary teachers.</P>
      <P>Remedial teachers may need to consult educational psychologists in respect of certain pupils who display marked specific learning difficulties. My Department provides an educational psychological service at present to all post-primary schools and to more than 700 primary schools. The psychologists provide assessments and advice to teachers and parents in respect of students with specific learning difficulties as the resources of time and personnel allow.  My Department's psychologists are firmly committed to consultation with parents as an essential part of the assessment process.</P>
      <P>I intend to improve access to such support by the provision of a national educational psychological service, which will be readily available to all schools.  On 15 September of this year, I launched and endorsed the report of the planning group for this service.  I have now set up a small implementation group within my Department to produce detailed proposals for the development of the psychological service, beginning in 1999. As an interim measure, my Department will shortly be recruiting a further ten psychologists.</P>

    <P>Guidelines for teachers on addressing specific <Col N="1347" /> learning difficulty may be provided in the context of the training courses referred to.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 14 project areas have been selected for inclusion under the present phase of the initiative.  Funding amounting to £3.62 million is being made available to the initiative over the coming two years.</P>
      <P>The initiative includes a project strand, a research strand and an evaluation strand.  A management committee, comprising representatives of the Department and outside agencies, has been established to oversee the operation of the initiative. A projects co-ordinator was appointed on 1 August 1998 to support the selected projects and to co-ordinate the development of the programme. The objective of the pilot projects is to develop models of good practice with a view to their integration, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice.</P>
      <P>The operation of the pilot phase of the initiative will be kept under ongoing review.  The question of expanding the initiative will be considered in the light of experience with the models now being tested under the pilot phase.  I am sure the Deputy would agree it would defeat the purpose of the research to mainstream an initiative before its effectiveness has been proven.</P>

      <P>The definitions of different disabilities used by the Department of Education and Science are those described and recommended in the Report of the Special Education Review Committee, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland the term &ldquo;specific reading disability&rdquo; has been officially adopted in preference to the term &ldquo;dyslexia&rdquo;.  The definition of this condition derived from this report is that it is an impairment in reading, writing or spelling, the primary cause of which is not attributable to assessed ability being below the average range, defective sight or hearing, emotional factors, a physical condition or to any extrinsic adverse circumstances. <Col N="1349" /> Psychologists of my Department assess and diagnose and make recommendations in individual cases as referred to them in schools, but they do not gather statistical data on prevalence or incidence.</P>
    <P>Dyspraxia and attention deficit disorder are not conditions that were defined in the Report of the Special Education Review Committee.  These disabilities are generally diagnosed by medical specialists.  Where children are diagnosed with these conditions and where there are accompanying difficulties in learning requiring special education, such is provided where resources permit.</P>

      <P>The returns by schools to the post primary pupil database do not identify pupils form traveller families separately.  Consequently, the exact numbers of traveller children who complete the junior cycle and the senior cycle at second level are not available.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total number of traveller children attending post primary schools in the current school year is 650.  The estimated figure for the 1997-98 school year is 500.  It is estimated that 175 traveller children are enrolled in junior education centres this year.  The estimated figure for 1997-98 is 200.</P>
      <P>My Department has just put in place a pilot project called &ldquo;The 8 to 15 Year Old Early School Leavers Initiative&rdquo;.  This will run in 14 project areas until June 2000.  This project aims to develop effective strategies for preventing school drop out and for encouraging those who may have left school to return to education.  It also aims to develop an effective system for tracking pupils through the education system.</P>
      <P>When the project is completed, it is hoped to implement, on a nationwide basis, the strategies which will have been developed.  It is important to point out that, while these will be of benefit in achieving higher retention rates among traveller children, they will apply to the whole school-going population.</P>
      <P>My Department is a partner with Pavee Point in an Integra project which is working to design a strategy for data gathering, data analysis and decision making so as to facilitate access to education and training by travellers and to develop a suitable tracking system.</P>

      <P>It is planned that a major study will begin shortly in Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann to determine the amount of Irish acquired by leaving certificate students on leaving school.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any current research which attempts to compare or evaluate different methods of teaching Irish on a large scale, but this type of research is no longer common.  It is more usual nowadays for teachers to come together in smaller localised groups to conduct their own study of current practice and to experiment with new teaching methods and materials.</P>
      <P>For a number of years now, work has been going on in collaboration between the curriculum development unit of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann on teaching methods and materials for the foundation level courses at junior and leaving certificate.  New materials are produced and piloted in 15 Dublin schools.</P>
      <P>The Department is currently supporting a research project entitled &ldquo;Gaeilge ag obair/Irish works sa scoil&rdquo;.  This involves a selection of second level schools.  The aims of the project include the production of guidelines which school communities will find useful in helping to create an Irish-bilingual atmosphere.  The project will focus, <i>inter alia,</i> on the school plan, the transition year, extra-curricular activities and school communication, internal and external.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>My Department currently provides £1,035 million to fund the pilot early start pre-school programme. My Department also provides funding for pre-school services for travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government programme contains a commitment to provide a specific budget for pre-school education.  As a first step to meeting this commitment, I have announced my intention to publish a White Paper, which will set out Government <Col N="1351" /> policy with regard to early childhood education. The question of funding for the extension of pre-school services will be considered in this context.  The National Forum for Early Childhood Education, which I convened in March last, provided a focus for consultation with all of those with an interest in early childhood education.</P>
    <P>The report on the forum, which was prepared by the independent secretariat to the forum, was received in my Department over the summer period. The arrangements for printing the report were then made by my Department.  It is my intention to publish the report as soon as possible. However, I considered it inadvisable to publish it during the summer, when many of the persons and organisations with an interest in the matter would have been unavailable due to holidays.  Pressure of other commitments, including, most particularly, legislative commitments, since the summer break has meant that I have not had the opportunity to publish the report over that period.</P>
    <P>However, I assure the Deputy that I intend to publish the report at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>In pursuance of the provisions of Articles 42 and 44 of the Constitution, the State provides for free primary education for children in national schools.  The State discharges its obligation in this regard by recognising and funding privately-owned and publicly-owned schools. Many of these schools are operated by religious orders although, increasingly, schools may be of a multi-denominational nature.</P>
      <P>The State also recognises that parents are constitutionally entitled to provide their children's education in their homes or in private schools and I acknowledge a number of private schools have been established for this purpose.  However, such private schools are not recognised by the State and, consequently, do not receive funding from the State.</P>
      <P>My main responsibility as Minister for Education and Science is to ensure there are sufficient places available to cater for the needs of pupils at primary level.  I am satisfied the current provisions for recognition and funding of schools enables me to discharge this responsibility.</P>

      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed this week to the creation of a new single regulatory authority for financial services.  An implementation group is being established to process the work necessary to enable the Authority to be set up as soon as possible.  This group will be asked to report back by 28 February 1999.  Among the issues to be considered by the implementation group will be the responsibilities of the new Authority in connection with the relationships between financial undertakings and their customers.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department's responsibilities relate to the regulation of the insurance industry as well as to friendly societies and credit unions, company law and consumer protection.</P>
      <P>I intend to introduce shortly life assurance transparency regulations.  These regulations will provide, as of legal right, for understandable information on essential features or key areas connected with buying life assurance.  The prime objectives in the formulation of such a regime are an end to over-complication in presentation of products, enhanced competition, end to misselling/confusion, realistic investment projections, transparency on charges and expenses, knowledge of with whom the consumer is dealing and redress through a firm statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Companies Act, 1990, I have responsibility for supervising the training and ethical standards of the accountancy profession, and I have taken a number of initiatives in the recent past to enhance my oversight role.  These <Col N="1353" /> include requiring access for my Department to observe investigations by the accountancy bodies of disciplinary cases involving matters of public concern, more detailed annual reporting of their handling of disciplinary matters in general and the notification of company law breaches coming to their attention.  I welcome the fact that some accountancy bodies are now taking steps to make their disciplinary proceedings more transparent.  I should add for the Deputy's information that the Moriarty tribunal has been asked to make whatever broad recommendations it considers necessary or expedient for the effective regulation by professional accountancy bodies of their members' conduct.</P>

      <P>The company concerned is an Irish subsidiary of a British software services company.  It sells its products mainly in the Asian, African and the middle Eastern markets.  The company has decided to undertake some of its software development work in India.  No redundancies are envisaged in their Irish operations.</P>
      <P>Employment has increased in the software sector from 9,000 five years ago to about 20,000 this year.  Further significant growth is expected over the next five years.  The government has made significant commitments to facilitate this growth by providing substantial resources to increase the output of software graduates.  In particular, I refer the Deputy to the introduction of the £250M Education Technology Investment Fund and the establishment of the business education and training partnership.  I would also refer to the increased output of FÁS software and electronics courses.  This will more than treble the numbers completing training on these FÁS courses over a three year period.</P>
      <P>I am confident the result of the measures introduced will be to enhance Ireland's attraction as a location for further software activity.</P>

      <P>My Department's functions in relation to passenger vessels, under the Merchant Shipping Acts, are limited to the surveying, certification and licensing of any vessels that may be used or proposed to be used for the carriage of passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All passenger vessels used for operating ferry <Col N="1355" /> services between offshore islands and the main-land are statutorily required to hold either a Passenger Vessel Safety Certificate &mdash; vessels carrying more than 12 passengers &mdash; or a Passenger Boat Licence &mdash; vessels carrying 12 or fewer passengers &mdash; issued by my Department.  The primary function of this certification procedure is to ensure that the vessel is fit to operate, subject to any conditions that may be imposed upon it, and that the highest standards of safety are maintained.</P>
    <P>Under the Acts it is a matter for the operators of such vessels, in the first instance, to approach the Marine Survey Office of my Department seeking such survey, certification or licensing.</P>
    <P>My Department maintains a record of licensed vessels and makes that information available on request.  As part of my ongoing commitment to increasing safety awareness, my Department is preparing proposals for the upgrading of the publication of this information with a view to achieving its widest possible dissemination.</P>
    <P>The awarding of contracts in respect of ferry services to and from offshore islands is the responsibility of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  That Department makes funding available to secure ferry services to a number of islands and it is for that Department to satisfy itself on the social, economic and value for money aspects of any ferry operation it might decide to support.  I understand that all tender documentation in respect of such operations includes a requirement that services should be operated using a suitably certified passenger vessel which meets the appropriate classification requirements of the Department of Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    <P>My Department is available to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, at all times, to offer advice as to the suitability of any vessel operating, or which it is proposed to operate.  I cannot put a precise figure on the number of contacts, on the subject, made to my Department by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands during the past 12 months.  However, if the Deputy requires specific safety information in respect of any existing or proposed services, I will be glad to help him with his inquiries.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year an independent <Col N="1356" /> safety review of railway infrastructure, covering jointed track, signalling and telecommunications, was carried out for Iarnród Éireann by A.D. Little.  Following the submission of the consultants' report to my Department, I asked the CIE board to prepare a railway safety investment plan.  That plan includes a track renewal programme for the Westport-Ballina line.  It does not contain specific costings for the work proposed in relation to individual lines.</P>
      <P>In March I commissioned a strategic review of all aspects of railway safety to be carried out by consultants, International Risk Management Services (IRMS).  The review is nearing completion and will be published.</P>
      <P>I will consider Iarnród Éireann's railway safety investment plan in conjunction with the IRMS review and make appropriate recommendations to the Government at an early date.</P>

      <P>The package of measures on fodder I announced yesterday is geared to helping certain farmers in the areas worst affected by the prolonged wet weather this year.  The scheme is directed at sheep farmers with mountain grazings and suckler cow producers and small dairy farmers, with milk quotas of less than 35,000 gallons, in 753 district electoral divisions in the worst affected areas based on a survey carried out by Teagasc.  County Meath is not included.  I acknowledge that there will be individual farmers with fodder problems outside the 753 DEDs identified. I am satisfied that in general such farmers are located in areas where the supply of fodder within the broad geographical area is more balanced and reasonably accessible.  In the case of sheep, the scheme covers all registered mountain grazings as per the sheep headage scheme.</P>

      <P>With regard to childcare, in my budget speech last December I said:</P>
      <P>It is not possible to introduce all the new measures one would wish in a single budget.  I have examined carefully the possibility of a tax relief on childcare at the standard rate of tax but have decided not to proceed with it this year.  I will review the situation for my next budget in the light of the reports due next year from the working group on childcare set up under Partnership 2000 and from the Household Review Group and the Commission on the Family set up by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>In considering these matters in the context of the forthcoming budget, I intend to take into account the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Family, published in May of this year, and any findings that emerge from the other working groups mentioned above in the run-up to the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of women awaiting mammograms in the five major Dublin hospitals dealing with breast cancer, Mater, Beaumont, St. James's, St. Vincent's and the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children's Hospital, is approximately 1,700.</P>
      <P>The average waiting time for routine referrals, that is, those which are not considered to be medically urgent, varies between four and eight weeks.  Urgent appointments are normally seen within a few days of referral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Routine or asymptomatic cases are dealt with as soon as possible, but must be subject to careful prioritisation.  In view of the demands placed on <Col N="1363" /> mammography services, some hospitals may refer asymptomatic women to their general practitioner for a further assessment of priority. Hospitals review their caseload regularly, to ensure that women with an urgent cause for concern are seen without delay.  The criteria for urgent cases include the existence of a breast lump, previous family history of breast cancer or other high risk indicators.</P>
    <P>Where a woman is concerned at the length of time she has to wait for a mammography, she can ask her general practitioner to discuss her case with a consultant radiologist, who decides upon the priority of cases.</P>
    <P>I am committed to developing mammography services in line with the principles of the national cancer strategy.  In the Eastern Health Board area, the regional directors of cancer services are preparing proposals for the further development of services for the treatment of cancer, including breast cancer.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision of mammography services, work is continuing on the introduction of a formal breast screening programme aimed at detecting breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Phase one of the programme comprises the Eastern, Midland and North Eastern Health Board areas.  I am committed to starting the screening programme as soon as possible.  To this end I have approved funding to date of £2 million to cover the start-up costs and minor capital equipment needs of the programme.  In addition, I recently approved a capital allocation of £1.035 million towards the refurbishment of 36 Eccles Street, Mater Hospital, as a screening and assessment unit and also as headquarters of the programme, and a capital allocation of £897,750 towards the construction of screening unit facilities at St. Vincent's Hospital.  The existing breast clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital is due to be completely upgraded as part of Phase One of the £50 million general redevelopment programme approved for the hospital.</P>
    <P>A key determinant regarding the start-up date for the breast screening programme will be the recruitment of the relevant consultant and support staff, advertisements for which were recently placed in the national press.  Once the relevant staff are ready to take up their appointments we should be in a position to start the programme.</P>

      <P>The development of more explicit standards for performance measurement is a key element of the implementation of the health strategy in the ambulance service.  In this regard, funding has been provided to each health board in 1998 for the development of ambulance response times and quality of care monitoring.  The use of these resources is provided for in health board service plans which are monitored by my Department.  In addition, the National Ambulance Advisory Council, NAAC, which was established to provide my Department with specialist advice in this area is working closely with my Department and the health boards to support these developments. The NAAC has played a key role in the development of performance measurement in the ambulance service and is currently working to develop appropriate standards to underpin the developments currently taking place.  I remain committed to supporting these developments to ensure the pre-hospital care is provided in a manner consistent with the principles of equity, qualify of service and accountability.</P>

    <P>I understand that the average waiting time for these scans is between three and ten months, depending on the specialty.  The hospitals concerned do not routinely analyse patients by health board origin, as their position on the waiting list is determined on the basis of a clinical assessment of need. However, my Department has asked both hospitals if they could furnish the information in the required format and I will be in touch with the Deputy in due course.</P>
    <P>I should point out that my Department has put on record the necessity to monitor and evaluate overall MRI requirements in the public hospital service and to this end the need to develop MRI facilities at University College Hospital, Galway, St. James's Hospital and the new Tallaght Hospital has been identified.  All three hospitals have submitted applications to my Department for the development of MRI facilities.  A timescale of three years is envisaged for the programme of enhancement for MRI facilities at the three sites.  As soon as the MRI programme is completed on the basis of these recommendations the need for future MRI facilities will be examined.</P>

      <P>My Department provides financial support to environmental NG0s and local community groups for environmental awareness measures.  This funding, for the most part, is provided through my Department's environmental partnership fund which also commits local authorities to providing support.  The organisation in question has received funding under the environmental partnership fund in 1997 and 1998.  I propose to run the scheme again in 1999.</P>

      <P>The qualifying conditions for the carer's allowance differ from those applying to the invalidity pension.  One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of invalidity pension is that the pensioner must be permanently incapable of working. Accordingly, recipients of invalidity pension are not, in general, allowed to work.</P>
      <P>However, with the prior approval of the Department, invalidity pensioners are allowed to engage in occupational training or work of a rehabilitative or therapeutic nature.  There are no earnings or time limits applying to such training or work.  These measures are designed to encourage and facilitate invalidity pensioners who wish to try and re-enter the workforce.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners and certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention, and whose incomes fall below certain limits.</P>
      <P>In its Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit, and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms. In line with these commitments, an overall review of the carer's allowance has been completed and was published earlier this month.</P>
      <P>One of the proposals put forward in the review concerns the relaxation of the full-time care and attention requirements to allow carers to undertake ten hours part-time work per week having due regard to the care recipients' needs.  This would be a further extension of the relaxation of these rules earlier in 1998 which allowed carers to attend educational or training courses or participate in voluntary or community based activities, for around ten hours per week, provided that the carer makes adequate provision for the care recipient in his-her absence.</P>
      <P>This proposal, and the other proposals contained in the review, will be considered in a budgetary context in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The pilot initiative on tourism and the environment arose from the mid-term review of the operational programme for tourism, 1994-99.  The objective of the initiative is to promote and support tourism projects of a pilot or demonstration nature which will contribute to knowledge and understanding of best practice in terms of sustainable tourism and the environment. European Regional Development Fund funding of 3 MECU, approximately IR£2.4 million is available for the initiative under the normal commitment and expenditure deadlines which apply under the operational programme.</P>
      <P>A selection committee, chaired by an official of my Department, was established by the monitoring committee for the operational programme for the purpose of selecting projects for funding.  It held its first meeting on 25th March 1998.  An advertisement appeared in the three national daily newspapers on 2 and 3 April 1998 inviting applications under the initiative to be submitted to either Bord Fáilte or Shannon Development, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development carried out a joint preliminary assessment of the 119 applications received.  The selection committee, at its meeting on 1 September 1998, identified 20 applications considered most suitable for funding. given the criteria which applied.  These applications are now undergoing detailed assessment, following.  which they will be submitted to the appropriate management board for product development, Bord Fáilte or Shannon Development, for formal approval for funding.  These 20 projects, if approved and implemented, will absorb the entire European Regional Development Fund allocation available under the initiative. I announced details of the projects on 13 September 1998, and I will arrange for a copy of the press release to be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

The Fund, which I made a priority on coming into Government, provides for an investment of £250 million over the period 1998 to 2000, is a clear statement of this Government's seriousness in addressing key educational issues which impact on our economic performance, and represents the largest single capital investment programme ever introduced by a Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The fund, which will provide a total of £250 million of public sector investment over three years, has three main objectives: to review, extend and modernise the infrastructure of third level institutions, particularly in the technological sector; to develop new areas of activities where emerging skills needs have been identified and to invest in promoting innovation to maintain and further our economic growth.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the implementation of an increased range of projects under the Fund with maximum speed, I arranged that the first tranche of the fund provision, i.e. £100 million, be included in my Department's Estimates for this year.  This provision is in addition to my Department's normal capital estimates.</P>
      <P>Such a major increase in capital investment in the technological sector (among others) would of necessity require a review of decisions previously made in relation to the prioritisation of projects, and allocation of funds, in consultation with the institutes concerned.  Arising from this process, it has been possible to bring forward many projects that would otherwise have been deferred, and to increase the size and scope of other eligible projects.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy requires any information in relation to specific capital projects in the technological sector, I will, of course, make arrangements to provide it.</P>

      <P>The higher education grant schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.  These Acts define a mature student to mean a person &ldquo;of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on 1 January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions&rdquo;.  The Acts further provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the making of grants to mature students whose means and those of their parents, where the mature students are dependent on their parents, and the means of their spouses, if any, do not exceed prescribed limits.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents.  An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.  Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students other than mature students, the Acts specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit.  This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties that these provisions can give rise to in individual cases, such as those outlined by the Deputy.  I have asked my Department to keep this issue under review.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that, in the context of the 1999 Estimates, I am currently examining a range of options, including the level of capitation rates to <Col N="1379" /> primary schools, with a view to identifying appropriate ways to fulfil this commitment.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment in this regard was clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates, which provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant represented an important step forward in the process of improving funding of the primary sector.</P>

      <P>All post-primary schools in the country are assigned to one of the psychologists employed by my Department.  A total of 19 psychologists are currently engaged in the post-primary sector, giving an average of less than one psychologist per county.</P>
      <P>The service to primary schools is still in the development stage.  All schools designated as disadvantaged in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick and all schools in County Tipperary South Riding are assigned to one of my Department's psychologists.  During the past year, it has been possible to expand the psychological service to primary schools.  Between 20 and 30 schools in each of the following counties has been added to the list of those served: Clare, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Offaly, Sligo, Tipperary North Riding, Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the need for all schools to have ready access to a psychological service.  I intend therefore to establish a national educational psychological service which will be available to all primary and secondary schools as well as to pre-school <Col N="1381" /> children.  Plans for this service were included in the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The report of the planning group for this service has now been completed.  I launched it publicly on 15 September.  The report examined the current availability of psychological services to children and young people, and has made recommendations as to the developments which will be necessary in order to ensure effective provision in all areas.  I have now set up an implementation group in my Department to plan the phased expansion of the psychological service to all schools.</P>
    <P>In the past, the lead responsibility for providing a psychological service to primary schools rested with the health boards and with voluntary agencies under their aegis.  I am aware that psychologists employed by some of these bodies have withdrawn or have announced their intention to withdraw from providing psychological assessments for educational purposes.  This is in order that they may focus on children who need intensive therapy and family support.  There may, therefore, be temporary difficulties in areas where my Department does not as yet provide a psychological service.</P>
    <P>Children in schools need access to both clinical and educational psychological services, which will work in close collaboration with one another.  For this reason, the Department of Health and Children was represented on the planning group for the new national educational psychological service. Implementation of the report will proceed in close consultation with the health authorities in order to ensure an orderly transfer of responsibilities where this is felt to be necessary.  Meanwhile, the health board programme managers have been supplied with a list of those schools served by my Department's psychological service and there will be constant and close liaison at local level.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government An Action Programme for the Millennium provides a commitment to the introduction of equitable support for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.  I have honoured this commitment with the introduction of a maintenance grants scheme for students attending PLC courses in the current academic year.  The grants will be means tested and the rates of grant, income limits, and other criteria for eligibility will be similar to those, which apply to the third level student support schemes.</P>
      <P>The assessment of means under the third level student support schemes and the new PLC maintenance grants scheme is based on gross income with certain deductions for specified social welfare and health board payments.  Any proposal to move to a means assessment system based on net income would have significant financial implications in addition to equity issues which would have to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.  The figures are provided by the Central Statistics Office and are computed in each case to March of the previous year.  The average industrial wage increase for the period March 1996 to March 1997 was 3.2 per cent.  The reckonable income limits <Col N="1383" /> for the 1998-99 academic year were therefore increased by 3.2 per cent.  These increased reckonable incomes are being used for the PLC maintenance grants scheme.</P>
    <P>It has also been the practice in recent years to increase maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index for the period mid-February to mid-February each year.  The inflation figure as provided by the Central Statistics Office for the period mid-February 1997 to mid-February 1998 was 1.7 per cent.  The value of the maintenance grants was therefore increased by 1.7 per cent for the 1998-99 academic year.</P>
    <P>This increase was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.  The definition of eligible courses in this regard has also been extended to include those family members attending a recognised PLC course, student nurse training or student Garda training, those participating in certain CERT courses and those attending full time Teagasc courses in an agricultural college.  In such cases the reckonable income limits are increased by £2,060 where there are two such children, £4,120 where there are three, and so on by increments of £2,060.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits as resources permit.  The Deputy will appreciate that such improvements must have regard to overall resource constraints and competing demands in the education sector.</P>

      <P>The educational needs of primary pupils with specific learning disability are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.  Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.</P>
      <P>I recently allocated an additional 60 remedial teachers to primary schools.  The total number of remedial teachers in place at primary level now stands at 1,302.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools dedicated to the needs of such children.  Three of these schools are located in Dublin and one in <Col N="1384" /> Cork.  Special classes have also been established in a number of primary schools in areas where a need for such classes has been identified.  There are six such classes in place at present.</P>
    <P>The pupil-teacher ratio applicable in special schools and special classes catering for these children is 11:1.  Pupils attending these facilities also attract special capitation funding at a rate of £253 for children under 12 years and £413 for children of 12 years or over.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides an educational psychological service which is currently available to more than 700 primary schools.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been aware for some time of the pressure on space in the university and since coming into office I have taken significant action to alleviate the problem.  The recently opened applied business and languages building, O'Rahilly Building, has made a major contribution in improving the situation.  The new building adds approximately 10 per cent to the overall spatial resources of the University and constitutes a major increment in the available level of technology and research accommodation.  In total, the building provides an additional 500 computer stations, 650 seminar-tutorial places, 1,450 teaching-research places for students, 225 staff places and a services social area for 100 people.  In addition, as an initial measure, I have already allocated £5 million from the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund for an extension to the O'Rahilly Building which will provide a further 500 undergraduate places.  I have also directed my Department to allocate <Col N="1385" /> funds in the order of £2 million to be made available on an incremental basis to facilitate the development of the Good Shepherd Convent premises.  When completed, it will accommodate the Departments of Applied Social Sciences, Music and Adult and Continuing Education, thus further alleviating the pressure on space.</P>
    <P>At present the university rents space in properties, the majority of which are in close proximity to the main campus or the University facilities at the Lee Maltings and North Mall.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to give the alleviation of space problems at UCC a high priority.</P>

      <P>My Department has made inquiries with the Higher Education Authority in relation to the matters raised by the Deputy and I understand that National University of Ireland, Cork has an extensive schools liaison programme involving open days for students and career guidance teachers.  I further understand that the university has not cancelled its open day and will be convening such an event at a convenient time in the current academic year and that the Higher Education Authority is not aware of any difficulties associated with its innovative scheme of pairing new students with members of the teaching staff.</P>

      <P>The disadvantaged fund, which was established in 1994, comprises two elements, namely, the hardship fund and the special fund for students with disabilities.  The objective of the hardship fund is to assist, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, students who might otherwise, because of financial reasons, suffer severe hardship or be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administration of this fund is devolved to the third level institutions.  The allocation to the university sector is made through the Higher Education Authority and to the institutes of technology and the teacher training colleges directly <Col N="1386" /> from my Department.  The allocations are based on total undergraduate enrolments in the previous academic year.  College authorities are urged to supplement the fund from their own resources or from private sources.</P>
    <P>The third level colleges have been advised to nominate one individual to administer the fund and final decisions should be taken by a small group appointed by the college authority.  My Department does not recommend a specific allocation per student.  However, I have asked my officials to request information on the issue and to examine if the objectives of the fund are being met.</P>

      <P>Final enrolment figures for primary and second level schools for the current school year have not as yet been compiled.  The primary pupil-teacher ratio is computed at national level rather than at regional or county level.  Accordingly, it is not possible to provide details of the pupil-teacher ratio which pertains to any specific location.</P>
      <P>The national pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in the 1997-98 school year was 21.7:1. While the pupil teacher ratio has declined significantly in recent years at primary level, the Government is committed to improving the ratio still further. The average pupil teacher ratio in second level schools in County Kildare in the 1997-98 school year was 16.6:1. This takes account of the total teacher allocation to schools including, where relevant, ex-quota and concessionary posts based on the individual needs of the schools.  The question of reducing the ratio in second level schools must be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>All post-primary schools in County Kildare are assigned to one of the psychologists employed by my Department.  The service to primary schools has, during the past year, been expanded to a number of primary schools in the county.  In north Kildare, the six primary schools in Leixlip now have access to the psychological service.</P>
      <P>The psychologists visit schools on a regular basis and consult with principals and other staff about the needs for psychological support, including assessments.  Together they establish priorities for the work of the psychologists in the schools. The psychologists do not keep formal waiting lists, but over the past year all those children referred to them for assessment by the schools in north Kildare have been seen or are about to be seen by one of the psychologists.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the number of referrals made may not necessarily reflect the number of students requiring psychological support.  During 1997, I established a planning group to advise me on the setting up of a national educational psychological service.  The planning group, assisted by a technical working group, made a detailed estimate of the number of appropriate referrals for psychological support that might generally be expected in any area.  The estimate was that over a period of time 11.2 per cent of the school population might require such support.</P>
      <P>The report of the planning group for the service has now been published.  I launched it publicly on 15 September.  The report examined the current availability of psychological services to children and young people and has made recommendations as to the developments that will be necessary in order to ensure effective provision in all areas.  I have now set up an implementation group in my Department to plan the phased expansion of the psychological service to all schools so that the estimated level of need may be met.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184, 185, 187 and 188 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to requests for resource teacher posts is not readily available in my Department.</P>
      <P>In March of this year, all primary schools seeking a remedial service or an increase in an existing service were invited to make fresh application to my Department.  The purpose of this exercise was to obtain an up-to-date measure of the level of demand for the service nationwide.</P>
      <P>Schools were advised that this invitation would supersede all previous applications for remedial services submitted to the Department.</P>
      <P>Arising from this exercise, 27 applications relate to schools in County Kildare.  It should be noted that these applications include a significant number from schools seeking improvement in an existing service.  It is also the case that some schools are mentioned in more than one application.</P>
      <P>I recently allocated 60 additional remedial teacher posts and 26 resource teacher posts to the primary sector.  One of the remedial posts and two of the resource posts were allocated to schools in County Kildare.  There are now 1,302 remedial teachers and 104 resource teachers in the primary system.  Of the 93 primary schools in County Kildare, 82 schools currently have a remedial service.  There are five resource teacher posts serving 18 schools in County Kildare.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial and resource teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of schools in County Kildare will be fully considered in the event of additional posts becoming available for allocation.</P>

      <P>All second level schools in the country are assigned to one of the psychologists employed by my Department.  Nineteen psychologists are currently engaged in the post-primary sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The service to primary schools is still in the development stage.  All schools designated as disadvantaged <Col N="1390" /> in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick and all schools in County Tipperary South Riding are assigned to one of my Department's psychologists.  During the past year, it has been possible to expand the psychological service to primary schools.  There are now 27 psychologists working in the primary sector.  Between 20 and 30 schools in each of the following counties has been added to the list of those served: Clare, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Offaly, Sligo, Tipperary North Riding and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>The psychologists try to provide a balance between individual casework, including assessment work, and general support and development work in schools.  They engage in casework as the resources of time and personnel allow.</P>
    <P>I am aware that all the needs for assessments may not be met at present.  It is my intention that all schools should have ready access to a psychological service through the establishment of a national educational psychological service which will be available to all primary and secondary schools as well as to pre-school children.  Plans for this service are included in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The report of the planning group for this service has now been completed.  I launched it publicly on 15 September.  The planning group set up a technical working group to provide a detailed examination of the current availability of psychological services to children and young people and of the estimated needs for such services.  The report of the planning group includes recommendations as to the developments that will be necessary in order to ensure effective provision in all areas.  I have now set up an implementation group in my Department to plan the phased expansion of the psychological service to all schools.</P>

      <P>The way in which resources are provided to second level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges, community and comprehensive schools and voluntary secondary schools.  Consequently, direct comparison between the different sectors is difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant which also covers the VEC overheads and other activities apart from the second level <Col N="1391" /> programme.  Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis based upon enrolments while the annual budget for community and comprehensive schools takes into account factors which vary from school to school.</P>
    <P>Current provision for caretaking and secretarial services in schools derive from commitments made under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and is consistent with the manner in which financial allocations are made to each type of school.</P>
    <P>In general, all schools with enrolments of 200 or more are entitled to assistance under the programme. The position in relation to each sector is as follows.</P>
    <P>The allocation of caretaking and secretarial posts in vocational education sector is made on a scheme wide basis.  It is a matter for each vocational education committee to deploy the staff as it sees fit.  However, most schools in this sector have the services of a full-time caretaker and a secretary.  Community and comprehensive schools have a full-time secretary and caretaker and schools with an enrolment in excess of 500 pupils have two full-time secretaries.  Secondary schools with enrolments of 200 or more are in receipt of additional <i>per capita</i> grants towards the provision of caretaking and secretarial services, subject to maximum of £8,750 for caretaking and £10,500 in the case of secretarial services.  The manner in which these services are provided is a matter for individual schools.</P>
    <P>I recognise there are anomalies and inconsistencies between the different sectors.  The matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second-level is currently being examined by a steering group on funding.  Under its terms of reference, the group will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second level sector while taking account of the needs of these different schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 191 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress (PESP), a scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides <Col N="1392" /> additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of caretaking and clerical services.</P>
    <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil (£15 per pupil in respect of each service), to a maximum of £15,000 per annum, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant.  The scheme by its nature is flexible and gives boards of management full discretion as to the level and extent of the services to which the grants are to be applied.</P>
    <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of such services has been expanded in line with under-takings given in the PESP.  The priority has been to extend the scheme in the first instance to schools which have no caretaking or clerical provision already.  In this regard the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services and the position of schools which are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the scheme will be examined in the context of any improvements to the scheme which may be implemented in the future.</P>
