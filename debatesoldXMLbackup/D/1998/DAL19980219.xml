      <P>It is proposed to take No. 22, Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Bill, 1997, Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 23, Referendum Bill, 1998, Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 24, Central Bank Bill, 1997, Second Stage, resumed.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Report and Final Stages of No. 22 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  Report and Final Stages of No. 23 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach clarify the Government's position with regard to the investi <Col N="858" /> gation into abuses in the swimming world, given newspaper reports that many of the victims will not co-operate with the investigation?  Will he also clarify the position regarding the exchange of letters that seems to have caused great difficulty to many of the victims?  It is important that we know the procedure that will be adopted if the existing investigation collapses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the confusion and the stated intention of some victims of sexual abuse in swimming not to co-operate with the nonstatutory inquiry proposed by the Government, will the Taoiseach consider holding an inquiry under the relevant statute to ensure full co-operation and compellability and that all relevant papers will be available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify the issue.  Last week I discussed this matter with Mr. Coleman and one of the victims and they asked me if the Government would consider certain issues to see if they could co-operate with the private investigation.  They subsequently said that they wished to have six questions considered. I told them to continue their negotiations with the Attorney General.  They sent a letter to the Attorney General which was discussed in detail at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday last.  Mr. Coleman asked that a reply be issued by 5.30 p.m. yesterday.  I do not like people forcing the Government to reply to letters by a certain time &mdash; it does its best to reply speedily.  Since other events arose yesterday, it was 6.30 p.m. when the reply was issued.  I apologise to Mr. Coleman and others for the one hour delay.  I hope everybody will co-operate with this investigation.  The Government is determined to assist fully in dealing with these issues.  We want to be as helpful as possible to the victims and to ensure justice is done in this case.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Howlin's question, Mr. Coleman made it clear he was not interested in an investigation by a Dáil committee, where there would be compellability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my question.  I asked about a statutory inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party leader suggested last week that the matter could be dealt with by a Dáil committee, but Mr. Coleman was not interested in that.  Four of the issues were fully cleared yesterday and one or two issues will be fully cleared today.  That does not seem an unreasonable time for the Government to deal with the matter.  I hope a one hour delay will not force people away from what seems to be a reasonable system of dealing with these issues.  As reported in this morning's newspapers, I said that if at the end of the day these matters are not dealt with satisfactorily the Government will have to reflect on that.  This is an entirely reasonable and sympathetic way of dealing with a number of the <Col N="859" /> victims of sexual abuse in swimming and the Government intends to proceed along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise we must consider the letter and the time of its arrival but it is not helpful for the Taoiseach to enter into a dispute with the solicitor representing the victims in this case.  Our main interest is to ensure the victims' stories are heard and that they feel confident in any inquiry established.  Can the Taoiseach clarify exactly what other measures he will consider if agreement is not reached on the existing inquiry?  Will he consider setting up a statutory judicial inquiry if he finds he cannot secure agreement on the two outstanding issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to enter into any arguments but the Deputy asked me about newspaper reports published this morning.  The only news in those reports is that a reply to the letter had not been received.  I explained to the Deputy that, because of other events occurring yesterday, the Office of the Attorney General and other officials had other matters with which to deal and were an hour late responding to the letter.  I apologise for that and hope it did not upset people too much.  I do not think it should have.</P>
      <P>The Government is concerned with dealing with the victims of sexual abuse in swimming. That is why the Minister said, in the first instance, that he would do all he could to be helpful by setting up the private inquiry.  The Government merely wants to assist the victims.  The Government is not directly involved in the issue but has sought to be of assistance in appointing Mr. Roderick Murphy, Senior Counsel, who has some knowledge of these matters and others who were prepared with reasonable legal costs, to try to uncover the events which occurred and to satisfactorily and adequately deal with them.  These were horrific events and there is obviously a great deal of hurt and bitterness surrounding them. Matters must be resolved and the Government wishes to do everything it can to assist.  I urge those involved to assist Mr. Roderick Murphy to the fullest extent.  I hope he will able to deal with these matters and we will not have to proceed any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, like everyone else in this House, has put the vulnerability and hurt of the victims in this case to the fore.  That being the case, surely their concerns must be heard.  It seems clear now that whatever the merits of the private inquiry suggested by the Government last week, it will not get at the full truth or receive the full co-operation of the people involved.  The Government should not prolong people's agony and create a public dispute between the Government and people who have been grievously hurt. Will the Government move to resolve the problem within a matter of hours and decide that if people will not co-operate with the private inquiry, which appears to be a non-starter, it will <Col N="860" /> institute a proper judicial inquiry and ensure this matter is resolved speedily so that the truth can be discovered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach presumably accepts that the Minister's proposal looks like it will run into the sand.  The extended discussions on this matter and the delays involved are causing great distress to the families concerned.  The Taoiseach says the Government is willing to do everything possible to be of assistance.  Does he consider it would be appropriate to examine new legislation?  That could be done relatively speedily and could create a framework which would be acceptable, fair and sensitive to the needs of the families as well as being capable of reaching the truth which is something the Government seems unable to present as an option to these families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept for one minute that any of the initiatives taken by the Government are running into the sand.  The Murphy private inquiry will proceed and many victims and their legal teams are co-operating with it.  In recent days, more victims have pledged their co-operation. I urge Mr. Coleman and the people he represents to co-operate too.  Mr. Coleman should carefully consider the six questions he asked the Government and the Attorney General to consider.  As I said last week in reply to a question from Deputy McManus, the Government must reflect on these issues given the number of child sexual abuse cases which have surfaced and are pending.  However, in relation to this issue, the Government is trying to provide a mechanism, through the appointment of Mr. Roderick Murphy, for something with which it is not even directly involved.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank the victims, their families, the legal teams and other representatives who are fully co-operating with Mr. Murphy and recognise the benefit of what he is doing.  I hope Mr. Coleman will see that benefit today also.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach and the Government for agreeing to hold a debate next week on the threatened war against Iraq.  I also welcome the new wording for the Amsterdam Treaty ratification.  The consultation which has taken place has clearly resulted in an improved wording.  In that context, when does the Taoiseach expect the Bill to be brought before the House and when does he expect the referendum to take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his remarks and I thank the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and Democratic Left for their co-operation in this matter.  I appreciate the time people took and I believe we have achieved a wording about which we can feel confident.  I <Col N="861" /> thank the party leaders and spokespersons who engaged in discussions on the matter.</P>
      <P>The timing of the introduction of the Bill is a matter for the Whips but it will have to have passed through the House at least 30 days before the date of the referendum.  During the discussions on the wording, a number of people stated that May might be an appropriate time to hold a referendum.  That is likely although the Government has not yet made a final decision. With Easter falling in the middle of April, the House will adjourn for the usual fortnight and that would give us all an opportunity to participate in a campaign for a May referendum.  That seems to be the view of most parties.  I understand, from the Whip, that with the agreement of the other Whips, we could take the Bill in the House the week after next.</P>

      <P>When is it proposed to publish the School Attendance (Amendment) Bill in light of a report in an evening newspaper yesterday that 16 people under the age of 16 years are sleeping rough in Dublin?</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that yesterday he stated that all colleges would be closed for the by-elections to be held on Wednesday, 11 March.  In fact, only one college will be closed.  The decision to hold the by-elections on a Wednesday was an incorrect one and was taken merely because Ministers would not be available for weekend voting.</P>

The latter refer to the right to dispose of, remove or delete whereas the effect of amendment No. 13 is to insert.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 4 are related.  Amendment No. 1 deals with the capacity to remove.  Amendment No. 4 is perhaps more explicit because it uses the term &ldquo;and dispose of&rdquo;.  Given the Minister's philosophy on waterways, I am not imputing any malign intentions to her.  The text should ensure the Minister of the day will operate tightly.  Deleting an inland waterway or amending an entry in respect of an inland waterway is almost as important and perhaps requires more consideration than the base legislation.  It is not peripheral to the legislation and is not a housekeeping exercise, the principle having been established.  It is fundamental, which is why I wish to press amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 is related and contains the additional language of &ldquo;and dispose of&rdquo;.  This does not only cover a waterway which falls into disuse but also its transfer to another form of ownership or use.  If aspects of property are redundant to the immediate needs and work programme of an authority, it can be handled separately from this legislation.  If one can include dance in an amendment to the Arts Acts, surely one can deal with housekeeping matters such as this when the Inland Waterways Authority legislation is introduced.</P>

      <P>We discussed this at length on Committee Stage where I indicated I could not accept amendment No. 1.  The purpose of the amendment is to enable me as Minister to delete an inland waterway from, or add an inland waterway to, the Schedule or amend an entry in respect of an inland waterway.  This is an enabling provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that I have the necessary powers to enable me to carry out my functions.  It is essential that future possibilities which require this flexibility are not frustrated by lack of ministerial powers.  I gave the example of the Ulster Canal on Committee Stage.  A feasibility study on its restoration is being undertaken at present.  If this study proves we can go ahead with proposals for restoration, the canal should be part of the Schedule.</P>
    <P>On the deletion provision in amendment No. 1, section 2 (2) provides that any order made pursuant to section 2(1) must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House.  That is a check and balance provision which Deputies want to see as the Oireachtas can or cannot approve any such intention of a Minister.</P>
    <P>There was some confusion about deletion and disposal.  Disposal is covered in amendment No. 4.  It is not, and has never been, my intention to look at this as an opportunity to sell off inland waterways, about which Deputies expressed their concern.  This is an enabling provision for flexibility. If we go ahead with the development of the Ulster Canal, the acquisition of alternative land will not be the only issue as the original abandoned stretch of waterway may have to be disposed of.  Flexibility is needed for such practicalities which is why disposal is referred to in amendment No. 4.  I know Deputy Michael Higgins accepts my bona fides in this regard.</P>
    <P>The powers to acquire and dispose of land under the Canals Act, 1986, and the State Property Act, 1954, are reflected in this Bill.  Those Acts give me the power to dispose of land vested in me as Minister.  I am advised by the Attorney General that the provisions of section 5 are entirely consistent with the provisions of the State Property Act, 1954.  This Bill does not deviate from the usual powers of a Minister. The intention is to ensure there is flexibility in a day-to-day working situation where these issues may arise.  It is not a question of looking for an opportunity to dispose of land, which some Deputies may fear.</P>
    <P>It is also important to point out that I am not looking for powers that are not already given to other Ministers.  There is consistency where acquisition and disposal of land is within a Minister's remit.  I am advised by the Attorney General that it would be unwise to take any action other than that proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of these two amendments is one of principle, on which this House must decide.  The principle at issue is whether this House will give the Minister, future Ministers or any Government, the power to sell any of our inland waterways.  Amendment No. 4 to section 5 deals with the sale of inland waterways.  Amendment No. 1 to section 2 deals with the provision which enables the Minister to strike off the list of waterways which are in her care and ownership any waterway which is sold off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> Section 5, to which amendment No. 4 refers, gives the Minister the power to dispose of an inland waterway.  This cannot be interpreted in any way other than the sale of an inland waterway and its alienation from the ownership of the State and the Minister.  Section 2, to which amendment No. 1 refers, gives the Minister power to delete an inland waterway from the list of inland waterways which are in her care and ownership.  The amendments tabled by Deputy Higgins and me would prevent that happening.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, and again today, the Minister put forward a case to support the provisions in the Bill.  She argued that it is necessary to give the Minister flexibility in circumstances where works to a waterway, where a channel is being diverted or a portion of a waterway has become redundant.  I have no difficulty with that and we suggested on Committee Stage that she should table an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.  I am sure the resources and personnel available to the Minister are capable of drafting an amendment which would circumscribe the circumstances in which such a power would be exercised.  I would have no difficulty with such an amendment.  Neither have I any difficulty with the Minister's intentions.  I accept it is not her intention to sell an inland waterway and that she wishes to use this power in the circumstances she described.</P>
    <P>However, we do not legislate for the Minister's good intentions or for the flexibility she described.  We are laying down the law of the land.  Ministers derive their powers from both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We make the laws and pass the legislation.  The law we are being asked to pass today will give the Minister the power to sell one of our inland waterways.  I accept that is not the Minister's intention, but that is what the Bill states.  We are being asked to give the Minister the power to sell one of our inland waterways and have it stroked off the list of waterways listed in the Schedule as in the ownership and care of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The House should not give the Minister that power.  I am sure the people we represent believe our waterways should belong to the people and that they should remain in the ownership and care of the State for the benefit of the public.  The people do not want this House to give any Minister the power to sell one of our inland waterways. In effect, we are being asked to give the Minister the power to sell a section of the Royal or Grand canals or the Shannon navigation system. It is not far fetched to imagine a position where a person might perceive some gain in acquiring one of the people's waterways and seek to do so.  This provision would give the Minister the power to sell that waterway.  She claims there is a safeguard whereby the House could vote down such a proposal by way of a motion annulling the order.  That is one of those theoretical powers the House has been rarely able to exercise because the Government has the majority to <Col N="868" /> defeat such a motion.  There are only limited opportunities, such as Private Members' time, to introduce such a motion.  We know from experience this provision is rarely used.  If the Government is determined to sell off a waterway it would have the power to vote down such a motion.  I wonder if the Independent Deputies, on whom the Government relies, are aware they are being asked to go through the lobbies today to vote for a provision that will allow the Government sell our inland waterways.  That is what they will do shortly if the Minister does not accept the amendment to delete this provision from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the questions posed by Deputies Higgins and Gilmore, the Minister should clarify this matter.  While I accept it is not her wish to dispose of inland waterways, I remind her of an incident that occurred in the House recently when the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources was dealing with the question of fishing rights on the Robe River where there are at least 12 different licensed sections.  He stopped the sale of those fishing rights.  The public has deep rooted feelings about the ownership of land and waterways and the people around the great lakes of the west displayed deep rooted feelings during the rod licence dispute some years ago.</P>
      <P>It may not be the Minister's intention to sell our waterways or no other person may intend to put a case to her to dispose of an inland waterway. However, that does not mean such a case would not be put to a Minister in the future.  Arising from the Deputies' valid questions, the Minister must clarify the consequences of such a proposal. Too often matters are decided before the public become aware of them.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives the Minister the power to acquire, create, hold, maintain and dispose of land, including an inland waterway.  A simplistic reading of this could mean the Minister has the authority of the House to sell a canal or waterway. The Minister should clarify the matters raised by Deputies Gilmore and Higgins.</P>

      <P>Amendments No. 1 and 4 are being taken together.  Perhaps that is why there is some confusion about the difference between &ldquo;deletion&rdquo; and &ldquo;disposal&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 1 refers to &ldquo;deleting an inland waterway&rdquo;.  In that regard any order made pursuant to subsection (1) must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House.  I am sure most, if not all, Members would welcome that safeguard.  As elected public representations, Members make legislation and are its watchdogs.  The term &ldquo;deletion&rdquo; is the way to proceed.  Amendment No. 4 refers to disposal.  I reiterate that the power in regard to disposal provided for in the Bill is not new.  It is already the law of the land.  The Canals Act, l986, and the State Property Act, l954, give the Minister the power to acquire and dispose of land.  This is not a new provision.  This Bill is attempting to be consistent <Col N="869" /> with the other Bills which come under this Minister's preserve in terms of the Department.</P>
      <P>I raised with the Attorney General, through my officials, the concerns of Deputies Gilmore and Higgins with reference to disposal.  I have been informed that every Minister, including the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, has the power to acquire and dispose of land.  Those powers are consistent with every Minister and consistent with the Canals Act, l986, and the State Property Act, l954, both of which refer to the acquisition and disposal of land.  It is disingenuous of Deputies to suggest this is a change and an attempt to acquire powers that already exist for each and every other Minister or which do not exist in other Acts which reflect the views, concerns and remit of this Ministry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's position and ours are diametrically opposed on this issue.  The purpose of the Bill is to give the Minister certain powers over our inland waterways.  One of the powers for consideration is the power to sell.  The issue that has to be decided is whether the Minister should have that power.  If anything the Minister's clarification makes the position worse.  She has rightly clarified that the annulling position applies only to the deletion of the list.  There is no annulling provision in the Bill.  We have no second opportunity, no matter how limited, to review a decision to dispose.</P>

      <P>The position is that a Minister could at some time take a section of one of our canals or of the Shannon and sell it.  Apart from a question being asked in the Dáil about it there is no accountability.  There is no provision whereby a Member could propose an annulling measure for it.  Deputy Kenny is correct in that there was an attempt to sell off fishing rights.  He is also correct in saying it is an area about which people are passionate.  People are passionate about our waterways.  They view our waterways as something that belongs to all our people and they should remain that way.  It is my view &mdash; and I believe it is the view of the public &mdash; that no Government and no Minister should have the power that this Bill is giving this Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make an unlimited speech but I would like to address some of the points made.  If one wanted to simply convey the powers of the State Property Act, l954, and the Canals Act, l986, the Bill would have conferred on the Minister such powers as were enjoyed under those two Acts.  The Minister is well aware that route was not chosen.  This Bill is fresh text.  Therefore one can resonate back and say these are powers which are contained generically in the first two Acts.  If one was to place that limit on oneself why was it not done in the Bill? The idea of making an order and <i>ex post facto</i> requiring an initiative to annul it has a clear parallel.</P>
      <P>When an order made under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act was renewed Deputies and Senators had the opportunity to initiate an annulling motion to cancel it.  There was a habit of renewing the order before the festive season and in any event I was pleased to bring it to an end.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister of the day to stand at arm's length from an inland waterways authority and that inland waterways authority should have full autonomy in relation to the management of its resources, including the use of property. However that is not being proposed.  Amendment No. 1 seeks to delete the words: &ldquo;deleting an inland waterway from, or amending an entry in respect of an island waterway in,&rdquo;.  The Minister's powers are not interrupted in the Bill.  The Minister is left with every other power of adding, managing and so on.  If the making of an order requires an initiative to have it cancelled, there is nothing in the Bill to require the Minister to state reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other examples of disposal, apart from those given by Deputy Gilmore.  The canals and the banks of the canals could become an incredibly valuable resource for distributing cable.  In other systems canals authorities lease the right to have cable and makes an income from distribution, particularly at a time of the digital revolution and information technology.  Therefore, they are valuable assets.  For example, the Minister could dispose of such property to a State, semi State or private company and future generations would be left without the lease income.  For all these reasons the Bill gives the Minister such powers and functions as a Minister would want.  Amendment No. 4 seeks only to delete the word &ldquo;dispose&rdquo;.  I am not enormously interested in the power to deal with the Ulster Canal.  If a feasibility study is taking place and one wants to develop the Ulster Canal one may <Col N="871" /> find it necessary to dispose of it.  With the greatest respect &mdash; I speak only from memory &mdash; if one decides to do so legislation will be required.  That could be done in a short Bill.  One could argue which is the more controversial.  If the Minister has the power to dispose does she have plans for the Boyne Navigation and that part of it which in the short-term is not being rewatered.</P>
    <P>Powers are conferred on Ministers by the 1954 legislation which deals with State property.  The former Commissioners of Public Works would know all there is to know about the workings of that legislation.  They would also know its limitations. If the Minister wanted to extend the powers conferred by that legislation and the Canals Act, 1986, she would have referred to this in the text.  There is a procedural defect in that Deputies would be required <i>ex post facto</i> to express their opposition after the making of an order by the Minister who would not be required to state reasons.  I am not convinced that the Minister can deal with the Ulster Canal in this way.</P>
    <P>I wish to be positive.  If the Minister wishes to bring forward a Bill to place inland waterways on a statutory basis, I have no difficulty about the independent statutory body having great powers at a distance, provided it is accountable.  Deputy Gilmore is correct in describing this as an issue <Col N="872" /> of property.  There has probably not been a more divisive or emotive issue than the issue of what is State and public.  One of the greatest threats to the State and the political system in modern times is posed by the question marks over the selling, disposal and acquisition of State property by the State and its agents.  The Minister should not use the word &ldquo;dispose&rdquo;.  This is a good Bill without it.  Issues of management of the waterways can be dealt with without providing for the power of deletion and the subsequent power of disposal.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister may for stated reasons temporarily close&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) an inland waterway, or</P>
      <P>(b) any part of an inland waterway, or</P>
      <P>(c) any land contiguous to an inland waterway including any towpath or embankment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Members will remember I gave notice that I would table an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.  I wish to introduce an amendment to section 3 on this Stage concerning my powers to close a waterway, including a towpath, and I do that by way of this amendment.  At present my powers apply only to navigation and not to adjacent waterway properties such as towpaths.  I am sure Deputies will understand the reason I wish to have this power is to be in a position to temporarily close such a waterway's property in order, for example, to carry out maintenance or restoration works on the waterway.</P>

      <P>This amendment is acceptable both in terms of what it tries to do and in the form by which the Minister's powers will be exercised &mdash; by giving notice, stated intention and descriptions.  It allows public accessibility, which is important.  I welcome the amendment, which is a practical extension of the Minister's power.  It would make no sense, for example, to be able to access the navigation requirements but not other necessary ancillary works.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a straightforward amendment and, unlike the previous one, it is very clear. When the Minister replies to the acceptance of the amendment, will she indicate what she will do in the event of closing a waterway or tow path? Will such an intention be published in an official document and what kind of notice will be given? How far does this power extend?  For instance, Galway University is undertaking research into zebra mussels, which have the potential to block water pipes.  Let us say, in theory, that such mussels have infested a particular waterway, which may or may not be State owned.  In that case, how far does the Minister's power extend?  Can the Minister temporarily close off a waterway, leading to a recognised inland waterway or lake, while rectification work takes place?  Other than those points, the amendment is straightforward.  The Minister should have this necessary function and I support it.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for supporting this amendment.  It is correct to say that there must be stated reasons for wishing to take such action.  Those reasons are important because it would not be in anyone's interest for the Minister to arbitrarily close an inland waterway, albeit temporarily.  Reasons have to be given for such a closure.  I understand the method of conveying the reason for closure is by erecting a notice on the affected stretch of waterway and perhaps by inserting a notice in newspapers to make sure the public and those in the general vicinity will be aware of the closure and the reasons for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 43, to delete &ldquo;It&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Subject to compliance with any legal requirement in that behalf, it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While this amendment is slightly different from the later ones with which it is grouped, I have no problem in discussing them together.  The amendment refers to legal requirements, whereas the others deal with a form of usage.  As I explained on Committee Stage, this amendment ensures that planning permission will be required, for example, to demolish a building.  One of the more exciting things about waterways is the heritage and architectural quality, not just of buildings but of fittings.</P>
      <P>Any Minister of the day will have my support in trying to develop the waterways but, unfortunately, given the history of local authorities, many buildings have been demolished.  In the history of State agencies the requirement to seek planning permission was vindicated by the courts rather than the Legislature, which had to respond to it later.</P>
      <P>This amendment inserts a reasonable restraint; &ldquo;Subject to compliance with any legal requirement in that behalf, it&rdquo;.  If there is no difficulty, why not accept it?  In answer to my suggestion, one might ask if it is not redundant in so far as any action would be lawful.  My response to that is simple: that argument was always there, but it did not prevent buildings from being demolished. Neither did it prevent property, which was part of the public heritage, from being neglected, demolished or sold by local authorities.  In addition, it did not stop serious and eminent bodies, which were acting in the name of the State, from applying for permission.  They did not do so until they were forced.  This amendment is saying to citizens that the State and its agencies, in so far as they are concerned with waterways, will put such disciplines on themselves as apply to every other citizen, even if one wanted to argue that the exemplary compliance with legal requirements, including that of planning permission, is highly appropriate.  That is what this change of wording suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difficulty in combining these amendments because I imagine the Minister and I have <Col N="876" /> reached a correspondence of minds with regard to amendments Nos. 5 and 6.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>From a housekeeping point of view, if the Minister gains power by enactment or by ministerial order made by another Minister, I am not limiting the manner by which she can acquire a function or power.  Her own amendment does exactly the same thing, except that here I am being consistent with the change I made, when I was a Minister, to the Broadcasting Act, 1993, in which I inserted a gender provision in relation to the composition of the RTE Authority. While I do not have the Bill in front of me, I recall that I referred to &ldquo;on him or her&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not want to hear the ancient colonial argument that since the age of the Pharaohs it has been the practice to refer to &ldquo;him&rdquo; generically and that the word automatically includes women. The reality is that in different legislation, but specifically in the example I gave of the Broadcasting Act, 1993, I decided it would refer to &ldquo;or otherwise conferred on him or her&rdquo;.  I would have no difficulty if people want to change that to read &ldquo;on her or him&rdquo;.  The difference between the Minister and I on this matter is not a fundamental one about powers.  She has suggested, however, &ldquo;or otherwise so conferred&rdquo;, and I simply want it to say &ldquo;on him or her&rdquo;.  It is important that people of different genders fill this important ministry in future.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 is self-explanatory and we discussed it at some length on Committee Stage. It would insert the following:</P>
      <P>(e) to facilitate the use of any or all land referred to in paragraph (a)(i) of this subsection for recreational use including walking, horse-riding, fishing and such other uses as the Minister shall from time to time deem appropriate.</P>
      <P>The difference between my amendment and amendment No. 8 in the name of Deputy Kenny is that I draw a distinction between designating and facilitating.  For example, a local authority could have a section of playing space and one code might want it designated for hurling or gaelic football, but local soccer clubs might want to play on it occasionally.  That is the distinction between designating and facilitating.  The latter allows for flexibility; designation might be a constraint.  We are not at odds over this, but I believe the formulation of words in amendment No. 7 is better than amendment No. 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the grouping of the amendments, amendment No. 3 is legal and requires the State to discipline itself in the same way as any citizen. I have given historical reasons for tabling it.  The Minister's amendment No. 5 stops short of that little extra which my amendment No. 6 has, the insertion of the words &ldquo;or otherwise conferred on him or her&rdquo;.  I have made the case that the wording <Col N="877" /> of amendment No. 7 allows the Minister flexibility and I urge her to accept it.  If she says she is happy to accept amendment No. 8, I will give way.  However, from a practice point of view, I believe the formulation of words in amendment No. 7 is superior to that in amendment No. 8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer specifically to amendments Nos. 7 and 8.  I have no difficulty with the Minister accepting either &ldquo;facilitate&rdquo; or &ldquo;designate&rdquo;. The Minister is aware from correspondence and previous discussions that amendment No. 8, with the use of the word &ldquo;designate&rdquo;, arises from the long-standing interest of Deputy Dukes in this area because a section of canal runs through his constituency.  He sent me copies of his correspondence with the Minister following the business being discussed in the Dáil previously.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister examined this matter from the outset with a completely open mind. That is as it should be.  State property too often lies idle for generations and people then assume it should always be so.  There will always be one or two individuals in a locality who will say the property should be left as it is and should be left untouched for time immemorial.  I do not believe that.  Things must change and it must be approached with a completely open mind.</P>
      <P>I know from my involvement in the Department that tourists, both foreign and national, require a variety of leisure activities for different interests.  I see no reason canal bank areas should not be used more than they are.  Many of them lie idle with different plants and vegetation growing there.  They are only occasionally walked through by backpackers, hikers, workmen, etc.  Regardless of whether the word &ldquo;facilitate&rdquo; or &ldquo;designate&rdquo; is used, sections of canal bank are eminently suitable for horse riding and for the creation of bridle paths or gallops.</P>
      <P>In his reply to the Minister, Deputy Dukes dealt with the four contentious issues the Minister raised.  First was the concerns of other canal users who oppose any change in the prohibition.  Is there any evidence or are there reports on the extent of canal use?  Do these people use kayaks or canoes?  Are they walkers, fishermen, cyclists, etc.  ?  When new interests, pursuits and opportunities are created, developed and authorised by a Department, many people see their value.  I know of umpteen cases throughout the country. People holidaying in the midlands, County Kildare for example, would love to have the use of a horse for themselves or their children who are involved in equestrian pursuits and to be able to walk, gallop or run along sections of canal banks which would be designated or deemed suitable for this pursuit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's second point was that if a group is facilitated or if a section of canal is designated for their use, could this be reconciled with demands from other parts of the country and would it create a precedent.  It obviously does not. The Minister is entitled and authorised to do as she wishes in this regard.  A blanket prohibition <Col N="878" /> along all canals is unrealistic in 1998.  The Minister should continue with her open mind policy and be courageous and imaginative on this.  She can potentially enhance the economic viability of the tourism and leisure pursuit industries in locations not strongly associated with them.  If she facilitates or designates a section of canal bank in Rathangan for this purpose and receives similar claims from other areas where there are canals, she is authorised to say whether those areas are suitable or not.  She should lead on this and should not leave the blanket prohibition which has existed since the last century.</P>
    <P>There is a genuine merit in carrying out a pilot study.  The Minister could facilitate the use of a section of canal at Rathangan for various purposes for six months and the damage, from horses' hooves for example, could be studied.  If it is bad, she could end the designation of the canal bank.  If it is not, she could extend it.  It is worthy of the Minster's imaginative approach and open mind at least to consider such a study for a six to 12 month period.  If, at the end, she or the waterways service is satisfied it is not working and is unfeasible, that it is damaging the canal bank to an undue extent, at least it will have been considered and people will have been given the option.  The other issues the Minister raised about the cost and insurance apply as in the case of all others.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for her open minded approach.  This issue arose from Deputy Dukes's interest, which I support fully.  I do not have a difficulty with the use either of the word &ldquo;facilitating&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;designating&rdquo;.  However, following on from the Minister's open minded approach, she should try a pilot study for six to 12 months and have her experts analyse the effects and consequences.  If they are beneficial as regards tourism, local economy and interests for young people and children, that is fine.  If they are proven to be damaging to an undue extent, she can say it was tried, the opportunity was given for it to work, but it did not and that is the end of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want fairness for Deputy Dukes who cannot be here.  He wrote to me on this matter and told the Minister he was sending me his correspondence with her and her Department on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been encouraged by recent events in Ireland regarding horses.  The notion that only a very well heeled property owner, farmer or rancher should own a horse, and that a person who does not have such resources should be precluded from owning a horse, fills me with horror at the class bias of it all.  I do not ride horses, but I happen to like them, and I was reared on a farm. There is an extraordinary sentence in one of the letters to the Minister about what a frightening apparition it is for someone walking along a towpath to meet someone on horseback.  It is described as an unusual sight these days.  God help those who think it is such an unusual sight. <Col N="879" /> May the Lord have even more pity on them if they happen to be frightened.  I remember the bunch of eccentrics who used to ride with the Clare Hunt past my uncle's gate and I was never actually frightened by them.  I thought they were a source of enormous amusement because we used to have bets as children about the big hole they would knock in the wall so that they could walk the horse through rather than seek to elevate its great weight or their own over a hedge. The point is that in regard to horses there is a bit of extremism creeping in.  However, that debate is for another day, and I will not stray into it.  It is quite tragic that youngsters who would come to know, love and care for horses might be prevented from owning them.  The local authorities should make provision so that they can develop the necessary skills and have access to horses.  The idea that only people in County Meath or County Kildare should own a horse is the most absurd class position.</P>
    <P>I read the correspondence in question with great care.  There was a very good, sensitive point that the officials have consistently made to the Minister, and that is the difference between the big heavy horses &mdash; they might have been Clydesdales &mdash; that pulled the barges but did not damage the towpaths, and a horse running at speed. There may be a way out of this.  It should be possible to compromise by having an extension of the towpath, rather like the British system, which is shot down too easily in the correspondence.  One could, taking up Deputy Kenny's position, extend sections of the towpath to allow a certain amount of equestrian activity and confine such activity to that.  In that way one would have answered the question of other users and the question of damage. It would be hard to sustain a general prohibition. The correspondence says that equestrian interests should make their own arrangements.  A number of equestrian interests have more fourwheel drives than horses, and they are well able to look after themselves, but there is also a reference to the problem of containing travellers' horses.  I see nothing wrong with young travellers taking their horses along a dedicated part of the towpath on the canal.  It is a wonderful thing.  It would also be wonderful if we could be reasonable to the youngsters trying to look after their horses in the city.  We should do that, because it has all gone too far.</P>
    <P>In support of the points made by Deputies Kenny and Dukes, I argue that it is difficult to justify total prohibition.  In the case made for the total prohibition, it is hard to accept the argument that horses are frightening to everybody at all times in every spot on all towpaths.  It is also difficult to accept that there is no part of the waterways and towpaths that could not be made safe for use.  We could even allow a period in which this could be examined experimentally.  This is a time for compromise, and I am interested in the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that I cannot accept amendment No. 3 because I have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that the wording of the subsection as drafted is correct.  With regard to amendment No. 6, I said on Committee Stage that I understood what Deputy Higgins was trying to do in principle and that I was willing to try to incorporate that view.  I have done that in my proposed amendment No. 5.  The Deputy points out that the only difference in amendments Nos. 5 and 6 seems to be that Deputy Higgins's amendment refers to &ldquo;him or her&rdquo;.  However, on reading the Bill, including my amendment No. 5, it would read &ldquo;for use by the Minister in the performance of his or her functions under this or any other enactment or otherwise so conferred&rdquo;.  That incorporates the view that was expressed and expounded initially by Deputy Higgins.  I believe that to be the right course of action.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 has been of great interest to me.  Deputies Kenny and Higgins referred to correspondence I had with Deputy Dukes.  It has become more interesting as that correspondence continues.  We are trying to find a fair approach to this matter.  I posed a number of questions in a letter to Deputy Dukes.  He came back to me yesterday by way of letter and answered those questions, which should be of help.  I was interested to note the different approach of both Deputies Kenny and Higgins with reference to &ldquo;facilitate&rdquo; and &ldquo;designate&rdquo;.  These are issues we can accept in terms of a general discussion at a later stage to see what is the best way forward.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept amendments Nos. 7 and 8 at this juncture.  They are unnecessary because bylaws effectively allow for such designations to be made.  To follow up on the interest expressed by Deputy Dukes and by the other Members, I intend to set a consultation process in train immediately which will report within months. This will give an opportunity to all prospective users, fishermen, horse riders or walkers, to give their views on this issue.  That is the fairest way forward.  To elicit as much response as possible, I will be asking Deputy Dukes to give us a list of the clubs, societies, or individuals he would like contacted on this.  We can then base our discussions and our decisions on the results of this survey.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) In providing financial assistance under subsection (1)(d) or otherwise to the Arts Council, the Minister shall determine the amount of such assistance as shall be expended by the Arts Council for the sole purpose of grant-aiding the Irish Museum of Modern Art Company, the National Concert <Col N="882" /> Hall Company and the National Theatre Society Limited.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the funding mechanism for the major cultural institutions, the Irish Museum of Modern Art Company, the National Concert Hall Company and the National Theatre Society Limited.  The previous mechanism, which was a good way of dealing with the funding for the various institutions, was brought into existence after consultation with them and the Arts Council.  However, the Minister said on Committee Stage that the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the National Concert Hall were not fully happy with it.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in the arts for up to 30 years and one of the problems which arises is the need to balance the requirements of the National Theatre Society Limited with the total budget for the Arts Council.  If one uses a different mechanism from the one proposed in the amendment, other clients of the Arts Council will be able to use it to make their case for increased funding. Under the cultural institutions legislation the list of institutions can be changed by the Minister. The suggestion that the needs of the major institutions are the same as those of the other clients of the Arts Council does not hold up.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 10, the members of the public to whom I have spoken are baffled that there is not a specific reference to dance in the 1951 and 1973 Arts Acts.  One could argue that expenditure on dance is <i>ultra vires.</i>  The Minister stated on Committee Stage that this can be dealt with by way of amendment to the Arts Acts. However, given the legislative programme, the work involved and that dance is not already provided for, I propose to press amendments Nos. 9 and 10.</P>

      <P>As I stated on Committee Stage, I cannot accept amendment No. 9.  I am reviewing the funding arrangements for the National Concert Hall, the Irish Museum of Modern Art Company and the National Theatre Society Limited.  It would be premature to consider making provision for this in legislation.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Deputy's points about the funding arrangements for these institutions. While my predecessor implemented a consultation process, the National Concert Hall and IMMA have never been entirely happy with the position.  In this context, amendment No. 9 would not be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On amendment No. 10, unfortunately dance has always been regarded as the Cinderella of the arts.  I have a particular interest in dance and do not accept the efforts by some people to portray it as a minority interest.  There is a tremendous amount of talent in this area and opportunities should be provided for training in dance.  The Arts Acts of 1951 and 1973 are the appropriate way of dealing with the matter as they would give dance the stature in legislation which it should have.  Deputy Higgins is as concerned as I am <Col N="883" /> about this matter and his point about funding for dance being <i>ultra vires</i> is interesting.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council is in a position to give further moneys to dance.  I was glad to be able to make this point during the debate in the Seanad last night on the Arts Plan.  The further allocations given by the Government to the Arts Council to implement the plan has meant that extra funding can be provided for dance.  I agree with the Deputy's general view that dance needs to be given further stature and the arts legislation should be looked at in this regard.  However, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 9 and 10.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 52, after &ldquo;specify&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall include the address in the State of the body concerned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 6 tabled by Deputy Howlin are identical to amendments that were withdrawn on Committee Stage and I indicated at that time I would consider them before Report Stage.  As Deputies are aware, the amendments provide that a body which applies for a declaration must be an approved body, that it should specify in the application an address in the State at which a notice may be served, that any notice sent to the body at the address by ordinary prepaid post would be deemed to be served for the purposes of the Act on the day in which the notice ought to have been served in the ordinary course of post, and that a notice of the commission's decision on an application for a declaration as an approved body would be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in addition to being notified directly to the body concerned.</P>
      <P>I considered Deputy Howlin's amendments Nos. 4 and 6 and was disposed to examining their merits.  I do not have any difficulty with the general principle of the matters covered in the amendments but for reasons I will outline I have tabled amendments Nos. 3 and 5 to meet the principle and the spirit of Deputy Howlin's amendments and to give effect to those particular matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 4, I do not have any problem with including a requirement on a body which applies for a declaration to furnish an address in the State.  Amendment No. 3 in my <Col N="887" /> name provides for the insertion of such a requirement in subsection (2) of section 7 which is probably the more appropriate place in which to insert that particular stipulation.</P>
    <P>The advice available to me in relation to the other segment of amendment No. 4, that any notice sent to the body at that address by prepaid post will be deemed to be served on the body on the day on which it ought to have been received in the ordinary course of post, is already covered in the 1937 Interpretation Act.  Section 18 of that Act makes a general provision relating to service of documents by post and largely covers the related matters provided for in amendment No. 4.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 in my name provides for a redraft of subsection (5) of section 7 and includes provision for the option to deliver such notices by post.  That would bring the provision within the scope of section 18 of the l937 Act and, on that basis, I ask Deputy Howlin not to press his amendment No. 4.  Amendment No. 5 in my name, which relates to publication of decisions of the commission in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> incorporates the substance of amendment No. 6, and I ask Deputy Howlin to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <P>I accept the spirit of both Deputy Howlin's amendments and I am putting forward amendments that will meet all of the criteria he outlined on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting two-thirds of the proposals I put forward on Committee Stage.  The procedures are better, more clear and certainly more public as they will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  There will be no secret between the applicant for recognition under the section and the determinants but, for the avoidance of doubt, I would prefer the form of words I use in my amendment No. 4 because people who wish to apply, under section 7, for a declaration that a body is approved for the purposes of a referendum will read the section in the Referendum Act to see the procedures involved. My amendment loses nothing and adds a great deal if there is a comprehensive statement of the procedures involved.  It will avoid any frustration, doubt or adverse publicity if the steps are as clearly stated as we can make them.  No doubt a good lawyer will say that the section now provides for notices to be served by post and that section 18 of the Interpretation Act states there is an assumption that once notification is sent by post, it is presumed to have arrived and that all is well.  However, most people reading legislation take it at face value, as I did in relation to this Bill.  I was not clear that the Interpretation Act stated what the Minister has now informed the House.  My amendment states the principles in great clarity.  I know from previous referenda when an application was made to the then Minister for the right to appoint agents at polling stations, people relied on the basic law put before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> I welcome the openness of the Minister to accept the principle in my amendment and I fully understand the technical advice given to him not to accept the form of words put forward.  The innate feeling of the officials is to amend an Opposition amendment because they cannot have their words put into the Act as that might be a reflection on them.  Notwithstanding the excellence of the officials involved in the drafting of this amendment, it might be possible that a mere Opposition spokesman could come up with a form of words that would improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will reflect again on amendment No. 4.  In cases where bodies, which have a great sense of their own importance and the importance of a referendum, apply for a declaration that the body is approved for the purposes of a referendum, the procedure should be as clear as we can make it.  The acceptance of amendment No. 4 would make it much more clear.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 in my name is clearly redundant now because the Minister has subsumed that into his amendment No. 5.  I will happily withdraw my amendment when it is reached.  I again ask the Minister to consider using amendment No. 4 in my name rather than pressing that part of his own amendment which incorporates two-thirds of the intention of mine.</P>

I am sure the Deputy will agree, however, that the legislation must be drafted in such a way that it is legally sound and that we avoid any form of doubt.  I have no difficulty accepting the principle of the two amendments, which have been considered by the draftsman. The Deputy can take full credit for putting them forward, but the two excellent officials beside me would not engage in a cosmetic exercise. The amendments are legally sound.  In deference to what the Deputy said, particularly about amendment No. 4, I will ask the commission to clarify the full procedure relating to application forms so that a clear and transparent message will go out to applicants.  On that basis I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.</P>

    <P>amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 37 and 38, to delete &ldquo;and having a membership of not less than 500&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete the requirement in subsection (9) that the approved bodies should have a membership of not less than 500. There is a requirement in that subsection that the organisation should be either a body corporate or an unincorporated body which is established in the State and governed by a constitution, a memorandum of association and such other document or written rules.  There is provision that the body must be an existing bona fide body.</P>
      <P>My difficulty relates to the requirement that the body must have a membership of 500.  That will rule out the possibility of being an approved body for many organisations which have an interest in referenda.  For example, the late Raymond Crotty who made a remarkable contribution to referenda and referendum law, particularly relating to the European Union, was probably never a member of an organisation that had more than 500 members.  Certainly many of the organisations in which he was involved were small.</P>
      <P>In referenda held here in recent times, I doubt if many of the bodies which took an active part in those campaigns had a paid up membership of 500 or more.  Many of the organisations involved in the larger referenda on abortion, divorce and so on were small organisations and they mounted very effective campaigns.  In referenda that were not as high pitched, such as the bail referendum, I doubt if many of the civil liberties groups, which mounted effective campaigns of opposition with great passion and conviction, had a membership of 500 or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In referenda that might be held in the future, which may not be constitutional referenda but may involve legislation, it is possible that many of the organisations that will take part in those referenda campaigns will not have a membership of more than 500.  For example, legislation which the Government might decide to put to referendum might impact on a professional body, and there are many professional bodies and interest groups which, while they may draw support from <Col N="890" /> a wide audience, may not have a membership of more than 500.  It is unwise to set down a membership requirement because difficulties will arise in the future.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to draw a distinction between a political party and an approved body that is not a political party.  There is no obligation under paragraph (b) that a political party must have a membership of 500 or more, although it is more likely political parties would have a membership in excess of that figure than organisations that often come together for the purposes of campaigning in a referendum.  As a result of this provision a bona fide body with a genuine interest in a referendum may be excluded from being an approved body simply because it does not meet the membership requirement.  Alternatively, it may give rise to artificial boosting of membership in the run-up to a referendum, signing up people to ensure the number reaches 500.</P>
    <P>That is an unwise provision.  I appreciate the Minister's intention that the approved body should be a genuine bona fide body, but the provisions that the body must be governed by a constitution, registered in the State and so on, cater for that.  It is a matter for the commission to exercise judgment as to whether the body is a bona fide one, but the membership requirement is unwise and should be withdrawn.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for his proposal.  If, however, I accept the amendment, a body applying for a declaration would not have to establish that it has members.  Under that arrangement an individual or a small group of individuals who could establish a bona fide interest in the subject matter of a referendum and who meet the requirements about being governed by a constitution, memorandum of association and so on would have a good case for being declared an approved body.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that under this Bill the sole function of an approved body is to appoint agents at a referendum.  Approved bodies will be entitled to appoint personation agents at each polling station and to appoint agents at count centres in each constituency.  Because of accommodation constraints, appointing authorities are restricted in the number of agents they may appoint.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that I tabled quite a number of amendments on Committee Stage which would have entailed redrafting the Bill in such a way as to create a comprehensive electoral commission with a number of functions.  I will not reiterate the arguments I made at that time.  However, the fact I did not table the amendments again on Report Stage is not an indication that I am no longer committed to the notion of having a comprehensive electoral Bill which would establish one commission to <Col N="892" /> deal with the various functions currently assigned to four separate commissions.</P>
      <P>The impact of passing this legislation is that it will establish yet a further commission which will have virtually the same membership as a number of other commissions with different functions and titles.  That is not good policy.  I gleaned that the Minister is agreeable to my point of view and that, in due course, he might introduce a Consolidation Bill.  I hope the Minister will declare his own intentions and those of the Government in this matter.  As it stands, I have no difficulty with the Bill doing the job it sets out to do but I feel strongly that it duplicates functions. I do not believe that every function arising in the electoral area requires the establishment of a separate board or commission.  This is an issue which should be addressed in the medium term. It should not remain an aspirational notion which will remain on the long finger.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael opposed this Bill on Second and Committee Stages and continues to do so.  It is our view that the Bill is ill conceived and fundamentally misunderstands the implications of the McKenna judgment.  While we understand that the Minister must proceed with his proposal and, acknowledging that the amendments to the Bill are good, we do not support the Bill.  We will continue to oppose it not only on the grounds of the McKenna judgment but because of the duplication to which Deputy Howlin referred.  The Bill is ill considered at this time.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat the arguments made on Second and Committee Stages about the basic nature of the Bill but I agree with Deputy Hayes that the Bill is not the way to legislate for the McKenna judgment.  I fear that the arrangement being put in place by the Bill will result in referenda campaigns which are anodyne and artificial and which, unfortunately, will hinder rather than help the expression of views with the passion and strength necessary in a referendum campaign.</P>
      <P>We are in the final moments of this debate on the Bill and, inevitably, the Government will have sufficient numbers to ensure its passage through the House.  However, this is an area which should be re-examined at some future stage.  We should consider how this mechanism will work in practice and I ask the Minister to express a willingness to examine its practice to see how it is working. If it produces the kind of artificiality in referenda campaigns which I suspect it will, we could perhaps revisit the issue at some future date, perhaps in the context of the establishment of a wider commission as suggested by Deputy Howlin. There should be a willingness to return to this House at a future date with this legislation and re-examine it in the light of experience.</P>

      <P>I thank those who participated in the various stages of the debate.  Deputies were generally constructive and courteous, notwithstanding <Col N="893" /> their apparent total opposition to the concept of the Bill.  I do not believe I possess the totality of wisdom and knowledge in this area and I willingly accept Members' comments on the Bill which represents an advance on the situation with which Deputy Howlin had to deal when he was Minister for the Environment.  He had to create something out of nothing when he established the <i>ad hoc</i> commissions which carried out their duties well and to the best of their ability but we must move on from that.  There were flaws in that and we must move on.  Deputy Gilmore's comments regarding the most recent referendum are true. However, he fears the information from the commission will be anodyne and artificial and that the real debate will not even get started.  I do not anticipate that happening, although I could be proved wrong.  What will make the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty anodyne and artificial is limited imagination on the part of the commission and those it employs to convey its message.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not prescriptive with regard to the commission.  It establishes the commission and allows it full rein with a budget of £2.5 million to make the campaign as interesting as possible. Members of the House also have a duty, outside the remit of the commission, to try to make the referendum debate equally interesting.  By giving the commission money and power the Oireachtas is signalling to it that the campaign should be as imaginative as possible.  I hope the commission will take up that challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an open mind with regard to Deputy Howlin's proposal.  It is probably the direction we should take.  I told the Committee on the Environment and Local Government that it should consider the issue further on behalf of the House. The only caveat I attached is that it should probably liaise with the committee on the Constitution and decide which committee should discuss the proposal and bring forward proposals.  There is much merit in the proposal to establish an electoral commission and in having an independent body to deal with these matters.  The chairpersons of the Committee on the Environment and Local Government and the committee on the Constitution <Col N="894" /> should meet and decide which committee should discuss the proposal further.  If I get a report from the relevant committee I will act on it.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their co-operation in getting the legislation through the House so quickly. It is an important Bill, although not the final one, that will be required in this area.  It will result in a more informed electorate and a better debate on the proposals in the referendum.  Despite Deputy O'Keeffe's gloomy view, the provision of objective information rather than partisan propaganda will encourage greater numbers to turn out on the day.</P>

    <Title>Central Bank Bill, 1997: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are five matters to which I will refer, two of which are of current interest, two of which could be called banking bees in my bonnet and the fifth relates to the general provisions of the Bill.  There are a number of issues in the news relating to the Central Bank which might necessitate the Minister changing the provisions of the Bill.  It is obvious from the evidence the Governor of the Central Bank gave to a committee of the Oireachtas yesterday and from a headline in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> that the bank will not name cheats to the tax tribunal. It is obvious from his evidence that the bank does not believe it should have any involvement in tax evasion matters.  While I understand that, the Minister should clarify the bank's role when it discovers tax evasion.  He should also clarify its position in relation to the Moriarty tribunal.  I accept the need for independence and confidentiality and the need for other European banks and outside investors to be assured of the safety and confidentiality of their deposits.  However, this sovereign assembly set up a tribunal to investigate certain matters and in so far as possible it should not be impeded from getting at the facts it has been asked to ascertain by the Dáil.  The Minister should outline the Central Bank's role in terms of that tribunal.  The Governor believes that if he discovers tax evasion in a bank under his supervision he has a duty to report it to the Garda, but not to the Revenue Commissioners. He also believes he should not give such evidence to the Moriarty tribunal or any other tribunal set up by the House.  He believes he should pass on information on breaches of exchange control to the Minister who I assume would give it to the Moriarty tribunal.  In the light of the concern that that tribunal does its job properly, fully and effectively, the Minister should deal with this matter today.  He may deem it necessary to introduce an amendment to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should also deal with the inflation forecast which is somewhat alarming.  We are operating on the basis of a prospective inflation rate of 2.5 per cent.  Using a model recommended by the Central Bank, Dr. Leddin of the University of Limerick predicts an inflation rate of 5 per cent.  That would have alarming effects.  Even taking <Col N="897" /> the worst case scenario predicted by Dr. Leddin, I accept that inflation will not increase to 5 per cent this year, but I am concerned about the 1999 figure.  Because of competition, hedging arrangements and other factors, we have escaped the dangers of inflation so far, but there are worrying signs particularly when one considers the measures introduced in the budget, rising house prices and so on.  We cannot ignore the 18 per cent price increase on imports from the UK. They are bound to feed into our figures at some stage.  The Minister should also refer to this matter today.</P>
    <P>There are two issues about the Central Bank to which I want to refer before dealing with the broader issue of the Bill, which I support.  I want to deal with the responsibility of the Central Bank and the powers we give to it to ensure the safety and security of money deposited in banks. We all think banks are as safe as houses and, fortunately, that has been the case here for some time.  However, some of the financial houses in Japan are experiencing major difficulties and I am told that in South Korea, which is buffeted by the winds of misfortune at present, ten of the 30 merchant banks will close this year.  We should consider the security of money on deposit in banks in the calmness of our current fiscal climate.  People who invest in risky ventures accept that things might go wrong, but people want to be assured about the security of their money in banks.</P>
    <P>The Legislature sets out the limited number of areas where trustee funds can be deposited, including banks.  What is the position regarding the safety and security of such money?  When I looked into this matter I was concerned that under the Central Bank Act, 1989, the maximum compensation for a deposit is £10,000.  Under the 1989 Act, as confirmed in a recent letter from the bank, depositors are protected under the Central Bank deposit guarantee scheme for 80 per cent of the first £5,000; 70 per cent of the next £5,000 and 50 per cent of the next £5,000.  If the amount exceeds £15,000 there is no compensation; that is unacceptable.  Will the Minister use this opportunity to amend the 1989 Act to update these figures? I am particularly concerned about the position of trustee funds.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware I am a solicitor.  If trustee funds or client funds are lodged with a solicitor and a problem arises with those funds the solicitors' compensation fund is liable to the extent of 100 per cent to cover any default.  The solicitor may then lodge the money in an authorised trustee bank ranging from Ansbacher to Woodchester but there is no State guarantee for those funds.  The maximum guarantee for such deposits is £10,000.  That is unacceptable.  The Minister should use the opportunity of this Bill to amend the complicated fractions set out in section 59 of the 1989 Act to increase the deposit protection guarantee scheme to a minimum of £25,000 and in respect of trustee funds the amount should be unlimited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> I wish to raise the question of dormant accounts.  While I have raised this matter from time to time by means of parliamentary questions I am still not satisfied with the response.  An examination of the issue was carried out by representatives of the Department of Finance, the banks and the building societies, following which a report was prepared.  Those involved in that examination should have been far outside that circle.  Apart from tabling parliamentary questions I have been in touch with the Irish Bankers' Federation, who have been courteous and helpful in their responses, but I am still not satisfied. There is a problem although many people suggest there is not.</P>
    <P>I have come across individual problems and I know accounts lay dormant for many years.  I have had the experience, through my law firm and otherwise, of inquiries being made with banks about accounts, particularly of deceased persons, and details of individual accounts coming back.  However, other accounts either in the same bank or in other branches of the bank were not reported.  I am aware that a second account in a joint name may not turn up on a search.  In the event of an inquiry being made about an account for John Browne which happens to be in the name of Séan de Brún the details could not be got.</P>
    <P>I had a personal experience when looking after a person's affairs of making three inquiries of a bank.  On the first two occasions I was told the account could not be found.  When I persisted with my inquiries a special savings account was discovered.</P>
    <P>In relation to other aspects of funding, a headline in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> of 4 January 1998, read: &ldquo;Over £20 million assurance funds unclaimed&rdquo;.  The article referred to major efforts by Standard Life to trace policy holders who should be drawing down policies that had matured.  Despite its efforts a substantial sum of money was unclaimed.  A headline in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 15 February 1998 on the situation in the UK, which cannot be that different from here, read: &ldquo;unclaimed savings hit £45 billion&rdquo;.  The article stated that bank deposits which account for the bulk of unclaimed money are more difficult to trace, that many accounts have been dormant for years and passbooks lost.</P>
    <P>I am convinced there is a problem and on that score I am not satisfied by the replies I have received to Dáil questions and otherwise.  In the last reply I was informed there were potential legal and constitutional issues.  If there are such problems let us confront them.  We are legislators and that is what we were elected for.  If there is a difficulty let us deal with it and find a solution.</P>
    <P>I have made the suggestion that there should be an obligation, <i>via</i> the Central Bank, on all banking institutions and others that take deposits, to issue an annual notification to the account holder.  If there is no notification and the person dies and the passbook is lost in many instances, there is no <Col N="899" /> record of the account.  In that event the money remains in the bank.  Technically this money is owned by the heirs and descendants of the deceased person but it is no good to them if they do not know about it and cannot trace it.  A way around the problem would be a requirement for a notification procedure.  When I made this suggestion previously I was informed that due to secrecy obligations it could not disclose information. That is humbug.  Of course the bank can disclose information to the person who lodged the money.  That is not a breach of secrecy or confidentiality. The person who takes in the money should be obliged by law to issue a notification, in relation to any amounts over a certain sum &mdash; obviously accounts of £1 or £10 do not arise &mdash; unless, at the making of the deposit, different arrangements were made.</P>
    <P>I accept there may be circumstances where a person may not want notification of a bank lodgement of £5,000 sent home in case another person in the household might see it.  To take account of that a procedure could be followed whereby the person who owns the deposit could sign a note to absolve the bank from the notification procedure. Otherwise there should be a rule that notification should issue at least once a year.  The day of the personal bank is gone and often bank staff may not know a customer has died.  In those circumstances the notification would be sent to the deceased's house and then the necessary steps could be taken to regularise the matter.  I give strong notice on that issue that the campaign I have been conducting for quite some time is not over.  I am convinced it will become more important to deal with this matter.  There was an old advertisement for a whiskey, &ldquo;Tullamore Dew, give every man his Dew&rdquo;.  It is important to ensure every man is given his due in relation to those accounts.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the Bill.  I am pro-Europe and pro-EMU and I am delighted the Bill is being put into law.  I am interested in the rather convoluted manner in which the Minister dealt with the proposed exchange rate with the euro.  Apparently it will meet the needs of our economy in the full sense of the word and the decision cannot be finalised until the end of July.  We are still somewhat confused as to what that figure will be and what the UK will do.  However, I will not look into a crystal ball and decide on that at this stage because essentially that is what everybody is doing.  Everybody has to take a chance on this.  If one had sterling to convert to punts or punts to convert to sterling, one has to take the best advice on whether and when to convert and the same applies to the other currencies.  I support the Bill in general and I would like a positive response from the Minister to the issues I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to wish the Minister well in the Department of Finance.  I wish him every success in a most onerous task as he approaches a particularly difficult <Col N="900" /> period with out entry to EMU.  I wish him, his Department and officials well in the task that lies ahead of them.</P>
      <P>The decision regarding a single currency for Europe is a difficult one.  I and many others have reservations and concerns about it, but if the other member states join EMU and we decide not to join we would be in great difficulty.  On balance the Government's decision to join EMU is the correct one.  Our party and the other parties favour it.  Therefore, we have no choice but to go ahead.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister two questions in this regard.  This matter may have been explained in documentation, but I would like to know officially the position regarding our gold reserves. Will the gold reserves of the member states be placed in a central bank of the European Union and, if so, where will it be located?  Will it be in Brussels, Berlin or Paris?  I understood the gold reserves would be placed in a fixed location, but I am not sure that will be the position.  I spoke to some people about this and was told it appears the major players, such as France and Germany, intend to retain their gold reserves in vaults in their countries.  The power of the American dollar lies in all America's gold reserves being stored in the same place.  I would not be in favour of France, Germany and other major players retaining their gold reserves in their capital cities.</P>
      <P>I am also uneasy about another matter on which I heard comment and I have spoken to a number of people about it.  Is the Minister aware that France and Germany are buying gold?  Questions have been raised about that and I would appreciate if the Minister would let me know if those countries are buying gold at present.  This is an important Bill.  We have gold reserves which are not very large, but are of major significance to us as a small independent country.  It is important we know and have details furnished to us about what will happen in respect of the gold reserves, which will be the basis of the strength of the euro.  France and Germany are the two main players and when they, Italy and other countries join EMU, they must show a firm commitment to it by centralising their gold reserves.  If they are not to be centralised they should indicate where they will be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have discussions taken place at European level on our economy <i>vis-a -vis</i> the economy of Great Britain and how we intend to proceed in regard to this matter?  We must be very careful how we proceed because ours is a small economy.  We have seen the difficulties caused by punt-sterling differential, particularly for constituents along the Border.  The rate at which we enter EMU will have a significant effect on our economy because of our trade links with Europe.  At present imports from Britain account for in excess of 30 per cent of our imports and exports to it account for in excess of 20 per cent of our exports. Although they are declining they are very significant and Britain is our most significant trading partner.  We may face problems on joining EMU <Col N="901" /> when Britain is not joining and, therefore, we should endeavour to ensure we are given some latitude to help us get over the first three to five year period.  Our economy will be affected.  If the value of the euro is very high or very low against the value of sterling that will pose problems for us.  We should try to ensure some safeguards are put in place to ensure our trade with Britain will not be adversely affected.  That is important and I ask the Minister to examine that matter Some people believe the euro will trade at 83p.</P>
    <P>Euro notes will be issued in denominations of 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5 and euro coins in denominations of 50, 10, 5, 2 and 1, but euro notes should be issued in denominations of 1 and 2.  Whenever I am out shopping or on a social occasion, I end up with a light wallet and my pockets full of silver, which can ruin a respectable suit.  The euro unit should be represented by a note for the sake of the currency's status.  The pound coin has not been good for our economy.  The US dollar is worth far less than the pound, yet it is a note.  We should make that change, which will be significant for the strength of the currency and the value people place upon it.</P>
    <P>We have an ombudsman for the credit institutions, and that is important.  We will enter the EMU and no matter how it develops, many of our financial institutions will be involved with some of the major players both in Europe and further afield.  I have some shares in AIB and the Bank of Ireland.  Our banking institutions deserve much credit for their success rate.  We can be proud of our financial institutions, whose staff are courteous and helpful.  While people may complain somewhat, there has been a good relationship overall between banking institutions and their staff and customers.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, however, about problems that arise with repayments.  The ombudsman for the credit institutions may need further powers because while people can resolve problems currently with their local bank or building society manager, that will not be possible when head offices are located in Berlin or Paris instead of Dublin.  In that case, customers will be very small players and may feel there is no way of remedying wrongs done to them by a financial institution whose headquarters are abroad.  For this reason the powers of the ombudsman for the credit institutions need to be strengthened.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the rise in house prices, which means that many couples are having difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments.  Does the Minister have any statistics on the number of borrowers who have appeared in court for failing to meet their mortgage commitments?  This is relevant to the Bill because so many people are involved whose lives depend upon what is happening. Given all these changes, which may include some of our financial institutions being taken over, there is a duty on us to protect people.  Has the Minister carried out any survey on this matter?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> Is the Minister in a position to state how many family homes have been repossessed in the past year?  How many forced sales have taken place because pressure was exerted by the financial institutions?  Does the Minister have any details concerning the number of cases currently listed for hearing before the courts regarding failure to meet mortgage commitments and where repossession may take place later?  While the Minister is probably not in a position to provide this information now, I wonder if he can state the number of families facing court orders to have their homes repossessed?  Is it 1,000 or 2,000?  A considerable number of cases appear to be listed in the Circuit Court in which family homes across the country are in danger of being repossessed. Quite a number of such cases are pending, particularly involving building societies.  Is any statistical data available on these cases?</P>
    <P>The Minister is a plain speaking man.  If a family home is taken away nowadays it is called a repossession, but in the past it was known as an eviction, which is an ugly term.  Regrettably many people are unable to meet their commitments and are thus forced from their homes, which become subject to enforced sales.</P>
    <P>It is important to examine how we can remedy this situation and I will give one example of how I think we can meet this matter as a country on the verge of entering EMU.  It is essential for monthly or quarterly bank and building society statements to furnish more details to people who borrow money, in whatever currency.  Such statements should outline the total loan, the term of years, the rate of interest being charged, the total balance due &mdash; including interest &mdash; and the precise details of house insurance costs.  I thought all that information was supposed to be furnished to borrowers, but it is not.  I hate to have to say it, but some building societies still do not furnish this information and, while the amount of house insurance might appear on financial statements, it is essential that more details are furnished to borrowers.  That may appear to be a long way from the financial mandarins in Berlin and Paris, but it is an important point.</P>
    <P>The Bill is important for us as a nation as we conform to the provisions of the European Treaty.  It is a further significant step along the way.  We are lucky our economy is going reasonably well at the moment.  When I hear the Celtic tiger being mentioned, I worry because while there are many successful businesses, many others are barely ticking over each month and we must protect them.  The economy is reasonably successful, but many people are in difficulties. Therefore, we must be prudent and not talk ourselves into either complacency or excess.  The management of financial matters requires prudence, care, thought and much skill.  We should be careful about it.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents an important step for us.  I wish the nation every success in the venture we are about to embark upon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>As we move towards the decision on our membership of EMU, there is great awareness of the importance of shaping policy to satisfy the conditions of entry.  By European standards, our economy is unique in that its growth has continued to exceed expectations.  The Central Bank expects growth will be in the order of 7 to 8 per cent this year.</P>
      <P>Other factors, such as asset price increases and tightening conditions in the labour market, also carry the potential to overheat the economy and create higher inflation.  Such factors are a cause for concern because, ultimately, they could damage the economy through higher wage costs.  The availability of highly skilled personnel and the fact that some companies pay higher wages could cause difficulties.</P>
      <P>One feature of the strong performance of the economy is the growth in private sector credit, especially business sector credit with which I will deal later.  The growth in the past three years has been more than 50 per cent and it has increased annually by 20 per cent.  As we started from a level of indebtedness, albeit relatively low by international standards, growth on this scale may not cause immediate alarm, but money is cheap to borrow and that is worrying.</P>
      <P>While it is very good that a bank returns a profit of more than £500 million, as a businessperson I am alarmed at the charges banks levy for business transactions, especially when one considers that, in the past, their sole income was interest.  If a customer cashes a cheque and it is returned, it can generate £15 in income.  That is outrageous. The bank charges their customer and the supplier who wrote the cheque.  For example, a cheque was returned to our company.  I was charged £7.50, as was the bank's customer.  The bank made £15 on one cheque.  We should be extremely cautious in welcoming bank profits because banks can be motivated solely by profit. I believe many bank personnel are encouraged to maximise profits in every possible way.</P>
      <P>Another area of concern is the handling charge for clearing a cheque.  If a retailer lodges 100 cheques to his account, he can be charged 35p per cheque to have them cleared.  Retailers in the supermarket business work with small margins.  A net margin of 2 per cent is by all indicators a very good one and the retailer with such a margin is doing extraordinarily well, especially given the onslaught of the multiples.  Those same retailers will be charged 30p to clear a £10 cheque, yet they do the banks a considerable service in cashing wage cheques when the banks are closed.  The Minister should discuss and examine the issue of charges with the Central Bank.  People entering the area are not aware of the significant hidden charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an automatic charge if £1,000 in change is needed at the weekend from the banks to service tills.  The banks can also charge £7.50 to lodge £1,000 to an account.  This means £1,000 is only worth £992.50. It does not surprise me to hear banks are making huge profits.  I do not wish <Col N="904" /> to be overly critical of them as they have served the country well.  However, it is important the general public is made aware of how banks arrive at their profits and where they come from.  Some 20 years ago, profits were solely derived from the interest on people's borrowings.  Today there are added charges.  If a person has an appointment with their bank manager, their account is debited by £20 to £35, even if the appointment is only for 20 minutes.  The Central Bank must investigate this area and I appeal to the Minister to also examine the issues.</P>
    <P>Some of the banks' profits should be channelled back into the regions in which they are situated.  I am concerned the banks move profits out of this country.  While their expansion plans abroad are to be welcomed, they should have a policy, or the Minister should indicate they have an obligation, to invest some of their profits in regions such as the west.  In America, if banks make a profit, they are obliged by law to invest a portion of their profits in the region.  I ask for this here because bank branches in small provincial towns throughout the west only rubber-stamp the decisions of their head offices.  Many years ago, branch managers had discretion but that is now gone.  There is now only one major bank in each county and all other branches are satellites of it. Banks should have a sympathetic fund for investment in poor and peripheral regions to help fund initiatives and ideas in those regions.  It would be both good business and a good investment for banks.  They should have an investment fund for Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo or whichever area needed money.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about banks.  While I welcome the huge contribution they have made, they have a major responsibility to invest their profits in the areas from which they were derived.  Up to £20 million can be on deposit in a bank in a relatively small town, yet the bank can be very unsympathetic to causes it could fund.  I appeal to the Minister on this issue, especially on a day when a bank announces profits of more than £500 million.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am very concerned about the high rate of interest at the AAA or business rate. There can be up to 4 per cent of a difference between that and the rate levied on the ordinary borrower.  People talk of money being cheap but we are still paying up to 12 and 14 per cent for funds.  It is something which should be examined. The business rate is by no means cheap money.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank should also monitor the conditions laid down by credit institutions in lending money for house purchases, as it is another area about which I am very concerned.  There is a great risk that home ownership will be beyond the reach of persons on an average income.  Three bedroomed semi-detached homes can now cost up to £100,000 and this has changed the fabric of life.  One income is no longer enough; two incomes are necessary to pay the mortgage.  It is important there be a ceiling on lending because many financial institutions make 100 per cent finance <Col N="905" /> available to purchasers.  We should be very careful.  Money is easily borrowed but it is difficult to repay it.  People can now be easily evicted from their homes and the banks' operation is devoid of sentiment because profit is the bottom line.  The Central Bank while ensuring banks operate on business terms should also ensure they are more sympathetic.</P>
    <P>Preparation for EMU is a dominant feature of the work of the Central Bank.  Our duty is to ensure Ireland will continue to fulfil the entry requirements.  The level at which we join will also be important.  From a business point of view, while the date of entry is very close, January next year, there is a huge lack of knowledge about EMU.  I know Forfás is informing people of the complications involved but it will cause confusion, especially for consumers who have not been informed.  The State agency involved is appealing to a niche market.  The possibility of making its service more freely available to the ordinary customer who will be at the coalface of this major change must be explored.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will outline the current state of the all-party talks.  [4497/98]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The session of the talks held earlier this week in Dublin Castle was completely dominated by consideration in the plenary, under rule 29 of the Rules of Procedure, of the question of the position of Sinn Féin in the talks in the light of the recent murders in Belfast of Brendan Campbell and Robert Dougan.  The session, which allowed all parties, including Sinn Féin, the opportunity to state their views in full, concluded yesterday afternoon.  The two Governments have begun their deliberations, but have not yet reached a conclusion on the terms of a determination.  As soon as the determination has been agreed, the parties will be informed and it will then be made public.  I am not in a position to say more about this matter for the moment.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply disappointed that the talks were unable this week to concentrate on further detailed discussion of strands two and three.  The intention had been to debate the written responses of the parties to the matters set out in the papers circulated by the two Governments at the session in London from 26 to 28 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> This would have been facilitated by the intention of the independent chairmen to bring forward a paper drawing together these responses.</P>
    <P>In the period since the London session, there have been vigorous and useful exchanges on a range of issues, including rights and safeguards, economic and social questions, and strand one matters.</P>
    <P>The talks will resume next week in Belfast, and it is planned that there will be meetings there of strand one, strand two, and of the liaison subcommittees on decommissioning and confidence building measures.</P>
    <P>While considerable differences continue to exist between the stated positions of the participants on a significant number of issues, we are still of the view that there is a reasonable prospect of finding common ground as the negotiations approach their final stages.  The two Governments are both determined that this opportunity for a lasting and honourable peace must not be squandered, and we will do all in our power to promote and encourage the compromises which are necessary on all sides if a settlement is to be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that people who say they aspire to taking on a democratic way of life should do that without qualification? Will he also agree that in relation to the sad developments in Northern Ireland, the Sinn Féin party should take its medicine in the same way as the UDP, even though it claimed it had no contact or involvement with those who carried out acts of violence?  Will the Minister confirm that Sinn Féin will be put out of the talks?  Will he say for how long, and what will happen the talks in the meantime?  Perhaps it would be more accurate to ask whether the Minister agrees that Sinn Féin has put itself out of the talks.  Nobody in this House wants to see Sinn Féin out of the talks.  I want to see the party in the talks, but if it is excluded, it is because it has excluded itself. Will the Minister agree, therefore, that when it finds itself in this position, rather than running off to the courts and blaming all and sundry, it should learn the democratic game, as the rest of us have, and take responsibility where it is its to take?</P>
      <P>What timescale does the Minister envisage for both Governments putting before the talks a comprehensive paper covering all three strands? Will he confirm that that timescale will not be interfered with in any way regardless of whether Sinn Féin is present or absent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now concluded the process of listening to the various participants in the talks.  That process came to a conclusion at 4 o'clock yesterday after three difficult and stressful days.  Thereafter, the two Governments analysed and sifted, and continue to analyse and sift the contributions of the various parties.  More particularly we listened very carefully to what Sinn Féin had to say arising from the proposed determination under paragraph 29 of the rules of <Col N="907" /> procedure relating to the Mitchell principles, that is, section 20 of the decommissioning rules.  That is how the position stands.  As a long-serving Member, I am anxious to be as open as possible as has been my practice as a Minister or back-bencher, but I am constrained by virtue of the fact that the determination is ongoing.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, the talks will resume next week in Belfast, and it is planned to have meetings of strand one and strand two and of the liaison subcommittees on decommissioning and confidence building measures.</P>
      <P>These are difficult days.  As I said during the course of a number of press conferences, it is a time for steady nerves and for leadership and, as Senator Mitchell said, it is a time to keep our eyes on the big prize, which is permanent peace on the island of Ireland forever.  People on both sides of the House have devoted long hours over weeks and months to advancing this process which has been brought further than ever before.  We are within two months of a settlement, much closer than anyone would have predicted.  We must be more determined than ever to bring about a resolution in the talks process under the guidance and leadership of the three co-chairmen and, more particularly, under the guidance and leadership of the brilliant former judge, Senator George Mitchell.  His leadership in all this has been exceptional and I would like to pay tribute to it. I have no doubt I will have the opportunity of doing so in the future when, as he indicated in his own optimistic fashion, he announces a settlement between all the parties present at the talks over the next few months.  The House will appreciate that I am constrained by the predicament in which I find myself.  It would be inappropriate to comment on the matters the Deputy has mentioned.</P>

      <P>One can accept what the Minister says about the troublesome nature of the past few days where no progress has been made.  However, the deliberations were concluded yesterday afternoon. Work went on last night and again this morning.  Can he give an indication as to when the Government will arrive at a conclusion on the presence or otherwise of Sinn Féin at the talks? Prolonging the agony one way or the other at this stage is destabilising and a determination should be made at the earliest possible hour this afternoon.</P>
      <P>In the event of Sinn Féin being excluded as a result of deeds and activities of the IRA, for which responsibility has to be taken, how does the Minister see the talks process continuing?  We all set out to make the talks process as inclusive as possible but we are moving towards the wire in terms of 1 May.  How can the Government continue its work and seek agreement between the remaining parties when the likelihood is that Sinn Féin will not accept that which is about to be agreed?</P>

      <P>In the circumstances I could not anticipate a determination or what Sinn Féin might agree to in the light of a determination which may be negative.  I appreciate the Deputy's acknowledgement of the predicament in which I find myself having regard to the upcoming determination.</P>
      <P>The process came to an end yesterday afternoon. The two Governments have a very heavy responsibility and we worked late into last night and continued the work this morning.  When I leave this Chamber the efforts to reach a determination will continue.  I would like to think the work will conclude by the late afternoon or evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That issue has been addressed by the Taoiseach.  I learned early in the process that one must be very careful about the use of words.  The Taoiseach said that he and the Government, including me and the Minister of State, are addressing the point raised by Deputy Mitchell.  We must have consultation with all the parties in the process.  As Deputy Spring and others have said, this is an inclusive process.  In these circumstances we cannot pop a paper out of an upturned hat and say this is the conclusion of the Government.  All these matters have to be addressed within the totality of the three strands and relationships and groups within the strands, based on the premise that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been working closely with our EU partners in support of efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis arising from Iraq's failure to comply fully with relevant Security Council resolutions on the work of the UN Special Commission, UNSCOM.</P>
      <P>The action by the Iraqi Government in blocking the work of UNSCOM is in clear violation of the terms of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and, in the view of the Irish Government, is unacceptable.  The Government calls on Iraq to respect fully its international obligations as stipulated in the resolutions of the Security Council and to co-operate with the work of the commission.</P>
      <P>The system of locating and destroying weapons of mass destruction was authorised by the Security Council which established UNSCOM by resolution 687 of 1991.  It has seen some successes. However, there still remains, in UNSCOM's view, a quantitatively small but qualitatively still significant number of items unaccounted for in Iraq.  UN inspectors must be given unfettered access to all sites in Iraq as part of their essential mission to locate and destroy stocks of weapons of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's firm view that the best means of resolving the current impasse should be found under the aegis of the Security Council through diplomatic means.  The Government fully supports the efforts currently under way and encourages those promoting them to continue their endeavours.  It also strongly supports the efforts of the Secretary General to this end.</P>
      <P>At a recent informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Panama, I urged strong support for the continuing diplomatic efforts, particularly of EU member states, and of the UN Secretary General, to solve the crisis with an outcome which requires that any diplomatic solution would allow UNSCOM to resume effective inspections.  This was agreed.  Ministers called upon Iraq to comply with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and, in particular, to permit UNSCOM to carry out effective inspections of sites where they suspect that chemical and biological weapons and vital information are concealed.</P>
      <P>I understand the UN Security Council is currently involved in efforts to clarify possible arrangements for the inspection of presidential sites and palaces which would meet the requirements of the Security Council while having due regard to Iraq's concerns about its sovereignty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note in this context that the Secretary General of the United Nations had an intensive series of discussions with the Permanent Members of the Council about this.  He has announced that, following a briefing of the Security Council, he is prepared to proceed to Baghdad before the weekend.  The Government unreservedly supports <Col N="910" /> his efforts and hopes he will be able to find a solution which will enable the Iraqi Government to meet its obligations.</P>
    <P>I very much hope the current diplomatic efforts will prove successful and the need to consider further measures will be obviated.  However, if material breach of relevant Security Council resolutions is established and not remedied, the possibility of further action, including military strikes, remains.  The Government believes any such action should derive its authority directly from decisions of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>We must also be mindful of the humanitarian dimension.  At the Panama meeting I also raised the issue of the plight of the Iraqi people and urged that the Security Council take rapid and positive action on the proposals laid before it by the UN Secretary General regarding a significant alleviation of the distress currently being suffered by the Iraqi people through an improvement of the current &ldquo;food for oil&rdquo; arrangement.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also made its views known bilaterally to its partners.  The matter will be addressed again by the General Affairs Council next Monday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the United States Administration has a long way to go in convincing friendly nations of the appropriateness of its proposals?  To paraphrase a distinguished Irish diplomat, many countries do not want to get caught between Iraq and a hard place. I hope this is not too frivolous a phrase to use in such serious circumstances.  Will he also agree that there has been a gross failure by international bodies?  The General Affairs Council has barely been able to agree to meet, yet the Presidency of the European Union has taken off in one direction with the United States.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the powers the Security Council gave itself to strip search Iraq are greater than any powers it is likely to have again?  If it cannot make Iraq comply the question can reasonably be asked if it can hope to deter others from following Iraq's nose thumbing exercise. Is this not a gross failure of the UN, the Security Council, the EU and other such international organisations?  To some extent one can understand why the US is leading the effort. Other organisations are failing to deal with those who are stockpiling biological, chemical and nuclear weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Armaments are an obscenity whether they are conventional or of the type possessed by Saddam Hussein.  When EU Foreign Ministers met on the margins of the Rio summit in Panama we spent 90 minutes discussing this matter.  I made a trenchant intervention on two fronts.  I stressed, first, the need to continue to urge diplomacy on those who are anxious to get on with the business and, second, the need to take account of the fact that Saddam Hussein is an evil man who, nevertheless, presides over men, women and children who deserve the right to life <Col N="911" /> as long as they are freely on this earth.  They have been subjected to the most terrible sanctions to which we are a party by virtue of our obligations under the UN resolution.  We recently saw horrific television pictures from hospitals in Baghdad, particularly those depicting starving children. Whether or not this is propaganda, a starving child is a starving child.  I had the opportunity of visiting Baghdad just before the last Iraqi war.  I found the Iraqis to be honest, decent and good people who wished to live in peace. However, they are presided over by a lunatic.</P>
      <P>The longer the diplomatic route is followed the better.  We in this House believe that the preservation of life should be uppermost in the objectives we seek to achieve.  All we can do is hope that Kofi Annan's mission will persuade Saddam Hussein and his generals that, in the name of Allah or whoever, they should think again before going to war with one of the strongest war machines which has ever graced, if that is the word, the earth.  We want to achieve a resolution to the problem and help to prevent the destruction of life in Iraq.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns for the ordinary people of Iraq who will be the ultimate victims if there is an armed conflict.  The Minister mentioned that there was an informal meeting on the margins of the Rio meeting.  In his original reply, he stated that the EU agreed a position.  Is this an informal position?  Is there an EU position on the pending conflict or does the Minister hope that the EU will adopt a common position at next Monday's meeting?  This is extremely important in the context of the potential for conflict.  I wish the UN Secretary General well on his mission.  It is an extremely arduous undertaking but we must find a diplomatic solution which saves face, protects the world from Saddam Hussein's stockpile of weapons and allows the UN mission to complete its work unhindered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to Britain's role and its responsibilities consistent and coincidental with its Presidency of the EU.  Iraq is considered from time to time by EU Foreign Ministers but it has not recently been the subject of co-ordination. There is no common position.  I will attend the General Affairs Council meeting next Monday. We must remember that we are a small nation.  However, we have an important role to play by virtue of our being equal to the strongest of our partners in the EU.  We still have the opportunity to voice our concerns and I will do so at the meeting on Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position has been the subject of Security Council resolutions which are binding on all member states.  Therefore, by definition all members of the EU are bound by the UN resolution. Britain, which currently holds the EU Presidency, is also one of the five permanent members of the Security Council.  As such, and like France, it has to exercise its prerogative to <Col N="912" /> take a national stance as regards the implementation of the appropriate resolution.</P>
    <P>Since assuming the Presidency, Britain has chaired the EU meetings at which the evolving situation has been discussed.  EU Foreign Ministers met on the margins of the Rio group in Panama on 13 February.  That meeting was chaired evenhandedly by the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook. The General Affairs Council will return to the subject next Monday.  I will report on the meeting to the House and the Deputies who raised this question.  I will also send a report to the Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam has no implications for Ireland's policy of military neutrality and the issue does not therefore arise.</P>
      <P>The Government's White Paper on the Treaty of Amsterdam, which I launched on 26 January, sets out in detail the ways in which the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty on the common foreign and security policy will be further developed and enhanced.</P>
      <P>At the launch of the White Paper I repeated the commitment of the Government to maintaining Ireland's position outside military alliances.  I repeat now what I said then, namely, that if the issue of an EU common defence, which would involve a mutual defence commitment by Ireland, were to arise for a decision in the future, it would be put to the people for their decision in a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that if the Treaty of Amsterdam is passed, neutrality will be enshrined in the Constitution for the first time?  This arises because of the wording of Article J.7 which states that a common defence or a full merger between the Western European Union and the EU can only come about following a unanimous decision of the EU Council, that is the Heads of State or Government, an Intergovernmental Conference under Article N and ratification by each member state in accordance with constitutional requirements, which in Ireland would involve a referendum.  Does the Minister agree that having ratified the Treaty of Amsterdam Ireland could join NATO without any reference to the people but, should we wish to join a EU common defence or become full members of the Western European Union, we could only do so by following the three stages I <Col N="914" /> have outlined?  Does the Minister agree this is a valid reading of Article J.7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that it is a valid reading of that article or with the Deputy's comments about the principle of enshrining neutrality in the Constitution.  I have already given an undertaking in the context of the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam that a EU common defence, which would involve a mutual defence commitment by Ireland, will be put to the people in a referendum should it arise.  This does not presume that by passing the Treaty of Amsterdam neutrality will automatically be enshrined in the Constitution.  The contrary is true.  Any resolution of the EU Council, following the three stages outlined by the Deputy, would have to be put to the people by way of referendum.</P>
      <P>Regarding the scope of the common foreign and security policy, the White Paper on the Treaty of Amsterdam, produced by officials in the Department who invested considerable time and effort in it, is very helpful in its exposition of this area.  The genuine problem with ratifying the treaty is its complexity in terms of amendments, additions and deletions to previous treaties.  The Government must now introduce the treaty which members of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left negotiated.  The questions now arising would have been answered by the previous Government &mdash; we have not interfered one whit with the treaty as negotiated by the previous Government, except to urge the addition of discretions and options.  This is relevant to Article 29.6 of the Constitution.  I understand this has found general favour with Members and I urge them to accept the new draft as amended and extended.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 3.41 of the White Paper states:</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 already says that the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) &ldquo;shall include all questions related to the security of the Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy which might in time lead to a common defence&rdquo;.  The new text will provide that the CFSP &ldquo;shall include all questions relating to the security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy in accordance with the second sub-paragraph, which might lead to a common defence should the European Council so decide.</P>
      <P>This concerns the first part of the Deputy's three part proposition.  The paragraph continues:</P>
      <P>It shall in that case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 3.42 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;second sub-paragraph&rdquo; referred to deals with the role of the Western European Union (Western European Union).  It provides <Col N="915" /> in particular that the Western European Union &ldquo;supports the Union in framing the defence aspects of the Common Foreign and Security Policy as set out in this Article.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3.43 states:</P>
    <P>In the new formulation, the concept of a future common defence continues to be referred to in the language of possibility (&ldquo;might&ldquo;).</P>
    <P>The Deputy is aware of this as, with Deputy Spring, he negotiated these provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 3.43 continues:</P>
      <P>Any decision about it would be taken by the European Council, that is to say at Summit level where all decisions are by unanimity; and it would then be referred to as a recommendation to each of the Member States for adoption in accordance with its respective constitutional requirements.  The Irish Government, like the two previous Governments, have stated that, whether or not such a decision would require an amendment of the Constitution, it would be put to the people for decision in a referendum.</P>
      <P>If neutrality was to be enshrined by virtue of the Treaty of Amsterdam we would not have given this undertaking and neither would the two previous Governments have done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording is clear.  Will the Minister accept that there are possibilities of an eventual framing of a common defence for Europe and that there is no change in the status of our neutrality in the present context?  I would like to think that can be made clear by those of us who understand these issues because spurious arguments will be made against this issue in the coming months.  I urge the Minister, and the Minister of State, with all the resources of their Department, to make that clear from the outset because I have already heard some of the arguments and they are spurious, misleading, not grounded in fact and definitely not grounded in the terms of the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the views of Deputy Spring in this matter.  When people throw out a headline, that headline is followed and it is difficult to catch up with the sound bite.  This is an extremely complex treaty and we are trying to convince the people that the European Union has served this country well, not only economically but culturally, linguistically and in what we seek <Col N="916" /> to achieve to fulfil our potential as a people.  The ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam will be part of the process of improving the well-being of the Irish people but it will be difficult to deal with those who put out these spurious arguments.  I will do my very best, in conjunction with my colleagues in Government and with the authors of the treaty, the main Opposition parties, to explain in layman's language the meaning of what we seek to achieve, but it will be difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only presume the Minister misunderstood or did not take into account what I said.  Will he agree that in terms of guaranteeing that there will be no departure from Irish neutrality following Amsterdam, the new Article J7 of the Treaty of Rome, certainly in the European Union context, is a much stronger article than the original J4 which it is amending?  Will the Minister agree also that if this House so decided we could become full charter members of NATO tomorrow simply by passing a resolution? Will he agree also that if we pass the Amsterdam treaty, irrespective of any general undertaking given by this or the previous Government in respect of a referendum on neutrality, and if there is to be a common defence and a merger between the EU and the Western European Union at some time in the future, it would require a unanimous decision of the EU Council, the holding of an intergovernmental conference under Article J75 and a recommendation from the EU Council for ratification in each member state in accordance with its constitutional requirements i.e. by referendum?  Does the Minister agree this is a stronger provision in relation to Irish neutrality than Article J4?</P>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputy Spring that at some time in the future the question of Irish neutrality or participation in a common defence within the European Union may have to be considered and may have to be put to the people, but as far as I am concerned that is a matter on which my children and my grandchildren can make a decision.  In the context of Europe, however, if we pass the Amsterdam treaty that is a decision they will have to make because Parliament will be unable to make it for them under Article J7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle outlined by the Deputy is correct.  Article J7 amends Article J4, as he pointed out.  I am aware of the role the Deputy and his colleagues have played in this regard, and I know he is on top of the subject.  I agree with him that what happens after the Intergovernmental Conference, the European Council recommendations, the return of the recommendations to the Oireachtas and the consequent need to set off the mechanism of a referendum will not be a matter for my generation but for our children's generation.  Frankly, I do not see anything sinister about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>One way of clarifying this issue would be to seek to apply the terms of the <Col N="917" /> Amsterdam treaty to an existing situation.  If the Amsterdam treaty were in place, does the Minister believe that its terms would oblige us, along with the United States and others, to send troops to Iraq on behalf of the European Union?  There is a fear that if the Amsterdam treaty is passed, Ireland would be obliged to send our troops into war against countries like Iraq as part of a European army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I categorically deny that.  I agree with the Deputy's assessment which is part of the misinformation that is being given about this matter and which is unhelpful.  I cannot deny the right of people to misrepresent the position &mdash; we are living in a democracy &mdash; but we have an obligation to set out the facts as we know them.  The argument put forward by the people who seek to confuse the issue is spurious and has no foundation in fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

In other words, there will be no compulsion on anybody to participate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 34 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has already set out its views on the situation in Algeria in answers which I gave to parliamentary questions on 4 November and 11 December, in a reply to an Adjournment Debate on 2 December and in a report I made to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on 17 December on my meeting with President Zéroual, Foreign Minister Attaf and parliamentary leaders in Algeria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> The Government has emphasised its solidarity with the Algerian people, whose fundamental freedoms and human rights are being currently violated.  We have expressed our deep sense of shock at the horrible massacres of innocent civilians, including women and children.  We have raised the issue of allegations of security force involvement in certain of these massacres with the Algerian government and we have actively encouraged it to pursue political dialogue with all the democratic parties in that country in as inclusive a framework as possible.  We have also been active at EU level in urging greater efforts by the Union towards the ending of the violence in Algeria.</P>
    <P>Most regrettably the killings, particularly of civilians, continue though not at the same level of intensity as during the month of January which coincided with the Moslem holy month of Ramadan. Following discussions among the European Union Council of Ministers in early January it was decided that a Troika visit to Algeria should take place later that month.  A Troika at ministerial level visited Algiers on 19-20 January 1998. Vice President Marin of the Commission also took part.</P>
    <P>The visiting Ministers met with the Algerian President and Minister for Foreign Affairs, leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly, representatives of the media and local non-governmental organisations.  The Troika had a series of open and frank discussions with the Government representatives.  The subjects discussed included terrorism, the need for greater transparency &mdash; the Troika pressed for early access by UN special human rights rapporteurs &mdash; humanitarian assistance, which the Troika offered as a gesture of solidarity with the Algerian people, and EU-Algerian assistance in the field of economic and technical co-operation.</P>
    <P>The EU group did not, however, achieve all that it hoped, notably with regard to visits to the scenes of the recent massacres and in the field of humanitarian assistance.  While the Algerian government indicated its opposition to visits of UN observers at the time, it agreed to further ministerial contact and to visits of parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>A group of members of the European Parliament visited Algeria for three days last week. They continued the dialogue with the Algerian government and with a wide range of opposition and NGO representatives as well as religious leaders.</P>
    <P>I understand that a team of three Algerian ministers will attend the session of the UN High Commission on Human Rights in Geneva next month and also that the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr Koffi Annan, intends to visit Algeria in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that such visits are taking place and indeed, seem to be increasing.  I remain of the view that the best hope of success lies through active diplomacy and I will continue to pursue that policy in dealing with this tragic situation <Col N="919" /> and urge that my partners in the Union should also do so both individually and collectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I speak for everybody here when I say we are appalled at the loss of life and the atrocities taking place in Algeria.  It is not clear where primary responsibility lies.  Has the Algerian Government given recent indications about permitting UN rapporteurs to visit Algeria or has it explained why it does not want rapporteurs there?  If it did so, it would at least improve the case for its argument on terrorism. Has the offer of EU assistance been accepted and has it been put in place?  What are the views of the European Parliament delegation following its visit to Algeria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give an indication of the result of the troika mission.  Given the intrinsically deep-rooted and political nature of the Algerian problem, the troika accomplished as much as could be expected during its brief visit.  The following points are noted from its report.  EU Ministers and Commissioner Marin had a lengthy and searching discussion with Foreign Minister Attaf who, while he made no concessions, should be under no illusion about the depth of feeling in the EU up to the highest political level at the position in Algeria.  They established, via the president of the Algerian Red Crescent, that Government assistance was &ldquo;not ideal but acceptable&rdquo;. Mr. Attaf had earlier refused offers of humanitarian assistance.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner and Ministers met leaders of democratic opposition parties who, while united in their attitudes to the Government, were sharply divided on the necessity for an international inquiry.  They also met newspaper editors. The two main negative aspects of the visit were the refusal by the Government to allow them to visit the scenes of the massacres and reversal by the Government of its earlier position to allow a visit by the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings.</P>
      <P>In regard to the MEP visit, nine members of the European Parliament delegation left Algiers on 12 February following their three day visit. Their departure was marked by three bombs in the capital which, according to media reports, killed at least two people and wounded 28 others. The delegation held meetings with their counterparts from the Algerian Parliament, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and a broad section of society and reported that they gave the definite impression that things were starting to move in Algeria and that progress was being made in terms of democracy.  I will give an undertaking to the Deputy that, in addition to raising the question of Iraq, I will raise this matter at the General Affairs Council meeting on Monday next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was the first Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs to visit Algeria.  During my visit I met the Foreign <Col N="920" /> Minister, Mr. Attaf, President Zéroual and the head of the Assembly, who was very scathing of the role played by our former President in her observations on the position in Algeria arising from her present position in the UN.  I said I appreciated the role played by the former President and that I commended her on her new role. I also said that if there was any criticism of her it should be addressed to her.  I did not get on particularly well with the head of the Assembly.</P>
    <P>My urgings and conversations with the Foreign Minister Mr. Attaf lasted for three and a half hours during which we had vigorous and robust exchanges on the conditions in the country and who is responsible for the killings, whether it is the so-called terrorist organisations or whether the Government had a hand in human rights offences.</P>
    <P>I met President Zéroual who presented his case well.  It appears he wants to return to the democratic process &mdash; he told me that he was elected by the democratic process, and as far as we can ascertain that was the case.  We should not engage in megaphone diplomacy with Algeria.  We should stand side by side, in a humanitarian context, with the people of Algeria in their predicament. We should urge continuing dialogue, as has happened since my visit.  It is very important that the imminent visit to Europe by the three Algerian Ministers is part of an ongoing process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister see if it is possible that one of those three Ministers will come to Ireland to meet parliamentarians here?  I met the Algerian Ambassador in London who is of the opinion that we do not have enough contact with Algerians to understand the problem in that country.  Will the Minister agree there must be access to Algeria by UN High Commission rapporteurs and that an international investigation must be undertaken into the position in Algeria so as to have an independent assessment of the position there?  Will he agree that any EU-Algerian agreement &mdash; one such agreement was in the pipeline, although it may now be on the back burner &mdash; should include the right of the European Union to gain information on the position in Algeria?  Will he agree the Government, together with our EU colleagues, should seek the setting up of a war crimes tribunal and bring before it whoever is responsible for the genocide and massacre.</P>
      <P>I note that whereas Amnesty International and other organisations say that in the region of 80,000 people have died, the Algerian Government says only 26,000 died.  Whether the exact figure is 26,000 or 80,000 and, irrespective of who carried out the murders, we should put down a marker that the international community will not accept this.  We should seek to exert pressure on those in Algeria, be they in government or state agencies or outside them, who are responsible for this terrible genocide and put them on notice that the EU and the international community will do all it can to bring them to account.</P>

      <P>One is always reluctant to attempt to prescribe from afar about what is obviously a highly complex, historically-based problem but many charges of state terrorism do seem to have been made against the Algerian Government's handling of the situation in its country.  I am disturbed that the Algerian Government will not provide access to the country to a UN human rights rapporteur and that it has refused the Troika permission to visit graves.  Did the government representatives to whom the Minister spoke offer any explanations for the high level and scale of the killing which occurred during the past number of months?  It appears to me that the government is not capable of protecting the innocent citizenry who seem to be caught in the middle of this struggle for power between it and the fundamentalists. The government is clearly trying to retain the system which has prevailed in recent years.</P>

      <P>It is the intention of the Government and of the EU to continue to press for access to be allowed to a human rights rapporteur into Algeria.  Perhaps we could invite Foreign Minister Attaf to Ireland to address the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  In the event of him not coming, perhaps the Algerian Ambassador Benyamina, who is based in London, might visit the committee on behalf of the Algerian Government.  The ambassador is an articulate individual and I had lengthy discussions with him in the compound in which we were placed on our arrival in Algiers.  Unfortunately, we were only allowed to leave the compound under very heavy protection.</P>
      <P>I do not doubt there would be sufficient work for a war crimes tribunal but I am not sure that calling for such a tribunal would help the situation at this time.  In regard to the number of people killed, the higher figure of 80,000 people, quoted by Deputy Mitchell, is probably the correct one.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring inquired about the writ of the Algerian Government.  I personally felt the government was under siege from the terrorists. The government did send a young and undertrained army to the regions to deal with the situation but I understand the soldiers would not stray very far from their camps or barracks because of the ferocity of the terrorism.  The obscenities being committed by people who proclaim themselves to be liberating their country from what they perceive to be a terrible government are quite horrific.  In order to achieve that goal, hundreds and thousands of people are being killed.  It was predicted that the greatest number of people would be killed during the Muslim month of Ramadan and that proved correct.  The level of killings has lessened to some degree since then, although that does not offer much consolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell has correctly pointed out the necessity to continue a two-way dialogue and we should invite an Algerian minister or ministers to visit this country.  In advance of that, we could <Col N="922" /> perhaps ask ambassador Benyamina to visit us.  I notice a letter from the ambassador entitled &ldquo;Massacres in Algeria&rdquo; is published in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> to which Lara Marlowe, a very courageous correspondent with the paper, has replied.  The letters are well worth reading as they show both sides of the story.</P>

      <P>A violent earthquake hit northern Afghanistan and southern Tajikistan almost two weeks ago.  Due to the remoteness and inaccessibility of the provinces which have been affected, there has been a good deal of difficulty in ascertaining the extent of the damage and the number of lives lost.  However, preliminary reports suggest that between 3,000 and 4,000 people on the Afghani side of the border may have died in the disaster.  In addition, several hundreds have been injured.</P>
      <P>In spite of the difficulties with access, a number of relief agencies including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), have carried out preliminary assessments of the needs of the remaining population in these areas and have distributed limited supplies of food, blankets and emergency medical supplies.  Preliminary estimates by the United Nations indicate that somewhere in the region of 15,000 people may be in urgent need of relief supplies.  Travel to the area remains very difficult as the only reliable source of access to the area is by plane from Tajikistan and flights have been hampered by dense fog and heavy rain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has made an immediate allocation of £50,000 to provide relief supplies to the affected populations.  This grant is being channelled through the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has extensive experience both of carrying out disaster relief operations and of working in Afghanistan.  The ICRC has the necessary logistics and other expertise in the country and has sent seven specialists to the affected Rostaq region.  The funds will be used to provide air drops of food and blankets, water and sanitation and medical supplies for the next two months.  The European Community Humanitarian <Col N="923" /> Office, ECHO, has also channelled a substantial proportion of its emergency grant of 2 million ECU through the ICRC.</P>
    <P>Part of the grant will also be used to carry out continued airborne and ground assessments to determine the exact nature and extent of the need.  These assessments will obviously inform the possibility of providing further funding for humanitarian and rehabilitation needs in the coming weeks and months.  The Deputy may also be interested to know that Ireland has provided consistent support to a number of agencies who have been working to meet the humanitarian needs of the population in Afghanistan for some years, including the world food programme and the Irish NGO, SAFE.  Total grants to support relief and rehabilitation efforts in Afghanistan since 1995 have amounted to just over £650,000.</P>

      <P>Ireland believes it is in the interest of the European Union to further develop relations between the Union and Turkey. On that basis, we welcomed the decision of the European Council, meeting in Luxembourg on 12-13 December 1997, to invite Turkey to participate in the European Conference, which will bring together the member states of the European Union and the states aspiring to accede to it.</P>
      <P>The European Council meeting at Luxembourg also outlined the main elements of an enhanced European strategy for Turkey, intended to prepare Turkey for accession by bringing it closer to the EU in every field, notably through the development of the possibilities afforded by the Ankara accord and an intensification of the customs union.  Turkish participation in the European Conference, complemented by the enhanced strategy outlined by the Luxembourg European Council, would have considerable potential to further deepen co-operation between the EU and Turkey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have not had an opportunity to discuss EU-Turkish relations with Foreign Minister Cem, the British Presidency of the EU has maintained an ongoing dialogue with Turkey on the Union's relations with that country.  We support the continuing efforts of the British Presidency to encourage Turkey to participate in the European Conference and we hope that Turkey would also reflect further on the positive elements outlined by the European Council at Luxembourg.  We hope, through a process of ongoing dialogue and cooperation, the Union and Turkey can find ways <Col N="924" /> to continue to deepen the relationship between us.</P>

Is the Minister aware of the initiative taken by the Turkish Government in recent days in which it communicated to the Greek Government with regard to a high level group to be set up between both countries?  If he is aware of this initiative, will he do everything possible to encourage the Greeks to respond positively?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware the representatives of the Turkish Government are extremely angry at their effective exclusion at the moment the decision was made.  To date, Turkey's position with regard to attendance at the conference has been negative.  They are still simmering with anger at their treatment.  They were not treated well in the context of the treatment of the other &ldquo;ins and pre-ins&rdquo;, the phrase to describe the other central and eastern European countries and Cyprus.</P>
      <P>At this stage, it appears the Turkish Government will not attend the conference.  There is a strong feeling that its representatives were not properly treated in the first instance and that they should be encouraged to attend the conference in March.  I hope they will change their minds as it will be in their own interests.  Turkey has a great deal to offer the EU as a bridge between different cultures and in view of its history.  However, there are problems in Turkey which will continue to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Ireland believes the Union has a fundamental interest in developing and strengthening relations with Turkey and welcomes the fact that the European Council at Luxembourg explicitly confirmed Turkey's eligibility for accession.  We welcome the proposal to invite Turkey to participate in the European Conference.  It has the potential to provide a useful multilateral framework for consultation with all applicants for the Union, including Turkey.  We also welcome the European strategy for Turkey, as outlined by the Council, and consider that elements for an enhanced European strategy for relations with Turkey, including the development of the possibilities afforded by the Ankara accord and an intensification of the customs union, have considerable potential to further deepen cooperation between the EU and Turkey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The OSCE Ministerial Council which I attended took place in Copenhagen on 18-19 December 1997.  The outcome of the council was entirely satisfactory from Ireland's standpoint. Several important decisions which will guide the OSCE in its future work were adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main items on the agenda of the council was a review of work on the OSCE's contribution towards enhancing security in Europe. In my statement to the meeting, I said I believed conditions were becoming ripe for agreement on a comprehensive and solemn document on security for a new era.  I therefore welcome the Council's agreement on guidelines for a charter or document on European security, intended for <Col N="926" /> adoption by OSCE heads of state or government at its next summit, most likely in 1999.</P>
    <P>The guidelines reflect the aim of the OSCE states to build on the improved post-Cold War security situation in Europe to create a common, inclusive security space, free of dividing lines. Central to these efforts is the concept of mutually reinforcing cooperation among the various European and Euro-Atlantic security organisations, in particular in relation to conflict prevention, peacekeeping and crisis management.  The OSCE has endorsed such cooperation and has referred to, among other organisations, the EU, NATO, Western European Union and the Council of Europe in this regard.  The agreed guidelines reflect EU proposals to build on the successful cooperation of the key international organisations in Bosnia and more recently in Albania.</P>
    <P>On regional issues, the Copenhagen meeting noted with satisfaction the considerable progress made in implementing the Dayton-Paris peace accords in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  There have been substantial achievements concerning confidence and security building measures and targets have been exceeded in respect of measures for sub-regional arms control.</P>
    <P>The council underlined the importance of moving now to start the process of more widespread regional stabilisation.  Our continued commitment to a democratic and multi-ethnic Bosnia and Hercegovina is reflected in the extension of the mandate of the OSCE mission to Bosnia to 31 December 1998.  The council also welcomed the strengthening of the OSCE mission to Croatia following the departure on 15 January of the United Nations transitional administration in Eastern Slovenia.</P>
    <P>As I said in Copenhagen, the international community is showing increasing confidence in the OSCE, particularly in its conflict prevention missions.  This presents new opportunities to make a significant and visible contribution to peace, security and human rights in Europe.  It also presents new challenges.  In Bosnia, Hercegovina and Croatia, the OSCE missions must play a significant role in promoting conditions for the security and democratic rights of returnees and displaced persons.  At Copenhagen, Ministers recognised that tasks in the field of human rights are crucial and emphasised the importance of the return of refugees.</P>
    <P>Several important organisational decisions &mdash; which I welcome &mdash; were also taken by the council. It is essential that we avoid making increasing demands on the OSCE without providing the necessary support.  I consider it timely, therefore, that agreement was reached on financial reform involving assessed rather than <i>ad hoc</i> voluntary contributions in respect of large scale OSCE projects. This will place the funding of crucial missions, such as those in Bosnia and Croatia, on a much sounder footing.  In addition, review groups were established to examine how to enhance the operational capacity of the secretariat and the <Col N="927" /> efficiency of OSCE meetings on human dimension issues.</P>
    <P>While in Copenhagen, I also availed of the opportunity for bilateral meetings with a number of my colleagues, including Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Bosnia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the developing and worrying situation in Kosovo discussed at any of the Minister's bilateral meetings or at the OSCE meeting?  Will he take the opportunity at next Monday's General Affairs Council to obtain the views of his colleagues on the situation?  Perhaps he may then be able to brief the House on the latest position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that.  The OSCE had a mission in Kosovo which was terminated when the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was suspended from that organisation.  Given its expertise in addressing minority and human rights questions, a role for the OSCE would appear to be appropriate and useful.  However, the decision to allow such a role depends on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill which is a harbinger of one of the most important developments since we joined the EU and one of the most important decisions we have taken since we achieved independence.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an enabling one which will prepare us for the transition from an independent Central Bank in Ireland to a system of central banks in the member countries of the new currency and a European central bank in Frankfurt.</P>
      <P>I wish to repeat what I said more than a year ago when I was chairman of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  As a country we are sleepwalking all the way to Frankfurt.  The Minister is, of necessity, restricted in what he can say publicly or privately in the run-up to the establishment of a single currency.  He has expressed his views on the currency in the House and at the select committee.</P>
      <P>One of the views the Minister cogently expressed as an Opposition Deputy, with great prescience, was the danger of speculation against currency and turbulence in the money markets in advance of entry, which is exactly what has happened. The sensitivity of currency and exchange rates means that they properly, and of necessity, do not become the subject of political debate. They are not a subject for party political division.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, someone in this House must express concern about the present currency situation, which is wholly untenable.  We have a booming economy, following several years of incredible economic growth which is a multiple of the EU and OECD average.  However, our currency is at its lowest level ever.  It is not as if this is of no consequence.  Today the Irish punt is trading at 83 pence sterling.  Not so many months ago it was trading at £1.05p. This is an effective devaluation of 22 per cent in sterling terms.  We have devalued our assets by 22 per cent, in international terms, at a time of incredible economic criteria &mdash; economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates, trade surplus, balance of payments surplus and falling unemployment.  It is clear our currency is grossly undervalued and something should be done about it.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger, of which we are so proud and which is producing great growth, will soon turn sour.  One of the reasons for the economic boom is that people have a say through social partnership and political consensus and share in its benefits.  These benefits will dissipate and this will become more apparent as the year goes on.  People will take their holiday abroad and find the pound in their pockets will buy 22 per cent less.  That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In real terms, we have revalued the foreign element of our national debt upwards.  This may <Col N="929" /> not be the full 22 per cent because it must be weighed against the basket of currencies involved in that debt.  The foreign element of our national debt represents over 40 per cent of our total national debt.  We have increased the foreign element of our national debt by approximately 22 per cent because we have allowed our currency to float downwards.  This can be justified only if one believes a weak currency helps the economy and improves competitiveness.  That is a contradiction in terms.  I have always countered that argument by asking what strong economy became wealthy on the back of a weak currency.  If an economy is strong, its currency should be strong. Our economy is strong under almost every heading. Our national debt has been reduced from 130 per cent to approximately 60 per cent of GNP. The picture is even better because of the free reserves in the Central Bank which amount to approximately £1.5 billion.  After we join EMU those reserves will be available to reduce our national debt further.  However, I would prefer if they were used to set up a contingency fund under the control of the Central Bank.  That would be a way of cementing our current economic progress for the future.  I will refer in more detail to the question of a contingency fund later.</P>
    <P>I strongly criticise those elements in society who believe a weak currency or a punt worth 83p sterling is good for them or the country.  That is short-term thinking.  The question of an appropriate rate for the punt is a matter for debate.  Any competitive disadvantage that may have existed has been largely dissipated by the fact that in the past six or seven years we have had lower inflation and interest rates and higher economic growth than the UK, and that is without taking currency into account.  Our currency should be close to parity with sterling, which would mean a significant revaluation.  It would only put us back to the position we were in a few months ago.</P>
    <P>The correct timing for such a decision is also important.  The Minister has a great deal of advice available to him in that regard.  Some people believe a decision of this nature could not be made until the relevant meeting is held in Brussels in May, but others believe it would a mistake to leave it until then.  I believe that would be a mistake.  If we allow the low currency level to continue, we will become used to it.  A weak currency leads to weak discipline in the economy. Conversely, a strong currency leads to tight discipline in the economy.  In other words, if we had a strong currency we would have to remain competitive to sell our goods abroad and we would do that by keeping industrial relations, costs and productivity under control.  Therefore, there is a strong argument for a revaluation sooner rather than later and a rate as high as parity with sterling would be justified by the underlying economic realities.</P>
    <P>I already referred to the question of a contingency fund.  The Central Bank has reserves of between £5 billion and £6 billion.  Some of those reserves are moneys on deposit from the NTMA, <Col N="930" /> some are on deposit from the Minister and more are on deposit from banks as a hedge against a collapse in the banking system.  There is no call on at least £1.5 billion of those reserves.  They are the internal or free reserves of the Central Bank which can be used as a hedge against currency speculation and for which there will be no call after we join EMU.  The legislation does not state what should be done with that money after EMU.</P>
    <P>We should use that £1.5 billion as the foundation for a contingency fund.  By a contingency fund I mean a fund that could not be called on by the Minister for Finance unless certain criteria, as set out in legislation, are met or a real contingency arises.  The Governor of the Central Bank should be the person to certify whether those criteria are met.  If we do not have a contingency fund and a contingency arises which warrants significant borrowing over and above the 3 per cent limit allowed under EMU rules, we could be snookered.  We may need to engage in temporary borrowing to deal with a crisis, but under EMU rules we will not be able to do that.  A contingency fund is essential to secure the future and we have an opportunity to set up one with the £1.5 billion reserves in the Central Bank.  The Minister should introduce an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The alternative would be to reduce the national debt by £1.5 billion and thus reduce it by another few percentage points, but a contingency fund would be a hedge against future problems. However, such a fund would work only if it is out of the control of those of us who are subject to the political pressures of elections or by-elections. Central Banks will lose many of their powers after EMU.  Therefore, we should assign control over such a contingency fund to the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>If the principle of such a fund is accepted as a way of securing our prosperity into the future, we would then have to decide on an appropriate amount for the fund.  A sum of £1.5 billion would not be adequate, we should aim for a significantly higher figure.  We should take another step and legislate to ensure future budget surpluses or annual contingency funds are used only if genuine contingencies arise during the year in question. Any unused part of the surplus should be transferred for a period of years to the proposed Central Bank contingency fund until it reaches a certain level.  I do not see any argument against such an idea.  It would secure our future and give us a real hedge against future catastrophes and ensure a significant cushion against some downside effect of EMU.</P>
    <P>We are sleepwalking all the way to Europe. This is a political project but when it comes to economic matters it has to be backed up by economic reality.  The problem is that if we are locked into EMU, as we will be irrevocably, and some unforeseen major disaster arises in, say, Germany, France or Italy it could have the effect of scuppering the entire EMU and having adverse effects on us.  Not only should there be a national <Col N="931" /> contingency reserve but the idea of a European contingency reserve should be urgently considered so that in the event of a catastrophe in one of the larger countries or across the Single Market we would have a means of dealing with it without upsetting the Maastricht criteria which should be observed to the letter.  If anything is to endanger the currency it would be a willingness to fudge the criteria.</P>
    <P>Over a year ago Commissioner de Silguy, among others, came before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  He was determined that the timetable should be met.  That determination is shared by all the political heads of the 11 prospective members.  The timetable and the criteria are sacrosanct.  A question arose as to what happens in the event of a conflict between the timetable and the criteria.  The French budget looked dodgy, using once off payments as a means of getting under the magic 3 per cent deficit, the Italian position is far from certain and in Belgium the national debt is way above 60 per cent, yet excuses are made that it is not so bad since most of it is internal debt.  There is nothing in the Maastricht Treaty that provides for internal debt but not external debt.  It refers to national debts approaching 60 per cent.  The Belgian national debt is more than twice that figure, yet it is considered as one of the inner circle countries which will join the EMU.  Herein lies a danger.</P>
    <P>Currency values are determined by the markets based on their confidence in certain areas.  If certain criteria are not met and we are soft or false about these targets nobody will detect it more quickly than the markets and that could have devastating effects.  The Minister should consider the idea not only of a national contingency reserve but the need for a European contingency reserve.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate and assure them I will give consideration to the matters raised prior to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>On the general issue of economic and monetary union, I thank Deputies for their constructive and supportive remarks.  I agree the decision to be part of EMU is, in the final analysis, a political one, even though experts, whether economists or otherwise, may have a role in assisting politicians in coming to their decisions.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputies that monetary union will go ahead and that it will be irreversible.  It is vital, therefore, that all parties concerned accept this fact and act accordingly.  The Government shall continue to press this point home through its various information campaigns.  I agree with Deputy Noonan that the question of economic policy to be adopted following EMU must be addressed on a strategic basis and I assure the House that this is something of which my Department is fully aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the accountability of the European Central Bank <Col N="932" /> and the national central banks.  Arrangements in place at national level, under which national central banks are accountable to national parliaments, will remain in place, so long as they are not in conflict with the provisions of the treaty which guarantee the independence of these central banks and that of the European Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Those provisions on independence are clear. Article 107 of the treaty states:</P>
    <P>When exercising the powers and carrying out the tasks and duties conferred upon them by this Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, neither the ECB, nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision-making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body.  The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the Member States undertake to respect this principle and not to seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the national central banks in the performance of their tasks.</P>
    <P>The question of influencing the European Central Bank simply does not enter into it.</P>
    <P>However, the independence of the European Central Bank must be complemented by accountability, and this is the case.  If, for example, the European Central Bank is to do its job within the framework of the Union's economic policy, then a dialogue with the Council of Ministers is essential. The arrangements agreed for accountability and dialogue mean that the European Central Bank must present an annual report on the activities of the ESCB, that is the European Central Bank itself and the national central banks, to the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission as well as to the European Council, Heads of State and Government. That report must cover the monetary policy of the previous and the current year.  When the European Central Bank President presents this report to the Council and the European Parliament they have the right to hold a general debate on that basis.  The President of the European Central Bank and the other members of the executive board may be heard by the competent committees of the European Parliament, either on their own initiative or, perhaps more importantly in terms of accountability, at the request of Parliament.</P>
    <P>The treaty also provides a framework for continuous dialogue between the Council of Ministers and the European Central Bank.  The President of the Council of Ministers can participate in meetings of the European Central Bank Governing Council and can submit motions for deliberation, although he or she has no vote.  In turn, the European Central Bank President shall be invited to participate in Council meetings whenever the Council is discussing matters relating to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB.  Furthermore, the Economic and Financial Committee to <Col N="933" /> be set up under Article 109c of the treaty will provide opportunities for dialogue at senior official level.  Members of that committee will be appointed by the member states, the Commission and the European Central Bank.  The key feature of the ECB in this regard is that it is a European institution and the ECB's accountability is principally provided for via the European Parliament, as is clear from what I said.</P>
    <P>It should not be lost sight of that the members of the key decision-making bodies of the ECB will be appointed by democratically elected politicians. In this way governors of national central banks will continue to be appointed, as at present, by member states while the president and executive board of the ECB will be appointed by the Heads of State or Government of participating member states, on a recommendation from ECOFIN and in consultation with the European Parliament. The arrangements for the initial appointments are a pointer to the role of Parliament in exercising accountability over the ECB; it will hold extensive hearings with the candidates proposed for the board before giving its formal opinion.</P>
    <P>The question was raised about what happens if the Presidency is held by a non-participating member state.  The treaty provides that the President of the Council may submit motions to and participate in meetings of the ECB's governing council.  There is only one Presidency.  The key point is that it is the Union as a whole which needs to engage in dialogue with the ECB in the context of economic union, as it affects all concerned &mdash; the Presidency represents the Union, not a particular member state.  Furthermore, the Council, which includes both &ldquo;ins&rdquo; and &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo;, remains the body in which relevant decisions are made by Ministers, even if the &ldquo;pre-ins&rdquo; do not vote on particular issues.</P>
    <P>Deputies also mentioned the question of the reserves of the Central Bank.  There has been much comment in relation to there being possible &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; reserves of European central banks, including the Central Bank of Ireland, following the establishment of the ECB.  In responding to Deputies' points, I wish to clarify the position generally.</P>
    <P>All central banks hold assets of various kinds. In most countries, a proportion of those assets is held in foreign currencies, known as the external reserves.  Such external reserves are held for two principal purposes &mdash; to assist in protecting the currency and to ensure the country does not lack the foreign currency needed to pay for essential imports.</P>
    <P>With the establishment of the ECB and the adoption of the single currency, it will be the euro-area as a whole rather than individual participating member states, such as Ireland, which will need such external reserves.  Consequently, the ECB is empowered under its statutes to call up, from participating national central banks, up to 50,000 million euro in foreign exchange reserves, that is, assets in currencies other than <Col N="934" /> the euro.  Each national central bank's contribution will be in proportion to its shareholding in the ECB which, in turn, will be in proportion to each member state's share of the euro-area's GDP and population, like shareholdings in the EMI.</P>
    <P>On that basis, the Irish contribution to the EMI is currently 0.8 per cent.  The initial Irish contribution to the ECB will depend on the final figures for GDP and population in recent years, the member states in EMU in 1999 and the total assets called up.  However, it is likely to be around 1 per cent of the total; something around £350 million, depending on the conversion rate and the actual proportion.  In addition, the Central Bank will be subscribing to the capital of the ECB, which is to total 5,000 million euro; the Irish subscription is likely to be around £35 million.</P>
    <P>These will remain assets on the balance sheet of the Central Bank, although they will not be under its control.  However, it should be noted that the foreign reserves contribution and the capital shareholding will earn income for the Central Bank and thus indirectly for the Exchequer, as the participating national central banks will share the profits of the ECB among themselves.</P>
    <P>This will leave a substantial amount of assets, both domestic euro assets and foreign non-euro assets, with the Central Bank.  However, just because they are not needed as official external reserves does not make them &ldquo;surplus&rdquo;.  Certain commentators on this issue, speaking of billions of surplus reserves, appear to have forgotten that the Central Bank's balance sheet includes liabilities as well as assets; these include deposits from financial institutions, the Exchequer deposit and legal tender notes.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank does have some assets which are not currently matched by liabilities; these are known as the &ldquo;accounting reserves&rdquo;.  However, the value of these reserves fluctuates, depending on changes in the values of the assets held by the Central Bank; for example, between 31 December 1995 and 31 December 1996, its accounting reserves fell from £1,370 million to £947 million, as the value of its foreign assets was reduced by the rise in the exchange rate of the Irish pound.</P>
    <P>It is too early to say what the balance sheet of the Central Bank will look like, immediately after 1 January 1999 in EMU.  There are too many unknowns &mdash; what countries will participate in the single currency at the start; the approach to be taken by the ECB to the management of foreign assets &mdash; its own and those of participating central banks &mdash; and money market operations; and how the foreign exchange market will initially perceive the euro.  What we can say with certainty is that both the overall level of assets and the surplus reserves of a central bank contribute to its credibility.  It is not my intention to act in a fashion which could undermine the credibility of the Central Bank, and indirectly the ESCB, or the credibility of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> It is not possible to assess whether the Central Bank will have assets in EMU which are surplus to its requirements and I do not intend to engage in hasty action.  However, the situation will be kept under review as the shape of EMU unfolds.</P>
    <P>The contribution which any surplus assets of the Central Bank would make to the Exchequer should not be exaggerated.  Assets of the Central Bank earn a return which is reflected in its profits. After provision for reserves, the Exchequer receives the profits of the Central Bank, thus indirectly benefiting from its accounting reserves. If those assets were transferred to the Exchequer, the Exchequer would receive a lower transfer from the Central Bank each year.  Therefore, the benefit of transferring part or all the accounting reserves to the Exchequer from the Central Bank would be marginal &mdash; essentially the difference between the return on the Central Bank's investment and the interest rate paid by the Exchequer for borrowings.  More specifically, if the Central Bank's accounting reserves were to be used to reduce the national debt, the net annual benefit to the Exchequer would be the difference between the cost of servicing the repaid debt and the return the Exchequer receives by way of Central Bank profits on the assets in the accounting reserves.</P>
    <P>When there is a clearer picture of the Central Bank's balance sheet in EMU, the possibility may arise of there being surplus reserves which could be used by the Exchequer.  Deputies have given me a number of suggestions as to what use these funds could be put and I will consider them.  It would not be my preferred option to use such reserves for day-to-day spending given the revenue that the reserves currently earn for the State each year and the one-off nature of any transfer of these reserves to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill, as Deputy Jim Mitchell said, is not to revise Central Bank legislation but to adjust it to ensure it will be compatible and not in conflict with our membership of the new European Central Bank.  Some of the matters raised during the debate should be raised at another forum but I will deal with them briefly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe raised the question of the McCracken and Moriarty tribunals.  Under section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, the Central Bank has an obligation to respect confidentiality. The section provides that the Central Bank cannot disclose information except under certain circumstances.  A tribunal is not covered as one of these exceptional circumstances. However, the Central Bank has disclosed information to the Moriarty tribunal on exchange controls. On the question of supervision, the Central Bank is complying fully with the discovery order issued by the Moriarty tribunal, the terms of reference of which include a provision which obliges it to look at the Central Bank's role as a supervisor of financial institutions and to make whatever recommendations it may consider appropriate. <Col N="936" /> I await the tribunal's report and will consider any recommendations made in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Keeffe and Mitchell raised the question of the exchange rate.  Deputy Mitchell reminded me, fairly, that when in Opposition I said that the setting of a date in currency matters would inevitably lead to speculation.  From my good knowledge of currencies acquired over many years, that is what the markets love as it is the time when one can make money.  Before certitude there is uncertainty.  If one looks back over the past 40 years, there was an occurrence or event which caused speculation.  I have adopted a consistent mantra which I do not need to repeat. It would not be right for any Irish Minister for Finance to give an indication one way or another. That leads me to some of difficulties posed by the questions put by Deputy Jim Mitchell.  If I were to enter into debate on any of the aspects raised about the bank rate or whatever, that might signal to the markets how I was thinking and I have guardedly not done that.</P>
    <P>The Deputy and I served on the Finance and General Affairs Committee and all the meetings concerning this were public, some were held in this Chamber, some were in the Seanad and most were in Kildare House.  People ranging from those who were die-hard opponents of the whole concept to those who were absolute proponents of it were brought before the committee.  We had a wonderful debate on this matter under the Deputy's chairmanship over nearly two and a half years and for most of that time, except for some reasonable coverage at one stage by one national newspaper, we might as well have been speaking to ourselves.  As the Deputy pointed out when he was chairman, despite our best efforts, we found it amusing, if nothing else, to read commentary in newspapers that Irish politicians were not concentrating on this matter.  Those same newspapers did not cover any of the excellent work done by that committee on this area.  EMU took up more of the time of the Financial and General Affairs Committee than any other topic.  I am already on record inside and outside the House for complimenting Deputy Mitchell in that regard.  A reading of the Official Report of those committee meetings will reveal the wide range of opinion on the issue.  I and others found it a great learning experience.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe commented on inflation and on the security of the banking system.  He raised the issue as to how legislation relating to depositors' money in other banks would be covered by the Central Bank.  That does not come under the scope of this Bill, but there are very adequate powers of regulation and supervision and we comply fully with EU directives and best international practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made interesting comments about dormant accounts.  He tabled some parliamentary questions on this since I came into office and other Deputies also have an interest in this area.  I said in reply to those questions that there were difficulties involved.  This subject has also <Col N="937" /> interested me for some time and I have not let the matter rest.  This would create great difficulties in that it would involve an inordinate amount of work for some institutions, but there is a good deal of sense in what the Deputy said.  From my background in finance I can readily identify with some of the examples he gave.  This matter is not an immediate priority for me, but I will not let it wither away given the various reports done by outside institutions in co-operation with the Department of Finance.  I take this opportunity to say I will investigate this matter further during my term of office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright said that according to his information France and Germany are buying gold, but my information is they are selling it because the price of it is falling.  In any event gold is a very minor element in the Central Bank's balance sheet.  In Irish terms out of £5.446 billion it represented £76 million at the end of 1996.  The amount of gold held by the Central Bank as part of its reserves is a fraction of 1 per cent.  In Irish terms gold is not the problem.  The role of gold in the reserves of the European Central Bank is being considered by the Economic and Monetary Institute.  This question will ultimately be a matter for the European Central Bank.  Deputy Enright also made a case about the Irish pound <i>vis-a -vis</i> sterling and I dealt with that matter at length during my Second Stage contribution.</P>
    <P>Deputies Enright and Perry raised a number of items related to bank charges.  This may be considered a great example of passing the buck, but under the Consumer Credit Bill which was steered through the Dáil when the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, was spokesperson on that area, the terms and conditions attached to loans and other charges levied by financial institutions for services are regulated by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I do not have any direct statutory role in those matters.  Deputy Perry gave the example of bank charges on a referred cheque for a £30 transaction in a supermarket.  The supermarket was charged £7.50 on its bank statement and the writer of the cheque was charged £7.50. To my knowledge those figures are correct.  He said that such charges would result in an inordinate percentage being taken off of the bottom line of his business in the supermarket area.  However, this is something that can be referred to the Director of Consumer Affairs because under the 1995 Act bank charges come within his remit.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their co-operation.  As pointed out by others, this is an important Bill.  It is not particularly momentous, but the steps on which we are about to embark in joining the monetary union are momentous.  It is the most significant decision taken by an Irish State in a long time.  This Bill is necessary to ensure our Central Bank legislation complies with our new commitments in regard to the euro.  I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cheann Comhairle for selecting this matter for the Adjournment.  It concerns the constituency of Deputy Brendan Smith and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle which will be affected by the closure of this company.  A number of people who worked in Ballinamore Textiles come from County Cavan.</P>
      <P>Ballinamore Textiles has been in operation in Ballinamore for 25 years.  When it was set up it was the flagship of a new renewal in County Leitrim. It came in the wake of the closure of the Dromod to Ballinamore railway line and the area was in a very deprived state 25 years ago.  Since then Ballinamore Textiles has been a major employer in the area and employed up to 160 people when it was at its peak.</P>
      <P>In October last year there were temporary layoffs which became permanent.  On Friday last, 13 February, which I described locally as &ldquo;black Friday&rdquo;, the company announced, without any notice to anybody, that it proposes to run down the plant over the next eight weeks, making everybody redundant by 10 April.  The company stated its reasons for doing that are loss of market share and high production costs.  I cannot agree with them, mainly because across the Border the same group of companies are reportedly expanding.  I am concerned about whether those jobs are being merely transferred from one plant to another.</P>
      <P>We would all sympathise with the workers who have lost their jobs, but sympathy is not of great use to anybody.  They want to know what the Government can do to find alternative employment for them in the area.</P>
      <P>There are suggestions of a possible takeover of the plant and I understand the former owners are willing to discuss this with anybody.  A special package should be provided via the IDA or Forbairt to make it attractive for a replacement industry to take up the premises occupied by Ballinamore Textiles.  It has a number of advantages, including a fully trained workforce available to it, with 25 years' experience in the textile industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, is unable to attend the House this evening.  I <Col N="939" /> am delighted that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is taking this debate on the Tánaiste's behalf.  Will the Minister convey to her Cabinet colleague the need for priority to be given to finding an alternative industry to replace jobs in an area which has suffered badly in recent times?</P>
    <P>Prior to the setting up of Masonite, Ballinamore Textiles was the biggest employer in County Leitrim.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to use their full influence, as we will be doing at local level, to persuade the IDA and Forbairt to put a rescue package in place for the jobs and, hopefully, to find an alternative entrepreneur to take over the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for raising this matter.  As he said, the Tánaiste is unable to be here, but she has asked me to represent her and the Cabinet in answering the matter.  She has already indicated her concerns about the closure of Ballinamore Textiles in a written reply to Deputy Brendan Smith earlier today.</P>
      <P>The loss of 106 jobs is a serious setback for Ballinamore and the surrounding area.  I fully sympathise with local people but, as Deputy Ellis said, sympathy is not enough.  The loss of 106 jobs in an area the size of Ballinamore has enormous implications when it is placed in context.</P>
      <P>Ballinamore Textiles Limited was established in 1972 by Cooneen Textiles of Northern Ireland. Up to late last year the company, which manufactures children's clothing, had sold virtually all its output to its parent company, which in turn supplied various multiple stores.  Intense competition put great pressure on the Irish operation and, as a result, Ballinamore Textiles had to reduce its levels of projected sales.  The question of lay offs was raised in the House by Deputy Ellis and everyone hoped they would be only temporary. Sadly, however, that was not to be the case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ellis may recall that last October, in response to questions raised by him and Deputy Brendan Smith, the Tánaiste asked IDA Ireland to actively assist Ballinamore in identifying new market outlets.  While the company did win new orders, it appears they were not sufficient to ensure its future viability.</P>
      <P>In a recent press statement, the company referred to these efforts and indicated that as it had only limited access to finance it was left with no option but to bow to market forces. Employees will be made redundant on a phased basis over the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Friday, when it was learned that the company intended to cease operations, IDA Ireland was immediately asked by the Tánaiste to liaise with other development agencies and FÁS in efforts to secure alternative employment opportunities for the Ballinamore workforce.  The IDA and Forbairt have already contacted a number of clothing companies regarding the possibility of locating in Ballinamore.  The IDA will meet the <Col N="940" /> management of Ballinamore Textiles shortly to ascertain the company's plans for the premises.</P>
    <P>As well as actively exploring the possibility of finding a new clothing operation, the development agencies are also vigorously pursuing other industrial opportunities for the Ballinamore area. They will meet the company's management and make every endeavour to locate employees in other industries.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, the textile industry is a difficult and competitive one in which to operate and that has always been the case.  The increasing use of technology has made it even more competitive. Deputy Ellis said he wants every effort made through the offices of the Tánaiste and the Cabinet to find a replacement industry for Ballinamore. I will certainly convey his concerns to the Tánaiste when I raise the matter with her in Cabinet early next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that very much. On Friday last, 13 February, the liquidation of a Dublin air freight company, EI Air Exports, caused the suspension of the daily passenger air service between Donegal International Airport at Carrickfin and Dublin.  This service was operated by Ireland Airways, a subsidiary of the aforementioned company.  It was approved under a three year tender contract between the Department of Public Enterprise and the EU's essential air service programme.</P>
      <P>Since its start up a little over a year ago, the Donegal to Dublin route has generated over 11,000 airline passengers.  This is a remarkable achievement considering that both the airline and the route were new to the travel and aviation industry.  Against this background the directors and staff of Donegal International Airport, Carrickfin, have &mdash; through their own tourism promotional activities and in association County Donegal Tourism, the North West Tourism Organisation and Bord Fáilte &mdash; worked hard to establish the market and get the message across to business and tourism interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ease of access to County Donegal provided by the airline services opened new opportunities for investment and industrial development.  The airline service between Donegal and Dublin has made a huge difference.  It offered great relief to people making hospital visits for specialised treatments from the North Western Health Board area, shortening their journey time to Dublin in <Col N="941" /> comfort.  For the first time, local industrialists were able to invite customers and suppliers to visit Donegal-based manufacturing plants, which had for long been seen as too distant and difficult to visit.  Companies thereby secured new export orders and increased employment in many Donegal and Gaeltacht companies.  New investors have agreed to set up business through Údarás na Gaeltachta because of the easier access gained through using the airline services.</P>
    <P>It is a major disappointment to lose such services, particularly at a time when traffic growth was being sustained and the viability of the service was supported under the PSO arrangements with the Department.  I am aware that the PSO routes to Galway, Kerry and Sligo &mdash; which Aer Lingus operates under similar EU essential air service tenders &mdash; are due for renewal.</P>
    <P>Why is Donegal out on a limb as Aer Lingus operates such routes from Dublin every day? Why can Donegal not receive the same service support?  Kerry and Galway have three flights daily.  With no railway station or proper road access, the airport at Carrickfin has made a huge contribution to the business community.  The air journey to Donegal from Dublin is a little over 45 minutes, 65 minutes from London and two hours from Brussels.  Given proper support, the airport will enable the county to compete nationally and internationally for more tourism growth and inward investment.</P>
    <P>If action is not taken swiftly, opportunities for Donegal will continue to decline further.  We need a speedy resolution to the problems caused by the demise of EI Air Exports.  The area can and will prosper even more with the support of the national and international marketing reputation that Aer Lingus provides elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>Ireland Airways, or any other option, cannot provide the necessary international focus and product distribution.  The other regional airports all began such services over ten years ago.  There is no reason Donegal cannot develop to at least one service daily to meet some of the regional distribution of visitor numbers and investment as demanded by Government policy.  The people of Donegal deserve a favourable decision and an immediate airline replacement must be found to continue the success achieved by Ireland Airways until other more suitable and permanent arrangements are agreed.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scor ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire gach dícheall a dhéanamh le seirbhís eile a chur ar fáil gan mhoill in ionad an tseirbhís atá ag dul chun críoch.  Tá sé an-tábhachtach, ní hamhain do mhuintir Dhún na nGall, dosna tionsclóirí, don fhorbairt tionsclaíochta agus turasóireachta, ach dosna hothair a thagann ó Dhún na nGall go Baile Átha Cliath faoi choinne cóir leigheasa a shá isteach san otharlann ann.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for allowing me some minutes to emphasise and support the plea of the constituency of Donegal <Col N="942" /> South-West for a return of the service which, unfortunately, it lost last Friday.  Donegal International Airport has developed over the past number of years not only with the support of Donegal County Council and Údarás na Gaeltachta but also with the support of those who live in Gaeltacht areas and the industrial base there. It is vital this link is restored.  I cannot emphasise enough to the Minister the absolute necessity to deal with the matter immediately and prior to any more permanent decisions being made about the route.  It is an essential air service and it is also used by many unfortunate patients who must come to Dublin for medical assistance.  It is vital the service is returned as we approach the beginning of the tourism season, something on which we are very dependent in south Donegal.  I hope the Minister can make a temporary solution until there is a more permanent option and the return of the daily return flight from Donegal to Dublin. We had hoped to be developing and increasing the flights from Dublin to Donegal in the next few years.  I hope every effort will be made to find an alternative airline to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McGinley, my colleague, Deputy Coughlan, Pat Gallagher, MEP, who was in touch with me over the past few days, and Deputy Gildea, who contacted me by telephone. I am glad to be able to respond to the debate.</P>
      <P>I met a deputation from Donegal Airport led by Pat Gallagher, MEP, shortly before Christmas. There was a great fear about this company operating the air service to and from Donegal.  I concur with everything said about fast and frequent access to the regions.  It is as important for domestic business and foreign-owned firms as it is for tourists.  It is especially important for Donegal. I visited Carrickfin airport when I was in Donegal two years ago.  I was amazed by the lovely building, the way it was kept and the obvious enthusiasm of those who worked in it. There is a clear necessity for it as it is situated in and serves a vast region.</P>
      <P>State-subvented air services started in 1995 and these are regulated by a European Council regulation which provides for the attaching of public service obligations to scheduled air services.  The competitive tenders process began in 1996 and the Dublin-Donegal air route was awarded to Air Exports Ltd., based at Dublin Airport.  The service commenced in August 1996.  Last week, the High Court appointed a provisional liquidator following a petition by the Revenue Commissioners. The company has ceased operations and can no longer provide a service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any part of Ireland needs an Exchequer subvented air service, it is the north west.  No rail services link Donegal to Dublin and the road journey takes between five and six hours.  The air service introduced in 1996 was warmly welcomed and 21,000 passengers were carried on the route in 1997.  The delegation I met told me that numbers <Col N="943" /> were holding up even in winter.  Therefore, they wanted the continuation of the service guaranteed.</P>
    <P>To secure a carrier for the route, it is necessary to arrange for a formal competition to comply with the European directive and the route would be advertised in the European Union Official Journal to see if air carriers are interested.  Before that is done, an immediate replacement must be secured.  If the route is left vacant, business will decline.  I asked my Department to secure a replacement carrier for the route on an interim basis as quickly as possible until a formal competition is arranged.  We invited bids from interested air carriers before close of business tomorrow, Friday, 20 February for the operation of the route up to the end of 1998 pending holding the competition. Those bids will be submitted by tomorrow evening and, in advance of that, my Department has already been in touch with interested carriers. Two firm competitive bids have been submitted and others have until tomorrow to respond to it.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring the service will be operable within a week and I hope earlier, pending clearance and related matters.  I am concerned the route is reactivated as quickly as possible.  It is hoped to have it operable within a week and I do not believe I am being over optimistic in saying that.  Whoever is chosen will be quizzed to ensure they are ready for &ldquo;take off&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for permitting me to raise this issue.</P>
      <P>Portarlington swimming pool opened in 1974, some 25 years ago.  Since then it has received no funding from the State.  It is run by a most efficient and competent group of local people and it is non-profit making.  As it has received no funding since it opened, it is important that funding is now provided to upgrade and improve the pool.  Grants of up to 100 per cent are available from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the refurbishment of existing pools, provided the proposed works comply with the standards laid down in the Department's procedures for the planning approval and financing of swimming pools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pool is run by a private organisation so any work it submits to the Department of the Environment and Local Government must be approved by the local authority, Laois County Council.  The council is happy to approve the work and it will make a submission in the next two weeks showing its support for the proposal The local swimming pool committee submitted grant applications for re-roofing of the pool and renovation of the office and dressing room area some considerable time ago.  The pool requires re-roofing and a two-story office.  Once the two-story office is built, the existing office space can be used to enlarge the two dressing rooms.  They also propose to provide ten <Col N="944" /> showers in a semicircle on the pool bank.  Further works proposed are a steam room and a jacuzzi, all of which are essential in a town of that size with an increasing population.</P>
    <P>The pool measures 25 metres by nine metres and its depth is one metre to two metres.  The pool is open for nine months of the year and the cost of running it each year for the past few years has been £96,000.  There is quite a sizeable staff attached to the pool, including a manager, two permanent lifeguards and temporary lifeguards, and swimming instructors.  At one time there were 13 people employed at the pool.  It is a wonderful facility for people of all age groups and particularly young people.  They need the money to be provided at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, wrote to me outlining the fact that the 1998 allocation for swimming pool projects has been increased to £4 million but that the money for 1998 had been allocated and the money for 1999 is also largely committed.  Previously we had problems in Birr, Clara and Edenderry and the then Minister provided funding for those towns.  In this instance a strong case will be made by Laois County Council and by the local swimming pool committee.  I am certain that all the local public representatives will be anxious that this issue be treated as one of priority.</P>
    <P>Laois County Council are in the final stages of submitting plans to the Department.  The Department should have them within the next two weeks.  This area has received no funding for a long time.  The committee is an excellent one and it is in the interests of everyone that the Department be seen to support this proposal. I highly commend it and congratulate the local voluntary committee on their efforts to date in providing such an amenity in their town. It is wonderful to see people working so hard for their local community.  The Department can show its support and goodwill by supporting this proposal.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is unable to be here this afternoon and he has asked me to reply on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Portarlington swimming pool was opened in 1974, jointly financed by Portarlington Swimming Pool Association, Laois and Offaly County Councils and the Department of the Environment. The local association has been running the pool since then with some assistance from Laois County Council by way of a full subsidy on rates and water charges, together with the provision of chlorine for the pool.  I understand that the association has spent a considerable amount of money over recent years in replacing the filter and heating systems, refurbishing the dressing rooms and providing an energy saving cover for the pool. <Col N="945" /> In August 1996, the swimming pool association applied to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for a grant to re-roof the swimming pool.  They were informed that their application should be re-routed through the county council which fully supports the application.</P>
    <P>Following a visit by the Department's inspector, the county council was asked to submit detailed plans, specifications and a cost estimate for the work involved.  It was also suggested that the existing glazing be fully examined and that consideration be given to reducing the overall area of windows and to installing double glazing throughout the pool building in the interests of heat conservation.  They were also advised to pay close attention to insulation of the roof and to ensure that the overall project specification would comply with the relevant standards set out in the Department's guideline specification for swimming pools and in the building regulations. These plans, specifications etc.  have not yet been received from Laois County Council.  In the meantime a further application has been received from the swimming pool association seeking an additional grant for the reconstruction and upgrading of the office and dressing room areas.</P>
    <P>There is a provision of £4 million in the Department's Estimates for 1998 for the swimming pool programme.  While this represents a significant increase on the 1996 provision of £2 million and the 1997 provision of £3.5 million, it must be made clear that, notwithstanding the increased allocation, the 1998 provision will be largely required to meet expenditure on projects already under construction or which are fully approved and on which work is expected to commence later in the year.  Accordingly, the scope available to release new projects in 1998 is very limited.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the Minister is not in a position, at this stage, to say when a firm financial commitment can be given to the funding of the proposed works at the Portarlington pool.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming here this evening.</P>
      <P>Between 1994 and 1996 there has been a 17 per cent drop in the number of people under 35 running family farms, and there has been a 9 per cent drop in the number of entrants to agricultural colleges in the 1997-98 college year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farm incomes are on average just above £10,000 a year, yet the Government has abandoned installation aid for young farmers.  It was one small financial encouragement which these <Col N="946" /> young courageous people received to take up this difficult profession.</P>
    <P>Young people are given no encouragement to take up full-time employment in farming.  In 1996 the IDA grant-aided 13,319 jobs at a cost of approximately £11,920 per job.  Yet the meagre grant of £5,600 to young farmers was cut and this is a disincentive to young people choosing farming as a career option.  How can the Minister for Agriculture and Food expect young people to choose a career in farming, with its long hours, 365 days a year in all weather, with variable and unstable income and huge overheads over a stable and well paid Government-subsidised industrial job?</P>
    <P>We are reaching a stage where there will be shortages in the agricultural employment sector. This can be seen in rural areas where people are moving to towns and cities to take up well-paid jobs, leaving rural communities without the valuable resource of young people to work the land. More young people are taking up third level courses, except, the certificate in farming course in our agricultural colleges.  For the first time in ten years, these colleges are unable to fill the places on offer.  This is because of the Minister's inability to display confidence in the industry and in young farmers through the provision of installation aid and proper support systems.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil stated in its election manifesto that in Government it would initiate a comprehensive programme of rural development.  Judging from the Minister's actions, it is a programme of rural destruction.  He will be remembered as the man who killed rural Ireland.  I ask him to deliver on his promise and that of the other Fianna Fáil candidates prior to the general election that installation aid would not be abandoned.  Talk is cheap and the Minister now has the opportunity to deliver on this promise on which he reneged following the general election.  It would be a small step in bringing to an end discrimination against young farmers at the hands of previous Governments, but especially this one.  How can the Minister stand over a policy of funding one job to the tune of £11,920 while cutting grant aid for another?</P>
    <P>Teagasc also need to maintain better contact with their green certificate students following completion of their course; it must put in place a discount scheme.  It is a disgrace that it costs £550 for a young person to draw up a REPS plan with no help available.  The enlargement clause in the farm retirement scheme regulations inhibits young people from entering the agricultural industry.  The State will fund a young person to the tune of between £10,000 and £12,000 if he goes to college, yet it will not allocate £5,600 to a farmer.</P>
    <P>Given the current concern about the reform of EU Agenda 2000, the Minister must instil confidence in the industry.  I appeal to him to immediately reintroduce installation aid and bring forward a comprehensive package to support young farmers through grant aid, tax relief and restructuring <Col N="947" /> the farm retirement scheme.  This should include a proper subsidised service provided by Teagasc and other State agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the early 1970s the Government has been involved in initiatives aimed not only at encouraging but also facilitating the early release of land to younger trained farmers.  Direct intervention has revolved around the introduction of the scheme of installation aid for young farmers and, most significantly, the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming. Indirect support facilitating land transfer has been through successive reforms to the tax code.</P>
      <P>The scheme of early retirement from farming was one of the programmes introduced as part of the CAP reform measures following the revision of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992.  The scheme, which was introduced in January 1994, is helping to redress two of the main structural defects in Irish farming, viz.  farm size and the age profile of farmers.  It also provides a generous pension for farmers who retire and hand on their lands to younger farmers, who very often are the family successor.</P>
      <P>The scheme has been a major success and this is reflected in the target of 7,000 participants in 1997, a year ahead of expectation.  At the end of January this year 7,059 farmers had qualified for pensions totalling £66 million annually.  Some 225,000 hectares has been released under the scheme to young trained farmers.  They have achieved an average increase in farm size from 31 hectares to 49 hectares, which is a significant structural improvement.  More than £140 million has been paid to date to retired farmers under the scheme, the average annual pension being £9,370.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The installation aid scheme has been very successful in assisting young farmers embarking on their careers.  Up to the end of last year some 6,400 young farmers had been paid the installation aid grant.  Under the current Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry a total of £17 million was set aside for the SIA scheme.  Due to the level of demand it was necessary to suspend the scheme late last year when 3,500 young farmers <Col N="948" /> had been paid representing a total public contribution of almost £20 million.</P>
      <P>I recognise the importance attached to this scheme by young farmers and am committed not only to meeting all existing valid applications but to the reintroduction of the scheme.  The Minister for Finance provided an additional £3.5 million in the budget to cover applications received up to its suspension.  In addition I have gained agreement to the introduction of a revised and more focused scheme.  Discussions are being held with the various farming organisations on the nature of the new scheme.  There will be a meeting in this regard with Macra Na Féirme next week.  When it is finalised I will approach the European Commission to ensure that the revised scheme is approved as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Indirect support facilitating land transfers has revolved primarily around successive reforms of the tax code.  Changes to the code over the last decade have greatly alleviated the tax burden on the young entrant to farming to the extent that the majority now entering farming do so largely free of any significant tax burden.</P>
      <P>Stamp duty remains the most significant tax burden for the majority of transferees.  Under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> this was reduced to 1 per cent for transfers to young trained farmers.  However stamp duty can still be a heavy burden for some young farmers.  The programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, includes a commitment to abolish this remaining tax burden and I will press to have this implemented as soon as possible.  Furthermore, the changes introduced in the budget in the administration of capital gains tax relief should encourage more farmers to avail of the early retirement scheme and support farm transfers.</P>
      <P>The Government continues to recognise that the provision of incentives to young trained farmers is central to the maintenance of a vibrant rural society and every effort will be made to ensure that the special position of young farmers is taken into account where programmes are being reviewed or new programmes are being submitted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The Government wishes to see an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba.  On 5 November 1997 Ireland, with all our European Union partners, voted in the United Nations General Assembly in favour of a resolution which called for this.  The General Assembly adopted the resolution with 143 votes in favour, three against and 17 abstentions. The US Administration is well aware of Ireland's concerns, and that of our EU partners, about the embargo and its extra-territorial effects.  In this regard, I acknowledge the fact that President Clinton has continued to exercise his power to suspend aspects of the congressional embargo legislation known as the Helms-Burton Act.</P>
      <P>The Pope, in his historic visit to Cuba last month, posed two important challenges: first, to the United States to end its policy of isolation of Cuba; and second to the Cuban authorities, to show willingness to grant full human rights and religious and political freedoms to the Cuban people.  I am glad to see reports that, following the papal visit, a number of prisoners of conscience are to be freed by the Cuban authorities. I hope that these releases, when confirmed, will be a step on the road towards full respect for civil and political rights in Cuba.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's policy is clear and is shared by our EU partners.  On 2 December 1996 Ireland joined the other EU member states in adopting a common position on Cuba.  The essence of the common position is that the EU favours a peaceful transition to democracy and a sustainable recovery and improvement in living standards of the Cuban people, and does not try to bring about change by coercive measures with the effect of <Col N="950" /> increasing hardship.  The EU attaches importance to the Cuban Government's responsibility to ensure full respect for human rights and political freedoms within Cuba.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the implementation of the European Union's common position in December last, the General Affairs Council reiterated that the objective of the European Union towards Cuba remained the encouragement of a process of peaceful transition to pluralist democracy, the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as sustainable economic recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people.</P>

Attacks against, or other mistreatment of, personnel who act on behalf of the United Nations are unjustifiable and unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The current international position is that the Convention is not yet in force and will not enter into force until 30 days after the deposit with the Secretary-General of the instruments of ratification, acceptance or accession of 22 countries.  As of 17 February 1998, 43 states had signed the Convention and 17 states were parties to the Convention.</P>
      <P>It is clear from an examination of the terms of the Convention that domestic legislative measures will have to be enacted to give effect to the provisions of the Convention in Irish law.

      <P>It is not my intention to consider changing the present system for appointing Irish ambassadors. Ambassadors are expected to promote the full range of Irish interests overseas with particular focus on our political and ecomomic interests.  It is, therefore, desirable that they have a wide <Col N="951" /> range of diplomatic experience, a detailed knowledge of all relevant policy areas and an ability to work effectively in a foreign environment.</P>
      <P>I recognise that many Irish people in the private sector, including those in the business community, make a significant contribution to promoting Ireland's interests overseas in their own particular sphere of activity.  There is already close co-operation between such business people and embassies to which I attach considerable importance.  However, I believe that the knowledge and skills necessary to perform effectively the full range of duties as ambassador are best acquired through a career in the foreign service. For this reason, I do not propose to change the practice of successive Irish Governments of selecting for appointment as ambassadors from among our professional diplomats.</P>
      <P>The promotion of Ireland's economic interests abroad is a primary objective of our overseas missions. In this context, I attach the highest importance to effective and focused co-operation between our ambassadors and the agencies with responsibility for promoting our economic interests.  One way in which this co-operation has been achieved in several locations is through the Ireland House concept.  In addition, representatives of An Bord Tráchtála (ABT) are attached to the staff of a number of diplomatic missions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a policy planning and early warning unit for the Common Foreign and Security Policy &mdash; CFSP &mdash; of the EU was agreed in a declaration adopted by the European Council in Amsterdam in June 1997.  The Treaty of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amsterdam will give the Secretary General of the Council a new role as high representative of the CFSP.  Both these changes will come into effect when the treaty enters into force.  It is difficult to anticipate the exact date of the entry into force which will require the completion of ratification procedures by all member states, according to their constitutional requirements.  However, I expect the establishment of the policy planning unit to be complete and the Secretary General of <Col N="952" /> the Council to assume his role of high representative for CFSP on the entry into force of the treaty.</P>
    <P>The declaration on the establishment of the policy planning and early warning unit stipulates that it will be established in the general secretariat of the Council, under the responsibility of its Secretary General, the high representative for the CFSP.  It will consist of personnel drawn from the general secretariat, the member states, the commission and the Western European Union.  The Council of Ministers has already had an initial discussion of the size and structure of the unit and mandated the appropriate bodies to consider these issues further.  It is expected that a report on the outcome of these discussions will be made to the General Affairs Council later this year to allow for initial decisions to be taken in respect of the 1999 budget, in preparation for setting up the policy planning and early warning unit.</P>

      <P>The General Affairs Council has met five times in total since I took office as Minister for Foreign Affairs on 8 October 1997.  Since taking office, I have attended two meetings of the Council, on 10 November and 8 December 1997.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, attended the Council meeting of 24 November.  The General Affairs Council held an additional special meeting in Geneva on 11-12 December which was attended by trade Ministers and entirely devoted to the question of a proposed WTO agreement on financial services. Ireland was represented at that meeting by Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. At the most recent meeting, on 26 January, Ireland was represented by its permanent representative to the European Union.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 60 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government remains firmly of the view that the current four party talks process currently <Col N="953" /> under way, involving the two parts of Korea with the US and China, offers the best prospect for a lasting peace settlement in the Korean peninsula. However, unreasonable demands and extreme positions taken by the North Korean side frequently threaten the success of these talks, the next session of which is due to take place in Geneva in the coming month.</P>
    <P>The serious food shortages which have arisen in North Korea in recent years have implications for the political and economic stability of the entire peninsula.  I am pleased to say, however, that the exceptional effort made by the international community over the past year has been largely successful in averting the threat of famine. In this context, the Government has contributed a total of £815,000 in humanitarian assistance to North Korea so far.</P>
    <P>A technical mission from the Department of Foreign Affairs travelled to North Korea last November to evaluate the impact of humanitarian assistance from Ireland.  Its findings were encouraging in that no evidence of famine was found, although malnutrition and infrastructural collapse did appear to be widespread.  A reduced harvest towards the end of last year means that large amounts of food aid will again be required in 1998.  However, it is also clear that serious structural problems in the agricultural and other sectors of the economy need to be addressed by the Government of North Korea if there is to be a measure of food security in future.</P>
    <P>Due to the positive response of the international community to appeals for assistance in 1997, food supplies should be available until early May of this year.  We are ready to respond to basic humanitarian needs again this year and are awaiting the outcome of the most recent needs assessments being carried out by the UN agencies and the EU.  The Government has no plans to establish diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Korea at present.</P>

      <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium sets out as a key priority Ireland's &ldquo;positive and constructive participation in the further building of Europe, taking account of our own specific traditions and interests&rdquo;.  Ireland's policy of military neutrality is acknowledged and recognised by our EU partners, and is addressed in the Maastricht Treaty which provides that the common foreign and security policy of the European Union &ldquo;shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy <Col N="954" /> of certain Member States.&rdquo;. This provision has been retained in the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
      <P>Following the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, Ireland took up observer status at the Western European Union in the light of the relationship created between the EU and the Western European Union in that treaty.  Ireland's observer status does not in any way compromise our policy of military neutrality.  The Deputy will be aware that our three fellow neutral members of the EU, Austria, Finland and Sweden are, like Ireland, observers at the Western European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has actively supported efforts to modernise and reform the United Nations system so that it can be more effective in responding to the complex and difficult challenges in the coming millennium.  Our priority is to secure agreement on the measures necessary to revitalise the United Nations, and ensure more vigorous action in fulfilling its mandate under the UN Charter of maintaining international peace and security and promoting the economic and social development of all member states.</P>
      <P>In the debate on UN reform at the General Assembly, Ireland and her EU partners have made proposals for financial reform of the UN budget.  These recommend that member state contributions be assessed by a simple, fair and transparent mechanism, based on the principle of capacity to pay, calculated in accordance with <i>per capita</i> GNP.  Under these proposals, the majority of poorer developing countries would pay less to the UN budget.</P>
      <P>With regard to the UN role in the area of economic and social development, the EU, under the recent Irish Presidency, put forward a substantial set of proposals aimed at strengthening the contribution of the UN system in this sector.  It was recommended that the various UN agencies and programmes adopt a more prioritised and better co-ordinated approach in the development area, particularly in the fight to reduce poverty in lesser developed countries.  These proposals also envisaged the establishment of a deputy Secretary-General post with particular responsibility to oversee and direct renewal measures within the UN system in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> In a detailed report presented in July 1997, the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has underlined his commitment to achieving a stronger and more effective UN system.  In his report, which was debated in the recent General Assembly session in New York, he outlined a series of actions to be taken by him to modernise and renew UN structures and programmes, and recommended other reform measures to be agreed by member states.  The General Assembly has given a positive response to his report. Ireland and her EU partners gave full political endorsement to the Secretary-General's report which included many ideas put forward by the EU, including that of the appointment of a deputy Secretary-General post.  In the period ahead Ireland will work closely, in co-operation with our EU partners and other member states, to ensure that the momentum of the UN reform process is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the House that the work programme related to Ireland's official development assistance, ODA, received a significant boost at the beginning of this year as a result of the allocation by the Government, at my request, of the largest ever budgetary provision for ODA. Expenditure on the programme this year is expected to reach £137 million or 0.32 per cent of GNP.  The budget increase will permit not only expansion of the programme but also &mdash; and more importantly &mdash; qualitative change and improvement.  There is a challenge programme of ongoing work related to that process of expansion and improvement.  This relates to all elements of our programme including multilateral assistance; bilateral assistance to the priority countries for Irish aid; and other bilateral assistance.</P>
      <P>In relation to the multilateral component of our co-operation, the allocation for 1998 is £45.958 million, a 17 per cent increase over the level for last year.  Multilateral development issues are regularly discussed at the range of meetings attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, including the General Affairs Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards international meetings held since the beginning of this year, I draw particular attention to the EU-Rio Group ministerial meeting in Panama from 11 to 12 February 1998.  Among the issues discussed at this meeting were sustainable development and the reform of the United Nations.  Minister Andrews emphasised, on bahalf of Ireland, that the eradication of absolute poverty on a global scale is a precondition for the achievement of sustainable development and that development co-operation policy must continue <Col N="956" /> to play a vital role in bridging the divide between developed and developing countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed our full support for the UN Secretary General's reform programme.  He also noted that the decline in development assistance flows has had a negative impact on discussions on development at the UN and pointed out that Ireland has increased its voluntary contributions to the UN agencies in recent years and is committed to continuing its support.</P>
    <P>There is also an intensive programme of work related to the negotiation of a successor agreement to the Lomé Convention.  The draft mandate for negotiations between the EU and the ACP countries was presented to the Council by the Commission at the end of January.  To assist the Commission in preparation of the draft mandate, the General Affairs Council had a broad ranging debate on the shape of future relations between the EU and ACP countries.  Ireland will continue to work closely with other member states in the General Affairs Council in the coming months in seeking to finalise the mandate in advance of negotiations with ACP countries which are scheduled to begin in September.</P>
    <P>As regards our bilateral assistance, the 1998 allocation for the priority countries programmes is £43 million &mdash; 33 per cent more than the level for last year.  Ireland is now well on the way to becoming a medium-sized donor to the countries concerned.  As befits our changing role, we are increasingly involved in initiatives to reform the overall aid processes in the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>A case in point is the development of a coherent sectoral approach to aid allocation.  This approach, which is in contrast to a piecemeal project-by-project approach, is believed by many observers to be the most promising innovation in relation to aid procedures for many years.  Ireland is playing a leading role, in collaboration with the governments of the countries concerned and other donors, with a view to making a success of this initiative.  I plan to visit Uganda next month for consultations on this and other issues.</P>
    <P>There are also significant developments in relation to the other components of our bilateral assistance.  For example, support for rehabilitation in countries emerging from humanitarian crises has been increased in 1998 in response to continuing needs in countries such as Rwanda and Bosnia-Hercegovina, and to a lesser extent Angola and Somalia.  The focus continues to be on addressing basic needs and building institutional and human resources capacity in divided societies in a manner which is inclusive.</P>
    <P>New guidelines aimed at strengthening the partnership with non-governmental organisations were introduced in 1997 on a pilot basis.  Based on experience with their implementation, revisions are currently taking place in consultation with NGOs with a view to enhancing their effectiveness and consolidating the partnership.</P>
    <P>In addition to the human rights and democratisation focus within the individual priority country programmes, there has been a sizable <Col N="957" /> increase in the separate budget heading for support for human rights projects in other countries from £0.868 million in 1997 to £1.25 million this year.  This substantial increase will enable us to expand our activities in this area and to undertake specific initiatives related to the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>As I am sure the House will appreciate, my comments today can provide only a flavour of the substantial programme of work related to the Irish Aid programme.  I am sure the House will agree, however, that the developments referred to are indicative of substantial progress in relation to our aid policy and programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The entire island of New Guinea, which is shared by Irian Jaya-West Papua and Papua New Guinea, has been severely affected by the El Nino phenomenon.  No significant rainfall has occurred on the island since April 1997.  Those problems were aggravated in the western part of the island in late 1997 by forest fires.  In common with other areas of Indonesia, fires were started by local farmers in Irian Jaya-West Papua to clear land in the expectation that the rains would extinguish them.  I understand that the fires have restricted access to many areas and have, in addition, prevented vulnerable people from seeking food in the nearby forests.</P>
      <P>UN assessments in late 1997 indicated that at least 500,000 people throughout New Guinea, around 10 per cent of the population, were suffering malnourishment.  In response to this situation, the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA) issued an emergency appeal for the worst affected areas.  The Government responded to this appeal by making an immediate allocation of £50,000 for emergency humanitarian relief to the island of New Guinea.  The grant was divided equally between those most in need in Irian Jaya-West Papua and Papua New Guinea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since that time, UNDHA has been providing relief supplies, medical assistance and transport throughout the island using light aircraft to distribute supplies to remote areas.  The Government of Indonesia has provided air transport for <Col N="958" /> the delivery of food to the main airport in Irian Jaya.  Distribution to the worst affected regions, which are among the most inaccessible in the world, is being carried out by UN personnel on the ground.  I understand that the operation, which is also financed by the governments of Australia, New Zealand, Britain and Norway, has been going well.  Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs remain in close contact with the officials in UNDHA and receive regular updates on the progress of the project.</P>
    <P>As I have made clear, both in my reply to Deputy Connaughton's question on the subject of Irian Jaya-West Papua of 11 December 1997 and to Deputy Spring's written questions on the same topic earlier this week, the Government is open to considering allocating further grants to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and to promote food security throughout the island in the coming months.  Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs are in touch with international organisations (including the International Committee of the Red Cross) and with NGOs operating on the ground.</P>
    <P>With regard to actions taken by the European Union, I understand that the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) has provided a grant of 1.5 million ECU for emergency assistance to Irian Jaya.  One million ECU is being channelled through the Belgian NGO, Medecins Sans Frontiers and 500,000 ECU through the International Committee of the Red Cross.  The grant is being used for emergency water and sanitation supplies and for distribution of food.  I have every confidence that ECHO's implementing partners will be able to carry out their emergency interventions as planned.  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that ECHO, in common with other international donors, routinely carry out monitoring and evaluation missions to countries which benefit from EU humanitarian aid.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 42 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The Government and its EU partners remain gravely concerned about continuing human rights abuses in Nigeria and the delays in the transition to democratic rule in that country.  In our pursuit of these concerns, we are particularly focused on the continued plight of Ogoni and other political detainees and the unacceptable lack of due process in their cases.  In the broader context of human rights in Nigeria, we attach particular significance to the handling of these cases.  With our EU partners, the Government wishes to see the current pattern of political arrests brought to an end and all concerned treated with fairness and justice.  It is our firm view that this can only be achieved with lasting effect in the context of an early restoration of full civilian government with full observance of human rights.</P>
      <P>On 28 November 1987 the EU Council of Development Ministers expressed its grave concern at the numerous human rights violations in Nigeria, including the detention of political prisoners and at the delay in the process of democratisation. The Council also decided, with strong support from Ireland, to extend the EU's common position on Nigeria and its restrictive measures, until 1 November 1998.  The extended EU restrictive measures include, <i>inter alia</i>, an arms embargo, the suspension of military co-operation, visa restrictions on members of the Nigerian military or government and their families, the suspension of all high level visits, and the interruption of sporting contacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to extending these measures, the Council also provided that: after six months, namely, next May, the Union will assess, at Council level, the situation in Nigeria on the basis of a report from the Presidency; and, if elections fail to produce a return to democracy and the rule of law in Nigeria before 1 October 1998, the UN will adopt further measures in addition to those adopted on 4 December 1995.  It is evident from the outcome of the Council on 28 November that Ireland and our European partners are actively monitoring the situation in Nigeria pending the restoration of a credible civilian government and meaningful human rights reform.  The consistently firm position being taken by the European Union is intended to keep the plight of Ogoni and other Nigerian political detainees to the fore.  In taking this course of action we are also particularly concerned about the conduct of the national elections scheduled to be held in Nigeria in August and the approaching official deadline for democratic transition on 1 October.  We are liaising closely with the Commonwealth, the United States and others who have adopted a similarly firm approach to human rights and democratisation issues in that country.  We will be pursuing our concerns at this year's Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights which will review the work of the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Nigeria, Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee.  He <Col N="960" /> been recently appointed as a direct result of a resolution successfully tabled at last year's session by the EU with strong support from Ireland.</P>
    <P>These concerns were also reflected in an EU declaration issued following the arrest of General Diya and others on 21 December.  The EU called on the Nigerian authorities to treat them in accordance with legal principles corresponding to international standards and stressed that the Union would not accept a repetition of the events of 1995 which led to the Ogoni executions.  These developments and the situation in Ongoniland are being monitored closely by the Irish ambasador in Lagos.  The Government will continue to support concerted international action which will lead to an early return to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed, on a number of occasions and most recently on 3 February last, my abhorrence of the use of the death penalty as an instrument of judicial punishment.  I know that sentiment is shared by my fellow Deputies as was reflected in the recent adoption by this House by consensus of a resolution which affirmed that &ldquo;the abolition of the death penalty represents a raising of human dignity and the progressive development of fundamental freedoms&rdquo;.  I welcomed this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has used and will continue to avail of each and every opportunity to press for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide, both within the United Nations and Council of Europe frameworks, in concert with our EU partners.  In this context, I recall some specific actions which have been taken in recent years.  At the UN General assembly in 1994, Ireland was a strong supporter of an Italian draft resolution which called for a global abolition of capital punishment.  Despite the best efforts of our own and like-minded delegations, that resolution was defeated.  However, we did succeed in having a similar resolution adopted at the 53rd session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on 3 April 1997.  On that occasion, we laid particular emphasis on our belief that the death penalty, as a human rights issue, is, therefore, a matter of legitimate concern to the international community in line with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993.  The resolution which was adopted enjoyed wide geographical support and was the first such resolution adopted by the Commission for many years.  At the forthcoming session of the <Col N="961" /> Commission, which commences in Geneva on 16 March next, Ireland will once again be taking a very strong stand in favour of the total, world-wide, abolition of capital punishment.</P>
    <P>Following the adoption by the Commission of a resolution on the death penalty last year, another welcome development was the adoption last October of the Final Declaration of the Second Summit of the Council of Europe Summit by the Heads of State and Governments of all the member states.  This declaration called for the universal abolition of the death penalty and insisted on the maintenance, in the meantime, of existing moratoria on executions in Europe.</P>
    <P>We also welcome the fact that Britain is now in a position to associate itself with its European partners in calling for universal abolition of the death penalty.  This revised British position means that EU démarches and initiatives on this question will have greater impact and will reinforce our common message in support of abolition. Among initiatives in this area in recent months, the EU has expressed its concern about the use of the death penalty in the Republic of Korea, and a démarche was made to the Jamaican Government about its decision to denounce the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for reasons associated with the use of the death penalty in that jurisdiction.  Ireland will continue to endorse such EU initiatives in support of universal abolition of the death penalty and a moratorium on its use.</P>
    <P>Arising from the recent debate in this House on the use of capital punishment in the United States, I will be writing in the very near future to the governors of all US states which have provision for the use of the death penalty on their statute books, asking that they do all in their power to bring this practice to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The percentage of GNP contributed by Ireland on overseas development aid for 1997 and the previous ten years was as follows: 1987, 0.22 per cent; 1988, 0.18 per cent; 1989, 0.17 per cent; 1990, 0.16 per cent; 1991, 0.19 per cent; <Col N="962" /> 1992, 0.16 per cent; 1993, 0.20 per cent; 1994, 0.24 per cent; 1995, 0.28 per cent; 1996, 0.30 per cent; 1997 (Estimated), 0.31 per cent.  The percentage of GNP spent on ODA in 1998 is expected to be equivalent to 0.32 per cent of estimated GNP.</P>
    <P>The resources available for official development assistance &mdash; ODA &mdash; have increased significantly in recent years.  Between 1992 and 1997, the budget has increased from £40 million to £122 million &mdash; a three-fold increase. Expressed as a percentage of GNP, the growth has been from 0.16 per cent to 0.31 per cent. Relative to other donors, the Irish performance as a percentage of GNP has increased from less than half the average of all donors in 1992 to a position of exceeding the donor average.  The Government is committed to maintaining a rapid rate of growth of ODA with a view to reaching 0.45 per cent of GNP by the year 2002. This target is an interim step on the way to reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    <P>The budgetary expansion in the ODA programme has facilitated a qualitative change and an improvement in our approach.  The increases in the budget have enabled us to focus on the objectives of poverty reduction and addressing basic human needs such as food security, basic education, primary health care and a safe water supply in our priority countries of Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.</P>
    <P>The composition of the Irish Aid programme, therefore, reflects our objectives of: reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development in some of the poorest countries in the world; establishing and maintaining peace in developing countries by strengthening democracy, respect for human rights, gender and social equality; protecting the environment and providing a humanitarian response to natural and man-made disasters and initiating measures to prevent impending emergencies, and building civil society and social solidarity.</P>
    <P>The Irish Aid programme reflects these principles. A special programme on human rights has been established and has grown rapidly to £1.25 million this year.  The list of priority countries for Irish bilateral assistance has been extended to include some of the world's poorest countries with the addition of Mozambique in 1996.  Collaboration with non-governmental organisations has expanded and now accounts for some 15 per cent of the total ODA budget.  Our participation in multilateral assistance is pursued actively and reflects the same principles as those which underpin our bilateral programme.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured that the Government is committed to providing adequate resources for the ODA budget and that every effort will be made to ensure that our operational activities are of the highest possible standard.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Australia is one of those countries which have recognised Indonesia's annexation of East Timor.  Mr. Downer and I were in agreement, however, that the human rights situation in the territory continues to give rise to great concern.  In the course of our discussions, I asked Mr. Downer to use his considerable influence with the Indonesian authorities to urge that human rights abuses there be brought to an end.  He assured me that the Australian Government would continue to do so at every suitable opportunity.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the editorial Mental Health and Ethnicity: An Irish Dimension in the February 1998 issue of the <i>British Journal of Psychiatry.</i></P>
      <P>The contents of the editorial are disturbing.  In summary, it states that considerable evidence exists that Irish people in England suffer higher mortality rates and higher incidences of physical and mental ill-health than either English people or any other ethnic group.</P>
      <P>In June, 1996 the <i>British Medical Journal</i> published the findings of a study on Patterns of Mortality in second generation Irish living in England and Wales, the results of which also were a cause for concern.  In light of that study a Government grant of £10,000 from the Vote for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was given at the end of 1996 in support of research into health issues affecting middle-aged Irish men in Britain being carried out by the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain and Middlesex University. The Dion Committee, through which Government grant assistance &mdash; £613,000 in 1998 &mdash; is given annually to Irish immigrant welfare organisations in Britain, is monitoring the progress of that project and will also look at the need for further research into health issues affecting the Irish communitiy in Britain in the context of applications for grant assistance in the current year.</P>
      <P>Issues affecting Irish emigrants are monitored by an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Departments and Government agencies with responsibility for matters relating to emigrants and emigration are represented on the committee.  I have asked the committee to consider the issues raised by the study published in 1996 and by this latest study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Children are amongst the most vulnerable members of society and their rights need special protection.  The near universal ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child demonstrates international acceptance of the need to give special emphasis to children's rights.  But despite the commitments entered into by almost <Col N="965" /> all countries, the lives of millions of children around the world, including in Latin America, are ruined by human rights violations ranging from simple neglect to acts of extreme violence.  Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, governments have a responsibility to provide a framework of laws and administrative measures to protect children's rights.</P>
      <P>Political instability in parts of Latin America, although greatly diminished in recent years, has left a legacy of continuing and unresolved problems, including human rights violations, poverty, deprivation and crime.  There are compelling reports that in some cases, death squads have murdered and tortured street children.  There is a need to put an end to the impunity often enjoyed by human rights violators and to establish effective mechanisms for independent investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the violations of the human rights of children.  There is a widespread international view, which Ireland shares, that all responsible for such harrowing crimes against children should be brought to justice, no matter where these crimes occur.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights will have before it an agenda item on the rights of the child.  I can assure the Deputy that the concerns he has referred to will be raised by Ireland at the session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, 1998 is a most significant year in the international human rights calendar because of the 50th Anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Accordingly, all UN member states have been called upon to commemorate the anniversary in a fitting manner.  The human rights unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs is co-ordinating, through the standing interdepartmental committee on human rights and in co-operation with the joint Department of Foreign Affairs-NGO standing committee on human rights, a number of events to mark this anniversary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a national level, a number of possibilities are being examined.  Some of them fall within the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs but the majority would be the responsibility of other Departments; for example, raising awareness of the declaration in schools would fall to the Department of Education and Science.  The following are among the activities being considered: to hold a debate in the House on human rights at a suitable date in the course of the year; the human rights and democratisation programme administered by the development co-operation division in the Department of Foreign Affairs may be in a position to fund projects with a link <Col N="966" /> to the anniversary; an NGO forum on human rights, sponsored by the Department of Foreign Affairs is scheduled for 7 March, 1998 &mdash; this forum is open to all NGOs active in the field of human rights and is being held in advance of the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva; the NGOs will, therefore, have an opportunity to put forward their views on the agenda of this major international human rights meeting to Government representatives: a project linking the 1798 commemoration and the 50th anniversary which is being explored with the Department of the Taoiseach; An Post has agreed to issue a commemorative postage stamp; the question of a mail-shot to school is being examined; representatives of the human rights unit have met the curriculum development unit to look at the question of education and human rights awareness in general &mdash; we hope to advance these discussions to a decision-making point in the course of 1998.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, also be Irish participation in events at UN level, particularly during the aforementioned UN Commission on Human Rights, which begins its 54th session in Geneva on 16 March next, and during the 53rd session of the UN Third Committee in New York.</P>
    <P>The anniversary will also be commemorated at EU level.  Indeed, to mark the beginning of the anniversary year on 10 December last, the European Council issued a statement which confirmed the commitment of the European Union to respect and defend the rights of all human beings as set out in the text of the universal declaration. The statement was very much a reaffirmation of the Union's dedication to human rights in which the Council stressed the universal nature of human rights and reiterated the obligation incumbent on all states to develop and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, regardless of race, gender, language or religion.  While noting the progress made in this area since the adoption of the declaration, the Council deplored the continuing flagrant violations of human rights in all parts of the world and called on all states to set up their efforts to promote and protect these rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to which the Deputy refers concerns the imposition of an advance notice requirement of 14 days, where reasonably practicable, for protest meetings.  This measure was introduced on Report Stage of the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill in the House of Commons on 5 February last and was agreed.  I understand that the Bill has now completed all parliamentary stages and is awaiting signature into law.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced of the rationale for imposing an advance notice requirement on protest meetings and the Government's reservations in this regard have been conveyed through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the legislation is to establish a Parades Commission on a statutory basis. The Government has broadly welcomed the establishment of a Parades Commission with determining powers as recommended in the North review of parades and marches.  I do not underestimate the difficult task facing the commission. To succeed, it must acquire the confidence of both communities in Northern Ireland and must be seen to be fair and impartial in carrying out its functions.</P>
      <P>The Government hopes that this year the people of Northern Ireland will not have to suffer the trauma which has accompanied recent marching seasons.  A balance must be struck between the rights of those who wish to march and the equally valid rights of the community in the area through which they seek to march.  The Government continues to believe that accommodations on contentious parades can best be achieved through local dialogue and agreement, based on mutual respect and the accommodation of the respective rights and heritage of both traditions.</P>

      <P>I refer Deputies to the answer given to priority questions and on the current Iraqi crisis in which I outlined the position of the Government.  It is of the utmost importance that all possible steps should be taken to find a peaceful solution to this problem.  We welcome the efforts of UN Secretary General Annan and strongly support him in the mission he is undertaking to Baghdad.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's view that the best means of resolving the current impasse should be found under the aegis of the Security Council through diplomatic means.  Representatives of international bodies and governments including France, the Russian Federation and Turkey as well as the Arab League have been pursuing initiatives in this regard.  I take this opportunity to express my appreciation for these efforts and to encourage them to continue their endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prevention of war is now the primary focus of attention for the members of the Security Council.  Although Ireland is not a member, our mission to the United Nations has been actively <Col N="969" /> monitoring all discussions by the Security Council. Contact with the United States is being maintained and I am confident that the United States is aware of our position in this matter.</P>
    <P>In my opinion none of the existing Security Council resolutions unambiguously authorises military action in the present context.  It would be most desirable, accordingly, that any state wishing to carry out such action revert to the Council for such authorisation.</P>
    <P>As regards the seeking of permission for military aircraft to land in Ireland or to overfly Irish airspace in the event of conflict, no such request has been received and accordingly no decision has been made in this connection.  Any such request would be considered in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time.</P>

      <P>The additional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine on the prohibition of the cloning of human beings was opened for signature in Paris on 12 January 1998. The protocol prohibits &ldquo;any intervention seeking to create a human being genetically identical to another human being, whether living or dead&rdquo;. The protocol stipulates that states must provide in their legislation for penalties in cases of infringement of the protocol.  To date the protocol has been signed by 19 of the 40 member states of the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>The protocol is open for signature only to those states which have signed the convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.  Ireland is not a signatory to the actual convention and we are therefore not in a posiiton to sign the additional protocol.  The question of whether Ireland should become a party to the convention and its additional protocol is a matter primarily for the Department of Health and Children.  I understand that there are difficulties with some articles which have implications for the destruction of embryos.  The Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine was opened for signature in April 1997 and has to date been signed by 22 member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is supportive of measures presently being taken at a number of international fora to prohibit the cloning of human beings.  In particular, <Col N="970" /> Ireland supported the decision of Heads of State and Government, meeting at the Second Summit of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on 10-11 October 1997 &ldquo;to prohibit all use of cloning techniques aimed at creating genetically identical human beings&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I remain concerned at the current human rights situation in Turkey.  As the recent European Council in Luxembourg recalled, the strengthening of links between Turkey and the European Union depends on Turkey's pursuit of the political and economic reforms on which it has embarked, including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in force in the European Union.  We will continue to encourage the Turkish Government to make progress in this regard.</P>
      <P>The recent decision of the Turkish Constitutional Court to order the closure of the Welfare Party, to which the Deputy refers, is a matter of deep regret.  The decision also excludes certain members of that party, including its leader and former Prime Minister Mr. Necmettin Erbakan, from being members of the Turkish Parliament and from engaging in further political activity for five years.</P>
      <P>The action of the Constitutional Court clearly raises concerns at the implication of its decision for democratic pluralism and freedom of expression in Turkey.  Ireland, along with her partners in the European Union, hopes that the Government of Turkey will make clear its continuing commitment to these fundamental democratic principles.</P>

      <P>The Russian Federation has not submitted an application to accede to membership of the European Union and this question has not therefore arisen for consideration.  The contractual basis for the Russian Federation's relations with the European Union is the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement &mdash; PCA &mdash; which entered into force on 1 December 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland attaches importance to the successful development of EU-Russia relations and supports efforts to establish a substantial and sound partnership with Russia.  In this regard, the full <Col N="971" /> integration of Russia into the international community and support for Russia's economic and political reforms remain the fundamentals of EU policy relating to the Russian Federation.</P>
    <P>The first meeting of the EU-Russia Co-operation Council under the PCA, which was held <i>en marge</i> of the General Affairs Council on 26-27 January 1998, represented a decisive step forward in our relations with Russia.  The PCA reflects the importance which the European Union attaches to its relations with the Russian Federation as a key partner for the promotion of peace and security and it marks the path for Russia's return to economic Europe as an equal partner.</P>

      <P>As the Tánaiste pointed out in reply to a question on 11 December 1997, the Foreign Earning Committee, which is chaired by the Minister of State Deputy Tom Kitt and which has representation from the Department of Foreign Affairs, includes in its remit the examination of opportunities for the consolidation, wherever possible, of our overseas diplomatic, commercial and consular offices into Ireland Houses so as to ensure the most effective use of available resources.</P>
      <P>There is now consolidated representation involving diplomatic missions and one or more agencies in New York, Tokyo, Moscow, Riyadh, Beijing, Prague, Budapest, Warsaw, Helsinki, Seoul, and Kuala Lumpur.  I was pleased to perform the opening in October, 1997, of the latest Ireland House in Madrid, which incorporates the Embassy, An Bord Trachtála, Bord Fáilte, BIM and An Bord Bia.  It should also be noted that there is consolidated representation involving some or all agencies, but not Embassies, in locations such as London, Paris, Dusseldorf and Milan.</P>
      <P>The possibility of expanding the Ireland House concept to other locations is being kept under review in liaison with the State agencies through the Foreign Earnings Committee.  Any such arrangements must naturally be shown to be both cost effective and conducive to the more effective representation of Ireland's interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The Government believe that the problem of policing in Northern Ireland is one of the crucial issues to be addressed by the current talks process. The creation of a policing service, wholeheartedly supported by all sections of the community, must be an essential goal of that process. For a police service to secure and enjoy crosscommunity support, it must reflect the communities it serves in its composition, identity and ethos, and must accord equal esteem to the Nationalist and Unionist identities.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of proposals from the British Government in recent years which have addressed managerial and other improvements to policing structures in Northern Ireland. They focus primarily on changes to the existing tri-partite structure of policing, that is the relationship between the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Chief Constable of the RUC and the Policy Authority for Northern Ireland.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mo Mowlam, published a consultation paper on 9 February 1998, entitled, &ldquo;Your Voice, Your Choice &mdash; Community and Police Partnership&rdquo;, which put forward various options for deciding the future composition of the Policy Authority.  The Police Bill currently before the House of Commons is also part of this approach.</P>
      <P>While these proposals from the British Government are welcome in so far as they contribute to the general debate on policing, they do not address the fundamental issues I have referred to and should not in any way pre-empt discussions on policing in the talks process.  The Government has emphasised this point in our representations to the British Government within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  I would note that, in her introduction to the recent consultation paper, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland states that: &ldquo;the improvements to the policing of Northern Ireland the Government will introduce in the current Police Bill do not pre-empt the all-party talks process which is currently under way&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Government looks forward to all the parties in the talks process addressing the problem of policing with the seriousness and attention it requires.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the curtailment of the civil rights of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi whose National League for Democracy party won 82 per cent of the vote in the 1990 parliamentary elections in Burma.  Although her house arrest was formally ended in 1995, her freedom of movement, association and expression continues to be severely restricted by military roadblocks around her residence and by other measures.  The case of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi has been raised both with the Burmese authorities and at appropriate international fora on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>On 28 October 1996, the European Union adopted a Common Position on Burma-Myanmar which currently remains in force.  In accordance with this, the EU has placed an embargo on all arms, munitions and military equipment to Burma and suspended all non-humaniatarian aid or development projects.  In addition, all Burmese military personnel attached to diplomatic missions in the EU have been expelled, visa restrictions against members of the governing regime put in place and high-level bilateral visits to Burma suspended.</P>
      <P>The EU Common Position is directed at the absence of progress towards democratisation and at the continuing violation of human rights in Burma.  All members states of the EU are committed to doing all in their power to persuade the Burmese authorities to meet the conditions called for in the Common Position.  Likewise, at the United Nations, the General Assembly has unanimously called for an improvement in the human rights situation in Burma.</P>
      <P>The Government will avail of every opportunity to press on the Burmese authorities the urgent need to address human rights abuses in their country.</P>

      <P>Our recognition of the importance of those links has been shown in recent years by the appointment of an Honorary Consul in St. John's, Newfoundland, the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding in 1996 with the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador on economic and cultural matters, and the exchange of ministerial visits at the highest level.</P>
      <P>In addition our Ambassador to Canada regularly visits Newfoundland not only to support and promote our interests but to foster the embassy's very good relations with the many people there of Irish birth and descent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland, together with EU partners, has been seriously concerned at developments in Belarus since President Lukashenko effectively abrogated the separation of powers in a controversial referendum in November 1996.  While anxious to avoid isolating Belarus, the international community, including the EU, the OSCE, and the Council of Europe, has been working to encourage the Lukashenko regime to abide by international standards of democracy and the rule of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acting on a proposal from Ireland, the EU sent a fact-finding mission to Belarus in Janaury 1997. The mission, which included OSCE and Council of Europe representatives, was highly critical of <Col N="975" /> the situation there and, particularly, of the almost complete absence of separation of powers.  Subsequent efforts to work constructively with the Belorussian authorities to overcome the democratic deficit were unsuccessful.  In the light of this impasse the General Affairs Council on 15 September 1997 reaffirmed that, while it did not wish to isolate Belarus, the failure to implement reforms would have negative effects on relations with the EU, including the non-conclusion of the Partnership and Co-operation and Interim Agreements, withdrawal of support for the Belorussian application to join the Council of Europe, restrictions on ministerial level contacts, and the suspension of technical aid programmes with the exception of those designed to assist in the reform process.</P>
    <P>However, in spite of the strong pressure from the EU and other international bodies, negative developments in the area of democracy and human rights continued to take place.  Over the past year these have included the arbitrary arrest of demonstrators and members of the opposition in April, the introduction of restrictive measures on lawyers and notaries in July, the application of strict new conditions on the accredition of foreign journalists also in July, and the closure of the leading independent newspaper, Svaboda, in November.</P>
    <P>Throughout this period the OSCE, with strong support of the EU, pressed Belarus for agreement to an OSCE presence on the ground.  On the eve of the OSCE Ministerial Meeting in Copenhagen on 18 December last, final agreement was reached with the Belorussian authorities on the establishment of an OSCE Advisory and Monitoring Group (AMG) in Minsk.  The AMG which is due to commence operations next week, will focus initially on legislation, human rights and the development of democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomes the Belorussian agreement to host the AMG.  We believe it can play an important role in helping the authorities to develop democratic institutions and to ensure compliance with OSCE principles and commitments, including respect for human rights. Together with EU partners, Ireland will be working to encourage Belarus in the months ahead to make the greatest possible use of the important facility provided by the AMG to help it address the current difficult situation there.</P>

      <P>On 15 December 1997, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution determining that a Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries be held in Rome from 15 June to 17 July 1998 <Col N="976" /> in order to finalise and adopt a convention on the establishment of an international criminal court.</P>
      <P>Before the diplomatic conference will be a draft text of a convention which has resulted from the work of a preparatory committee which was set up by the UN General Assembly in 1995 to produce such a draft.  That committee has met five times and is due to meet one more time before the diplomatic conference.  Although the draft text being prepared by the preparatory committee represents sufficient progress to warrant the convening of the diplomatic conference, there is widespread recognition that certain key political and legal issues will be resolved only by the diplomatic conference.</P>
      <P>Although the list of crimes which will come within the jurisdiction of any future court is not finalised yet, and will not be until the diplomatic conference, there is fairly widespread acceptance that the court should deal only with crimes of exceptional gravity and heinousness.  Most states, including Ireland, would agree therefore that the crime of genocide, crimes againt humanity and war crimes should come within the remit of the court.</P>
      <P>Many states have indicated their support in principle to the establishment of a permanent international criminal court and it could be said that there has never been a more positive climate at international level towards the proposed court. Notwithstanding the fact that many important and difficult political and legal issues remain to be resolved at the diplomatic conference, it is my view that there are no insuperable difficulties which stand between the international community and the establishment of a permanent international criminal court.  A successful outcome of the diplomatic conference should therefore be possible to achieve.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I can confirm that Ireland will continue to work in the future, as it has done in the past, for the establishment of an international criminal court which will constitute a powerful and impartial instrument of justice in the field of international humanitarian law.</P>

      <P>The European Council, meeting in Luxembourg on 12-13 December 1997, decided to establish a European Conference, which it envisaged as bringing together the member states of the European Union, and the European states aspiring to accede to it which share the values and objectives of the Union.  The Luxembourg European Council outlined the fundamental principles which must be shared by all members of the conference. These included, <i>inter alia</i>, a common commitment to peace and security, the principles upon which the EU is founded and the principles of international law.  The European Council decided to extend invitations to the states which it considered subscribed to these principles, and which shared the Union's commitment to building a Europe free of the divisions and difficulties of the past.  Initially, the EU offer to participate in the conference was addressed to Cyprus, the ten central and eastern European applicants for membership of the EU, and Turkey.</P>
      <P>As regards the agenda and format of the conference, it is envisaged that it will be a multilateral forum for dialogue and consultation which will address questions of general concern to the participants.  Participation in the conference is also intended to broaden and deepen co-operation in the fields of foreign and security policy, justice and home affairs as well as other areas of common concern, particularly economic matters and regional co-operation.</P>
      <P>The Luxembourg European Council also took a number of decisions regarding the level of representation at the conference, as well as the frequency of meetings and the holder of the chair of the conference.  The conference will be chaired by the State holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  At the Presidency's invitation, Heads of State and Government and the President of the Commission will meet at the conference once a year, as will Ministers for Foreign Affairs.  The inaugural meeting of the European Conference, which will be hosted by the current British Presidency of the European Union, is scheduled to take place in London on 12 March 1998.</P>

      <P>Ireland's contribution to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon remains a key feature of our commitment to the efforts of the UN and the international community to maintain peace in the region.  In particular, it underlines our full support for the Middle East peace process and the significance of the Lebanon aspect of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> The Security Council on 30 January 1998 renewed the mandate of the UNIFIL force as a valuable and necessary contribution to maintaining peace and stability in the area.  The UN Secretary-General, in his recent report on UNIFIL submitted to the Security Council, had sought the continued presence of UNIFIL as a force for peace and stabilisation in southern Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Both the Secretary-General and the Security Council expressed serious concern at the recurrent pattern of violence in southern Lebanon and expressed regret at the loss of civilian life which this has caused.  The Secretary-General also noted his concern at the harassment of UN personnel which has occurred.  The Security Council urged all parties to the conflict to exercise restraint.</P>
    <P>It is clear that UNIFIL continues to have a central role to play in the maintenance of peace and stability and the protection of the civilian population in southern Lebanon.  Ireland's intention is to maintain its contribution to this effort through participation in UNIFIL.</P>

      <Quest>if he will list, in order of descending magnitude, those states who are internationally considered to be producing and stockpiling chemical and biological weapons; and if he will give an estimate of the amount of these weapons held by each state.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two international conventions governing chemical and biological weapons.  These are the Chemical Weapons Convention (1993) and the Biological Weapons Convention (1972).</P>
      <P>There are 165 states signatories and 106 states parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention; while there are 140 states both signatories and parties to the Biological Weapons Convention. Ireland is a state party to both conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and provides for their destruction.  As such it represents a total ban on these weapons.  This convention entered into force in 1997.  It now includes as states parties both the Russian Federation and the United States, which had originally declared possession of chemical weapons, and other countries such as India and the Republic of Korea which recently declared chemical weapons possession in their initial declarations under the convention.  Countries which declare chemical weapons possession are obliged to destroy such weapons within ten years of their accession to the convention.  Other countries with significant chemical industries such as Iran and Pakistan have more recently acceded to the Treaty and until we have received their initial declarations we will not be in a position to <Col N="980" /> state whether they will declare chemical weapons possession.  The Chemical Weapons Convention &mdash; in spite of having only recently entered into force &mdash; is fast becoming a global disarmament treaty.  However, in the Middle East, Israel and its Arab neighours show little sign of becoming parties to the convention.  The mutual suspicions and tension characteristic of the region do not augur well for the early ratification of the convention by this group of states, the adherence of which is of considerable importance for the universal application of the convention.  Ireland together with its partners in the European Union is actively promoting the early accession to the convention by these states.</P>
    <P>The Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological and toxin weapons and provides for their destruction, and is therefore also a total ban.  This Convention entered into force in 1975. The Convention was concluded without a verification mechanism and as a consequence, in September 1994, a special conferece of states parties decided to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> group to develop a compliance regime, which would mirror to the extent relevant that of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  The <i>ad hoc</i> group is working intensively for the purpose of completing its substantive work on verification mechanism before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The addition of a verification mechanism for the Biological Weapons Convention will provide greater confidence in the implementation of the provisions of the convention, as biological research and development and the biological sciences have generally become more widespread in the intervening years since its conclusion 1972.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will have followed the events relating to the investigation by UNSCOM of chemical and biological weapons in Iraq.  The International Community's abhorrence of these weapons is evident in the strong response to that development.  This reinforces the need for universal adherence to the two applicable conventions I have described above.  Ireland will continue to work together with our partners in the European Union to promote the early universal application of these conventions as well as the early conclusion of a verification mechanism for the Biological Weapons Convention.  We will also work with like-minded countries to prevent any unwitting contribution by Irish companies in the supply of products, equipment, components or sub-components which could contribute to the development of chemical or biological weapons capacity.</P>

      <P>This initiative was taken by the Netherlands Presidency in April 1997.  It proposed that both Greece and Turkey appoint experts to a joint committee which would examine ways in which both parties might seek a rapprochement on issues of bilateral dispute, particularly in relation to the Aegean area.</P>
      <P>Whilst it did not prove possible to have the agreement of both parties to formal meetings of such a joint group, views have been exchanged between Greek and Turkish experts through the offices of the Presidency of the European Union and this process of informal contacts between the two parties continues.</P>
      <P>The framework for further bilateral dialogue between Greece and Turkey on problems in their bilateral relations was improved by the adoption by them of a joint communique in July 1997 at the Madrid NATO Summit.  This communique committed both parties to a peaceful resolution of issues of bilateral dispute.  Following this, at the Balkan Summit in Crete in November 1997, the Prime Ministers of Greece and Turkey met to discuss relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland, along with other EU partners, will continue to encourage the bilateral dialogue between the two parties, both in the &ldquo;Wisemen&rdquo; process and other fora, aimed at reducing tensions and finding ways to resolve issues of contention in their relations.</P>

      <P>The role of the NGO Forum on Human Rights complements that of the Joint Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; Non-Government Organisation Standing Committee on Human Rights, which was set up last year to provide a formal framework for a regular exchange of views between the Department of Foreign Affairs and representatives of the non-governmental sector. While a key objective has been that the process of interaction should be as inclusive as possible, it would not be feasible to include on the committee every organisation that would wish to participate. The holding of the NGO forum on an annual basis to which all interested NGOs would be invited is intended to address these concerns. In this way, we hope to ensure the fullest possible utilisation of the experience and perspectives of the broader NGO community.  It will provide a regular focus for NGO participation in the consideration of Irish foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inaugural NGO Forum on Human Rights will take place in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham <Col N="982" /> on Saturday, 7 March next.  It is intended to use the occasion of the forum to brief NGOs on the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, of which we are currently a member, which convenes in Geneva on 16 March. Specific themes and current issues in the human rights field such as refugees and asylum-seekers, the rights of the child, universality, human rights and democratisation and the role of NGOs will also be addressed during the forum.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Channel 4 programme of 17 December 1997 dealing with children in orphanages in Albania.  I share the Deputy's concern about the plight of the people of Albania and the particular case of children.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the Government contributed $50,000 in humanitarian aid to the International Committee of the Red Cross for the benefit of the people of Albania.  Ireland also contributed £32,000 through the Irish NGO, Health Action Overseas, for capacity building in public health promotion and nutrition education.</P>
      <P>The Government would be willing to consider additional project proposals from NGOs for financial assistance to Albania.  This could be done through the Department's NGO co-financing scheme which supports the work of Irish NGOs in developing countries.  Under this scheme, priority is given to proposals which meet the basis needs of the poorest sections of the population in areas such as primary health care, primary education, water, sanitation, urban and rural development and vocational training.</P>
      <P>At international level, a ministerial conference in Rome and a donor conference in Brussels were held in October 1997.  At these conferences, international and bilateral donors confirmed their willingness to continue to assist the most vulnerable social groups in Albania.</P>
      <P>In addition, since 1996 the EU, through its European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has allocated a total of 12 million ecu, over £15 million, to Albania.  ECHO's assistance which is channelled primarily through its partners, i.e. the non-governmental organisations and the specialised agencies of the United Nations, has directly focussed on the needs of the most vulnerable in Albania through food aid and the rehabilitation of essential social services.  A portion of this assistance has gone to orphanages.</P>

      <P>Ballinamore Textiles Limited was a substantial employer in <Col N="984" /> the Leitrim-Cavan area over the past 25 years and the fact that the company has decided to cease operations will come as a severe blow to the workforce.  I am naturally concerned at this development.</P>
      <P>I understand the current workforce of 106 will be made redundant on a phased basis between 20 February and 10 April.  In its press statement Ballinamore Textiles cited &ldquo;fierce competition for domestic and export sales&rdquo; as the reason for the proposed closure.  While IDA Ireland managed to secure some new contracts for the company, I understand these were insufficient to support its future viability.</P>
      <P>My first priority on learning of the company's decision to close was to see if anything could be done to secure alternative employment opportunities for the workforce.  I immediately asked IDA Ireland to liaise with the other development agencies and FÁS, and I know that the IDA and Forbairt have already contacted a number of clothing companies regarding the possibility of locating to Ballinamore.  As well as actively exploring this possibility, the development agencies are also vigorously pursuing other industrial opportunities for the Ballinamore area.  The IDA plans to meet the management of Ballinamore shortly to ascertain the company's plans for the premises.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the development agencies' efforts, FÁS has arranged to meet the company's management to discuss the skills of the workforce, in advance of arranging suitable courses which would best equip the employees to gain alternative employment in the clothing and other sectors.</P>
      <P>The development agencies have been made very much aware of my determination to focus to a much greater extent than in the past on the creation of new job opportunities in the regions, and particularly regions such as west Cavan and south Leitrim.  In the past seven months, we have announced some 11,000 jobs for areas outside of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that the strenuous campaign being mounted by the various agencies, generally for the regions and more specifically for Ballinamore, will have positive results over the coming months.</P>

      <P>The undertaking of protection works at Seafield-Quilty is among the priority protection proposals submitted by Clare County Council to my Department for consideration under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-9.  I understand the county council is taking a fresh look at the situation and has engaged a firm of consulting engineers to assist in the technical evaluation.  The consultants' report will be assessed by my Department when it becomes available, within the context of the limited funding available up to 1999 for coast protection works under the coast protection sub-programme of the Environmental Services Operational Programme.</P>

      <P>The forest service of my Department grant aided a study on the effects of stream hydrology and water quality in forested catchments on fish and invertebrates.  This study, known as the Aquafor Report, was carried out by UCD, UCC, and TCD in collaboration with the forestry sector and fisheries interests in Cork, Galway and Wicklow and was published in 1997.</P>
      <P>The study highlighted the interactions between plantation forestry and aquatic ecology some of which were negative, particularly in some of the most acid sensitive regions in the country. However, the study concluded that it would be wrong to extrapolate from these areas to the whole country, or to conclude that forestry, as a whole, has a net negative effect on aquatic ecology. It is important also to point out that the Aquafor study was carried out entirely on forests which were established long before the current guidelines on forestry and fisheries were introduced in 1992.  These guidelines are currently being reviewed and will take cognisance of the findings of the Aquafor study.  My Department also supports an ongoing research programme undertaken by Coillte into the effect of water on forest operational activities, covering such aspects as siltation and fertiliser application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">

      <P>The Government remains gravely concerned at continuing human rights abuses in Nigeria and <Col N="986" /> the delays in the transition to democratic rule in that country.  Together with our EU partners we are availing of every appropriate opportunity to support an early return to democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>At the recent 52nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Ireland and our EU partners reiterated our call for democratic and human rights reform in Nigeria and co-sponsored a resolution condemning human rights abuses. Prior to that, at last year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, an EU-sponsored resolution strongly supported by Ireland, had called for the appointment of a UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Nigeria. Recently, the Special Rapporteur, Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee, was appointed.  The Government urges the Nigerian authorities to co-operate fully with him. Together with other members of the international community, we will be reviewing the progress of his work at this year's Session of the Commission on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>On 28 November, the EU Council of Development Ministers expressed its grave concern at the numerous human rights violations in Nigeria, including the detention of political prisoners, and at the delay in the process of democratisation. The Council also decided, with strong support from Ireland, to extend the EU's Common Position on Nigeria and its restrictive measures, until 1 November 1998.  The extended EU restrictive measures include <i>inter alia</i> an arms embargo, the suspension of military co-operation, visa restrictions on members of the Nigerian military or government and their families, the suspension of all high level visits, and the interruption of sporting contacts.</P>
      <P>In addition to extending these measures, the Council also provided that: after six months &mdash; that is to say next May &mdash; the Union will assess, at Council level, the situation in Nigeria on the basis of a report from the Presidency, and, if elections fail to produce a return to democracy and the rule of law in Nigeria before 1 October 1998, the EU will adopt further measures in addition to those adopted on 4 December 1995.</P>
      <P>It is evident from the outcome of the Council on 28 November that Ireland and our European partners are actively monitoring the situation in Nigeria pending the restoration of a credible civilian government and meaningful human rights reform.  In so doing we are particularly concerned about the conduct of the national elections scheduled to be held there in August and the approaching official deadline for democratic transition on 1 October.  We are also liaising closely with the Commonwealth, the United States and others who have adopted a similarly firm approach to human rights and democratisation issues in Nigeria. Against this background, the Government continues to support concerted international action which will lead to an early return to democratic government and full observance of human rights in that country.</P>

      <P>The Heads of State and Government of the European Union, meeting in Luxembourg on 12-13 December 1997, noted that the accession of Cyprus to the Union should benefit all communities and help to bring about civil peace and reconciliation. In this context, the Luxembourg European Council requested that the willingness of the Government of Cyprus to include representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community in the accession negotiating delegation be acted upon, and mandated the Presidency of the European Union and the European Commission to undertake the necessary contacts with all parties to achieve this aim.  Following the recent Presidential elections in Cyprus, we would expect that the UK Presidency and the European Commission, in accordance with the mandate of the Luxembourg European Council, will be in early contact with the Government of Cyprus and the leadership of the Turkish Cypriot community, with a view to finding a basis for Turkish Cypriot participation in the accession negotiations.  The Government shares the view expressed by the EU Heads of <Col N="988" /> State and Government at Luxembourg that the accession negotiations will contribute positively to the search for a political solution to the Cyprus problem through the talks under the aegis of the United Nations with a view to creating a bi-community bi-zonal federation.</P>

      <P>With regard to the implementation in Ireland of the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, it has been the view of successive Irish Governments that rights guaranteed under the Constitution, relevant legislation and common law rights in Ireland fully correspond to, and in places exceed, those available through the convention. These rights are, of course, justiciable in our domestic courts.  I should point out that while we are committed to equivalence between the human rights regimes North and South, this does not mean that precisely identical mechanisms have to be in place in the two jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>However, we are prepared to examine actively proposals for incorporation if it appears that this would be necessary to ensure the equivalence we seek between human rights regimes in the North and the South.  In this context, the Government has decided to ask the relevant Departments to look again at the various complex legal and practical issues, including those relating to the Constitution that would be involved in the incorporation of the European Convention into domestic legislation.</P>

However, before the balance of the premia payments and the beef cow headage payments can issue, the forage area declared by the person concerned must be validated by the land parcel identification system (LPIS).  Due to the fact that a map of the above-named person's land was not received I have arranged for a townland map to issue from my Department.

      <P>The Mid-West Subregional Review Committee's submission to my Department in respect of the National Development Plan 1994-99 did not give Clare County Council's full submission nor did it contain any mention of a submission from the Mid-West Regional Development Organisation. Relevant extracts from the subregional review committee's submission as they relate to Clare County Council's submission are reproduced as follows.</P>
      <P>The Mid-West Subregional Review Committee's submission together with the submissions from the other subregional review committees, Government Departments, the sectoral interests and social partners were taken into account by my Department in drawing up the national development plan.  The plan provided the basis for negotiating the Community Support Framework for Ireland 1994-99 with the European Commission.  The plan and the CSF set out the overall priorities and strategy for the utilisation of structural funds in Ireland.  The operational programmes for the various sectors were agreed with the European Commission by the relevant lead Departments on the basis of the strategic priorities and financial allocations agreed in the CSF.  The inclusion in the first instance of individual projects from Clare County Council or others and, the progress of such projects where they have been included, would be a matter for the implementing departments and agencies for the operational programmes.</P>

        <i>Tourism</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This submission identified a strategy for tourism development within the county.  This strategy would include improved access; upgrade role of Shannon Airport; adequate water and sewerage facilities; attractive tourist products.  It proposed several measures including: the upgrading of county roads; provision of water and sewerage schemes; development of water based facility on west coast; provision of visitor facilities &mdash; Cliffs <Col N="994" /> of Moher; holiday centres; access to waterways; network of outdoor activities; indoor water-based facility &mdash; Lough Derg; access to beaches; coastal management plan and additional golf courses.</P>
    <P>It also proposed action areas for development e.g. Lough Derg, the Burren, coastal zone, the Shannon estuary.  The submission highlighted the importance of adequate roads and outlined essential improvements to tourist roads &mdash; national secondary routes &mdash; required expenditure £50 million, regional and county routes &mdash; required expenditure £83.4 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sanitary Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>This detailed submission outlines the general policy of the council as being the provision of an adequate infrastructural base which helps to encourage and direct the economic growth and social and cultural well being of the county in a rational and organised manner.  The policy aims at realising the county's full potential while protecting the character and enhancing the quality of the environment.</P>
    <P>The submission includes a priority list of water and sewerage schemes comprising four priority bands.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Peripherality &mdash; General</i>
    </P>
    <P>Clare County Council proposes that its general policy is to provide an adequate infrastructural base and to encourage and direct the economic growth and social and cultural well-being of the county.  The council describes the provision of roads as one of their principal functions within the considerations of Structural Funds.  The road network is outlined in two ways, both functional and tourist oriented: the route from Rosslare to Limerick-Ennis-Galway to be upgraded to Euroroute status and the necessary improvements carried out before the year 2000.  This route is described as a strategic route for both the Mid-West and the West of Ireland; strategic county roads to receive priority for upgrading-improvements; special strengthening grants required for bridge improvements as well as important regional and county roads.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Peripherality &mdash; Coastal Erosion</i>
    </P>
    <P>Clare County Council as a maritime county is affiliated to the National Coastal Erosion Committee set up in August 1991 to examine this issue.  The responsibility for Ireland's coastline is somewhat fragmented with physical planning being the responsibility of the local authorities under the Department of the Environment.  Designated areas of scientific interest are now the responsibility of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works with an input from the Department of the Marine in the case of coastal areas.  As a result an inadequate financial structure exists and local authorities find themselves unable to respond with preventative measures to protect the coastline.  Recent policy <Col N="995" /> has been for the Department of the Environment to provide 50 per cent of the coast of specific schemes with the remainder of the cost to be found locally.  The setting up of a single agency is recommended to take a lead role in managing the coast, which would be entitled the National Coastal Authority and would be located either within the Department of the Environment or the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>Coastal erosion in Ireland is perceived as a serious issue affecting coastal roads, agricultural land and tourism infrastructure.  A strong case is proposed for the funding of coastal protection works from Structural Funds during the period 1994-97.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>A job sharing scheme was introduced in the Civil Service in 1984.  No new options were introduced in 1996.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Government approved a number of changes to the general framework of the public service job-sharing schemes.  The practical application of the new arrangements are to be worked out and discussed with the appropriate trade unions for each of the various public service organisations.  The introduction of a broader range of job-sharing options such as a four day week or a three week month in the Civil Service is currently under consideration in conjunction with staff representatives.  As the arrangements have not yet been finalised, there are as yet no statistics on the numbers who will participate.</P>
      <P>The possibility of running a pilot scheme of term-time working, i.e. three months unpaid leave to care for young children during the summer of 1998, is currently under discussion with one of the larger Government Departments.</P>

    <P>It is vital in interpreting these tables that the mechanism for reviewing both the family income <Col N="997" /> supplement and the rent subsidy under shared ownership scheme is understood.  FIS is renewable on a 12 monthly basis: once awarded it will not be reduced or withdrawn until the end of the period (provided they continue to meet the basic qualifying conditions), regardless of any upward movement in pay during that period.  The rent subsidy under the shared ownership scheme operates in much the same way: all cases are reviewed annually (in July) and the rate for the coming year is based on the income of the recipient in the previous tax year i.e. the applicants P60.  It is also important to note that income from FIS is not reckonable when calculating entitlement to the rent subsidy, this practice works in the favour of the applicant.  Therefore, gross income from employment can increase significantly during the course of a year while adjustments to both FIS and the rent subsidy may not occur until some time later.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fuel sudsidy for designated areas of Dublin and Cork, it should be noted that this is paid in addition to the family income supplement while the person is eligible for this.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of tax free expenses, the only expenses paid by an employer to an employee which can be regarded as tax-free are those which are incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of the employment.  Details of the subsistence expenses which employers may pay free to tax to employees are set out in the Revenue Commissioners leaflet IT54, which I will arrange to have forwarded to the Deputy.  The Revenue Commissioners agree flat rate tax-free expenses in respect of particular employments with the trade unions representing employees in those employments.</P>
    <P>The medical card is shown here in the tables as being withdrawn as the income increases by the first £20 per week.  However, if the person had previously been long-term unemployed, the medical card can be retained for three years, irrespective of earnings.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable without undue hardship to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the persons's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
    <P>It is open to any person without a medical card who is experiencing difficulty in paying for general practitioner services to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for a medical card on hardship grounds.  I understand that the health boards take a sympathetic <Col N="998" /> view of such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers also introduced a number of measures to assist workers in low and moderately paid employument.  Assessment is now based on gross income less PRSI deductions. Weekly payments under the community employment programme, back to work allowance, supplementary welfare allowance and family income support are excluded in assessing an applicant's income.

    <P>The valuable role which is played by home helps in the overall care of older people in this country is widely recognised.  In this context, my Department has arranged to have an examination of the home helps services carried out by an independent body, under the supervision of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, to advise on how the services can be developed in a cost <Col N="999" /> effective way in tandem with the other community based services.  I expect work to be completed on this review by early summer.  When I have received the report I will be in a better position to consider how best to bring about improvements in the overall organisation and development of the home help service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of services at Ennis General Hospital is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance.  The board's 1998 service plan for that hospital is based on a projected overall activity level for 1998 that is broadly in line with the level provided in 1997, with a shift from in-patient to day case activity provided for. The plan envisages a decrease in general surgical activity and concomitant expansion of specialty surgery in the hospital in 1998, specifically in urology and gynaecology.  It states that the introduction of a new clinical speciality at the hospital in 1998 will be facilitated by the recruitment of an oral surgeon based at the Regional Hospital Limerick, with an out-patient and day case sessional commitment to Ennis General Hospital. The board's plan also outlines the intention to deploy development funding of £50,000 in supporting a replacement consultant physician with <Col N="1001" /> an interest in cardiology, who is due to take up duty at the hospital in July 1998.</P>
    <P>My Department will remain in contact with the Mid-Western Health Board in relation to the ongoing needs of Ennis General Hospital, including any longer term capital development requirements that are identified by the board.</P>

      <P>Additional funding was made available by my Department in late 1997 to facilitate health boards in the implementation of nursing homes legislation, including the Nursing Homes (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations, 1996.  These regulations allow boards, <i>inter alia</i>, to pay an enhanced subvention in certain circumstances.  I understand that as a result of this additional funding, the Eastern Health Board made available enhanced subventions to 205 older people in private nursing home care whose financial resources had become depleted.</P>
      <P>The board is aware that certain homes have increased their fees in the last few months.  I am anxious that the recent improvements in the financing of the scheme be used for the optimum benefit of older people availing of private nursing home care and I have asked my Department to monitor the situation in conjunction with the Eastern Heath Board.</P>

Achieving uniformity of implementation is an objective of my Department's ongoing monitoring of the operation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware regulations, which came into effect in October 1991, allow that where a pensioner, or a person of pension age in receipt of a means tested payment from the Department, sells his or her principal residence and either buys or rents alternative accommodation, or moves into a private nursing home, the income derived from the sale shall be exempted from the means test in relation to the pension, or other relevant payment, up to a limit of £75,000.  In the case of a couple the spouse must also be over 66.</P>
      <P>I am presuming the Deputy is suggesting that income from the kind of arrangement he suggests would be exempted from the means test in the same manner as outlined above.  The possibility of a scheme with the financial institutions as suggested by the Deputy has not been explored to date although it is one of the issues that will be considered in the coming year.  I am aware that these kind of arrangements exist in some other European countries.  The Deputy will appreciate that this proposal has a number of implications that will need to be examined in detail.</P>

      <P>The Phoenix Park is maintained as a public park for the general purpose of the recreation and enjoyment of the public. Policy in relation to the Phoenix Park is governed by the Phoenix Park Act, 1925, the Phoenix Park Bye-Laws, 1926, and the management plan published in 1986.  The four main objectives set out in the management plan are as follows: 1-to conserve the historic landscape character of the park; 2-to encourage recreational use and public appreciation; 3-to conserve natural and other values within the park; and 4-to develop a harmonious relationship between the park and the community.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to this matter is that the afforestation grant scheme and forest premium scheme, administered by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, are governed by European Council Regulation 2080/92.  This regulation attaches environmental conditions to afforestation grantaid which require that all works grant-aided under the scheme must be compatible with protecting the environment.  My Department gives technical advice to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources on the environmental, and more specifically, the ecological implications of afforestation proposals.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the person concerned applied for an afforestation grant in 1996.  The land in question is located in an area which is exceptionally diverse in habitats and species.  Its most interesting ecological feature is the presence of orchid-rich calacreous grasslands, which are an annex I priority habitat under the EU Habitats Directive.  The area is also of geological, geomorphological and archaeological importance.  It is botanically rich and varied, containing limestone and peat flora, and, in places, leaching has led to the development of calcifuge flora.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances outlined above, my Department, when advice was sought, advised the Forest Service that the proposals were incompatible with protecting the environment.  The decision as to whether a grant will be paid or not is a matter for the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of revised procedures to deal with applications for refugee status became necessary as the arrangements made in 1985, involving formal consultation with UNHCR in each individual case, were no longer workable due to the huge increase in numbers applying and a new approach was necessary.  The 1985 administrative arrangement worked well when the number of applications being lodged in the State were less than 60 a year.  The procedures were not designed, however, to handle, and were incapable of handling, the increased volume of recent years.  The new procedures which were drawn up in July 1997 and, following extensive consultation with the UNHCR, finalised in December 1997 are based on the philosophy of the Refugee Act, 1996, and will, I am satisfied, bring about an improvement in the position, not just in fairness to those who have applied for refugee status who are entitled to a speedy decision but also to the taxpayer who must support applicants and their families while a decision is pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> My Department provides £120 per case in legal aid for asylum seekers to present their cases to the appeals authority.  This amount is paid to the legal representatives, who are engaged independently by asylum seekers, on certification by the appeals authority that the representatives have acted in the case.  The fee of £120 is the same as that paid by the Legal Aid Board under its private practioners scheme for legal services provided for certain District Court family law cases.</P>
    <P>As part of my ongoing review of the whole asylum issue I am considering how best the issue of legal aid might be tackled.  In this regard I am availing myself of the advice of the UNHCR. Given its experience in other parts of the world, I consider it would be foolish to act without consultation with that body.  Various options are being considered and a decision in the matter is expected soon.</P>
    <P>As I have stated in this House on a number of occasions my Department has full responsibility for the training of officials who deal with asylum matters.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has provided, and has given a commmitment to continue to provide, training in asylum law and practice geared to the needs of the staff and other officials involved in the asylum process.</P>
    <P>Extensive training courses, run in conjunction with the UNHCR, are currently being prepared and officials of the asylum division are meeting on a regualr basis with UNHCR representatives to finalise details of a comprehensive training programme for existing staff and for new staff who will be assigned to the asylum division shortly.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that, in December last, a number of fine on-the-spot notices were issued in respect of vehicles parked on the footpath in question, including a vehicle owned by the person referred to by the Deputy.  This was following the receipt of a complaint concerning illegally parked vehicles.  The Garda authorities say that they regularly received complaints from the public about vehicles being illegally parked on this footpath as such parking can cause considerable annoyance to the elderly, persons with disabilities and young children.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that, apart from the statutory exemptions, there are no legal provisions whereby concessions can be extended to any particular individual.  The district officer may cancel notices in specific circumstances provided by law, but in this case the local district officer having met with the person referred to by the Deputy to discuss her situation is of the view that it would not be appropriate to cancel the notice in her case.</P>

      <P>In deciding on the matter for the inquiry, the Government took account of all the issues involved, including victims' concerns, the desire for privacy of a number of victims and their families and the wider public policy issue of how best child abuse cases should be dealt with in such circumstances in the future.</P>
      <P>The Government has appointed Dr. Roderick Murphy, S.C., Chairman of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, to carry out the inquiry.</P>
      <P>Dr. Murphy has been asked to conduct this investigation in private and to report to me by 10 March 1998.  Subject to the need to preserve the confidentiality of victims, his findings will be made public.</P>

The local authority decides the rate applicable in each particular case.

      <Quest>if he will appoint a resource teacher to service the needs of St Joseph's national school, Boyerstown, Dunsany national school and St Joseph's Convent of Mercy, Navan, on a shared basis, in view of the fact that each of the schools in question have a child enrolled with Down's Syndrome and the children require special attention.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the schools in question have applied to my Department for the appointment of resource teachers.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997/98 school year.</P>
      <P>A total of 32 resource teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for access to a resource teaching service.  I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the resource teacher area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools in question will be fully considered in the context of any additional resource teacher allocations which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>The board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of primary schools.  My Department investigates specific complaints which involve an alleged breach of the Rules for National Schools only after every effort has been made to resolve the matter at local level.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, the complaint received by my Department alleged mistreatment of the complainant's daughter by a teacher.  Upon concluding its investigation, my Department made the results of the investigation known to the board of management of the school. A letter issued to the complainant indicating that the Department's investigation had been concluded and that the board of management had been informed of the Department's findings.</P>
      <P>I should add that discussions are ongoing with the education partners at present with a view to reviewing the procedure for dealing with complaints. The main focus of these discussions is to agree a procedure for the resolution of complaints at local school level, and to ensure that all parties to a complaint are kept fully informed of the manner in which the complaint is being dealt with.</P>

      <P>The pupil to whom the Deputy refers lives 1.6 miles from the nearest school, and therefore does not qualify for free transport on distance grounds.  Furthermore, the pupil is not attending the nearest school.</P>
      <P>Under the school transport scheme, there is no provision for refunds of transport costs for pupils who are ineligible.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I regret the family in question is not entitled to free transport, or a refund towards the cost of transport as requested.</P>
