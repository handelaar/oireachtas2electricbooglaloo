      <P>I want to seek clarification about the item on the agenda for 4.15 p.m. <Col N="1062" /> this evening.  Will the Taoiseach agree that Members may share time so that others can participate in that important debate on today's business?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked last week to hold a debate on Northern Ireland in which party leaders could make contributions.  If there is enough time available I am sure the Whips will agree to the Deputy's request.  The normal practice, however, in this type of debate is that only party leaders contribute.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree to hold a debate on aviation policy in the next week or two?  There is a conflict of evidence about what is happening in Aer Lingus with regard to TEAM.  There is also a problem regarding Ryanair and there is great concern in Dublin and other airports about the effect on aviation of the loss of duty free status. A broad debate on aviation policy and future employment in aviation industries in Ireland would be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is prepared to consider any reasonable request from the leader of the Opposition.  Such a debate would give the Minister an opportunity to talk about the excellent things that are happening in Irish aviation. We are moving towards the conclusion of a development in Aer Lingus that will provide <Col N="1063" /> facilities for up to 24 million passengers, bringing us into the 21st century.  The Minister announced an excellent initiative for regional airports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two matters with the Taoiseach.  The first concerns an issue I raised yesterday on the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  Will there be a mechanism to arrive at all-party agreement in relation to the proposal which will come before the House?  Has the Taoiseach decided to amend the specific proposal published?  How will it be reintroduced and will there be discussions in advance?  Does the Government propose to put a motion to the House to establish a judicial tribunal of inquiry into the events surrounding the conviction of Mr. Derry O'Rourke in relation to sex abuses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated yesterday and before Christmas, the Government will do all in its power to get agreement on the constitutional amendment.  A meeting took place about two weeks ago at which I listened to the parties on this issue and we came close to an understanding. The debate brought about a level of certainty which clause 6 was seeking to achieve.  We signed off at that stage as people thought it was best to leave it in.  Subsequently parties expressed the belief that we should not include it.  I have been <Col N="1064" /> listening to those views.  I met the Deputy's leader and officials of his party on Monday last.  I am meeting the leader of Democratic Left tonight and I will communicate with Deputy Bruton. After that we shall proceed with whatever arrangement is agreed.  As stated in December I am anxious to get agreement on this.  It is important that the parties which support the Amsterdam Treaty should also support the wording; that is what I am seeking to achieve.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's second question the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, announced last night the setting up of an independent inquiry.  I understand that is how he will proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that those parties who are committed to supporting the Amsterdam Treaty should be in a position to do so fully.  I hope those discussions will lead to that result.  In relation to the other matter, is the Taoiseach ruling out the possibility of a full sworn judicial inquiry into the events surrounding sex abuse and the conviction of Mr. Derry O'Rourke?  Has the Government set its face against a judicial inquiry in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister who is directly involved has stated, following his meetings with the various bodies, that we should have an independent inquiry.  Perhaps something will happen that will make us change our minds but at this stage the Minister thinks an independent inquiry is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's recollection of the meeting two weeks ago regarding the indicative wording is not quite accurate.  The Democratic Left representative at that meeting pointed out that we were not satisfied with the wording proposed.  However, I will be discussing this matter with the Taoiseach later today.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach personally contact Ryanair in light of the Labour Court's recommendation that Ryanair recognise the SIPTU representatives of the baggage handlers who work for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That question would be more appropriate to Question Time.  We had a debate on this matter last week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute is going on and on.  It would certainly be worthwhile for the Taoiseach, who is on record as expressing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has agreed to a debate on aviation policy in the near future <Col N="1065" /> and perhaps the Deputy will avail of that opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an opportunity for the Taoiseach to indicate this morning that he is keen that Ryanair should accept the Labour Court recommendation.  That is a reasonable request.  The Taoiseach has answered questions that were not strictly in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That question is not appropriate for the Order of Business.  Does the Taoiseach wish to comment on the Ryanair issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, all these matters are out of order.  Last week I stated that the Labour Court would issue its views on this matter.  I stated yesterday what the Labour Court has said. It is now a matter for the parties to respond.  One of the employer organisations has obviously given as broad a hint as it can through one of its members or an employers body.  I am sure Turlough O'Sullivan's view, rather than mine, would be listened to within the confines of Ryanair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing a question yesterday on the pending execution of a woman in the United States.  That woman was barbarously put to death in the early hours of this morning.  We have been promised legislation on the human rights convention.  Will the Taoiseach bring forward that legislation to allow the Government to lay before the House the assurance it has received from the United States administration that a woman it is seeking to extradite from Ireland on charges of conspiracy to murder will not be executed?  Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or the relevant Minister, lay that assurance before the House?  I ask that the human rights legislation be brought forward to allow the Taoiseach or the relevant Minister to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The convention is being observed without a statutory basis.  The Deputy is correct in that a Bill on the United Nations Convention against torture is being prepared.  It is a short Bill which has eight heads and I will check its progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A case is pending of a woman whom the American administration is seeking to extradite on charges of conspiracy to murder. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government has received an assurance that if charged and found guilty she will not be executed?  My understanding is that the Government has received such an assurance.  I am asking that that assurance be laid before the House, given what happened in the early hours of this morning in Texas.</P>

      <P>In setting up the inquiry in relation to the activities of Mr. Derry O'Rourke I urge the Taoiseach that there should be no half measures. Unless the inquiry is set up under the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, it will be meaningless and will not have the power to compel witnesses to attend or provide evidence.</P>

Are there plans to meet development agencies who would have a distinct interest in the implications of the multilateral agreement on investment?  When will the task force report on dumping radioactive material be published, given the commitment to report back by December 1997?

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment of the House last evening I expressed surprise that the principal Opposition party, Fine Gael, had decided to divide the House on this Bill, the purpose of which is to provide the people with more information in the referendum.  It is a peculiar Bill on which to divide.</P>
      <P>Up to 1995 Governments funded referendum campaigns in favour of particular proposals through the Minister sponsoring the proposal. There was controversy during the years, for example, about the Minister for Foreign Affairs funding arrangements for the promotion of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in campaigns connected with our membership of the European Union.  In 1995 the House voted £500,000 to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to fund a promotional campaign in favour of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the divorce referendum.  As Members are aware, Patricia McKenna, MEP, took legal proceedings which were successful in the Supreme Court and restrained the use of public funds for the purposes of promoting a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
      <P>A careful analysis of the judgments of the judges of the Supreme Court on that occasion shows that there is no clear overall reasoning in the judgments of the majority of the court.  The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Hamilton, and Mr. Justice O'Flaherty took the view that in allocating funds to the Government for expenditure in promoting a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote this House infringed the equality which has to be maintained between the two sides in a referendum argument.  In his judgment Mr. Justice Blaney emphasised the voter's right to fair procedures.  What is important in the conduct of a referendum is not strict equality between the two sides &mdash; an almost mathematical concept which is impossible to achieve in a political contest &mdash; but basic fairness that must apply in the referendum procedure.  That is the constitutional obligation on this House in looking at a measure of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision in the McKenna case was subsequently considered in a petition brought by 11 o'clock another public figure, a Member of the other House and of my own parliamentary party, Senator Des Hanafin, who instituted proceedings after that referendum which sought to impugn the result on the basis that the result was affected by an interference with the conduct of the referendum caused by the illegal expenditure of moneys to promote a particular result.  It was interesting to note that in the Hanafin decision, <Col N="1070" /> the Supreme Court indicated clearly that the Government was acting in accordance with its powers in giving factual information with regard to the proposal which is the subject of a referendum, in expressing its views thereon and in urging the acceptance of such views.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Hanafin decision the Government is not prevented from campaigning for an amendment or from advocating that the proposed amendment should be approved by the people.  That is an important point in relation to the referendum, that there is no block on the Government engaging in a campaign and promoting a particular result.  The Government established an <i>ad hoc</i> commission for the divorce referendum, the referendum on bail and the recent referendum on Cabinet confidentiality.  The operation of that commission is described in the Minister's contribution.</P>
    <P>I want to make one practical point which I hope the commission will take into account in exercising its functions on the Amsterdam referendum. It is interesting to note that in the divorce referendum the <i>ad hoc</i> commission prepared a pamphlet which cost £143,000 to circulate to every household in the State.  On the other hand, in the bail and Cabinet confidentiality referenda the cost was £400,000 in each case and that cost was incurred in respect of taking out advertisements in the public press and in the press generally. That is not an effective way of conveying information to the voter.  The information might as well have been included in a copy of Iris Oifigiúil as put in a notice in the national and local newspapers.  A pamphlet attractively designed and presented would have the advantage of reaching every household and would set out a balanced set of arguments for the voter in that household.</P>
    <P>There is some evidence from research available from Australia where an Australian electoral commission has to post an official pamphlet to every voter.  A national telephone poll before a l988 referendum in Australia reported 87 per cent of respondents saying they had received the pamphlet and 62 per cent saying they had read it.  That was a failure to reach 38 per cent of the electorate. Any politician would agree is quite a high success rate.</P>
    <P>Surveys on ballot voting carried out in Massachusetts suggest that pamphlet distribution is the most effective information source for the voter followed by newspaper reports, television news reports and then radio news and talk shows.  It is interesting that paid advertising on the ballot questions is very far down the list and in Massachusetts was found to be used by only 10 per cent of the electorate.  That suggests the rather expensive newspaper advertisements used in the Cabinet confidentiality and the bail referenda were useless in that they reached 10 per cent of the voters. I hope the more inexpensive method of preparing a good pamphlet and circulating it to every household will be considered in relation to the Amsterdam referendum.  Talking to voters after <Col N="1071" /> those referenda the general view was that inadequate information was provided in both of those referenda.</P>
    <P>The voter receives a voting card and it seems sensible that the voter should also receive a document setting out the arguments for and against the referendum.  Difficulties may arise in that but ideally the voting card could be included as a coupon on the information leaflet.  When politicians are then told they have not circulated any information about this proposal it can be pointed out to the voter that it arrived with the coupon accompanying the voting card.</P>
    <P>I would like the commission to examine that issue, although I realise time is limited.  One of the difficulties the commission has faced in circulating information is that there is a limited amount of time available to it to assemble the arguments made during the debates in this House and those that may be made by other interested parties, obtain legal advice on those arguments, cast them into a form that is acceptable for rational digestion by the electorate and then physically prepare the documentation and circulate it.  All of that takes time and I appreciate time may be limited for the commission but I urge it to try to reach each household in the course of this referendum.</P>
    <P>Another question which has arisen in connection with the Referendum Bill is whether promotional funds should be made available in the conduct of a referendum.  The Minister has limited the Bill to the giving of information, and that is a real advance.  Up to now the legislation merely provided that a person could visit the local post office and purchase the Bill for two and a half pence, but that was not of great assistance to the voter and I doubt very many voters had recourse to that procedure.</P>
    <P>We are now setting up a commission which will have a positive obligation to inform the electorate about the merits and demerits of the proposal. That is a real advance but I understand the position of the Fine Gael Party is that we should go somewhat further and allocate moneys to promote a particular result in proportion, say, to the party's strength in this House.  That comes back to the decision in the McKenna case and the question of whether that case obliges us to be strictly equal in funding which promotes a particular result in a referendum.  If one takes the view that the decision requires that, then the Government, in funding the advocacy argument on a referendum, would then be obliged to give as much money to its opponents as it gave to its own side.  No Government would be anxious to take up that proposal.</P>
    <P>That raises the wider question of whether the McKenna decision requires the Government to observe that strictly drawn equality.  On reading the judgments of the Supreme Court, it may be that the concept of fairness is more fundamental than the concept of equality in deciding how funds should be allocated for promotional purposes and, therefore, one could draw up a scheme <Col N="1072" /> rather like the schemes that obtain in Canada and in Denmark where in relation to the promotional side of a referendum, if money is allocated some element of proportionality is built into it to reflect the size and strength of the different interests represented in this House.  This House has a direct democratic mandate from the people and it could be argued that element of proportionality should be built into any system for the allocation of funds for promotional purposes.</P>
    <P>I understand why the Government has decided not to go down that route in connection with this Bill.  We are facing a referendum soon and any such proposal would have to be referred by the President to the Supreme Court for its consideration were it to be mooted at this stage.  It is an issue to which we will have to return because the judgment in the McKenna case is not wholly satisfactory. I do not wish to take from the fact that Patricia McKenna took the proceedings and established an important principle that the Constitution belongs to the people in fact as well as in legal theory and that there must not be an abuse of process by the Government in the expenditure of money during a referendum.  I accept that establishing that principle through legal proceedings, where the risk of incurring costs was on her as a plaintiff, was a brave step and I salute her for that, but some of the judgments are less than satisfactory in their conclusions and their implications for the way we conduct our business in the State.  We must examine the question of whether that strict equality must necessarily apply to funds available for the promotion of a particular result in every referendum.</P>
    <P>There can be a referendum that is non-contentious. For example, a proposal was adopted in l972 to lower the voting age to 18.  Currently there is an agitation to lower the age of entitlement to become a Member of this House to 18.  Such a matter might not be very contentious.  It seems anomalous that a person aged 18 can vote for a Member of Dáil Éireann but cannot be a Member before reaching 21 years of age.  There are persons on the register who are not permitted to contest parliamentary elections.  That is a matter we might examine in the future and if a referendum were held on it, it would not seem necessary to have a promotional campaign.  A fairly minimal information campaign would suffice.</P>
    <P>There could be other proposals to amend the Constitution, proposals in the not too distant future on Northern Ireland where the promotion of a particular result would be very much in the national interest.  It would be disturbing if the Government in seeking to allocate funds for the promotion of a particular result found itself in a position where those promoting a &ldquo;no&rdquo; result would have to receive an equal amount of funding.</P>
    <P>To some extent a similar problem can arise in connection with our membership of the European Union because there is an overwhelming degree of public support for the European Union <Col N="1073" /> among public opinion and the political parties in this State.  It has not been imposed by Brussels, it has arisen because of our experience of Community membership over more than 25 years.  We are into our third decade of experience of membership of the Union and it has given great satisfaction to the bulk of our population.  The Government is entitled to point out the obvious benefits and advantages of membership, but it seems absurd that if it wishes to use public money to do that, it would be obliged to disburse an equal amount of public money to a collection of individuals who are not representative of any substantial weight of opinion in this House or country. We must always be careful in this type of matter to safeguard the rights of minorities.  That is why we had the McKenna decision.  I welcome it but I question if it went too far in its conclusions.</P>
    <P>Another main issue addressed as a matter of principle in this legislation is safeguarding the position of the minority.  There was an anomaly in referendum legislation in that where there was unanimous support for a proposal in this House there was no approved body which could permit the appointment of agents at polling stations and at the count in connection with a referendum.  I welcome the provision of machinery by the Minister in this legislation for the recognition of those approved bodies.  The practice up to now has been that a member of the Oireachtas can appoint agents to be present at polling stations for opening postal ballots and at the counting of votes in a referendum.  If all Members of the Oireachtas were in agreement with a particular proposal, those campaigning against it would not have any legal rights in relation to the referendum procedure.  It is important to establish machinery for the recognition of approved bodies which can appoint agents and other necessary legal creatures of electoral procedure.  They can safeguard and protect their interests at the various stages of the casting and counting of ballots. That is a welcome and necessary measure in the Bill.  The Minister explained the rather curious and anomalous manner in which this matter had been regulated to date.</P>

      <P>Much of the comment from the Opposition Benches on this Bill has been negative. Generally speaking I welcome the Bill.  It is a step in the right direction and represents the democratisation of the referendum process.  In looking back on the evolution of this process we should remember Mr Raymond Crotty, who went to court before Patricia McKenna and made it necessary for the State to hold referenda on important European issues.  Referenda have been held on the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty.  If it had not been for the persistence, integrity and courage of Mr. Raymond <Col N="1074" /> Crotty there would not be a forthcoming referendum on this.  Were it not for the persistence, courage and zeal for democracy of Patricia McKenna this Bill would not be before the House.  I thank Deputy Lenihan for saluting Patricia McKenna's achievement.  I agree it was a milestone and a victory for democracy and smaller groups.  I take issue with Deputy Dukes who yesterday dismissed the McKenna judgment and said it was based on specious arguments.  It was a great victory for democracy.  We often hear Members speak of transparency and democracy, yet those Members had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the altar of democracy.  If it had not been for the courts we would not have had the McKenna judgment and those referenda.  It is due to Patricia McKenna and Raymond Crotty that we have a little more democracy.</P>
      <P>Previous referenda were held on the basis that people had not been fully informed on what they were voting.  We saw that recently in the Cabinet confidentiality referendum, which was a debacle. In a real democracy we need diversity of opinion, but the Irish political landscape has become a barren place where there are five, not very different, parties.  To use the analogy of a healthy ecosystem, it requires biodiversity and a healthy political system requires political diversity.  We cannot have real democracy if we do not have diversity of opinion.  Too often in previous referenda the so called five main parties sang from the same hymn sheet.  That is regrettable.  It has been left to the Green Party to offer a different point of view.  I believe the commission that will be set up will do a good job and I hope it will present the arguments in a fair way.  It states in the legislation that it is to be fair to the interests concerned. There has been much discussion lately about the public office commission that has been set up to examine donations received by Members at election time.  There has been much disquiet about that.  People have said the commission has been too zealous and assiduous in its work, but I welcome the work it has done.  It helps to level the playing field.  It is no longer the case that people with money can buy votes.  Donations have to be declared.</P>
      <P>Similarly the new commission will have £2.5 million to divide equally among the various interests.  That is in keeping with the spirit of the McKenna judgment.  People can be properly informed about the arguments by the circulation of leaflets and the publication of advertisements. People did not read the boring and not very user-friendly advertisements in newspapers used to present the arguments on the bail referendum and Cabinet confidentiality referendum.  It is hoped that television and newspaper advertisements setting out the arguments on this forthcoming referendum will enable people to consider those important arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> Mr. Patrick Smith referred to legislation in Denmark which provides for money to be given directly to the parties.  I believe that is a bad idea and could lead <Col N="1075" /> to a good deal of disquiet.  The public are cynical enough about parties and if money were given directly to them it would only increase that level of cynicism.  A very large amount of money is involved here.</P>
    <P>In relation to referenda, parties do not have any constitutional status.  Referenda are about the people.  The people must decide and they must be properly informed.  I believe Ed Rollins, a political consultant in the United States, said: &ldquo;you can fool all the people all the time if your advertising budget is high enough&rdquo;.  Too often in the past we saw Governments put the money into propaganda and the promotion of a one-sided version of events.  That distorted the arguments and led to an undemocratic process.  When Governments could no longer do that because of the McKenna judgment, they decided not to give any &mdash; or very sparse &mdash; information.  That led to many people complaining that they did not have enough information, particularly in regard to the Cabinet confidentiality referendum.  That was evidenced by the large number of spoiled votes and a general lack of interest in it to the extent that I believe I was the only TD at the count of that referendum. It was an indictment of our democratic system that Members of this House did not bother to turn up for the count.</P>
    <P>RTE plays an important role.  Its record on referenda has been shameful in many instances. Mr. Bob Collins, the Director General of RTE, said the essence of balance is fairness.  Where was the fairness in previous referenda when five political parties who represented the same point of view were given special broadcast time?  This is unfair and undemocratic.  RTE is the public service broadcaster and it has a duty to inform people impartially.  Hopefully, because of this legislation, there will be fairness in RTE's broadcasting on this referendum.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, newspapers cannot be legislated for and we will see a distorted attitude from sections of the media.  I saw it last Sunday in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> where Mr. Stephen Collins, a responsible journalist on most occasions, said this referendum would be opposed by the Green Party and &ldquo;other fringe groups&rdquo;.  This is a nice way of immediately marginalising those opposed to this referendum.  He also referred to those opposing it as &ldquo;anti-Europe&rdquo;, which seems to equate Europe with the EU.  Mary Banotti, the Fine Gael MEP, told a good story about a delegation from the Czech Republic visiting the European Parliament.  One of the commissioners welcomed them to Europe to which one of the delegation rightly answered they had been there all the time.</P>
    <P>Europe is much more than the European Union.  Those of us who oppose various treaties are not Eurosceptics.  I am a Europhile with every fibre of my body.  If a treaty is flawed &mdash; and this one is &mdash; we need argument and debate on it. There was scarcely any debate in this House on EMU.  There has been an abdication of political <Col N="1076" /> responsibility in that no one has had the courage to point out that it could be bad for our economy if Britain does not participate, which it is clearly not going to do.  Our economy could overheat if we go in at the rate of DM 2.41, which many people want to happen.  However, no one is calling for a halt.  It is left to economists in universities to stimulate a good debate on this issue.  The politicians have remained silent.  I hope there will be informed debate on this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are a number of flaws in the Bill.  Spending should be capped, as is done in constituencies regarding general elections.  There is nothing to stop organisations spending huge amounts of ecus on a one sided debate.  I refer particularly to The New Treaty for Europe &mdash; A Citizen's Guide which is to be included in the latest issues of <i>Magill</i>, the <i>RTE Guide</i> and the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>.  It is one-sided propaganda.  The foreword is by Mr. Jacques Santer and it may be given to every household.  It distorts the argument and there should be a cap on spending on such information. Deputy Lenihan referred to Canadian legislation, which places a cap on spending.  The source of donations for referenda has to be declared.  This should be included in this legislation.  Outside interference should be stopped.</P>
    <P>This Bill is heading in the right direction.  We will put down amendments on Committee Stage. First, we need to restrict how and where finance can be sourced.  Second, we need to restrict the total contributions which can be made by individuals and organisations not directly involved in the referendum process.  Third, we need to limit the total amount of money each registered referendum committee can spend during the process. These are important aspects which were not addressed in this legislation and I hope we can do so on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gormley for sharing his time.  The position of my party in opposing this legislation is a clear one.  It is not good to rush this legislation through the House.  It is not necessary at this stage and it flies in the face of the recommendation of the all-party committee on the Constitution that a single commission should incorporate the various commissions established recently.  There is no point enacting legislation if there is a better vehicle to address the purpose of it.</P>
      <P>Referenda are fundamentally important to our democratic process.  Our Constitution derives from the people.  When a Minister receives a seal from the President, it is given by the people.  The people ultimately have the most important role in the democratic process.  They must be encouraged to vote and express their view.  I agree with my colleagues that we should enhance the referendum process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent low turnouts in referenda demonstrate the widespread support for the measure being voted on.  There may have been confusion on the issues of Cabinet confidentiality and bail. However, there was widespread agreement on <Col N="1077" /> these measures.  People frequently decide not to vote because they are in agreement with the measure and know it will be passed.  There is motivation to vote when an issue is contentious, such as the divorce or the abortion referenda. When the country is divided, it frequently leads to a bigger turnout.  Polling for the divorce referendum was held on one of the worst evenings weather wise.  This did not reduce the turnout because the issue was hotly contested.</P>
    <P>People can exaggerate the issue of turnout in referenda for political reasons.  A national debate must be generated to ensure a good turnout. Money will not do this.  A national debate requires the issue to be hotly contested among various sections of the population.  There is widespread agreement on the issues of Cabinet confidentiality, bail and Europe.  This leads to a low turnout as the same level of motivation does not apply to those issues.</P>
    <P>One of our major objections to this legislation is that we have seen a raft of commissions proposed in recent years &mdash; the Public Offices Commission, the Constituency Commission and the Independent Referendum Commission.  With respect to those sitting on these commissions, it is time all their functions were brought together under one commission.  The usual suspects such as the Clerk of the Dáil, the Clerk of the Seanad and the Ombudsman are brought together every time a new commission is established and a new function farmed out to it.</P>
    <P>We need a much more realistic view of how we organise our electoral affairs.  That is why the all-party committee proposed the establishment of a single commission to deal with, for instance, the issues of donations to parties, constituency reviews following a census, and referenda. There is no need for four separate commissions to observe and put into effect all these functions.  By adding another commission we will not only confuse the issue but will also not use the relevant officials' time to the maximum. There is no need for all these commissions, one specific commission would do the job quite well.</P>
    <P>In many ways the proposal undermines the committee process of the House because an all-party committee could make a definite proposal for streamlining the commissions under one new commission.  The Government seeks to oppose that.  As Deputy Lenihan was chairman of that all-party committee at the time, the strength of support for that proposal should be heard by a plenary session of the House and by the Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome any proposal that would overturn the anomalous situation whereby an agent of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; side cannot attend the count or the opening of postal votes.  That is a sensible measure.  It could be amended quickly through legislation instead of linking it to the establishment of a new commission.  If the Government re-examined the proposal it would find merit in it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> A sum of £2.5 million is being spoken of in terms of spending on the forthcoming referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  If that is the case it will probably be the most expensive campaign in the history of the State for a turnout of 50 per cent or 60 per cent if we are lucky.  We must begin to ask whether we are getting value for money.  If the expenditure is £2.5 million and 1.5 million voters turn out, it might be easier to hand them all £1.50 each to get out to vote instead of putting leaflets through their doors.  If this proposal goes ahead the Government can spend a huge sum of money which would make it a most expensive campaign.  It is not something we should encourage.</P>
    <P>Section 7(4)(a) is a curious element of the legislation and states that:</P>
    <P>A Commission may refuse to make a declaration under subsection (1) if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) in the opinion of the Commission, the body concerned does not have a bona fide interest in the proposal the subject of the referendum concerned.</P>
    <P>We are inferring there that an independent commission will have to take a political decision about whether such a body applying to that commission for funding can be heard.  In that situation we could be conferring a hugely contentious political objective on the new commission.</P>
    <P>I can also see other problems concerning the establishment of the body in that it is only within the State.  What happens on the issue of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution when we get to that stage of the Northern Ireland peace process?  Will it be the case that 500 residents of Northern Ireland, who hold Irish passports, cannot apply to this commission because they are not resident in the State, which they are not?  Has that matter been thought out?</P>
    <P>We will oppose this on Second Stage for some of the reasons that have been mentioned in the course of the debate.  I would encourage others to do so.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill which is totally inadequate to deal with the problems that have arisen in the conduct of referenda following the McKenna judgment.  The legislation before us is one of the most absurd provisions ever to come before this House.  The conduct of referenda as pursued under this legislation will be highly artificial and probably undemocratic.  For that reason, Democratic Left will oppose a second reading of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told the Bill is necessary to deal with the McKenna judgment.  It is worth revisiting the circumstances of that judgment.  When the Green MEP, Ms Patricia McKenna, went to the courts to challenge the then Government's right to advocate a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the divorce referendum, she argued through her legal representatives that an equivalent amount of money should be made available to promote the &ldquo;no&rdquo; case.  It would <Col N="1079" /> appear the conclusion arrived at by the courts has been interpreted by the present Government as meaning the Government cannot spend any money in promoting a referendum.  That is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, that judgment was essentially about the question of fairness in the conduct of a referendum.  If a fair opportunity and fair resources were being provided for both sides to present their cases in a referendum debate, then the difficulties the Government has been encountering since that judgment in presenting its case on a referendum, would be met.</P>
    <P>Since the McKenna judgment we have had an unsatisfactory experience in relation to referenda. The conduct of the referenda on bail and Cabinet confidentiality were nothing short of a disaster. We had a totally neutered debate with anodyne and turgid texts, arguing for both sides, being prepared for publication in newspapers and circulation to the public.  Missing from the debates, both on the bail and Cabinet confidentiality referenda, was the normal passion and cut and thrust of political debate.</P>
    <P>If anything, the McKenna judgment has worsened the conduct of referenda.  One can look at what happened in the past and all the evidence is there.  One thinks back, for example, to the 1960s when a Fianna Fáil Government attempted to amend the Constitution to change the proportional representation system of voting.  The people threw that proposal out even though the Government strongly advocated it.  There was a very robust debate in 1972 on our proposed entry to the European Community.  In 1986, when the Government advocated a change in the Constitution in relation to divorce it was defeated by the people.  It was something I was less than happy with but, nevertheless, that was the decision of the people.  There was also a robust debate on the abortion referendum in 1983 and there were robust debates on the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle that has been established in the McKenna judgment that fair resources should be provided to present both sides of a case.  I am disappointed this Bill is being put before us at a time when the all-party committee on the Constitution has been considering this very issue.  It makes one wonder about how serious the Government is about the work of the all-party committee, when it can introduce legislation not only ignoring the work of the committee but ignoring the very recommendations the committee has made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Fianna Fáil seems to be hankering after it yet, to judge by some of the comments made by the Minister for Environment and Local Government about the electoral system.</P>
      <P>The recommendation was that the commission should have a function to mount an adequate information campaign and to allocate funds to political parties and interest groups to ensure a thorough and sustained debate on the proposal. That recommendation has been blithely ignored by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes a provision that there will be an independent commission.  I have no difficulty with the idea or the proposed composition of an independent commission.  However, anyone who wants to get a pass for an election count, to be an agent at a polling station or to make an observation and have it considered by the commission must make a submission.  Only those bodies with a membership of more than 500 members who can present their articles of association will be enabled to do so.</P>
      <P>The late Mr. Raymond Crotty made an enormous contribution to debate on referenda.  His court challenge to the Single European Act required successive Governments to present amendments to the European treaties to the people in referenda.  He was not a member of an organisation which had more than 500 members. Many of the people involved in referendum campaigns are not necessarily involved in organisations of more than 500 members.  Many of the campaigns are driven by small groups of people who have an understanding of and a commitment to the Constitution and who put forward their case.  This will result in all types of artificial membership and membership lists so that people qualify to make a submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission will have £2.5 million to spend putting forward the case for both sides of the referendum campaign.  They will be entitled to hire advertising agencies to put each side of the argument. These will be attractive advertising contracts. The advertising agencies will know a great deal about how to advertise but they may know little about the issues at stake in the referendum <Col N="1081" /> or the conduct of politics.  They will place advertisements in public newspapers and on radio and television.  However, these might not relate to the issues which will arise during a referendum.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of any referendum campaign one does not know what type of issue will arise. Who could have predicted when the Maastricht Treaty was signed that one of the issues which would be most loudly debated during the referendum campaign would be abortion?  During the last divorce campaign people predicted that the central issues would be social welfare, property ownership, pensions, etc.  By the time the campaign was well under way, the main issue was its wider implications for society.  One cannot anticipate what issues will arise in advance of a referendum campaign.</P>
    <P>We should also look at the way it might conduct its advertising campaign.  It cannot, for example, produce a party political broadcast using the Taoiseach because that would be seen as the Government promoting a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the campaign.  However, it might be entitled to use an actor who acts the part of a Taoiseach.  This would give rise to the most absurd and artificial presentation of the campaign.</P>
    <P>The press and media are quick to tell us the public has a right to know and its job is to tell the public about what is happening in public affairs. The effect of this independent commission and its budget of £2.5 million, however, will be to reduce the amount of press information about a referendum. I cannot see many editors, for example, deciding to ask correspondents to find out what is in a complicated constitutional proposal, to write feature articles on it and to present documentaries on radio and television explaining it to the people.  They will wait until someone with £2.5 million of public money places an advertisement with them.  An unwitting effect of this will be a reduction in the amount of press coverage and press information about a campaign.</P>
    <P>There is no control on spending by groups outside the political process.  The Government cannot spend anything independently, political parties will not be funded to pursue a referendum campaign and groups with a particular interest in the campaign must send their submission to the independent commission.  Any group outside that, however, can spend all the money it likes to influence the people to change the Constitution.  If, for example, the all-party talks in Northern Ireland are concluded in a number of months' time and there is a proposal to amend Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution, one can envisage a situation where the Government will not be permitted to make its case for that change.  Instead, the material will go through the anodyne process of the independent commission.  However, a group might raise millions of dollars in the United States and mount a massive campaign in the referendum. We have already had evidence during referendum debates of highly resourced and financed groups, some from fundamentalist religious groupings in the United States, pumping <Col N="1082" /> money into campaigns in the State.  There is nothing to prevent that from happening.  A situation could arise where the Government is muzzled in its conduct of an election campaign but powerful interests inside or outside the State, such as media groups or well resourced fundamentalist groups who want to use the Constitution to make a point, as happened in the abortion referendum, could provide finance and proceed to make their case.</P>
    <P>We could also have a situation where the government of another state is not prevented from spending money to influence the public on a referendum to change the Constitution.  The Amsterdam Treaty was negotiated by one Government but is being put to the people by another Government.  If, for example, the next European Union treaty is negotiated by one Government and the referendum is set up, but a general election takes place before it is held and the new Government decides that it has gone too far on the issue of defence so it should be opposed and an alternative negotiated, it could be prevented from advocating its case to the people although it might have campaigned on that issue in the general election.  It could happen that the government of another state which wants the treaty accepted would be enabled to spend money to influence the people of this country on the issue.  Private interests outside Government could do this.  Let us say, for example, that in the context of the conclusion of the talks on Northern Ireland an east-west body is established, and that east-west body between Ireland and the United Kingdom has a function in relation to transboundary pollution, and has powers which would curb the activities of the nuclear industry in the United Kingdom, and let us suppose that body has jurisdiction over the Irish sea.  In such circumstances British Nuclear Fuels or any aspect of the British nuclear industry could conceivably, if it felt strongly enough, put money into a referendum campaign to persuade the Irish people not to pass it.  There is nothing in the legislation which prevents that.  The all-party committee draws attention to the situation where a Government might be elected on a programme of constitutional change but, once elected, would be effectively muzzled in pursuing its case during the course of a referendum campaign.  This Bill is a recipe for muzzling the democratically elected Government of the people.  It is a recipe for the not providing resources to the political parties and to people who are democratically elected and whose business it is to pursue public affairs here, or to groups who have a particular interest in the referendum campaign itself and for allowing <i>carte blanche</i> to any vested interest or anybody with sufficient money to attempt to influence the views of the people in a referendum.</P>
    <P>There are alternatives available to the Government. I commend the arrangements being made in Denmark which seem very reasonable.  There will be a referendum there on 28 May on the Amsterdam Treaty.  Their Government is making <Col N="1083" /> £2.5 million available, the same amount of money our Government is making available, to be administered by an independent committee, but the Danish approach is different.  The fund will be divided in two.  Two thirds of one half will be divided among the political parties, based on their electoral support, to allow them to pursue the campaign.  The remaining one third of that half will be divided among the European Movement and two organised groups opposing the treaty.  The other half of the money will be made available to local organisations, grass roots committees, whether they are for or against the treaty, so that they can make information available to the public.  In the meantime the Government will produce information explaining what is in the treaty.  That seems a much better way of conducting a referendum campaign and providing fair resourcing and equality of treatment between the sides for and against, than the method being advocated by the Government at present.  It would be preferable to have resources made available through political parties, through democratically elected Members of the House, perhaps through local authorities, through the various organisations that have an interest, for example, the social partners, and through local organisations who would be able to use those resources and have a better debate.</P>
    <P>A very dangerous tone is developing in the conduct of public affairs here.  It is as if the last people in the world who should offer an opinion on public affairs, or who should be resourced to inform the public about public affairs, are the people who have an electoral and a democratic mandate from the public.  I am sick and tired of people who did not get an electoral mandate of any kind taking the view that people who have an electoral mandate, who have put their case before the people and who have had their case validated in one form or another, advocating that people involved in public affairs, who negotiate various issues that have to go before the people, who debate those issues and who are very often the most informed about them, should be muzzled when the issue goes before the public.  That is bad for democracy.  It will create a situation where the conduct of referenda will be totally artificial, totally anodyne and totally apolitical.  It is no wonder the public show little interest in referenda, that the numbers of people turning out to vote are declining, and that the most common comment on the day of a referendum is not that people are for or against it but that they do not know anything about it.  The experience we have had over two referenda is that in campaigns where the conduct of debate is sterilised and distilled by independent people of one kind or another, without the passion, debate and argument that go with political debate, the public simply do not know what the issue is about, much less what position they should take on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the establishment of the referendum commission which has the potential to make for much fairer referenda than we have had in the past.  This Bill is a long overdue measure, and it has come about ultimately because the unfair practices of successive Governments in the conduct of referenda have become politically untenable.  It was vigilant campaigners, whether groups or individuals, who swam against the tide of political and media consensus about the European Union who challenged this injustice.  I pay tribute here to the memory of one of those people, the late Raymond Crotty, a courageous and patriotic citizen with whom I had the honour to share a platform on several occasions.  Ray Crotty's constitutional challenge gave back to the people their right to decide on vital issues of sovereignty and neutrality which had been usurped by successive governments.  It was necessary for another citizen, Patricia McKenna, a Dublin MEP &mdash; much respected in her native County Monaghan &mdash; to challenge the Government again after it resorted to unconstitutional practices in referenda by spending public money on one side of the argument only.  Two major treaties, the Single European Act in 1987 and the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, had thus been ratified in an undemocratic fashion by means by which the McKenna judgment found to be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>This Bill goes a long way towards restoring the balance.  I hope the new Commission will be allowed conduct its work thoroughly and impartially. It is required to be &ldquo;fair to all interests concerned&rdquo;, and that must be strictly adhered to in terms of allocation of resources.  The letter and spirit of the McKenna judgment mean there must be equality for the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; sides so that the people can be allowed to make a balanced judgment.</P>
      <P>I said that I hope the Commission will be allowed to do its work, and I stress the word &ldquo;allowed&rdquo;, because there are several ways in which it can be thwarted.  Already the European Commission has been spending public money promoting the Amsterdam Treaty with its booklet &ldquo;A New Treaty for Europe: A Citizen's Guide&rdquo;, referred to earlier by another Member of the House.  This partisan publication constitutes interference in the democratic process and is way beyond the remit of the Commission.  This booklet has been distributed as a free enclosure in at least one Irish magazine.  Public money is indirectly funding this project, and it is thus in breach of the McKenna judgment.  This booklet should be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second way in which the referendum commission can be thwarted is if RTE continues its unfair practices in the allocation of time for party political broadcasts.  If the commission produces television advertisements giving fair and equal treatment to the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; sides, then surely its purpose will be nullified if RTE, as has been its practice, invites parties to do free broadcasts, the duration <Col N="1085" /> of which are determined by the electoral support for the party, regardless of whether they advocate &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  RTE's most recent practice also excluded parties with fewer than three Members of this House.  If repeated, this practice will make a mockery of the commission's efforts to ensure impartiality.</P>
    <P>Recent debate on this issue in the House focused on the unsuitability of newspaper advertisements in recent referenda.  However, the reality is that such campaigns are won and lost on television and radio, from which most people receive news and information.  The onus is on RTE to ensure that the fairness and balance required of it in the coverage of current affairs is not set aside once again in a referendum context.</P>
    <P>The third way in which the referendum commission could be thwarted is if the Government persists with its proposed wording for the Amsterdam Treaty referendum.  This incredible amendment would insert into the Constitution a blank cheque which would give future Governments the power to finally abandon neutrality by agreeing to participate in an EU military alliance. They could do this without resort to a referendum, and the referendum commission would be made redundant in so far as EU matters are concerned.  How would Fianna Fáil feel if a future Fine Gael led Government decided, without consulting the people, to bring us into NATO's Partnership for Peace, which Fine Gael is so anxious to do and which has been advocated by Deputies Bruton and Mitchell in recent weeks?</P>
    <P>It seems the Government's blank cheque may have bounced given that we were to debate the amendment ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty this week.  This debate has been postponed while the Whips are in conclave.  Regardless of whether this blank cheque amendment survives, my party will oppose ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty. The people are being asked to write into the Constitution a commitment to a so-called common European defence and the dilution of our sovereignty and independent foreign policy.</P>

      <P>When launching the Amsterdam White Paper last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, promised a referendum on neutrality.  The same promise was made by his predecessor, Deputy Spring, before the last election but we are still waiting for this referendum.  Our neutrality should be safeguarded in the Constitution by way of an amendment which keeps the hands of future Governments off the people's sovereignty.  The Government should be forced by the people in the upcoming referendum to hand back the treaty and renegotiate it on the basis of our true national interests.  That, Sir, is not rubbish.</P>
      <P>I have judged the referendum Bill on its merits and have concluded that it is a positive step forward. Accordingly, I support its adoption.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I will deal with some of the points raised by them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes asked who will produce the leaflets and pamphlets containing the statements to be issued by the commission.  He questioned the competence of the members of the commission to carry out their functions.  In the forthcoming referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty it will be a matter for the commission to decide how it carries out its functions.  However, given the complexities of the treaty, I expect it will get experts to draw up the statements.  The commission will be responsible for ensuring that the statements are fair to all the interests concerned.  It is not necessary for the members of the commission to be expert on all matters.  They are being given the power to engage experts whose job it will be to produce leaflets etc., in simple and easy to understand language so that the problems encountered by the previous <i>ad hoc</i> commission will not be repeated.</P>
      <P>One got the impression from Deputy Dukes that he believes the five member commission will do everything, but this is not so.  Staff will be provided and the commission will have power under section 4 to engage any type of consultant it deems necessary.  This will enable the commission to organise and fulfil its functions in the limited time available.  My officials have brought the Deputy's suggestion on the distribution of the summary of the White Paper to the attention of the appropriate personnel in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies referred to politicians engaging in debate at a referendum.  There is nothing in the Supreme Court decision or the Bill to prevent politicians from engaging in debate on a proposal at a referendum.  The publication of material by the proposed commission should assist politicians and others in engaging in debate.  The public will be given statements by the proposed commission which should assist them in engaging in debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes said this Bill is not the answer. However, we will not know this until we have seen how it operates.  If changes are needed I will consider the matter further.  I stress that the commission is not responsible for the turnout of voters. The work of the commission will assist voters in coming to an informed decision but it cannot be blamed, as suggested last night, if there is a low turnout on polling day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies referred to the work being undertaken by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution in relation to referendum information.  The Bill is not an attempt to gazump the committee, as recently suggested by one committee member in the press.  It is anticipated that the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty will be held at an early date.  Everyone agrees that it will be difficult for the commission to explain the treaty in simple language.  The Bill is being taken now so that the commission will have the necessary statutory <Col N="1087" /> powers to carry out what will be a difficult task in a short period.</P>
    <P>I will consider any recommendations made by the committee.  The enactment of the Bill does not mean recommendations will not be implemented for future referenda.  Further electoral legislation will be introduced in the months and years ahead in which recommendations can be considered.  The Bill does not include some elements of the recommendations made by the Constitution Review Group and the All-Party Committee on the Constitution in its first progress report.  The question of a further constitutional amendment to give a constitutional basis to an all-embracing commission to include the constituency commission and the public offices commission, together with the proposed referendum commission, will have to be further considered. However, this should not be a reason to delay the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the Danish proposals on referendum information.  An essential part of the Danish proposals is the division of the funding made available by the Danish Government.  As I understand it, the fund will be divided in two halves, with one half being paid to grass roots groupings both pro and anti the proposal and the other half disbursed as follows: two thirds divided among the political parties in proportion to their electoral support and the balance divided equally among three groups &mdash; the European Movement and two organised groups which are anti-EU.</P>
    <P>With respect to the Danish proposals, this scheme would not work in this country.  If we proposed the introduction of a similar scheme we would probably find ourselves in the High Court. In any event the Government favours giving funds to the proposed statutory commission so that it can carry out the functions set out in section 3 in a manner which is fair to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I note the support by Deputy Howlin to a single electoral commission.  A similar proposal is contained in the report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution with the provision that it be given a constitutional basis.  This matter might be considered further by the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government but it should not be used to delay the enactment of the Bill.  If such a proposal is eventually agreed then the Bill can be incorporated in new legislation, at which stage we will have the benefit of practical experience.  If it needs strengthening, such amendments can be included in the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin asked about the accounting arrangements for the proposed expenditure.  The commission and its staff will be bound by all existing public accounting rules and procedures applicable to the public service, especially procurement procedures in the case of engaging consultants. The proposed members of the commission will be fully conversant with public accountability requirements from their responsibilities <Col N="1088" /> in their respective offices.  It is not considered necessary to include in the Bill every detail of such normal accounting requirements. Section 4 refers to guidelines issued from time to time by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The money provided by the Oireachtas will be included in the Estimates of the sponsoring Department and Deputies will be able to raise concerns on consideration of the Estimate.  The expenditure will also be reviewed in the annual audit of the Department concerned.  The Committee of Public Accounts can query the respective accounting officers on the expenditure. Deputy Howlin wondered whether £2.5 million is too much.  As this is the first statutory commission with expanded functions dealing with a very complex treaty, it is difficult to gauge precisely the amount of funding required.  I have no doubt the commission will use the funds wisely and prudently and if it succeeds in not spending all the £2.5 million, so be it.  Like all public sector Estimates, it is not imperative that the total sum is expended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin expressed concern at the wide discretion the commission will have.  While the commission will have wide discretion on how it implements its mandate, it will be bound by the rules and procedures of the public service.  The members of the commission will be fully aware of the norms involved.  We cannot have it every way. The commission is given discretion to decide not what its functions are but how to implement what will be a difficult task.  The range of options open to it is not very wide because the commission will normally work within a limited timeframe.  It must be allowed flexibility.  If the Oireachtas decides to enact the Bill, it should have confidence that the persons proposed as members of the commission will carry out their duties in a competent manner within the norms expected of the public sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe said the Bill does no more than put the former <i>ad hoc</i> commission on a statutory basis.  If the Deputy reads section 3 he will see that the proposed commission has much broader powers than the single-function <i>ad hoc</i> commissions.  The Bill will give certainty to the commission in carrying out its functions in a manner that is fair to all concerned.  The Deputy asked why the Bill is necessary.  The answer is obvious.  It will put the former <i>ad hoc</i> commission on a statutory basis with much broader powers and functions.  That is necessary because of the importance of the subject matter involved.  Legislation is necessary to amend the broadcasting legislation to enable the commission to carry out its functions.  The changes proposed for the appointment of agents by groups follows from a High Court decision.  I note most Deputies welcome those aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made interesting suggestions about funding research, better use of existing structures, the issuing of White Papers and so on. Those matters should be considered but not at the expense of holding up the Bill.  The Deputy <Col N="1089" /> suggested the Bill could lead to a low turn out at the referendum, but I cannot accept that point. The commission will not be responsible for the turnout on polling day, which is determined by a host of factors.  The commission's function is to prepare and disseminate information to the electorate in an understandable format which will lead to a more informed electorate.  Whether people decide to exercise their democratic right cannot be laid at the door of the committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe asked about staff and resources for the commission.  The Minister informed the House last night that the Government has decided to make £2.5 million available to the commission for its promotional work.  The Government has also agreed to the provision of extra staff to the office of the Ombudsman for secretarial work for the commission.  Discussions are ongoing at the moment on the provision of extra staff and resources for the commission.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dukes and O'Keeffe indicated they will oppose the Bill.  They expressed the view that the Government is entitled to campaign for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote using public funds notwithstanding the McKenna judgment and that if there is a role for the referendum commission it should be to determine whether the Government is impartial in the expenditure of public funds at a referendum. They envisaged that legislation should provide accordingly, with its constitutionality tested in the courts.  I find this line of thinking rather strange. In the period of more than two years since the McKenna judgment it has been generally accepted that the Government may not spend public funds on advocating a result at a referendum to the detriment of those on the other side of the argument.  I do not see how the views put forward by the Deputies can be squared with the McKenna judgment.  While the judgment acknowledges that the Government may advocate a result at a referendum they make it clear it may not incur expenditure of public funds in doing so.</P>
    <P>In his judgment, Mr. Justice Blayney said:</P>
    <P>The Government has not held the scales equally between those who support and those who oppose the amendment.  It has thrown its weight behind those who support it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, in his judgment, said: &ldquo;. it is impermissible for the Government to spend public money in the course of a referendum campaign to benefit one side rather than the other&rdquo;. Those extracts from the judgment make it clear the Government cannot spend public funds in advocating a result at a referendum.  It is acknowledged in the judgment that the incidental use of Civil Service facilities do not come within the ambit of the judgment.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Howlin's summing up of the available options resulting from the McKenna judgment, which are to overturn the McKenna judgment by way of a constitutional amendment, accept the judgment and legislate for an arrangement under which information is made available, as in the Bill, or do nothing.  In bringing forward <Col N="1090" /> this Bill the Government has chosen the second option identified by Deputy Howlin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin suggested that of the three <i>ad hoc</i> commissions established at previous referenda, the experience at the first such referendum, the divorce referendum, was the most satisfactory. I agree with that point.  The reason for this was that the statements prepared by that commission were distributed to each household by An Post in the form of a leaflet.  Due to time constraints at the bail and Cabinet confidentiality referenda, the commission had no choice but to insert statements in national newspapers in the form of a notice.  I accept that the distribution of the statement to each household at the divorce referendum was a more cost effective method as compared with newspaper notices at later referenda.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe suggested that as part of the process of providing information there should be an obligation on the Government to prepare and publish a White Paper before each referendum.  I would have no problem with the idea of a White Paper being published elaborating on a proposal at a referendum &mdash; a White Paper has already been published relating to the Amsterdam Treaty.  I do not agree, however, there should be a statutory obligation on the Government to publish a White Paper at each referendum.  By its nature, a White Paper is a document which is time consuming to prepare.  There may be instances where, for example, arising from a court ruling an urgent amendment may be necessary and it would not be practicable to have a White Paper published without unduly delaying the referendum. There is also the question of a fairly simple straightforward amendment, possibly of a technical nature, where a White Paper would not be warranted.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe was a little contemptuous of the provisions of the Bill providing for an arrangement for authorising interest groups to appoint agents at a referendum.  He seemed to suggest that personation agents are unnecessary in modern political circumstances.  The Bill provides for the appointment by approved bodies of agents at all processes at a referendum &mdash; at the issue and opening of postal ballot papers, in polling stations and at the counting of votes.  I remind the House that the provisions of the Bill relating to the appointment of agents are necessary due to a High Court ruling in a case brought by an anti-divorce activist who sought to appoint agents at the divorce referendum.  The Minister could not ignore the implications of that judgment and took the opportunity afforded by this Bill to legislate for an appropriate procedure for the appointment of agents by interested bodies.</P>
    <P>Deputies Gormley and Gilmore referred to the lack of limits on expenditure.  Under existing law, there are no limits on expenditure by bodies or individuals on a referendum campaign.  The McKenna judgment held that while the Government may advocate a result at a referendum, it <Col N="1091" /> could not use public funds to do so to the detriment of the side that opposed the referendum.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not propose to limit expenditure by participants in a referendum campaign.  The point made in the McKenna judgment was not that either or both sides were spending too much on the campaign, but that the use by the Government of public funds to fund the campaign to influence voters in favour of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote to the detriment of those opposed to the amendment of the Constitution was not permissible.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not propose the expenditure of public funds on either side of the campaign, or to allocate public funds to groups campaigning on either side.  It is not necessary, under the McKenna judgment, to control spending of either <Col N="1092" /> side at the referendum.  To do so could result in a limitation on the debate in which interest groups are an integral part.  It could also run the risk of a petition being taken against the result of a referendum on the grounds that it was an interference with the conduct of the referendum. A limitation on expenditure could also have constitutional implications for freedom of speech.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Bill is to ensure that the information which is fair to all interests concerned is made available to the electorate.  This includes a statement of the points for and against the proposal the subject of the referendum.  The Bill also confers on the Commission the functions of fostering and promoting and, where appropriate, facilitating debate or discussion on the subject matter of the referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill which allows us to review all aspects of the running of An Bord Pleanála and the planning process as a whole. The board was established in 1976 as a statutory body and in 1996 it had a staff of 71.  It is financed by a State grant and income from planning fees. In 1996 the grant was £2.315 million and the income from fees was £502,259.  It is an important body which performs functions under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, Air Pollution Act and Building Control Act.</P>
      <P>The Bill allows for an increase in the number of board members, currently restricted by Statute to a chairman and five ordinary members and all Members support the measures being brought forward in the Bill.  The activities of the board are of central importance to the socio-economic development of Ireland.  In recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of planning appeals combined with accelerating rates of economic growth.  We are also experiencing the problem of growing urbanisation and an increasing consciousness of environmental issues.  It is important that the board be expanded as planning issues become more complex while it must also be efficient, utilise modern technology, employ highly qualified staff and be seen to be representative.</P>
      <P>The board represents various interests, including construction and business organisations, planning and professional groups, environmental bodies and general interest groups.  It is important that it be seen to be pro-enterprise and that a balance is struck in that regard.  There are various bureaucratic obstacles in terms of setting up businesses whether at local authority level or in Government Departments.  The board should recognise the important role business plays in the economy and it is relatively easy to ensure that in terms of the membership of the board.</P>
      <P>We have got the concept of a planning appeal right.  An Bord Pleanála should be independent of the political process and the Minister of the Environment and Local Government.  That was not the tradition in past years but on balance the concept behind the board is correct although we criticise its operations from time to time with regard to individual decisions.  In general the system of third party appeals works but there should be transparency in the operations of the board. There is a question mark over some decisions made by it, particularly where it overturns the decision of a local authority.  People ask to whom the board is answerable as it is not often clear to those who have an interest in planning matters. A way to deal with that would be to ensure more transparency on controversial decisions.</P>
      <P>This issue was raised at a convention on the Irish planning system, an initiative of the Minister, dealing with continuity and change on 27 November 1997.  Those attending the seminar were strongly of the view that the report of the inspector should be published and there should be an explanation from the board where a decision has been overturned.  I hope that could be accommodated in a review of the planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unhappy with the role given to public representatives in the operation of the board.  It is not fair to ask them to make a financial contribution in order to submit observations.  It seems a public representative is only entitled to send a letter looking for a copy of the decision when it is determined, and to possibly mention in it whether he is for or against it if there is no financial contribution or if the submission is not made within a particular time scale.  The role of public representatives was examined in great detail when this matter was last discussed in the House. As a public representative I feel somewhat isolated <Col N="1095" /> and do not want to fork out the required fee merely to make observations on behalf of my electorate.  That matter should be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members would agree that delays on decisions should be minimised.  We have a thriving economy, business is expanding and there has been a great deal of overseas investment in hotels and so on.  Outsiders in particular do not understand the delay on the part of the board, but I am sure the Bill will address that matter.  The question of staffing is another important matter.</P>
    <P>I have the honour of being the vice-chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Local Government which has just finalised its work programme.  One of the first items on our agenda is a review of the planning process, which is currently taking place.  Many members of that committee believe the Minister should be supported in the need to examine many aspects of the planning process.  The committee's review is timely given that it is also a priority of the Minister. I am sure many of the matters discussed at the convention on the Irish planning system last November will be considered in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I hope the planning process is improved by public consultation.  Increased public participation and local democracy is crucial.  As I stated at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Local Government, I am amazed at the lack of public involvement in major planning issues.  It is generally only when a planning application for housing is lodged that people take note, but that is too late because the application for residential zoning would have been determined some years earlier.  In many cases listed buildings are demolished before the public realise what is happening.  It is regrettable they are not more vigilant at an earlier stage in such developments.</P>
    <P>Modern communication techniques should be used by local authorities.  There should be proper advertising through the media, leaflet drops and so on.  As stated recently in the debate on the conduct of referenda, large official-looking notices or small advertisements in newspapers are not enough to attract public attention on such matters.  It would be in everybody's interest, including developers, to involve the public on a partnership basis in planning matters.  A great deal more needs to be done in that area.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the enforcement of An Bord Pleanála decisions.  Local inspectors employed by local authorities do not have enough power to deal with breaches of planning permissions and so on.  They appear to be very restricted in what they can do and as a result they tend to adopt a rather laid back and traditional attitude.  We live in a modern European State and regulations should be stringently enforced.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is concerned about abuse of retention provisions.  He referred to this at the seminar <Col N="1096" /> last November and in reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Allen yesterday he stated that circumvention of the planning system should be eliminated.  I agree with his view in that regard.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála has made many decisions on residential developments.  It has often refused planning permission for residential developments on the basis of zoning.  Escalating houses prices, particularly in the greater Dublin area, have turned from a talking point into a potentially serious problem.  An article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last September stated that prices in the Dublin area rose by 25 per cent in one year and that the average price of a house would soon exceed £100,000.  That is well beyond the reach of young married couples even where both parties are earning relatively good incomes.  If the Dáil does nothing else this session, it must address that problem.  While I am aware the Department is taking steps in this regard, something must be done urgently.  Young couples are facing serious problems in the months ahead.  The results of a consultancy study on house prices will be published in March.  I accept this is a complex issue and the Government does not want to introduce a measure that would increase prices even further.</P>
    <P>I welcome the £15 million provided to service more land in respect of water and sewerage facilities. It is important that more houses are built.  Unfortunately, in the current climate city councillors will balk at the possibility of rezoning land in and around the Dublin area.  If there was official recognition of the need for more serviced land, city and county councillors would deal with it.  It is vitally important that more houses are built, more lands zoned for residential purposes and that there is no corruption in the system, a problem that has still to be dealt with.  I hope the Minister's study will address that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief given that a number of Deputies wish to contribute to the debate.  I welcome the Bill, the purpose of which is to increase the number of decision makers in An Bord Pleanála.  Those of us who have been a member of a local authority for many years realise that the planning process, decision making, the objection process leading to An Bord Pleanála can take considerable time.  It is important that the facilities are made available to An Bord Pleanála to enable it to arrive at a decision as quickly as possible in the interests of applicants for the various developments in our constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have moved a long way from the time when decisions were made at political level, usually by the Minister of State at the then Department of Local Government.  Many fine decisions were made at that time.  Unfortunately it became unacceptable that politicians would be involved in the planning process.  Given all the recent controversy, it is well that some of these decisions <Col N="1097" /> were handed over to an autonomous body, either the local authority or An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority for 31 years I have been involved in planning debates, the preparation of plans for my constituency &mdash; the county development plan &mdash; and as a member of an urban district council for the town development plan.  Usually the desire of the elected representatives is that the decisions made in this area conform to the plan we have prepared which has been advertised and on public view with an opportunity for submissions to be made.  When the plan is adopted all applications must conform to it.  That is why I always defend the planning officer at local authority level.  He has the local knowledge, has visited the site, listened to the objections and, through the due process of decision making, notifies the local authority members that he intends to grant permission to the various applicants.</P>
    <P>In my local authority I am pleased the county development officer and the county planning officer bring to the attention of elected members the intention to refuse an application and the reasons.  This allows members, before the decision is made, to debate the reasons an application is refused.  Occasionally, we have found it was possible to achieve a consensus between the applicant, the legitimate objections of the planning officer and the local members.  That process has proved satisfactory in my constituency.</P>
    <P>In the past I have used section 4s in the area of planning and have no apology to make.  Those section 4s were implemented following consultation with the planning officer, having regard to the overall county development plan and the reasons the elected members decided exceptions could and should be made without breaking the principle of the town or county development plan.  We have moved from there because there were cases where the section 4 power was abused and used to direct the manager, under the County Management (Amendment) Act, to do something he considered he should not do and advised councillors to that effect.  At the same time section 4s were pushed through, ignoring all the professional advice available.  That is not how councillors should perform.</P>
    <P>There are still discrepancies where genuine concerns are expressed by local authority members and of which the planning officer will take account.  When decisions are made the objectors still proceed to An Bord Pleanála, as the supernumerary body, to give a decision which has been discussed and debated publicly in the area where the development is taking place.</P>
    <P>There are times when I do not understand the reason An Bord Pleanála will overturn a decision arrived at, following the due process at local level. I have reservations about some of its decisions. Given this procedure I have always refused to be involved in either influencing An Bord Pleanála or giving my opinion about an application on appeal.  However, I have asked it to expedite its decision so that the applicant or the objector <Col N="1098" /> know where they stand.  We have a problem in that local authorities have to go through a public notice process of any developments within their jurisdiction.  This requirement is cumbersome in comparison with the planning application.  In other words if a local authority intends to have a housing development or a development for travellers or otherwise, it is precluded from entering discussions with people in the area before the public notice appears.  Usually when the public notice appears and the consultation takes place much undermining of the original proposal will have taken place because of doubts in people's minds or even deliberate misinformation about a particular development.</P>
    <P>People are always ready to object to proposals, regardless of what they are.  Nowadays people have the attitude: &ldquo;I am all right, I want nothing to happen in my area, I want no developments that will interfere with my privacy&rdquo; and that they must object.  There is also the anomaly that objectors are allowed to object in an area where they have no connections; for example, people in County Donegal could object to a development in County Kerry.  An Taisce and similar bodies prescribed under the Act can use that involvement in applications which do not have relevance to the people listed as objectors.  That is difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>Likewise when a local authority gives public notice of its intent to do something it is appropriate that discussions take place.  I would prefer if preliminary discussions could take place between the manager and the group who would be directly involved in a particular development.  By the time the public notice appears much of the misunderstanding about the development would have been cleared.</P>
    <P>I attended a planning conference recently, at which the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, was present, where a commentary was given by a person from the media who obviously considered himself an expert in the area of planning.  He was inclined to blame everybody for every decision, including the Minister of State for decisions when he was not in the Department.  This person considered Ireland was so precious &mdash; and it is &mdash; particularly its rural hinterland, that nobody should be allowed to live in the countryside, that everybody should be shepherded to villages and towns, hamlets and cities, thus creating a demand for land to be rezoned in these areas.  This does not present a major problem in rural constituencies. It is the philosophy of the media, which has tremendous power, that nobody is entitled to live in rural areas, even the sons and daughters of a land owner, that they should be asked to live in a town or village which is alien to their culture.</P>
    <P>A reasonable attitude should be adopted to development in rural areas, particularly along non-national primary routes.  I defend the stance taken on the number of entry and exit points along national primary routes.  These should be kept to a minimum.  I do not share this philosophy, however, when it comes to national secondary <Col N="1099" /> routes, the proposed realignment of which is used as a reason to turn down planning applications for permission to build houses, even though local authorities previously allowed the construction of isolated cottages and other development along these routes.  This does not mean that development which is not in keeping with an area should be allowed, but wherever possible demands for local authority or private housing should be met.</P>
    <P>The provision of tiphead facilities is another source of contention.  A particular procedure is being followed in my constituency of Tipperary South where such a facility is urgently needed. Independent consultants have been commissioned to conduct a review.  The matter is in the hands of the Environmental Protection Agency which is studying the suitability of the site chosen, Hard Bog.  Although there is spring water flowing through the site, it is impossible to convince local people that it is the correct one.  In spite of this, the local authority has pre-empted the outcome of the EIA and issued compulsory purchase orders in respect of all lands adjacent to the site.  If one pre-empts the decisions of bodies such as An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency in this way, people will lose faith in them.  An Bord Pleanála was established to convince people that decisions would be made by professionals who would be independent in the exercise of their functions, would have no axe to grind politically and nothing to gain.  That is the reason it has been so successful, with some exceptions which have been dealt with by the courts.  I resent the fact that in anticipation of a positive result the local authority has served notice of the compulsory acquisition of the lands in question in the local newspaper.  Who will meet the cost of this procedure if there is not a positive result?  Placing such advertisements in local newspapers is an expensive process.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to allow for an increase in the membership of An Bord Pleanála. This is welcome as we wish to avoid unnecessary delays and requests for further information or additional time to visit a site.  Where An Bord Pleanála decides not to hold an oral hearing or to visit a site, as it is entitled to do, it should refund the additional fees lodged by an applicant.  I have made representations to An Bord Pleanála in respect of this matter.  The Minister has confirmed that under the law there is no obligation on it to refund fees.  I asked the Ombudsman to investigate the matter.  An Bord Pleanála should not retain the additional fees lodged where it refuses to hold an oral hearing as requested.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, the purpose of which is to amend the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, in order to allow for an increase in the membership of An Bord Pleanála which, because of the number of appeals in hand, is unable to address adequately <Col N="1100" /> all of the issues raised within a satisfactory timeframe. Planning legislation has been amended to ensure decisions are made within a period of four months but An Bord Pleanála is unable adhere to this.  I understand it has written to applicants informing them of this and, I presume, seeking additional time to consider their appeal.  This is regrettable.  We should ensure there is an effective appeals mechanism in place to ensure An Bord Pleanála adheres at all times to the requirements laid down and to good planning practices.</P>
      <P>The increase in the membership of An Bord Pleanála should speed up the process to the point where decisions are made much quicker than four months.  An application may have been under consideration for a considerable period before it reached An Bord Pleanála.  That is the reason I would welcome an immediate decision on the provision of adequate staffing and other supports required by An Bord Pleanála so that it could make those decisions in line with good planning practices.  I hope the Bill will assist in the more effective operation of An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>We can improve communication between An Bord Pleanála and public representatives.  I understand from communication I have received from An Bord Pleanála that if I appeal a decision on behalf of one of my constituents I must submit a fee as normal.  However, observations from a public representative can be accommodated.  I ask the Minister to take the opportunity of reviewing the current structures to allow public representatives make observations, support an appeal or make an appeal on behalf of their constituents. That might be done in an overall examination of the current structure.</P>
      <P>We should also try to improve public perception because, on occasions, members of the public are somewhat baffled by decisions made by local authorities and An Bord Pleanála.  We must ensure, if at all possible, that An Bord Pleanála becomes more user friendly.  I am not sure how that can be achieved.  The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is probably more equipped to make recommendations on that but there is scope to improve public perception of the manner in which cases are dealt with by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>An issue not far removed from the concerns of the public in relation to controversial decisions made by local authorities and by An Bord Pleanála is rezoning to which a number of speakers referred.  We have seen a major improvement in planning and rezoning over the past ten years.  As a member of Dublin Corporation I am proud of our record on most planning matters.  I am particularly proud of the genuine input from the public representatives on Dublin Corporation and that of the corporation's professional and administrative planners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern about planning decisions and rezoning has been expressed by the public on occasions.  It is important to clearly state that, by and large, the people involved in the planning process are genuine in what they are endeavouring to do.  I accept that a cloud may hang over some rezoning <Col N="1101" /> or planning decisions but we must acknowledge that the people involved in the planning process are genuine.  That process can be scrutinised by the public and the majority of its decisions would pass any acid test.  I have been a member of Dublin Corporation since 1985 and I understand the commitment and dedication of the professional planners and my political colleagues.  It is important to put down a marker that we are genuine in all decisions made in line with good planning practices, the current legislation and the recommendations made by the professional planners.</P>
    <P>The question of rezoning is controversial, as we know from recent experiences, but it must be accepted that with the growing population, particularly in the Dublin area, and the current economic boom there is a need for mixed development whether it be industrial, commercial, residential or the provision of recreation and sporting amenities.  As the city develops we will have to address this issue in a bona fide way to ensure that we adequately cater for its development and the expansion of other areas that require the appropriate rezoning.  We need to plan many years in advance.</P>
    <P>As a member of Dublin Corporation I participate in a local authority which does not have its own water supply, a graveyard or a dump.  Those necessary services are not available in a city where many thousands of people live.  Legislators, and particularly the Department of the Environment and Local Government, will have to ask those working in the respective areas to produce a plan for the future which clearly identifies areas that will require rezoning to accommodate such needs as we approach the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I welcome the review the Minister has undertaken in all planning and development matters. He has encouraged members of local authorities and the general public to participate in this review.  People who have a role as public representatives, either at local authority or central Government level, should encourage local authority members to participate in that review.  We are frequently contacted by residents' associations or other interested groups in the community who wish to express their concern about certain matters in relation to planning and development.  We now have an opportunity to ask people to participate in the area of planning and development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 30, inclusive together.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to condemn all acts of violence and express my sympathy, and that of the House, to all the families and friends of victims of the recent appalling violence.  I already indicated this in my recent speech in Belfast to the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  I commend the <i>Newsletter</i> and the <i>Irish News</i> on their initiative in launching their pledge for peace campaign.  I also mention the STOP campaign, whose members are also involved here in organising a campaign for peace.  It is important that we all make clear our rejection of violence in all its forms and that we will not be deflected by such violence from the search for a fair and balanced settlement that would bring an end to the conflict which remains at the root of recent violence.  These killings are a grim reminder to us all why these talks must succeed.</P>
      <P>Discussion on the most inclusive basis possible, consistent with compliance with the Mitchell Principles, is the way forward.  As the House will know, the UFF issued a statement on 23 January admitting it had broken its ceasefire for a period but that it had now been restored.  The Chief Constable of the RUC has indicated that during the suspension of its ceasefire, the UFF was involved in the sectarian murder of at least three civilians.  The claim by the UFF that its actions represented a measured military response is outrageous, unsustainable and deeply offensive to the families and friends of its innocent victims.</P>
      <P>Against that background, there was a heavy responsibility on the two Governments to ensure that when the negotiation participants met in London last Monday the Mitchell Principles and the integrity of the talks process were upheld. The issue of the UFF statement and its implications was accordingly raised at the commencement of the proceedings by the two Governments and a plenary session was convened at which the UDP made a statement.  All the participants gave their views and the UDP responded to these.  The two Governments then, under Rule 29 of the Rules of Procedure, considered the question of appropriate action in light of all the material available to them and having due regard to the views of the participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the importance of the issue, I consider it appropriate that I read into the record of the House the conclusions section of the determination <Col N="1105" /> made by the two Governments and issued on Monday last.  It states:</P>
    <P>11.  The Governments regard the UFF involvement in sectarian murders, which has been well attested by information in the security forces' possession, to be admitted in their statement.  The statement itself asserts that these murders were a &ldquo;measured military response&rdquo; to &ldquo;Republican aggression&rdquo;.  If this was the motivation of the perpetrators it is all the clearer that the murders constitute a manifest breach of the first Mitchell principle of democratic and exclusively peaceful means of resolving political issues.  We find the UFF's use in this context of terms like &ldquo;military response&rdquo; outrageous, unsustainable and deeply offensive to the families and friends of their innocent victims.</P>
    <P>12.  The Governments accept that the Ulster Democratic Party may have sought to use its influence to oppose the violence of the UFF, and take full account of the acknowledgement by other participants of the UDP's efforts.</P>
    <P>13.  But there is also no doubt in the Governments' mind that there are close links between the Ulster Freedom Fighters and the UDP, and that the question whether the party has demonstrably dishonoured its commitment to the Mitchell principles has to be considered in the light of that.</P>
    <P>14.  The Governments are obliged to conclude that by reason of the UFF murders, there has been the clearest breach of the UDP's commitment to the Mitchell principles.  The UDP is therefore no longer entitled to participate in the negotiations.  The UDP has now withdrawn from the talks, which in view of the course of events seems to the Governments an appropriate gesture.</P>
    <P>15.  The UFF statement indicates that its involvement in killings has for the present come to an end, in that what it terms its military response is now concluded.  The statement leaves room for doubt, however, as to how unequivocal the restored ceasefire is.  The ambiguity here must be resolved.</P>
    <P>16.  If over a period of weeks a complete, unequivocal and unqualified UFF ceasefire were demonstrated, and established through word and deed to have been fully and continuously observed, the Governments would consider the possibility of the UDP rejoining the negotiations.  The Governments would welcome the prospect in such circumstances.  With that possibility in mind, they, with their advisers, will keep the situation under the most careful review.  The Governments will, of course, do nothing incompatible with the integrity of the process, which depends on the total and absolute commitment of all participants to democratic and exclusively peaceful means of <Col N="1106" /> resolving political issues required by the Mitchell principles.</P>
    <P>The events on which I have reported raised difficult issues, given the attachment of the Government to the most inclusive participation possible, consistent with compliance with the Mitchell Principles.  However, I have no doubt but that the decision taken was the correct one.  It was absolutely essential that we upheld the integrity of the process.  At the same time, we have made clear that if over a period of weeks there is a complete and unqualified ceasefire established by word and deed, the Governments would consider the possibility of the UDP rejoining the negotiations.  The Government would welcome the prospect in such circumstances and, in that connection, I welcome the fact that the UDP indicated that the outcome on last Monday week does not mean the UDP is withdrawing from the political process.</P>
    <P>Following intensive discussions after the adjournment of the talks before Christmas, the two Governments presented a paper to other participants at the talks which set out propositions on heads of agreement.  It was and is imperative to ensure that the talks remain the sole focus.  For the first time in this difficult process we have identified a way to proceed to real negotiations on issues of substance.  These are not detailed proposals or a draft agreement but they are a good basis on which all the participating parties, whose responsibility and prerogative it is to do so, can work towards a widely acceptable agreement.</P>
    <P>While the propositions were presented in the name of the two Governments, they were developed as an aid to discussion from the views expressed by all parties during the discussions in recent months.  The best judgment of the two Governments as to the form of an acceptable and balanced settlement remains as set out in the Joint Framework Document, published in February 1995.  The firm commitment of the two Governments to the position set out in that document as being their best assessment of where agreement might be found in the negotiations, and to the positions in the Joint Declaration, was restated in the joint paper tabled last week by the two Governments to facilitate discussion in strand two.  The three day talks session at Lancaster House in London ended on a positive note with an agreement by delegations to pursue detailed negotiations on the basis of the papers tabled by the two Governments in strands two and three.</P>
    <P>The issues are now on the table and the participants are beginning to engage in discussion on the detail.</P>
    <P>We know that there will be difficult issues to be resolved for everyone before real agreement can be achieved and both Governments are determined to press ahead to find a settlement which will give a firm foundation for peace.  I believe that all parties currently participating in the talks are prepared to seriously engage in substantive discussions.  I will continue to avail of every opportunity, including while the talks are <Col N="1107" /> in Dublin, to meet the talks participants both on a bilateral basis and a multilateral basis and to inject momentum into the talks to ensure that they continue to move forward.  Planning for the talks session in Dublin is being undertaken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  With regard to those parties who have taken the decision not to participate in the talks, I continue to hope that they will reconsider their position.  They know the talks are constituted on an all-inclusive basis in respect of parties that are committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means and the door is always open to such parties.</P>
    <P>Before the heads of agreement were tabled at the talks, all my contacts with the British Government, Northern Ireland parties and US representatives were designed to help us prepare a paper that would provide a map leading towards a future settlement.  I have had intensive contacts with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and the leaders of the Northern parties, including Sinn Féin, and I do not believe it is helpful or constructive to report on these contacts in detail on a regular basis.  I have already reported extensively on my meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in Luxembourg in December and the communiqué and report which we issued on east-west co-operation, when I made a statement in the House on 17 December last.</P>
    <P>I have not been in direct personal contact with President Clinton since 19 December.  While close contacts at diplomatic and official level have continued, as reflected in a number of supportive statements issued from the White House, I have had some helpful and informative meetings with a number of US representatives including Senator Connie Mack on 15 January, Senator Edward Kennedy on 10 January, and Congressman Patrick Kennedy on 20 January.  At these meetings, they continued to offer their support and assistance for the peace process and I was glad to have the opportunity to inform them of current developments.  I also used the opportunity to express our appreciation of their efforts on behalf of Ireland, and the input of all in the USA who have taken such a great interest in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to meetings of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, it was agreed at the last meeting in December that contacts would be made with all the parties to explore their views in this regard.  I understand that this is now being done.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise two questions I did not get the opportunity to raise yesterday.  While I welcome the assurance of the Taoiseach that on every occasion he meets delegations from Sinn Féin he raises the question of the disappeared, those whose bodies have not been returned, a matter I have raised on a number of occasions, does he share my increasing frustration and anger about this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> Many people will remember a well publicised &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; when I had a confrontation with Gerry Adams.  He promised on that programme in 1994 that he would look into this matter. Will the Taoiseach agree it is time we had answers to those questions, particularly in circumstances where at least some members of the leadership of Sinn Féin have personal knowledge of the location of those bodies?</P>
    <P>It is necessary to remind ourselves on occasions that we in this House and the SDLP in the North represent the great majority of Nationalists on this island.  There are occasions when we feel we are being held to ransom.  Will the Taoiseach agree that there are certain matters, such as the matter of consent and the matter of an institution in Northern Ireland, without which there can be no North-South body, on which the views of the great majority of people on this island represented by our parties ought to be taken into consideration?  Will he further agree that it may be appropriate at some stage to remind the Unionists, and for the British Government in particular to remind the Unionists, that while they, the Unionists, claim to be British and say that they wish to be part of the United Kingdom that there are certain rules and conditions for membership of the United Kingdom club that they, too, ought to take into consideration?  Will the Taoiseach agree that at an appropriate time &mdash; I welcome the indications yesterday that there was the beginning of an engagement at the Stormont talks &mdash; it might be worthwhile reminding some of the parties involved that such engagement is not only a matter for themselves but that the rest of us have a particular interest in making sure that engagement increases and that agreement is reached?</P>

      <P>On the Deputy's last question, it is clear it would be useful if all the parties and individuals engaged in the discussions and if as much progress as possible could be made.  I welcome the events of yesterday and last week.  Even though it sounds odd, it is true to say there was more talk through the Chair in the past few days than there has been for 18 months.  I am thankful there has been some progress in that regard and I hope we can continue to move in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to those people who have disappeared and are on the list of people who are believed to be dead or have not been traced over many years, I have continually raised this matter in Opposition, as Taoiseach and it has been raised by people before me and we will continue to raise it.  It falls within that category of issues that are genuinely confidence building measures.  As Deputy Currie said, this issue relates to both sides of the community and yesterday I replied to a question on this matter in relation to one side. Some people believe missing persons come from only one side of the community.  That is not the case.  Many have disappeared from both sides of the community over the years and their where-abouts are unknown.  On each occasion I answer <Col N="1109" /> this question I call on those, whoever they are, who may know something about this matter to use their influence to try to assist those families who have suffered enough torture over the years.</P>
    <P>In relation to progress on a body or institution in the North, as I stated yesterday and there is no need to repeat it, my view and that envisaged in the Framework Document and the document published on the same day by the British Government, is that we are talking about an institution. That institution can only be successful in the context of the three strands.  I have continually reiterated that is what we are talking about.  We are talking about three interlocking strands.  Whatever happens in Northern Ireland cannot be part of an internal settlement but part of the three stranded approach.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his assurance on certain matters.  However, the next time he meets the leadership of Sinn Féin will he point out to them that some of those bodies are within this jurisdiction?  Will he bear in mind that some of the people about whom he is talking have personal knowledge of where some of those bodies are located and the circumstances surrounding that.  Will he point out to those people once again that even in pagan times when a conflict ended bodies were returned and that is the least we expect so that something can be done to assuage the grief of the relatives of those people who have suffered enough?  Regarding the talks, the important element to keep emphasising is that none of the Members of this House wants a partitionist settlement.  The fact that there are three stranded talks is a good indication of that.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach assure the House the Government stands by its stated position that an internal solution, a return to Stormont, is not an option and cannot form the basis of a democratic settlement?  What is needed is a dynamic settlement that has the potential to develop and grow and leave behind us all the failures of partition and the sectarian State that we <Col N="1110" /> have known for decades.  On a clearly related matter, will the Taoiseach acknowledge that Sinn Féin has deplored sectarian death threats from whatever source and expresses solidarity with all who may have received them?  Can he tell the House if he has sought from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Garda an assessment of the source of such threats as there is a widespread belief they are either the work of cranks or those who seek to make political capital from such a climate and they are being deliberately hyped to provide cover for the very real threat from the Loyalist Volunteer Force who, with others, has carried on a reprehensible campaign of sectarian slaughter over the past 18 months and before that?</P>

      <P>As I said yesterday, there can be no internal settlement.  We are endeavouring to work with the three interlocking strands to achieve a fair, balanced and just settlement.  I do not accept any arguments that the proposition documents stated any differently.  They represent a broad map which will lead to a fair and just settlement.  There is no question of an institution in Northern Ireland which will represent a return to Stormont.  I have not heard anyone say that is what they are trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>I have received no information from the security forces, North or South, that any known groups are involved in issuing death threats.  The one letter last week was not from any <i>ad hoc</i> organisation. I responded to Deputy John Bruton's question yesterday in relation to the Unionist politicians in Derry.  There are two sides to that story.  A particular group may have targeted the individual involved but I have no definite information.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask all the parties involved in the talks to deplore the unwillingness of those who know the location of the disappeared to give the information to their families? While not suggesting that any individual has the information, will all the parties ask paramilitary organisations who have information to disclose it now?</P>
      <P>Will the North-South bodies have their own staff or will they rely solely on seconded staff from both Administrations?  Is the Taoiseach aware that it is impossible to operate a proper cross-Border health service, whereby, for example, Dundalk Hospital might service needs north of the Border?  It is impossible to appoint and pay staff, such as hospital consultants, on a joint North-South basis, under existing legal arrangements.  There must be legal arrangements for joint appointment of staff if the North-South bodies are to work.  Staff would then have a joint employer operating across the Border.  Does the Taoiseach agree that this legal requirement must be provided?  How will this work under existing finance sanctions and legislation for the expenditure of moneys and the authorisation of the payment of salaries?</P>

      <P>Much thought has been given to the administration of staff who will work directly for a North-South body.  Regulations will have to be changed as there is no mechanism to deal with it at present.  Apart from the staff directly employed, it will be possible to appoint staff on a co-operative basis.  To take the example mentioned by the Deputy, Comhairle na n-Ospidéal could appoint someone whose remit would be contracted.  The same could apply to the areas of education and the arts.  A change in legislation will not be required for cases where there is co-operation. There will have to be changes to appoint staff who work directly for a body, to allow for accountancy practice.</P>

Would it have to seek sanction from the Department of Finance in Merrion Street, the Department of Finance in Belfast, the Treasury in London or would there be a joint arrangement where one Minister of Finance would, on an agreed basis, consent to a financial issue?

There will have to be an agreed system involving the Treasury and the Department of Finance for administrative purposes.  It is being discussed that rather than each heading going through a bureaucratic system, it would be more administratively effective and accountable to have a separate accounting officer to which money would be allocated.</P>

For how many do the security forces believe different paramilitary organisations are responsible?  The approximate figure is 20, many of which are the responsibility of the <Col N="1112" /> IRA and UVF.  There is an attempt being made to shift responsibility to a broad, amorphous mass of unseen generality of paramilitaries, while the major responsibility lies with the IRA.  It is not good enough for them to seek to get off the hook.</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach explain what he believes Sinn Féin means when it says &ldquo;no return to Stormont&rdquo;? I have never heard, or seen in any documentation, an explanation of what this means. Does Sinn Féin not want a democratically elected assembly in Northern Ireland which will give power back to the people of Northern Ireland and end direct British rule?</P>

      <P>I hope I am not doing Sinn Féin question time, as I would prefer other people to answer those questions.  I have seen the list of disappeared people but I do not want to guess figures off the top of my head.  I have seen a note on this and I could get information for the Deputy if he so wishes.  I would like to repeat what I have said rather than seek to clarify anybody else's argument.  Our negotiating position &mdash; as it was in the Framework Document, as it is in the Propositions Paper and as it is outlined in the strand two and strand three papers &mdash; is to try to achieve a fair and balanced settlement with the necessary constitutional change to have North-South bodies with real executive powers that can administer Departments in the North in a meaningful way, and that there will be no internal settlement.</P>
      <P>Nobody is arguing the case that an old kind of Stormont is what we are talking about.  I have not heard that case put by anybody in the talks.</P>

Will he explain to the House what arrangements are being made to facilitate those talks?

      <P>I appreciate that point.  The talks will be confined to Dublin Castle and all the activities will be confined there as well.  Most of the talks in that week will be on strand two, although I am trying to get people to move away from just one strand, as we discussed here yesterday. Most of the talks will be trying to work on the strand two paper and I hope there will be no difficulties.  I repeat what I am continually saying to the British Government and to the parties at the talks &mdash; the quicker the better we get to a position where we can meaningfully negotiate <Col N="1113" /> without continual analysis and people having major press conferences every three hours.  Most of the time is spent preparing what spin to put on the next matter, but if we continually go down that road the talks will never get anywhere.  I have been trying to get people to have longer working sessions that are not necessarily followed by major press conferences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily agree with the Taoiseach in saying it is important to get away from the phenomenon where every document is analysed in public as to whether it is slightly greener or more orange than the last one.  According to some commentaries, the colour of the paper seems almost to be more important than the content of the documents.  Some of the most trenchant comments are made by people who apparently have not read the documents at all.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the arrangements for the talks in London, the Conservative and Liberal Democrat opposition parties were involved in some informal aspects of the talks? Will similar procedures be followed here to allow Opposition Parties access to the participants, particularly in view of the fact that some of the issues in strands two and three directly affect the prerogatives of this House and the role of Members of the House, both in Government and Opposition?</P>
      <P>In the Propositions Document the Taoiseach has committed us to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into our domestic law.  To the best of my knowledge this is the first time this has been done.  Will that convention be incorporated in our Constitution, thereby overriding or having equivalent effect to the existing constitutional provisions, or will it simply be incorporated in our domestic law, in which case our Constitution will remain superior to the European Convention on Human Rights?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the areas where, in his belief, there is a current conflict between the provisions of the European Convention and our Constitution?  Is he aware of the view that there are some areas in which there is a difference?  Has the Taoiseach any indication of the laws that will need to be changed if the European Convention is to be incorporated into our domestic law and made superior to it?</P>
      <P>Will the Intergovernmental Council, involving the devolved assemblies to apply between Britain and the whole island of Ireland, North and South, have its own secretariat, financial allocation and executive functions, similar to the North-South body?  If not, in what respect will it differ from the Anglo-Irish Council which has already been established by the agreement of 1980 between the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, and the then British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher?  In other words, is the Intergovernmental Council contained in the Propositions Document a new body?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Deputy what it means.  The last line refers to &ldquo;appropriate steps to ensure an equivalent level of protection in the Republic&rdquo;, which is precisely the same language used when the Deputy negotiated the Framework Document, to make sure that we did not get ourselves into the issue the Deputy has outlined, where there are difficulties and differences with our position.  This is a difficult and complex area but one we have to deal with.  Soon we will be the only country that has not incorporated the European Convention into its domestic legislation. Many of the rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights are already covered by the rights established under the Constitution &mdash; both those explicitly set out in the Constitution and those that have been declared to be implicit. However, there are major difficulties in that. There are still areas of conflict and that is why they have not been dealt with.</P>
      <P>On 12 November 1997 when this was discussed in one of the sessions of the talks, I asked the Attorney General and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to re-examine their reports dating from a few years ago when this matter was examined at the time of the completion of the Framework Document.  At that stage, as Deputy Bruton will recall, they had grave reservations about going down that road. Difficulties can arise in regard to issues where our case law, in cases that have been either explicitly or implicitly dealt with in the Constitution or by the courts, would be at variance with the European Court of Human Rights.  We have to deal with these issues in terms of a full agreement, but I have not moved from the position as set out over the years by my predecessors.</P>

The Taoiseach cannot disagree he has stated that appropriate steps will be taken to give an equivalent level of protection in the Republic to that <Col N="1115" /> provided for in the Convention.  That statement implies that an equivalent level of protection is not currently being provided and that things need to be done which have not been done so far.

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Lest I am labelled by Deputy Currie's earlier comment, I am asking this question not as a Nationalist or a Unionist but as a democratic socialist.  Will the Taoiseach agree the mass rally organised by the trade union movement in Belfast last Friday, which I attended, and similar rallies throughout the North are important developments in allowing working class communities across the divide, who have suffered most from the violence and sectarianism, to state clearly that the sectarian killers on all sides do not act for the majority of people in our society?  Although the media exaggerated one incident where a small number of banners, which were out of order, were displayed, that element did not dominate the rally.  Will he also agree it is highly significant that more than 10,000 workers left their workplaces to take part in such a demonstration against sectarian killings?  Will he join in urging the trade union movement to continue to develop this protest across the sectarian divide in the knowledge that action by working class communities can isolate such sectarianism, because self-appointed paramilitaries or sectarian groups on any side do not have the right to attempt to drag working class people and their communities back to the days of sectarianism and killings?</P>

      <P>Over recent years both the NESC and the NESF have made a valuable contribution to the social partnership process.  In response to views put forward by both the NESC and the NESF, in particular the latter's Report No. 16, &ldquo;A Framework for Partnership&rdquo;, the Government announced on 19 December its decision to reconstitute both organisations on a statutory basis. The heads of a Bill are now being prepared and it is my intention to present legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas later this year.  In the interim, both the NESC and the NESF will continue to operate on a non-statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference of the two bodies are being revised to ensure that their activities are fully complementary.  The NESC will continue to provide strategic analysis through its reports and will develop the framework within which discussions on future national programmes will take place.  The NESF will focus on the detailed monitoring of initiatives taken in the context of social partnership, especially with regard to social exclusion and long-term unemployment. <Col N="1117" /> It is intended also that the membership of both bodies will be changed to reflect more fully the various strands of the social partnership process. It is hoped that the invitations seeking nominations will be issued soon.  The exact composition of both bodies has yet to be finalised.  It is envisaged, however, that the composition of the NESC will be five nominees from each of the four social partner pillars, five representatives from Departments and five independent members.  In the case of the NESF, the composition will be 15 members of the Oireachtas, five nominees from each of the business, trade union and farming pillars, 15 representatives of non-governmental organisations, five representatives of Departments, five representatives of local government and five independent members.  The terms of office of members of both the NESC and the NESF will be for a period of three years, during which time members may nominate alternates.</P>
    <P>As regards participation in the negotiations of future partnership agreements, a decision on expansion has not been made.  The Government will bear in mind the views of the NESF, as set out in its Report No. 16, as well as the views of all the social partners.  The widening of the membership of the NESC to include the voluntary sector reflects the views of the NESF.</P>
    <P>Our focus remains firmly fixed on the full implementation of Partnership 2000, which is just over one year old and has more than two years yet to run.  An impressive amount of progress, however, has been achieved so far and it is our intention to sustain that momentum until the present agreement expires in March 2000.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of Partnership 2000, as part of the monitoring procedures, I will attend an annual meeting with all the parties to the agreement. In respect of 1997, I fulfilled that undertaking at the July meeting which focused largely on the themes of enterprise promotion, job creation and modernising the public service.  I regularly meet the individual social partners both on a formal and an informal basis.</P>
    <P>Accompanied by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, I met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on Monday, 26 January to discuss a number of current issues, including a review of progress in the implementation of Partnership 2000, the outlook for the Irish economy and Ireland's entry into EMU.  At this meeting I reaffirmed the Government's commitment to the implementation of Partnership 2000 and to working with the social partners to strengthen the spirit of partnership.  It was agreed the Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the other social partners will work more intensively in the coming year under Partnership 2000 to ensure the benefits of economic growth are shared fairly among all the people.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Tánaiste and I met representatives of IBEC on Monday last.  We agreed that the Government, IBEC and the other social partners would work more intensively in the coming year under Partnership 2000 to ensure that economic <Col N="1118" /> growth and its benefits are sustained.  We underlined the crucial importance of continued adherence to the pay agreement in Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The latest plenary meeting to monitor Partnership 2000 took place on Tuesday, 27 January and focused primarily on competitiveness and budgetary related issues.  The next meeting will take place in April and it is envisaged it will deal with the themes of enterprise and agriculture, food and forestry.  The monitoring of Partnership 2000 will benefit from the revised terms of reference of the NESF, which reflects the views of the forum as set out in Report No. 16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was an agreement reached during the Taoiseach's meetings with the social partners that they would come together with the Government to deal with any shocks which might affect the economy after the Irish pound has locked into a relationship with other EMU currencies and if, for example, there is a sudden fall in the value of sterling which will affect certain export sectors and there is a need to share the burden to avoid redundancy?  Was an agreement reached on a mechanism to deal with the problem of asymmetric shocks?</P>
      <P>As regards the change in the terms of reference of the NESF, did the Taoiseach say the NESF would have a primary monitoring role?  If that is the case, does that mean it will not be continually involved in policy making as well as policy monitoring? If it is to be confined to monitoring and not to policy making, surely that is not the appropriate place for Members of the Oireachtas to be involved given that the role of the Oireachtas is policy making rather than monitoring of policy?</P>
      <P>Why is it necessary to put the NESF and the NESC on a statutory footing?  Does the Taoiseach not see that by putting it on a statutory footing it will be more difficult to make changes? Social partnership in Ireland is a living thing.  New needs arise, new bodies need to be represented and some, perhaps, need less representation than they had in the past.  If everything is written in stone and statute, it will be harder for these institutions to work as they should.  If institutions of social partnership which have been put on a statutory basis in other countries, such as the Economic and Social Council in France which is provided for in its constitution, have not worked at all because they became rigid, stratified and formalised, surely a non-statutory approach might be better?</P>

      <P>In terms of the legislative basis, this has been in the process for some time.  The NESC has not changed its structure.  It has been involved over the years in detailed economic analysis.  The NESF has been only five years in existence.  It is felt that as a mechanism of developing social partnership as a concept it is better that they have a legislative base.  One could argue either way about it but a commitment was made to these bodies, and the people involved in those bodies believe this is the way to go.  If one were to draw a logical conclusion it would be that the joint labour committees, the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission etc., should have been set up on a non-statutory basis, but that would not work because these organisations have a particular role in developing partnership.  In the context of partnership, it is now put forward by the social partners that these bodies should be set up on a permanent basis.  I do not see NESC changing in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>The NESC and the NESF are not just part of the social partnership system. The NESC was providing detailed reports representing industry, trade unions and agriculture long before social partnership.  It just happens to have been its report which brought the social partners together in l986 and put forward the first document which led to the Programme for National Recovery.  It had other roles and functions and still does.  It is involved in the analysis of factors within the economy and in reporting on them.  The NESF did it from another view-point where other bodies, including the Houses of the Oireachtas, had an involvement, although they are not social partners <i>per se,</i> in the same way as farmers, employers or trade unions.</P>

      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect the legislation relating to the NESF and the NESC to be brought before the House?  Is it intended in the meantime to change the membership of the NESF and the NESC?  What mechanisms will be used to encourage the co-operation or better co-ordination between the two bodies which has been recommended by the NESF?  Can the Taoiseach indicate in what way the proposed changes in relation to the membership of these two bodies differ from what is already there?  Is he simply adding the voluntary community sector to the NESC?  What changes is he thereby making to the NESF?  I am not making a specific argument for it, but does he not think he should perhaps consider that if public representatives have a valuable role on the NESF, they have an equally valuable role on the NESC?</P>

      <P>I hope the legislation will be ready this year.  In terms of the changes, we are largely following report No. 16 and trying to tidy up where the briefs cross.  That is what both organisations would wish.  The NESC continues to do its detailed analysis, bringing together the reports while the NESF is involved in the implementation of policy, particularly in the voluntary community sector.  Strong arguments have been made regarding the involvement of local government in these issues, and that is a good idea. Local government has been excluded from these processes for a long time, and should have a meaningful involvement that stands up to scrutiny. Both bodies would agree with that involvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The lack of integration between the various social services of an income related nature administered by Government Departments and State agencies has been a matter of concern for some time.  This lack of integration can result in duplication of effort by those agencies involved in administering income support schemes, since each agency carries out its own means test.  This issue has been highlighted on a number of occasions in the House and by various commentators.  Complaints have also been received from people regarding the number of times they have to provide the same information to different State agencies to receive their entitlements. <Col N="1121" /> The report of the interdepartmental Committee on the development of an integrated Social Services System, published in 1996, sets out a framework for the development of an integrated approach to the administration, delivery, management and control of publicly funded income support services.  The basic objective is to introduce greater coherence into the provision of these services. One of the issues being addressed in this context is the question of sharing information, including means data, within and between agencies involved in the delivery of social services. The Deputy will be aware of the requirements and obligations set out under the Data Protection Act to protect the privacy interests of individuals when information about them is processed.  My Department is currently in the process of preparing legislation which will allow for the sharing of data, under specified circumstances, between the various agencies.</P>
      <P>The aim is to put in place over time better administrative procedures by the various State agencies which will enable them to share the latest available means data for a customer.  The means information could be stored on a Central Means Database, which has been developed by my Department which could then be accessed by relevant agencies where the customer has made a claim for an allowance, grant, etc.  This would help ensure a better and quicker service for customers.</P>
      <P>In relation to the means tested schemes operated by my Department, there is a need to balance the desire for uniformity and consistency across all social welfare means tests with the need to ensure that the system is sufficiently flexible to be able to respond adequately to the specific needs of differing categories of customers.</P>
      <P>The different methods of assessing earnings between the various social assistance payment schemes reflect, in many instances, specific policies being pursued by the Department, which are aimed at targeting particular groups of recipients for special attention.</P>
      <P>For example, the means test associated with the one-parent family payment scheme acts to encourage and facilitate lone parents to enter the active labour force by enabling them to earn up to £6,000 a year without affecting their entitlement to the payment.  It is recognised that unemployed lone parents face many difficulties in trying to access the labour market, particularly in relation to child minding expenses, and as a consequence they are particularly at risk of poverty.  This measure is designed, therefore, to specifically encourage such people to gain a foothold in the labour market, thereby reducing their dependence on social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the means test associated with the unemployment assistance scheme has been restructured to make it easier for claimants to avail of casual and part-time work opportunities and to ensure that they are always better off as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> My Department will continue to seek to streamline the administration of means tests in the interests of improving the quality of service to customers and of ensuring that their specific needs are reflected in the nature of the means tests involved.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the present system is a waste of time and money in that a person applying for dole, a medical card and a rent allowance is means tested by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the health board and the local authority? He must also undergo another means test if his daughter wishes to avail of a higher education grant.  If the Minister agrees with me, why have no steps been taken to simplify the system?  The first phase of the excellent report produced some years ago was supposed to be brought into effect within one or two years.  Why is there no single means test or central database which could be used for different means tests?  Does the Minister understand the frustration felt by people who want a better and more streamlined system to be introduced as quickly as possible?</P>

      <P>An integrated social services system is designed to ensure a flexible integrated approach to the administration and delivery of services.  A committee was established in 1993 with a specific brief and it produced a report.  The previous Government looked at the report and recommended certain procedures to move it on. The Social Welfare Bill will provide for a certain number of tests and will move on the issue so that there is greater flexibility and standardisation across agencies.</P>
      <P>It is facile to say that one means test could be used for all services as agencies have different criteria and also cover different areas.  For example, in considering applications for a medical card the agency has to take into account financial as well as medical issues.  A number of reports produced in recent years recommend the setting up of a unique identifier which can be used by all agencies to obtain and transfer information.  Obviously this will be subject to the restrictions imposed by the Data Protection Act.  I assure the Deputy that reference will be made to this in the Social Welfare Bill, which I hope his party will support.</P>

It does not matter if there is a single means test or a central database so long as there is a simple way of doing the job.  I am concerned at the Minister's reference to the Social Welfare Bill which the Taoiseach told me on the Order of Business this morning will be circulated next week.  Will all the legislative problems in this area be overcome in the Social Welfare Bill or will it simply provide for one means tests for each person?  Will the problems which arise from the Data Protection <Col N="1123" /> Act be overcome by way of amendment in the Social Welfare Bill?  Will the legislative jungle be cleared so that a new system can be brought into operation this year?  If so, I will certainly support the section of the Social Welfare Bill which deals with this issue.</P>

      <P>Short-term social welfare payments have been treated as reckonable income for tax purposes since 6 April 1993 in the case of disability benefit and 6 April 1994 in the case of unemployment benefit.  Long-term payments such as social welfare pensions have always been reckonable for tax purposes.  The extent to which a tax liability arises in an individual case will, of course, depend on the level of other income which a social welfare recipient or their spouse receives in the relevant tax year.</P>
      <P>All social welfare payments by my Department are made directly to the recipient without deduction of income tax.  In the case of disability benefit recipients who are employed, arrangements have been made for employers to apply taxation on the basis of my Department notifying the taxable amount of disability benefit to be taken into account.  Where the recipient is not employed, the Revenue Commissioners take into account the disability benefit paid when adjusting the tax free allowances of the recipient or his/her spouse.  They take account of unemployment benefit paid when dealing with claims for refunds of tax after a person becomes unemployed, when employment is resumed or when reviewing the tax affairs of recipients or their spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government decided in October 1995 to defer plans for the introduction of a system of direct taxation of short-term social welfare payments and to continue with the existing indirect system.  A major factor in that decision <Col N="1124" /> was the likely impact of direct taxation on a significant number of recipients, many of whom would be on relatively low rates of payment.  I have no plans at present to change the current arrangements.</P>
    <P>In the context of Partnership 2000, arrangements have been agreed to reduce the impact of taxation on income for certain social welfare benefits.  Under those arrangements, with effect from 6 April 1997 the first three weeks of disability benefit were exempted for tax purposes and this will be extended to six weeks with effect from 6 April.</P>

      <P>I support the decision by the previous Government to defer plans for the introduction of a system of direct taxation of short-term social welfare payments as it would make the system very bureaucratic.  With all due respect to the Deputy, the introduction of such a system would be very unpopular as the present system works well.  When the previous Government looked at the issue in 1995 it was estimated that approximately 20,000 people in receipt of unemployment benefit would suffer a reduction in their weekly payments if they were taxed at source.  It was also found that 5,300 recipients of disability benefit would be liable to tax.  It was accepted that any move in this area would impact on people on relatively low rates of payment, the less well off in society.  There are cases where difficulties arise, but taking into account the examination carried out then and that carried out subsequently by me and the concessions suggested <Col N="1125" /> in Partnership 2000, the position has somewhat eased.</P>

      <P>I agree some people were in receipt of low social welfare payments, but the problem arises where the spouse is working. Friction is caused in households when at the end of the year the spouse receives a bill for £300 or £400 and the person drawing unemployment benefit feels his independence is gone.  That causes much more hardship than would a reduction of £1 or £2 per week from the social welfare payment.  Some people find it very difficult to pay the lump sum and have to take out a loan for that purpose.  Will the Minister have discussions with the organisation for the unemployed to see if a solution can be found to this problem?</P>

While I accept there may be difficulties in some cases, it is better to leave the system as it is because it is working well.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy refers to the position of self-employed people who were over age 56 on the extension of social insurance to the self-employed in April 1988.  The figures the Deputy seeks are not readily available but it is estimated there could have been up to 20,000 self-employed people over age 56 when PRSI was extended in 1988.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension a person must, <i>inter alia,</i> have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension. They may be covered for widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions subject, of course, to satisfying the normal qualifying criteria.  However, self-employed people in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56, could qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  In the Social Welfare Act, 1997, provision was made for self-employed contributors, who entered insurance in 1988 but were already over the age of 56 at that time and who had previously paid social insurance contributions as employees, to receive a refund of the pensions element of their self-employed social insurance provided they do not qualify for an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  Heretofore, their earlier contributions precluded them from receiving such a refund.</P>
    <P>From 21 November last new <i>pro rata</i> pensions were introduced so that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period will qualify for an old age contributory pension.  A yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 gives a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  To qualify a person also needs to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions.  This measure will be of benefit to many self-employed contributors.</P>
    <P>I will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible.  I have asked my Department to examine the general issue relating to the self-employed group aged over 56 in April 1988.  As any proposals would have a major cost implication they would fall to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>Any person resident in the State can qualify for an old age non-contributory pension which is payable subject to a means test.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept there is a great injustice to a limited number of people who were forced to make payments and are now denied contributory pension?  Will he give an indication of the number of people involved?  I suggest the figure of 20,000 is not the true figure.  We are talking about those who do not qualify for a pension, those who applied for non-contributory pension and were refused.  Has there been a proper assessment of the cost of granting pension to those people?</P>

      <P>The figure of 20,000 is an estimate. Some people believe that is a conservative figure, that there might be many more people in this position.  If the scheme was extended it might open the floodgates.  The figures quoted are astronomical and I have queried them.  The overall additional cost could range from £370 million for those aged between 56 and 60 years and up to £756 million for those aged 56 to 66 years.  The rate of increase in contribution that would be required to finance that proposal could range from 1 per cent to 2.4 per cent over a 50-year period.  The most recent revised figures are estimated at £500 million based on 20,000 people claiming.  In the context of the recent actuarial review, I have asked that the figures be updated and I hope to have them in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am not blaming the Minister unduly &mdash; those figures were mentioned last October when I first raised this issue.  The figure varies from £750 million to £350 million.  That is not proper accounting.  Will the Minister accept there is a serious anomaly here and will he quantify the cost of remedying it?  I am aware of a case where a person is 18 days short of the required contributions to qualify for contributory pension and in other cases people are short of the required contributions by only weeks or months.</P>
      <P>Perhaps a <i>pro rata</i> pension, particularly for those who are close to the limit, or the acceptance of further contributions would solve the problem? Will the Minister accept we are talking not about an ongoing problem but about a group of people who were over age 56 in April 1988?  That limited number of people were forced by new legislation to make contributions and are now denied contributory pension.  That problem will not arise again because everybody is now in the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it will not arise again. It is difficult to give an exact figure, and that is one of the major difficulties in estimating the overall cost.  Everyone will accept there is an anomaly here, and we are considering ways in which it can be corrected.  It will not be easy.  It will be extremely costly and it will have ramifications. Fixing an anomaly at one stage, just moves the problem further down the line.  I want to look at all the proposals and in the light of budgetary constraints, see if anything can be done.  Proposals which will have knock on effects elsewhere will be difficult to justify.  If implemented they will create additional anomalies which may be worse than the one to which the Deputy referred. That would put pressure on me or on subsequent Ministers to change it again.  At the end of the day, there must be adherence to some level of contribution.  Various groups who have looked at this set ten year's contributions as the benchmark, and that is reasonable.  However, I accept there are difficulties, particularly following its introduction for the self-employed in 1988.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the 1998 social welfare budget increase of £125 million in the context of 1997 savings of £160 million; and the future proposals, if any, he has by way of reallocation of savings or otherwise for social inclusion measures during 1998.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the 1998 budget measures in the social welfare area will be £125 million this year and £225 million in a full year. This is the largest budget package in many years &mdash; £11 million higher than the budget presented in 1997 by the previous Government, an increase in the region of 9 per cent on the previous year.</P>
      <P>The budget provided for a £3 increase in all weekly rates of social welfare payments, together with a 3 per cent increase, in general, in the rates of qualified adult allowances.  It also provided an overall increase of £5 per week in the maximum rates of payments for pensioners aged 66 and over.  These represented real increases &mdash; over and above expected inflation &mdash; of between 2.2 per cent and 5.4 per cent.</P>
      <P>When these increases come into effect at the start of June 1998, all but two payment rates will have exceeded the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Furthermore, from September child benefit will be increased by £1.50 in respect of the first and second child, and £3 in respect of the third and subsequent child in a family.  Family income supplement will be assessed on a net income basis from next September as promised in Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>These improvements represent substantial progress towards meeting the commitments to social inclusion measures contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium and in the Partnership 2000 agreement.</P>
      <P>As regards the 1997 savings of £160 million, a significant element of my Department's administrative effort is committed to programme control and anti-fraud activities.  The work involved is ongoing and the savings that accrue are incorporated in the annual estimates and budget process when expenditure proposals are set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's budgetary provision for social welfare improvements was determined in the light of overall budgetary and economic requirements, and also took account of the various commitments regarding social inclusion contained in Partnership 2000 and in the Government's programme. As a result of this year's initiatives, the <Col N="1129" /> commitment to spend an additional £525 million on social inclusion measures &mdash; including social welfare rates increases &mdash; during the three year period of the partnership has been more than exceeded in the first two years, largely because of the large increase this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought this budget provided an opportunity for fair play for everybody, particularly for the weaker sections of the community. Does the Minister accept that it is not fair that, when there is a great deal of money around, the social welfare budget, which is the main instrument for helping the needy and the underprivileged, does not even get the savings it made last year?  From that point of view, does he accept that, essentially, trimming the social welfare budget at a time of such enormous prosperity is not fair and it is not sharing the wealth of this society with those in greatest need?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>These savings are built into the figures in the Estimates and they are not available to us.  The budget package is the largest since the early 1980s, when the rates of inflation led to high nominal increases in social welfare payments. What was given in the budget is one of the largest social welfare budget packages, if not the largest budget package, in recent times, and it is significantly larger than that of the last year when Deputy O'Keeffe's party was in Government.</P>
      <P>It is not extra money.  It is money which is already built in to the Department's expenditure. The Deputy may want to argue about whether the savings made in the Department should be handed out.  If he wants to go down that road, there were savings of £156 million in 1997 and, in the budget year cost, we gave £125.  In 1996 there was a saving of £141 million and that Government gave £113 million in the budget year cost.  The previous year the saving was £124 million and £80 million was given.  I am just making the point that it is wrong to make that argument because it is not tenable.  The savings are already built in to the Estimates.  It is the actual increase, which is given not only in the budget year but in the overall year cost, which makes the difference.  The £125 million and the £225 million in a full year was one of the most significant increases for social welfare recipients.  That is widely accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not complaining about the savings.  I am delighted control and anti-fraud measures are ensuring that money is not going to people who do not deserve it.  I would be particularly happy about that if I thought the money in question was funnelled to, and focused on, those who really need it.  It is in that context that I am comparing savings of £160 million last year and the provision of only £125 million extra for social welfare this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that we have never had it so good, the economy is flying and the country is bursting with wealth and there is a duty and an obligation to stretch ourselves to ensure <Col N="1130" /> the benefits of the Celtic tiger reach the under-privileged? From that point of view and in the interests of fair play will he agree it is a rather miserable approach to confine the social welfare increases in that way and that, consequently, the poverty gap has widened in our society?  Does the Minister accept that can only lead to alienation and that the social dividend which is available from fair play for all will not now ensue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The savings are already built in to the budgets and they do not bear out what is given in the budget package.  If the Deputy wants to make that argument, £124 million was saved in 1995 and in 1996 only £80 million was given as a budget package.  In the December 1997 budget package the budget year cost was £124 million, a 9 per cent increase on the previous budget, which was £113 million, which, I must remind the Deputy, was in an election year.</P>
      <P>The budget increases of £5 which we gave to old age pensioners involved an increase of between 5.4 per cent and 7.4 per cent above a rate of inflation expected to be somewhere in the region of 2 per cent.  At no stage when the Deputy's party was in Government did it come anywhere near giving that percentage increase to old age pensioners or, indeed, the general increase which we gave, taking into account the rate of inflation then.  I do not accept this was creating a poverty trap.  I know the Deputy must make his case, but this was one of the most generous budget packages for many a long year.  The vast majority of people accept that.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people, who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention, and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of last September, 9,930 people were in receipt of a carer's allowance at a cost of over £36 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1990, the allowance has been improved and expanded progressively over the years.  As announced in the budget, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance is being increased from June by £5, from £70.50 to £75.50, for those over the age of 66 and £3 for carers under 66, from £70.50 to £73.50. In addition, the budget also provided for two additional improvements for carers.  These include a disregard of non-national disability pensions up to the maximum level of the old age contributory pension in assessing means and the provision of a free travel pass to all those in receipt of carer's allowance in their own right.</P>
      <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can obtain the benefit and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.  In line with these commitments, an overall review of carer's allowance is being carried out within the Department.  This review is considering the purpose and development of the scheme in terms of its current operation and its future development.  It will also examine the potential for the development of provision for carers through the social insurance system and the role of the private sector.  The review is expected to be completed by the middle of this year and it will be published.  Any changes in the scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

Does he also accept that they carry out their work each day for no payment &mdash; without the luxury of a break &mdash; and that they have been badly treated not only by the Government but by society in general?  Does he further agree that carers expected that a reasonable deal would be forthcoming from the recent budget but their hopes were dashed?  Is the Minister ashamed that he could not do more for carers? Does he accept that, apart from the individuals involved, it is in the interests of society to support <Col N="1132" /> carers and encourage people to allow the elderly, the disabled and the handicapped to remain at home rather than placing them in institutions?</P>

      <P>The scheme has been progressively improved in the interim.  The fact that a review is taking place to consider the objectives of the scheme and its future constrained my approach in the recent budget.  As already stated, the Government made a policy decision to provide a significant increase in the rates payable to carers, namely, £5 for those over the age of 66 and £3 for those under 66.  In itself, that is a significant increase in the money carers receive. When the results of the review are forthcoming, I hope to introduce additional benefits in the area of carer's allowance.</P>

Does he also accept that while every situation involving carers is different there are, in addition to the regular expenses incurred from caring for an infirm or disabled person, respite or nursing costs?  In that context, will the Minister consider the proposal I made prior to the budget that, apart from a relaxation in the means test to allow additional people to qualify for carer's allowance, there should be a carer's respite allowance available to all carers?  I proposed that a modest figure of £1,000 be paid twice a year, the 30,000 carers who look after people who require full-time care and attention should be given a carer's respite allowance and, in addition, the top-up payment should be based on means.  Will the Minister give serious consideration to this reasonable proposal from the point of view of the carers in question and the kind of society we should be attempting to develop?</P>

As Deputy O'Keeffe indicated, <Col N="1133" /> everyone has ideas about how the carer's allowance scheme can be improved.  Does the Minister agree that recent improvements to the carer's allowance scheme did not result in new carers qualifying for payment but merely benefited those already in the scheme?  Does he also agree that the criteria for qualification remain the same as last year?  In the context of the review, will the Minister consider the issue of residency and the requirement that people must live with the person they care for 24 hours a day?  There are circumstances where that is not appropriate. Having previously occupied the Minister's position, I appreciate the difficulties involved but this issue must be addressed if we are to tackle the 30,000 people who provide care on a full-time basis.</P>

There is room for a further relaxation of the rules in that regard.  I accept that the numbers involved have not been extended in any great measure by the changes in the scheme.  However, we did not want to interfere with the scheme and be forced to withdraw amendments to it if something major, which we had not anticipated, emerged from the review.  I am an extremely strong supporter of the scheme as it has stood the test of time.  We must make a quantum leap in the coming years and this is one of a number of key issues that involves all Departments, not only mine.  We are examining pensions in terms of the ageing population and how that will be addressed. There are broader issues involved but in regard to the carer's allowance I assure Deputies it is being examined as intensively as possible and hopefully in the coming year we will be able to do something significant in that regard.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing a free travel pass for carers but why must they wait until October for it?  Has he examined what it would cost to introduce it in April, for example?  Carers often take those they look after to hospital but in the summer months it would be valuable if the carers could take those for whom they care out in the fine weather as it would be good for them.  The reason the budget was introduced before Christmas was so that benefits would be provided earlier than in previous years.  It will be next winter before they receive the benefit of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined in the newspaper interview, assisting lone parents and their families to achieve greater financial independence and move out of poverty is one of my key concerns.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that the most effective route out of poverty is through paid employment and the policy of my Department is therefore to encourage and facilitate lone parents in moving into the labour force.  Significant steps have already been taken in this direction with the introduction of an annual earnings disregard in the means test for the one parent family payment.  This allows a lone parent to earn up to £6,000 a year and retain title to the maximum rate of payment.  While it is too early to assess the success of this measure in encouraging lone parents to take up employment, I am satisfied this is the type of support lone parents need if they are to take advantage of employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Another issue which I am aware is of great significance to lone parents is the withdrawal of rent supplement paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, on taking up employment of more than 30 hours per week.  This issue is being examined in the context of a commitment in Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>I also consider access to further educational opportunities important for lone parents to improve their chances of securing employment. To this end, lone parents in receipt of one parent family payment can avail of a number of full-time educational opportunities while retaining full title to their social welfare payment under the recently introduced back to education programme.</P>
      <P>We need to build on such measures and I assure the Deputy that my Department is actively examining ways of assisting lone parents in gaining a foothold in the labour market and achieving greater financial independence for themselves and their families.  In this regard, I look forward to receiving the report of the Commission on the Family, which will be available shortly.</P>

      <P>Can I take it the reply given by the Minister in the Sunday newspaper interview was not intended to indicate a clawing back of the allowance for lone parents once they take up work?  Concern was expressed to me by lone parents as they felt the reply implied that the allowance they are allowed to retain will be reduced in order to make them less dependent on social welfare.</P>
      <P>What proportion of lone parents claim the allowance and also work?  There is a perception that every lone parent is working and claiming lone parent's payment, but I understand the proportion is low.  Has the Minister a figure for the proportion of married women in the labour force as a comparison?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a figure for married women in the labour force.  According to the 1997 labour force survey, 38,700 lone parents were in employment.  The number of people claiming lone parent's allowance was 75,300 in <Col N="1136" /> December 1997.  Approximately 7,000 lone parents are participating in community employment.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to change the allowance and if I gave that impression, it was not intended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 31, 32, 54 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The free schemes such as the free electricity allowance, the free telephone rental allowance and the free TV licence are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition.  In addition, widows and widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the qualifying conditions of the free electricity allowance scheme is that the applicant must be living alone or living only with certain excepted people.  People in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance do not qualify as excepted people and there are no plans to expand <Col N="1137" /> the number of excepted categories to include recipients of unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>The range of the free schemes currently available does not include assistance towards the cost of cable television charges.</P>
    <P>As announced in the budget, people in receipt of invalidity pension, disability allowance and blind person's pension who transfer to certain other social welfare pensions, for example, widow's and widower's contributory pensions, will retain their entitlement to the free schemes. This measure will extend the current arrangement which allows only for invalidity pensioners who transfer either to retirement pension at age 65 or to widow's or widower's contributory pension at age 60 or over, to retain their free schemes.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over, as well as to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare-type payments.  The purpose of the scheme is to encourage such people to remain active in the community by providing them with access to spare capacity on a range of services provided by the CIE group of companies as well by 56 private transport operators who also participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to extend the free travel scheme to include taxi services.  However, as Deputies may know, licensed private transport operators participate in the free travel scheme and the Department will consider further applications from this group.</P>
    <P>The individual proposals raised by the Deputies would involve additional expenditure which could be considered only in a budgetary context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I tabled refers to the free electricity allowance only.  As I am sure the Minister knows, many pensioners who live with a son or daughter in receipt of social welfare benefit do not derive any benefit from that person.  I ask for discretion in this matter.  Very often that son or daughter can be an encumbrance on the pensioner.  They could have a drink or drug problem and be using part of the pensioner's allowance to feed their habit.  In specified cases the conditions of the household should be examined and if the pensioner deserves to have free electricity he or she should get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that Deputies from all sides have had difficulties over the years with the free schemes.  Successive Governments have relaxed the schemes, but the type of change suggested by the Deputy would have huge budgetary ramifications.  I cannot see any way of going as far as he suggests in any future budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the free travel scheme is unfair given that people living in areas where there is a public transport service can avail of it, but people in <Col N="1138" /> other areas do not derive any benefit from it? There is a huge anomaly in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there are anomalies in the scheme and from time to time officials of my Department meet groups to discuss how to deal with the problem.  The scheme depends on the availability of transport.  Apart from the CIE group, 56 private operators participate in the scheme and as far as possible the entire country is covered.  I accept, however, that some areas are not covered.  There are ongoing discussions to try to resolve the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In general the free schemes were introduced to assist people living alone. Although it may not have been intended, does the Minister accept they discourage pensioners from living with a family member?  Does he accept that in many cases it would be more appropriate for an elderly person to have somebody living with them?  Many of the elderly living in rural areas are prey to criminals and, from a social point of view, pensioners in urban areas should be encouraged to live with a family member. Will the Minister re-examine the schemes from that point of view?  Question No. 27 refers to a person on unemployment assistance living with a pensioner.  Surely, from a society point of view they should be encouraged to live together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent times there have been changes to take account of the Deputy's concern. The household composition rules no longer affect eligibility for free schemes of applicants over the age of 75.  That was a much sought after change. I will examine other possible changes to facilitate, in particular, people living in exposed regions of urban and rural areas.</P>

      <P>Recent weeks have seen an intensification of random sectarian killings on the streets of Northern Ireland.  The list of the dead has grown and our television screens have been filled with the grief-stricken faces of the bereaved.  I convey once again, on behalf of the Irish Government and people, our deepest and most heartfelt sympathy to the relatives and friends of the latest victims of violence.  Nothing we say or do can compensate for your terrible loss but we can undertake to pursue the search <Col N="1141" /> for lasting peace with renewed vigour and determination. I call on all constitutional politicians to join me today in doing this.  It is the least we can do in memory of those killed &mdash; and it is perhaps the best answer we can give to those responsible for these terrible deeds.</P>
      <P>We have made a certain amount of progress in the multi-party negotiations in recent weeks.  On 12 January, following intensive work over the Christmas break, the two Governments tabled their Propositions on Heads of Agreement paper, as a basis for discussion to help participants move forward to agreement.  On 27 January, the two Governments tabled joint papers on strand two and strand three and parties agreed the following day to take the questions in these papers as a reference point for further detailed work in these strands.  This week the focus is on strand one.</P>
      <P>Such progress as has been made is very much to be welcomed.  No one expected the multi-party negotiations to achieve results overnight.  At the same time, the talks process has been in place since June 1996 and we are fast approaching the time when it will have to deliver on what it was set up to do.  Much attention has been paid to the roller-coaster nature of the talks process and it is a tribute to the strength of the process that it has survived all the stresses and strains.  At the end of the day, however, the talks process is still just that &mdash; a process.  If it does not yield results, the process will gravely disappoint the expectations of all the people in these islands and we will be faced with a vacuum and the risk of this being filled by senseless violence.</P>
      <P>In calling for accelerated progress in the talks, I recognise it was inevitable that time would be needed before parties could feel comfortable with the talks process.  I acknowledge too the achievement represented by the fact that parties with such differing perspectives and convictions are prepared to take part in the same negotiating process. I accept that parties needed time to give the fullest possible exposition of their positions. However, it is now time to move on.  The participants in the talks have come to know each other well; we know each other's positions and we know in broad outline what is required for a mutually acceptable settlement.</P>

    <P>In essence, such a settlement will involve balanced constitutional change; Northern Ireland institutions including an assembly, exercising devolved executive and legislative responsibility; a North-South ministerial council and North-South bodies with executive powers; an East-West intergovernmental council, for purposes of co-operation involving the two Governments and devolved institutions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; standing intergovernmental machinery between the two Governments for interaction and co-operation on non-devolved matters; equality of treatment provisions and measures to establish an acceptable peaceful society, dealing with issues such as prisoners, measures to deal with the concerns of the victims, security in all its aspects, policing and decommissioning. <Col N="1142" /> All of these elements are inter-linked, the underlying principle being that nothing is agreed, until everything is agreed.</P>
    <P>Such then is the broad outline of a settlement. As to the detail, the papers on strands two and three tabled last week made clear that the two Governments remain firmly committed to the positions in the Joint Declaration, and to those set out in A New Framework for Agreement.  We will draw on these as we seek to flesh out the settlement.  The Government is already engaged in doing this.</P>
    <P>Mention of the framework document almost invariably provokes a hostile response from Unionists.  This is mistaken.  The framework document is not a Nationalist blueprint for a United Ireland.  It is a document which was drawn up not just by the Irish Government but by the Irish Government and the British Government over many months.  It represents, still, the two Governments' best assessment of where agreement might be found in negotiations between Nationalists and Unionists.  In other words it is based on an extensive search for a compromise between Nationalist and Unionist positions and I ask Unionists to view it in that light.</P>
    <P>For our part, the Irish Government &mdash; as must be clear from even the most cursory read of the framework document &mdash; is not afraid of compromise. We are not seeking domination or conquest. We are not some ogre intent on smothering unionism.  We do not view these negotiations as a win-lose contest.  What we want to achieve as a result of these negotiations is a win-win situation for nationalism and unionism alike.</P>
    <P>What we want to see is a level playing field where nationalism can coexist in healthy competition with unionism; where Nationalists can feel they too are first class citizens and that it is just as respectable to be a Nationalist as a Unionist; and where Nationalists can feel that their rights and aspirations have equal validity and enjoy equal respect and recognition to those of Unionists. In short, we are talking about rectifying an imbalance, not about creating a new imbalance. We understand the past too well to want to recreate it.  We want to put the past behind us and move on.</P>
    <P>Close co-operation between the Irish and British Governments and proactive leadership by them has always been essential to securing political progress in the North.  That is as true today, as it was at the time of the Joint Declaration or again, of the framework document.  I am happy to report that the two Governments are working well together.  The joint papers of 12 and 27 January represent our most recent efforts to inject forward momentum into the talks.  We will both continue to give the necessary leadership as required. If the current process is to succeed, it will require the proactive participation and engagement of all the parties involved, to the maximum extent possible, in all aspects of the negotiations.  They can participate confident in the knowledge that, as set out in the various basic reference documents I <Col N="1143" /> have mentioned, any settlement will have to embrace all the broad elements I have set out, and cannot give undue preference or emphasis to any one strand in what is a three-stranded process.</P>
    <P>Accordingly I take the opportunity today to appeal to all the parties, on the basis of the assurance I have just outlined, to join us in making a concerted and intensive effort to reach agreement on the detailed lines of a settlement before Easter. There can be no question that this is a feasible timeframe.  We have the building blocks and we know what has to be done.  All that is needed is the resolution to do it.</P>
    <P>I make a special plea to the people on this island, North and South, to give their political representatives the space in which to negotiate a settlement.  I make a separate appeal to the parties to put inter-party competition aside in the interests of the greater good.  The statement and restatement of maximalist positions and inter-party point-scoring may afford a certain basic satisfaction.  They are certainly well tried and trusted.  They will not, however, deliver a lasting peace.  For that, compromise &mdash; and a willingness to compromise on all sides &mdash; is essential.  As has often been said, we have today a great opportunity to put the past behind us and to build our own future.  The vast majority of the people on this island, North and South, want peace and they are relying on us, as their elected representatives, to deliver it.  Time does not stand still.  If we &mdash; the representatives of nationalism and unionism fail to discharge our mandate, others will chart a very different course for us.  It will be a future based on and perhaps even worse than the terrible violence of the past.  We cannot let that happen and for our part, I pledge the Irish Government to do everything in its power to ensure that it does not happen.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the excellent working relationship at intergovernmental level.  I pay particular tribute to my counterpart, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair for his Government's decision to establish a full scale judicial inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday.  The Prime Minister's close personal engagement on this issue was critical in securing this very welcome result; and it is illustrative of the degree of his commitment to the Northern peace process generally.</P>
    <P>The decision to re-examine Bloody Sunday has a wider &mdash; and perhaps more important significance than this.  It shows, once again, that those who say that nothing ever changes in Northern Ireland are wrong.  It is not of course the first such change.  We have had the ceasefires, the establishment of a more inclusive negotiating process than ever before and the decisions taken by the Orange Order last year which helped to avert serious conflict during the marching season but it is a further change for the better and it comes at an important time.  Everybody, not just Nationalists, can draw encouragement from changes such <Col N="1144" /> as these which lay a foundation of hope on which we can build.</P>
    <P>While the two Governments are actively engaged in moving the process forward, we are appreciative of the assistance and encouragement given to us by our friends in the United States.  It is almost a cliché to say that we are grateful for the support of President Clinton but his personal knowledge of and engagement in the situation in Northern Ireland has been critical.  From the time of the granting of visas to Sinn Féin representatives, his visit to Belfast and his ongoing engagement with those involved on all sides, the President's grasp of the issues and the timing of his interventions have invariably been helpful.</P>
    <P>The role of Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith, her brother, Senator Edward Kennedy, and other members of the Kennedy family has also been vital.  It is difficult to imagine achieving the depth of co-operation between Dublin and Washington without their drive and determination.</P>
    <P>Nowhere has the help we have received from the United States been more evident than in the contribution of Senator George Mitchell.  His tireless efforts as chairman of the talks have been an example to us all.  His skills, with those of his co-chairmen, General John de Chastelain and Prime Minister Harri Holkeri, whom I met in Dublin yesterday, coupled with their independence and impartiality, have been key ingredients in the process.</P>
    <P>While the engagement of the US administration and President Clinton in particular has given a vital political dimension and impetus to our efforts, the goodwill of the United States, the European Union and the international community generally has also been harnessed in a way that brings real, practical benefits and has a direct impact on people's lives.  Since it was established, the International Fund for Ireland has supported 3,400 individual projects involving total expenditure of £350 million, while £320 million has been committed by the European Union to the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. These programmes are designed to help those most affected by violence to rebuild their communities and lives.  All this represents a huge political and capital investment in peace.  The international community has put its faith in us to secure a peaceful future.  We have an obligation to show that they are right.</P>
    <P>All of us engaged in this process have had to show a greater willingness to understand each other's positions and constituencies than we did before the process began.  Engagement in real politics is about finding acceptable compromises that everyone can live with.  For too long politics in Northern Ireland was about taking a position and not moving, not engaging, simply saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Everyone around the table is committed to reaching an acceptable agreement.  We all acknowledge that the rights and aspirations of both communities in Northern Ireland must be accommodated.  Simple solutions, while attractive <Col N="1145" /> at face value, will not serve the kind of situation we face, a situation of competing rights.  We will have to strike fine balances.  Because what we are seeking to achieve is subtle and complex does not mean it is unachievable.</P>
    <P>We do not need to be condemned to a future of mutual hostility, suspicion, fear and violence. We must take control of our destiny and reach an accommodation that will lead to a peaceful future based on a fair and balanced settlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has often been said that the first thing to do in trying to solve a problem is to establish what the problem is.  There are a wide variety of versions of the problem of Northern Ireland.  Some republicans take the view that the problem is that we do not have a united Ireland and that if we did, there would not be a problem. Some Unionists take the view that the problem is that the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland has never accepted the Union, that it should do so and that if it did, there would not be a problem.  At a deep level, the level of core belief, far too many people hold one or other of these two irreconcilable viewpoints.</P>
      <P>The two positions are irreconcilable in the sense that no compromise between them is possible. Northern Ireland is either part of a united Ireland or part of the United Kingdom.  As long as the question continues to be posed in those terms, it cannot be solved by agreement.  The holding of these irreconcilable positions contributes to sectarianism.</P>
      <P>People are not born sectarian.  Let me illustrate the point by referring to something that is happening in the Republic, the growth of racism. Racism and sectarianism are more or less the same thing.  People are not born racist any more than they are born sectarian.  What happens is well illustrated in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 3 February based on an interview with Malaysian medical students in Dublin.  One student had the following to say about her recent experience in Dublin:</P>
      <P>In the beginning when I first came it was great, everyone was really nice and hospitable but in the last few months things have changed. It has been difficult the way people stare, the looks they give you.  Old women bless themselves when they see us.  I have even been spat at.</P>
      <P>That is what has been happening in Dublin in recent months.  We can hardly claim, therefore, not to understand sectarianism in Northern Ireland, we are seeing how it can develop in our midst.  If we could understand the reasons for the recent growth of racism in this State, we might begin to understand the roots and sources of sectarianism in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my guess that racism has grown in the Republic because of an underlying sense of insecurity.  People feel insecure about the economic boom and frightened by the rapid pace of change.  We want to revert to an old familiar <Col N="1146" /> Ireland of the past.  Immigrants, by their presence, seem to prevent that return to the simple, uncomplicated past for which we crave in our response to the many insecurities of the present.</P>
    <P>The same thing is happening in Northern Ireland but over a longer period.  Sectarianism is growing because of insecurity about the future. People do not know where things are heading and crave for an imagined past which never existed but which appears cosy and comfortable from the perspective of the insecure present.</P>
    <P>The answer to racism is the same as the answer to sectarianism: give people a sense of security about the future and they will no longer feel hostile to those who seem to threaten their ability to revert to an idealised past that never existed. Sectarianism and racism are attempts to revert to a past that never existed.</P>
    <P>Racist feelings in the Republic are predicated on the assumption that we can get back to the idealised Ireland of the l950s where everybody had the same skin colour, was happy and lived in complete communion with one another.  Anyone who lived through the l950s will know that that never existed.</P>
    <P>Likewise, some Unionists have created a myth in their minds about idealised conditions that existed prior to the fall of Stormont.  The truth is that prior to the fall of Stormont Northern Ireland was not such a wonderful place in which to live, either for Unionists or Nationalists, and the Union was never fully accepted by Nationalists at any stage.</P>
    <P>Some republicans would go even further back in their search for an imagined past that they wish to recreate.  They have some idea of a united Ireland of the kind that existed prior to the Norman invasion of 1169.  If only we could reverse 800 years of history, the Ulster Plantation and the settlement of l921, everything would be fine.  That is nonsense.</P>
    <P>None of these versions of the imagined past can be recreated and none of them is particularly attractive.  The tragedy of Northern Ireland is that sectarianism is increasing.  There is more residential segregation, more people living in one religion housing estates than even before the first IRA ceasefire.  There was far more residential segregation of Catholics and Protestants at the time of the IRA ceasefire than there had been at the time of the first civil rights march.  It is increasingly infrequent for Protestants and Catholics to live together.  In the past it was working class areas only that were religiously segregated but now, increasingly, middle class areas are segregated also.  Any house sold on the Malone Road now is sold by a Protestant and bought by a Catholic.  The same is happening in reverse in other areas.  The fact that Alderman Andrew Davidson is leaving his home in Eglinton in Derry because of a death threat is a metaphor for what is happening throughout Northern Ireland.  Ordinary Protestants and Catholics may not be the recipients of death threats but they are quietly moving to separate neighbourhoods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> These unnoticed residential movements display a profound fear of the future.  They also make it much more difficult for genuine cross-community institutions to work.  If people do not meet those of another religion at school or in normal social life, how can we expect them to forge political alliances?  Protestants and Catholics continue to meet in the workplace, but that is the only remaining point of contact in many cases.  At 5 p.m. they head home to their own neighbourhoods to meet people who are exclusively of their own religion and to be with their children who have spent the day at schools which are also exclusively attended by others of their own religion.</P>
    <P>This slow motion segregation is also reflected in voting patterns.  The centre ground has been weakened, comparatively speaking, in recent elections and preference voting across the religious divide is becoming less frequent.  Even in the privacy of the polling booth people think in terms of &ldquo;our&rdquo; community and &ldquo;their&rdquo; community. The current problems in the talks stem from this growing sectarian segregation.  It is very difficult to trust people whom you never meet.  It is equally difficult to meet people whom you do not trust.</P>
    <P>This is at the heart of the stand-off about a meeting between the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Féin.  The Ulster Unionists should meet Sinn Féin.  Sinn Féin has an electoral mandate.  The Ulster Unionists are in the talks as is Sinn Féin, so why not a bilateral meeting?  Is that really the point?  The Unionists are talking to Sinn Féin in the business committee and in the round table discussions taking place today and yesterday, so why is a bilateral meeting with no one else present so important?  The only reason it is important is that it has not taken place.  If it took place, it would no longer be important.  The controversy about the UUP-Sinn Féin bilateral illustrates the way people constantly ask themselves how empty the glass is, not how full.  That in turn comes from a sectarian mind-set which in turn derives from a profound fear of the future felt by both communities equally.</P>
    <P>Will the institutions that emerge from the current talks process reverse the fear, the segregation and the sectarianism that continues to grow as we speak?  Unless these new institutions do that, they will not work because the psychological conditions will not exist to make them work.  On the other hand, the sight of Unionist and Nationalist political leaders wearing the same jersey and working together as Ministers to solve practical social and economical problems will go a major distance to healing the divisions between their constituents.  It will be difficult.  The political leaders will need support.  That is why both the settlement itself and the process by which it is reached must leave both communities feeling secure.  Only if they feel secure will the fear of the future diminish.  Only if the fear of the future diminishes will sectarianism diminish, and only if <Col N="1148" /> sectarianism diminishes will the institutions work on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>That is the reason I worry about the real viability of a settlement which is formalised on the basis that either side continues to insist on its ever present aspiration to something much better than the existing institutions and much more in favour of their own position.  I realise that compromising on an interim settlement while aspiring to something better is common in politics.  In that sense nothing is ever permanent in life, but it is rare that radically conflicting aspirations can easily co-exist on the fundamental constitutional question of the nature of the state to which allegiance is given by those co-operating in a power sharing Government.</P>
    <P>Such aspirations, of their very nature, make the other side feel insecure.  For example, a power sharing solution in which Unionists took part but continued to assert their aspiration to simple majority rule might not work very well.  That can be applied in reverse also to the aspirations of other communities.  A formula that the whole settlement could be overturned, on the basis of a particular interpretation of the principle of consent by just 51 per cent of the people, would be difficult to work also.  The transitional nature of the institutions might, of itself, make it difficult to get the full hearted co-operation of whatever section felt threatened by the other side's aspirations.</P>
    <P>This is not an issue that is currently at the forefront in the talks.  Indeed the participants seem to accept that others have aspirations which conflict radically with their own, but it is a problem that could arise once the agreed institutions are up and running.  The aim, therefore, should be to create a three stranded system of Government which will, in and of itself, command the primary allegiances of both communities.  Anything that makes these institutions more difficult to operate should be avoided because any political institution can be frustrated by a recalcitrant minority. This Dáil works on the basis of consent by the Opposition.  That is why the institutions in Northern Ireland will only work if there is both Unionist and Nationalist consent, but consent requires a modicum of trust.  Will the new agreed institutions of themselves create the necessary trust? That is the key question.  These new institutions of their very nature will be inherently difficult to operate.</P>
    <P>The institutions to emerge from the three strands of the talks will involve what I would describe as multi-polar, variably geometric federalism. They will be multi-polar in the sense that there will be a number of poles of power provided for in the institutions.  London, Dublin, Belfast, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Brussels will be recognised poles of power.  There will be variable geometry in the sense that the power relationship between Edinburgh and London will not be the same as that between Cardiff and London or between London and Belfast.  The relationship between Dublin and London will be of an entirely <Col N="1149" /> different character from that of the three relationships I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>We have already seen the difficulties with a much smaller amount of variable geometry created within the European Union.  The British variably geometric opt-out from economic and monetary union is an example of something that is causing great difficulty for the rest of the Union and for us on this island in particular.  The settlement will also involve federalism in the sense that there will be the sharing of power between different layers of Government.  Such sharing of power is part of the human condition.  It is a myth that any nation state was ever fully sovereign.  Absolute sovereignty was a myth generated by British imperialism in the 19th century and it should never have been adopted as part of Ireland's national objectives.</P>
    <P>Formalised federalism is not easy to operate, as we can see from the United States, Canada and the European Union.  It is difficult to work out a neat, watertight division of function between different layers of Government.  There will always be disputes, the results will often be messy and the decision making slow and expensive.</P>
    <P>My concern about the outcome of the all-party talks is not that they will be insufficiently comprehensive. The three stranded approach guarantees that every aspect of the problem will be tackled; that is a great strength.  Nor am I concerned that the outcome will be insufficiently fair.  I believe the outcome will be very fair.  My only concern is that the institutions will be so complicated that normal Government decision making will be exceptionally slow and difficult.  People need Governments that can make decisions.  If too many important day to day decisions have to be mediated through very complicated institutions, there is a real risk that decisions will be taken too slowly for the needs of the people.  If that happens, there will be frustration and that frustration could undermine the political institutions and the overall political settlement to which they give effect.</P>
    <P>Institutions earn respect only if they work. There has been no detailed public analysis of how the three stranded institutions would work on a day to day basis.  Taking the example of the North-South bodies, will they come within the remit of the Irish Comptroller and Auditor General or the British Comptroller and Auditor General? Will the funding for those bodies be agreed by the Department of Finance in Dublin, the treasury in London, the Department of Finance in Belfast or some joint creation?  How will the funding of those bodies be divided between the UK Exchequer and the Irish Exchequer?  Will the North-South bodies have their own civil servants or will civil servants be seconded to them from the UK and Irish Administrations?  Seconded officials will tend to look over their shoulders to the employer to whom they will eventually return.  The European Commission would never have worked if it had been staffed by officials seconded from national administrations.  The <Col N="1150" /> European Commission only worked because it created a new European Civil Service.  Exactly the same questions I posed about the North-South bodies will also have to be posed about the Council of the Isles and there is also the Northern Ireland internal administration.  The working of the internal Northern Ireland institutions is crucial to the whole edifice.  If they do not work, neither the North-South body nor the east-west body will work.</P>
    <P>Within the North the probability is that all decisions would have to be taken by what is called &ldquo;sufficient consensus&rdquo;.  According to the ground rules &ldquo;sufficient consensus&rdquo; means that any decision has to be supported by parties which, taken together, obtain a clear majority of a valid poll, which between them represents a clear majority in both the Unionist and Nationalist communities in Northern Ireland.  In practice that means a minority in Northern Ireland could prevent an agreement that a majority supported if the minority was large enough to represent a majority within one of the two communities.  That means in practice that the Northern Ireland involvement in the Council of the Isles, which the Unionists want, could be paralysed by parties representing barely 51 per cent of the Northern Nationalist community.  Likewise, it means the Northern Ireland participation in the North-South bodies, which the Nationalists want, could be paralysed by parties representing only 51 per cent of the Unionist vote in Northern Ireland, even though a majority of the population in Northern Ireland wanted the North-South bodies to work.</P>
    <P>I am not making those points to test the three stranded approach to destruction.  The truth is there is no better option available than the present three stranded approach.  There is no better option available than the present talks and the present talks' participants have the necessary goodwill to do business.  I know that, having spoken to them last week.  I made those points because it is important to find solutions to those difficulties in good times and to stress that the institutions, no matter how brilliantly devised, will only work if there is willingness at grass roots level to allow them to work.  That is why the fundamental cancer of sectarianism must be tackled in Northern Ireland just as the fundamental cancer of racism must be tackled in our State.</P>
    <P>The Christian churches need to take a much more active role on the issue of sectarianism.  I am a supporter of denominational education but in the situation of Northern Ireland I believe the Christian thing to do is to support integrated education. Separate education is a luxury Northern Ireland cannot afford.  Children in a divided society, who are sent to separate schools, will not get to know one another sufficiently well to work in harmony with one another politically as adults. All clergymen should withdraw from outside organisations that are exclusive to one religion or political view.  It is wrong that Protestant clergymen are members of the Orange Order.  It would <Col N="1151" /> be equally wrong if Catholic clergymen were to associate themselves too closely with one political party or one political point of view or aspiration. The role of a Christian church is to give moral leadership based on the universal teachings of Christ and not to associate itself too closely with its community as against the needs of some other communities of believers or unbelievers.  The best inspiration the people of Northern Ireland could find at present is to be found in the life of Gandhi.  He stood up against anti-Muslim sectarianism in his Hindu community.  He went on a fast to his death to stop it.  He was willing to sacrifice his life to oppose sectarianism in his community. That is the sort of example that is needed, the example of self-sacrifice, anti-sectarianism and anti-racism, not an example set by finger wagging at others, but an example set by sacrificing oneself.</P>
    <P>Regarding the recent developments in the talks, at present the negotiators in Belfast are dealing with strand one on the basis of a series of questions put by the British Government to the participants.  I regret it appeared up to yesterday at least that Sinn Feáin had not taken part actively in those strand one discussions.  I understand Sinn Féin listen and take copious notes, but as yet has offered no contribution.  It must engage in strand one discussions.  The negotiations were set up on a three stranded basis and Sinn Féin entered them on the basis that there were three strands, one of which was within Northern Ireland.  It cannot opt out now for ideological reasons.  Last week in London the participants started to deal with strand two, the North-South dimension.  I understand the Unionist engagement in those discussions was less than total, but there was a measure of engagement with the strand two questions posed by the two Governments.  Strand three has yet to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I read through the series of questions posed by the Governments for strands two and three. Those strands affect the powers of the Dáil considerably. It seems that all parties in the Dáil should be involved in an appropriate way in the discussion of strands two and three issues.  This Dáil debate while welcome does not allow for any real engagement by the Opposition parties in the House on strands two and three issues.  I suggest a forum be provided within the House for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The questions posed by the Governments in their paper are non-directive.  They read a little like an exam posed by a teacher to a class with a view to demonstrating to them how little they know so that when the exam is over and the teacher produces his or her version of the answers he or she will appear to be much more knowledgeable than the students.  I believe the two Governments have ready made answers to all the questions they are posing and are simply giving the participants enough time to fail to answer them in order that the Governments will bring forward their proposals in the most favourable <Col N="1152" /> conditions possible.  That sort of gamesmanship might be inevitable and necessary, but it is not healthy.  The two Governments have a clear obligation to produce much more detailed scenarios for the working of those various institutions.  I can understand the Governments' reluctance to produce a prescriptive formula at this stage for the North-South body or the Council of the Isles, but the Government should at least produce three or four different and potentially workable scenarios for each of the two strands.  Then the participants would have something to get their teeth into.</P>
    <P>I will illustrate the difficulty facing the participants in dealing with that Government questionnaire by referring to what happens in the Dáil. The Government does not produce a series of questions on crime, housing or health and get us to fill them out in an opinion poll manner in the House.  It produces legislative proposals which the Dáil can agree, disagree or amend.  In reality it is only on the basis of detailed and fully worked out proposals from the Government that the Dáil is able to function as a deliberative assembly, yet the two Governments who operate in that manner at home are expecting the talks' participants in Belfast to function as a deliberative and negotiating body, not on the basis of solid proposals, but on the basis of a type of open-ended questionnaire. That is not realistic politics.</P>
    <P>We should know what the two Governments' realistic scenario is for the conclusion of the talks by May.  They are currently working on the basis that by May there will be agreement in the three strands to create interlocking institutions between those strands which will put in place multi-polar variably geometric federalism &mdash; I am waiting for a better definition, but I believe that is an accurate one.  It is obvious the agreement will have to be very detailed because it will have to be put to the people in a referendum.  A scheme that was not detailed could not withstand the sort of criticism that occurs in contested referendum campaigns, and this campaign will be contested. Unless every question can be adequately answered, including hostile trick questions, proposals may be rejected in a referendum in the North or the South on the grounds of caution alone.</P>
    <P>No loose ends can be left in any of the three strands, if the overall agreement is to be put to a referendum.  Given the present state of the negotiations, this raises questions about the timetable.  It is realistic to expect that by May the negotiations will have reached some form of outline agreement, but an outline agreement is not enough to put to the people in a referendum for the reasons I have given.  There is another difficulty.  Included in strand three is the establishment of an institution which is supposed to interact with the Welsh and Scottish assemblies.  However, these assemblies do not exist.  Presumably their consent will be required for any institutions involving them.  Will we be ready to put proposals to referendum <Col N="1153" /> involving strand three institutions until this is clarified?</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting the Governments should unilaterally abandon their May timetable for the conclusion of the present phase of the talks but there must be substantial progress by May if the process is to remain viable.  In that sense, the Governments are right to continue to inject a measure of urgency into proceedings.  However, I have doubts about the views expressed by the Secretary of State in the past few days when she seemed to imply we would have a referendum immediately after May.  We will not be ready for a referendum at that stage.  The talks will have to resume in September to finalise some of the details on the heads of agreement which I hope will have been reached by May.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable length of life left in the talks process.  It is not simply a question of keeping them on the road for another two months.  We may have to keep them on the road until the end of the year at least.  This means that the enforcement of the Mitchell Principles is not an academic matter.  We need to ensure the Mitchell Principles are enforced throughout the full likely duration of the talks process.</P>
    <P>The talks process is, historically, by far the best hope for a comprehensive settlement.  However, there will be no settlement unless positive leadership is shown in both communities to end sectarianism. The best leadership is leadership by example.  We need visible, strong and anti-sectarian leadership, directed at their own communities, from Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP and all participants in the talks.  Each of the parties must confront the sins of their supporters, not those of their opponents.  If Unionist leaders are to confront and disown Orange sectarianism, Nationalist leaders must confront and disown the legacy of IRA violence.</P>
    <P>The agreed institutions should command the allegiance of every section of the community.  The three stranded institutions &mdash; not an aspiration to something better &mdash; should be the primary focus of the allegiance of all the people.  Only in that way will the fear of the future, the genesis of sectarianism, be banished from Northern Ireland forever.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;what about&rdquo; should be banished from the vocabulary.  When an inquiry into Bloody Sunday was announced, the Unionist reaction was to ask, &ldquo;What about the arms crisis of 1970?&rdquo;.  When Unionists engage with Sinn Féin in round table talks, Sinn Féin's reaction is to ask &ldquo;What about a bilateral?&rdquo;.  When Nationalists look for progress on North-South bodies, the Unionist reaction is to ask &ldquo;What about the Northern Assembly and its powers?&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;what about&rdquo; mentality is to be found in both communities and displays a deep-seated unwillingness to discuss anybody's agenda but one's own.</P>
    <P>A settlement will work only if each side deliberately sets out to address the other side's agenda as a first priority and seeks to achieve its own objectives by means of the other side's agenda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" /> That, in my experience, is the key to successful negotiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's debate takes place against the background of the recent horrific killings in Northern Ireland which pose a grave threat to the peace process.  Since Christmas, violence, or the threat of violence, has sadly, once again, temporarily become part and parcel of the daily fabric of life in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>At the outset it should be stated quite explicitly that the indiscriminate murder of people causes nothing but pain and misery to the families so grievously affected.  It is not acceptable that people should be fearful of going about their ordinary business because of the threat of indiscriminate and random death.  There is a palpable fear of the sectarian nature and current level of violence in Northern Ireland.  Terrorising the Nationalist community must stop and extreme elements on all sides must resist the temptation to resort to violence and murder.</P>
      <P>It is clear that extremists on both sides of the conflict wish to see the peace process fail.  As constitutional politicians, all in this House, sworn to serve the Constitution and respect democracy, must insist this conflict is solved by democratic means alone.  However, the prospects of the peace process failing are too real and awful to contemplate.  Democrats on all sides, North and South, and throughout these islands must work even harder to ensure the peace process stays on track and we remain focused on achieving the goal of peace on this island.</P>
      <P>The opportunity to reach a lasting settlement, and with it peace, still exists.  It is imperative that all parties involved in the process redouble their efforts now the all-party talks process has entered a critical and new phase.  Progress will be achieved only through dialogue and discussion.  It would be foolhardy not to admit there will be difficulties. Consultation, courage and compromise from all sides will be essential if the prospects of success are to be enhanced.</P>
      <P>This House must clearly state it is fully prepared to play a constructive role in finding a democratic settlement.  However, part of the process of finding a settlement must involve a reexamination of some of the tragic events in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years.  In that context, I welcome the announcement last week by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, that a new inquiry will be held into the events surrounding Bloody Sunday.</P>
      <P>The decision to hold such an investigation will go some way to building confidence in the peace process.  The new examination into the events of that tragic day will be accorded the powers of subpoena and disclosure.  Equipped with such powers, we can have confidence in the inquiry and we can hope it will give a clear and detailed picture of what happened on that day over 26 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday have the right to know the truth about the circumstances <Col N="1155" /> in which their loved ones died.  They have campaigned tirelessly for over two and a half decades and deserve to have this issue finally laid to rest.  I also welcome the Government's decision to publish the report into the events of Bloody Sunday which was commissioned by the previous rainbow Government.</P>
    <P>The Government report makes it quite clear that a fresh inquiry is imperative.  The report states that the original tribunal, and Judge Widgery, suppressed written statements made by British soldiers that contradicted their oral evidence. The Widgery investigation was a travesty of justice. It in no way attempted to establish the truth of that fateful day in a fair, independent and just fashion.</P>
    <P>At the same time, there is also a responsibility on those who caused other deaths in Northern Ireland to follow the example of the British Government.  I refer, in particular, to those victims known as the disappeared &mdash; that is, people who have disappeared at the hands of terrorist organisations over the last three decades.  Their families should now be accorded the same respect that has been given to the families of the deceased of Bloody Sunday.  If we are to learn from the past we must learn from the entire past and not from a selective view of recent history.</P>
    <P>The past contains painful memories and serious unhealed wounds for people and families on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland.  A process of healing must be established.  It is a process which will of necessity take time if it is to be effective.  However, there are precedents elsewhere in the world from which we on this island can learn.  The painful experience and history of apartheid in South Africa are being addressed through an innovative process of public acknowledgement and reconciliation.  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, under the Chairmanship of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, is certainly a model which might have relevance to this island. For many, an acknowledgement of the past is, in itself, the first major step towards bringing about reconciliation &mdash; internal and personal reconciliation as well as reconciliation between divided opinions.</P>
    <P>The new Bloody Sunday inquiry will go some way towards addressing the pain and trauma that have been so evident in Northern Ireland in the last three decades.  It is an essential part of the healing process, but many more steps must be taken.  However, as previous speakers have said, the most important part of the overall process is the all-party talks.</P>
    <P>I join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to the role in the all-party talks of the chairman, Senator George Mitchell, and the co-chairmen, General John de Chastelain, and the former Prime Minister of Finland, Harri Holkeri, for their skill in keeping the all-party talks going.  The Irish people owe a huge debt of gratitude to these three men and their officials for their work and personal skills in such difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> It has been obvious always, from the beginning of the peace process, that difficult choices will have to be faced and that all sides will have to compromise if we are to reach a settlement that ultimately will be acceptable to the majority of people.  As a former South African President, F. W. de Klerk, stated to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin Castle two years ago, the process of political negotiation and compromise involves the participants becoming, in part, the advocates to their own supporters of the positions of their opponents.  That was probably the most important statement to be said.  We have to internalise the views of those whose opinions we do not agree with to make progress and have a shared agreement.  As the murdered Israeli Labour Party Leader and Prime Minister, Yitzak Rabin, put it: &ldquo;One makes peace with one's enemies not with one's friends&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In this context, I welcome the beginning of a process of communication between Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist Party which will hopefully lead in the near future to face to face talks between these two parties.  I urge the leadership of both these parties to continue the initial dialogue and work quickly towards a point where they can sit down together in formal negotiations. It will not be easy for either side to reach this point as compromises inevitably will have to be made.  However, if Sinn Féin and the UUP could sit down for talks it would send a strong message to the extremists that the only way forward is through direct negotiation.  Nobody in this House or anywhere else has any illusions about the difficulties that face the parties in Northern Ireland as the May deadline comes closer.  It is important that there is a perceived deadline so that talking cannot continue endlessly without progress.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest sources of pressure is the constant and relentless focus on the talks participants themselves and on their every utterance, which is parsed, analysed and weighed daily by press, radio and television.  There seems to be a requirement for constant explanation, a pressure which in itself is fast becoming a barrier to progress. It is clear from the experience of any negotiation at trade union level or between political parties that a measure of uninterrupted focus is required.  The experience in negotiating the Dayton Accord is a useful point of reference.  We may need to allow for a much greater degree of breathing space to be given to those involved in the direct negotiations if we are to achieve the progress which we so earnestly desire.</P>
    <P>If we are to arrive at a successful conclusion to these talks we have to focus upon the different sets of relationships on this island and between the island and the neighbouring island of Britain. I am intrigued by the explanation of the Leader of Fine Gael of the model he is positing.  I have no difficulty in accepting and understanding the model, but I hope he will come forward with a simpler name for it.</P>
    <P>It is clear that an exclusively internal solution to Northern Ireland cannot work.  The history of <Col N="1157" /> the last 70 odd years is certainly sufficient reason for us to understand that particular premise.  It is also clear, notwithstanding the significantly enhanced and positive relationship which now exists between Dublin and London, that relationship and dialogue on its own will not be sufficient to bring about an ultimate solution to the problems that divide communities in Northern Ireland.  The North-South relationships are crucial to the successful operation of the other two, but all three relationships are dependent upon and complementary to each other.</P>
    <P>That is why it is crucial that the North-South relationships are given significant form and real substance.  In this respect, the Irish Government and we in the Oireachtas have a unique role to play.  The more we are prepared to share executive power in the operation of agencies which we have successfully established in the South and which have complementary agencies in the North, the more real substance can be assigned to the operation of that North-South dimension.</P>
    <P>It is far too early to be prescriptive as to the precise nature and form of the executive powers which will evolve, but it is clear that we need to show a clear willingness to maximise their potential, efficiency and, consequently, their effectiveness. It is equally clear that there is an onus of responsibility on all parties to engage fully, in so far as is appropriate for them, in each set of negotiations. I echo the words of the Leader of the Fine Gael Party in saying that we cannot choose to be enthusiastic about one strand and uninvolved in another.  The process is an integrated one and ultimate success is dependent on a satisfactory conclusion on all three sets of discussions which ultimately can be endorsed by a popular vote of the people North and South.</P>
    <P>No one in the South of Ireland should underestimate the operational and political difficulties that this may cause for many people.  The hard decisions will not all have to be made north of the Border.  We in the South have a substantial vested interest in seeing a successful outcome to the current talks process.  We must be willing to make our substantial contribution.  A satisfactory resolution of the conflict of relations between the peoples of this island is to the advantage of everyone on the island but, particularly, to the tax paying citizens of the Republic.  A successful resolution would in turn include an improved economic relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>It would prepare us in a unique way to face the difficult challenges which the two states as offshore islands within the European Union will have to confront as that Union both deepens its integration and enlarges its membership.  The 60 million people on the two islands have much more in common than those issues which have historically divided us, particularly in a European Union which will, within 12 years or so, have more than 400 million citizens.  Dublin and London working together in Brussels can do an enormous amount to enhance the well-being and welfare <Col N="1158" /> of all the people in Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales.  It is in our common interest to achieve the methodology to do that.</P>
    <P>The onus is now on the parties involved to make the process work.  Most of the people involved directly in the process acknowledge what must be done and know that if we fail on this occasion we will not have another opportunity for some time.  As the murderous events of recent weeks have shown, the prospects of failure are too awful to contemplate and the consequences of that failure will not be confined to the counties of Northern Ireland.  The people of the Republic have a real and vested interest in the success of the outcome of these talks.  We must be prepared to strengthen the structure and composition of the three sets of relationships which, taken together, provide the basis for a satisfactory outcome for all the people.</P>
    <P>We have a unique opportunity to achieve a permanent peace on this island, a reconciliation between divided nationalities and to address historic wrongs.  There is and always will be those who, for whatever reason, will work against the cause of peace.  They must not be allowed to succeed. The preliminary stages are at an end; the time for courageous decision is now.  All those who are brave in the cause of peace will gain forever the respect and admiration of the people of these islands.  The majority of people are willing to make compromises, to change old perspectives and to support progressive leadership.  That is the message this debate and this House must send out.</P>

      <P>Nobody doubts that we have entered a critical year in the life of this island.  We stand on the threshold of a potentially momentous new era for relationships within Northern Ireland and this island and between the peoples of Ireland and Britain.  The multi-party talks represent an unparalleled opportunity to remove the causes of conflict, overcome the legacy of history and heal the divisions which have resulted.  I welcome the opportunity on behalf of the Government and of the Progressive Democrats to contribute to this discussion on the talks and the issues central to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join the Taoiseach and others in condemning the recent murders in Northern Ireland and in offering my deepest sympathies to all who have been bereaved.  All murders are obscene but there has been something particularly shocking in the spate of recent sectarian killings.  Perhaps we had come to believe or hope that we had put random, sectarian killings behind us.  Perhaps it was seeing again the heartbreaking scenes of grief as children mourned fathers cruelly taken from <Col N="1159" /> them in their prime.  Perhaps it was hearing on the television and reading in the newspapers the stories of the lives of the victims.  The random manner in which they died seemed in stark contrast to the precious and central role they had clearly played in the lives of families, friends and communities and by whom they will never be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Whatever the reason, those recent killings have chillingly reminded us all that the stakes are high. The project of the talks is literally a matter of life and death.  That is why the two Governments and all the parties involved are determined we must not fail.  Success in the talks is undoubtedly the best bulwark against the killings we have witnessed in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>With the deadline of May only months away, I am confident we can reach our goal of a comprehensive agreement.  Following the initial weeks of debate across the agenda before Christmas, the two Governments felt it was desirable and necessary that a new focus and impetus be given to the discussions.  That was why last month they put on the table a number of joint papers for discussion and debate by the parties.  The first of these, the &ldquo;Propositions on Heads of Agreement&rdquo;, set out the Governments' ideas on the possible outline of an acceptable settlement.  There was nothing radically new in the document, as it drew from ideas put forward by the parties during the autumn. However, it tried to combine those ideas in a way which struck a balance between them.  Both Governments have made clear throughout these talks that they remain firmly committed to the positions in the Joint Declaration and the Joint Framework Document as being their best assessment of where agreement might be found in the negotiations.  The propositions paper was fully consistent with that approach.</P>
    <P>As an aid to working through the details of the negotiations, the two Governments tabled three further papers on strand two &mdash; relations within the island of Ireland &mdash; and strand three &mdash; relations between Ireland and Britain &mdash; during the talks session in London last week.  In the papers on new structures relating to strand two and strand three, the two Governments reiterated their firm commitment to the positions set out in the Joint Declaration and the Joint Framework Document and set out a series of questions on the operation of those structures in these areas with the aim of facilitating the detailed discussion of them by the parties.  The other strand two paper sets out existing areas of North-South co-operation and an illustrative list of matters which could be the subject of further co-operation, without prejudice to the form, content and extent of such co-operation.</P>
    <P>As regards strand one &mdash; relations within Northern Ireland, the British Government has tabled a number of papers on possible new institutions in that area.  Intensive debate on these papers took place between the parties in Belfast this week.  These papers have in common the <Col N="1160" /> focus now on detailed, intensive negotiations.  As the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have made clear, the time has come to move from generalities and to begin grappling with the core issues in their detail.  This is now happening and we have entered a critical phase of the process.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government team, I have been participating in these talks and was in London last week with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, for the discussions on strands two and three.  On Tuesday and Wednesday last week good and constructive discussions on both strands took place and will be continued in Belfast and in Dublin in two weeks' time.</P>
    <P>Under the continued wise chairmanship of George Mitchell, I sensed in Lancaster House a deepening and broadening level of engagement beginning to emerge.  There are a number of reasons for that.  First, the parties have been around the table with each other for several months now.  As in any human process, time has helped to nurture a greater level of familiarity and trust.  Let us not forget that many of those involved were meeting each other for the first time and against the background of deep historical and political differences which had been compounded by decades of violence and mistrust. Time was needed to enable some degree of mutual understanding to develop.  Deputies in this House who participated in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation will recall a similar process there in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>Second, there is a consciousness by the parties that the time is growing shorter and that the hard decisions cannot be postponed much longer. Mindful of the need to ensure that it is the political process and not the way of violence which decides the future of this island, they are determined to honour the trust and responsibility which has been placed upon them by the people who elected them.</P>
    <P>Third, the two Governments, in tabling both the propositions document and the follow-up papers setting out the detailed questions, have provided the parties with the mechanism and the context within which more intensive and detailed engagement can take place.  For the first time we are now addressing the whats and the hows rather than the whethers.  This is a critical development and of importance to the ultimate success of what we are about.</P>
    <P>I am not seeking to minimise the scale and extent of the difficulties that we face in finalising a settlement.  Our session in London had to address a particularly serious instance of such a difficulty.  I refer to the decision of the two Governments that the UDP were no longer entitled to participate in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The decision was a difficult one in the context of our overall desire to promote an inclusive settlement.  At the same time, against the background of the actions of the UFF in breaking its ceasefire and killing innocent Catholics, it was the only decision the Governments could have taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> This case was very different from all previous instances where questions arose in terms of the commitment of parties to the Mitchell principles. On this occasion the group in question had openly admitted to the breach.  A political process must be based on integrity and democratic principles. When boundaries are crossed in the way that they were by the UFF, a stand has to be taken.  The calling of its murders a measured military response caused deep outrage, particularly in the Catholic community, and to all of us who are engaged in the process.  The Governments took a stand.  I believe it was the right one, and that the peace process is the stronger for that action.</P>
    <P>We have acknowledged the positive efforts of the UDP in the talks so far.  As the Governments indicated in our decision last week, the possibility of a return to the negotiating table in certain circumstances is open to it.  If over a period of weeks a complete, unequivocal and unqualified UFF ceasefire were demonstrated, and established through word and deed to have been fully and continuously observed, the Governments would consider that possibility.  The ball is firmly in the court of the UFF and the UDP.</P>
    <P>There are other very difficult issues to be faced. The Taoiseach has outlined what the main elements of a settlement are likely to be.  We are all conscious of the importance of new institutions which will attract the allegiance and support of all sides.  Balanced constitutional change, too, will be a critical dimension of any overall settlement, as will issues such as prisoners and decommissioning.</P>
    <P>I want to focus on another element of the negotiations, namely what we describe in broad terms as the &ldquo;equality/rights/justice agenda&rdquo;.  While much of the focus, rightly, has been on the institutional area, the equality issue, in its broadest understanding, will be critical also to the securing of an agreement to which all sides can sign up.  It is appropriate that this is so as we mark the 200th anniversary of 1798, a period in which the rights of man was such a guiding factor.  The House will also be aware that this is the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, an issue of particular focus for me in my capacity as Minister with special responsibility for human rights.</P>
    <P>While the conflict which we are addressing in the multiparty talks cannot be understood exclusively in rights terms, the question of rights has played a critical role.  After all, it was the civil rights campaign of almost 30 years, and the response to it, which was the prelude to the Troubles.  Catholics and Nationalists were no longer prepared to put up with second class citizenship in their home place.  I have no wish to replay 30 years of history here today.  Suffice it to say and acknowledge that much progress has been made in the intervening decades to address the wrongs which were highlighted by the Civil Rights campaign.  Electoral reform, the transformation in the housing situation and the significant <Col N="1162" /> progress in regard to fair employment are but a number of examples of this.</P>
    <P>At the same time, serious issues remain to be resolved.  Despite the undoubted progress of recent years, more needs to be done in terms of the creation of parity of esteem and treatment. That was why the Irish Government strongly welcomed the pledges in this regard by the British Government in the Joint Declaration and the Framework Document.  The translation of this into legislation, and subsequently into practice on the ground, will be a central part of the settlement we are currently negotiating in the talks.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of policing, and the legal framework in which it takes place, is a critical element of the equality/rights/justice &ldquo;basket&rdquo;. Clearly, agreement on this area will not be easily achieved.  For Nationalists, deep change and reform are essential if a new relationship of confidence is to be established between police and people.  This is a view strongly held right across that community.  On the other hand, the Unionist community sees the RUC as a force which has sought professionally and courageously to defend it in the most difficult of circumstances and that major change is neither necessary nor desirable. Achieving agreement on the area will be extremely difficult, yet without such agreement, establishing an overall settlement acceptable to all sides would be highly problematic.</P>
    <P>The Government has frequently said that what is at issue in these talks is change, profound change.  It was clear to everybody and to all parties in this House that the <i>status quo</i>, which has brought us over 3,000 deaths in less than 30 years, is not an option.  At the same time, we recognise that change is not easy.  Change magnifies fears, but it is possible, and it is taking place.  It is visible in the very fact that we are this far in the negotiations. In the almost 80 years since the Government of Ireland Act and the partition of Ireland, we have never been this close to an accommodation to which all the people of the island could sign up.  The reaching of this point in what has been a slow and difficult journey has required change in many regards and on many sides.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, for instance, that change is visible in the courageous decision of the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, to order a new judicial inquiry into the Bloody Sunday killings.  In taking the decision he did, Tony Blair overturned all precedent and made clear that a new attempt to establish the truth of that awful day was needed. As well as being a just reward for the patience, perseverance and dignity of the families of the innocent victims of that day, it also demonstrated that change can take place and that old moulds can be broken.  The decision also reflects the new maturity in relations between the Irish and British Governments, a maturity that augurs well for the future of relations between our two peoples.  I am also hopeful that, just as the events of Bloody Sunday and the Widgery report were a touchstone for suffering and injustice in the Nationalist community, the new inquiry and the establishment <Col N="1163" /> of the truth can serve as a catalyst for a wider sense of healing and of justice done.</P>
    <P>In referring to Bloody Sunday, I wish to make clear that the Government is deeply conscious that there have been thousands of innocent victims of these Troubles, many of them in the Unionist communities.  Each of those was a tragedy and a life that should not have been lost. In welcoming the new Bloody Sunday inquiry, we seek to take nothing from the sense of loss of the other bereaved &mdash; last week's decision has served to bring into relief again the scale of the toll of violence across all of Northern Ireland and beyond.  That is why we supported the decision of Dr. Mowlam to establish a commission on the victims of violence to study the problems suffered by victims and to make recommendations about ways in which those who died during the Troubles could be commemorated.</P>
    <P>Change will be needed on all sides.  It is easy to say that others must change.  Change will be needed on our part in the South also.  The journey we have embarked on in these talks will bring challenges for us, as well.  The new North-South structures which we hope will emerge from these talks will require us to enter an unprecedented partnership between the traditions on this island. Partnerships require give and take, and they require compromise.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic that agreement can be reached. The prize before us is of extraordinary value, both for ourselves and our children.  This island has enormous potential and I hope we can achieve it and copperfasten peace by way of a political settlement.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton painted his view of the republican vision of a united Ireland and described it as nonsense.  I could not agree more.  A week ago I had the honour of hosting a visit to this House by a delegation representing 14 community organisations in Belfast.  They came from Nationalist districts which, since the beginning of December, have been bearing the brunt of an intensified sectarian killing campaign at the hands of loyalist paramilitaries.  They met formally with the Taoiseach and the Fine Gael Leader and informally with a number of other Deputies.  When they came to the public gallery they found to their disappointment that once again, because of the procedures of the House, the crisis which they faced was not being discussed that day.  As I have stated on previous occasions, there is insufficient focus in this Assembly on the greatest and most urgent issue facing the people of Ireland, the common search for a negotiated end to conflict and a lasting and democratic peace settlement.  I am glad we have the opportunity to address the issue, albeit once again in an unsatisfactory way with statements rather than real debate.</P>
      <P>Last weekend in Derry 40,000 people took part in a demonstration marking the 26th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.  It is believed to have been the largest such demonstration since the 1972 massacre. It showed in a very dramatic way not only that the proud people of Derry are strong in their demand for justice and truth but that the entire Nationalist community is today more than ever before determined to end the long Nationalist nightmare and achieve a future of equality beyond sectarianism and partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bloody Sunday massacre was carried out in the hope that opposition to the sectarian Six County state would be smashed.  The British Government has finally been forced to recognise the demand of the relatives of the Bloody Sunday victims for truth and justice.  Similar recognition should be given by the Irish Government to the families devastated by the Dublin-Monaghan <Col N="1165" /> bombings of 1974.  I call on the Government to order the release of the Garda files on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the single biggest tragedy of the war in terms of loss of life, so that the relatives can proceed with their international human rights case against the British Government.</P>
    <P>Loyalist killings are being used in an effort to terrorise the entire Nationalist community into lowering its political demands.  During her visit here last week Liz Groves, a member of the community delegation from Belfast, said:</P>
    <P>We believe that once again sectarian murders are taking place in an attempt to terrorise our community into a return to a Stormont regime.  We resolve that naked sectarianism and hatred of Catholics will not determine our political future and structures of government in the way it has in the past.</P>
    <P>I assure Members that sentiment is widespread across the Nationalist community in the Six Counties.  It cannot and must not be ignored.</P>
    <P>My party continues to be fully engaged in the multi-party negotiations in all aspects.  We are seeking agreement on a comprehensive settlement which is democratic and dynamic.  Such an agreement needs to include structures which act as a bridge from the past failures of partition to a new political and constitutional dispensation embracing the entire island and all its people.  A return to Stormont would be a return to past failures. Sinn Féin is opposed to a Six County assembly.  We are engaged in strand one on this issue and have been open in discussing it because the Ulster Unionist Party sought such discussion. There was a useful exchange of views.  However, we are not confident from the replies to the questions we put to the Ulster Unionist Party that a new assembly will not be a return to Unionist domination and discrimination.</P>
    <P>Progress on all issues is the acid test of the peace process.  Any agreement which does not remove the sectarian basis on which such injustices stand will inevitably fail but none of us should contemplate failure.  Sinn Féin remains committed and determined to achieve an agreed outcome through negotiations and a democratic peace settlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity presented by these statements to review the situation in Northern Ireland.  Two weeks ago I urged the Government to agree to an early debate because I believed it was important for all sides in Northern Ireland to understand that all of the parties in the Dáil speak with one voice in their absolute opposition to the recent spate of sectarian murders, their firm support for the inter-party talks and their belief that the heads of agreement document and the papers put forward by the two Governments at Lancaster House last week offer a reasonable and realistic agenda for an agreement between the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> It is desirable that the Government should have the support of all parties in the Dáil, and the Taoiseach and his team will continue to have the support of Democratic Left as long as they continue to pursue a balanced approach to the search for a solution to the problems of Northern Ireland.  There might be some political advantage in having criticised the Government over some of the difficulties that have arisen in recent weeks, and while I am not at all sure that had the situations been reversed and the rainbow parties were still in Government Fianna Fáil would have exercised the same restraint, it would not have been in the interests of the peace process or of the people of Northern Ireland to have done so.</P>
    <P>This debate takes place against the background of the most difficult period in the peace process since the renewed IRA ceasefire last July.  The return of sectarian killers to the streets of Northern Ireland and particularly the intensified spate of murders directed primarily against Catholics in the aftermath of the murder of Billy Wright were an unwelcome reminder of the darkest days of the past 25 years.  There has been a respite in the round of killings over the past week, which I fervently hope will prove permanent, but threats and counter-threats continue to be made by a range of paramilitaries and their shadow groups. Tension remains high and the atmosphere is poisonous.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of the UDP from the talks following the announcement by the UFF that it had been responsible for a number of recent murders was inevitable.  The two Governments and the other participants in the talks were correct to take action.  The Mitchell principles are a crucial element in the peace process and acceptance of and adherence to them are the litmus test of a party's commitment to democracy.</P>
    <P>No organisation can be allowed to turn on and turn off violence at will and expect that the other participants will turn a blind eye.  There is evidence that all of the paramilitary organisations represented at the talks by associate parties have breached the Mitchell principles to one extent or another.  A public reaffirmation of commitment to all of the Mitchell principles by all of the participants involved in the talks would be helpful, as would a declaration from the parties associated with the paramilitaries that they will not be cowed, bullied or intimidated by the backwoodsmen in their own communities.  Such statements would be real confidence building measures for the community.</P>
    <P>Everyone has acknowledged the positive contribution made to the talks process by UDP leaders like Gary McMichael.  I hope that once a sufficient period of time has elapsed to confirm the bona fides of the UFF statement that it has halted its violence, the UDP will be able to take its place at the talks once again.</P>
    <P>The talks process is now entering a crucial phase.  Key decisions will determine whether the process moves on to a position where agreement can be reached on proposals to be put to the <Col N="1167" /> people in this State and in Northern Ireland or whether Northern Ireland will plunge back into violent conflict.  Difficult decisions will have to be made by all parties, courage will have to be shown and a willingness displayed to go out and sell an agreement to their supporters.  The key challenge facing parties in Northern Ireland is not simply to insist on a package of proposals that will be supported by their own supporters but to negotiate proposals that are capable of proving acceptable to a broad spectrum of the community. In other words, all participants must be conscious of the needs of others: if any side wins too much it reduces the prospects of overall acceptance of the package.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin, in particular, faces difficult decisions.  Its response to the heads of agreement document did not indicate a party with a grip on the realities of what is feasible in the context of Northern Ireland.  This was not the first time Sinn Féin found itself out of step with the other Nationalist parties and moderate Unionism.  This is, after all, what happened also in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin Castle.  Sinn Féin is quick to criticise other participants in the talks for a failure to engage, yet reports that Mr. Adams and his colleagues are playing no more than a token role in this week's talks on strand one suggest that it needs to examine its own approach.  A democratic assembly within Northern Ireland is a key element of the Framework Document.  Acceptable arrangements for the internal governance of Northern Ireland are just as important as North-South structures and east-west relations.  Indeed a democratically elected Northern Assembly with executive powers and functions is essential to an effective North-South body.</P>
    <P>It seems ironic that Sinn Féin should be putting such emphasis on North-South bodies with executive powers when it is opposing proposals for a Northern Ireland assembly.  Who would supply the Northern element of a North-South body in the absence of an assembly?  Can it be that Sinn Féin would prefer the British Government to provide the Northern element of North-South bodies rather than democratically elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland?  Is Sinn Féin seriously arguing that the people of Northern Ireland should be deprived of the power such an assembly would give it and opt instead for the &lsquo;talking shop&rsquo; proposal favoured by some in the UUP?</P>
    <P>The election of a new assembly in Northern Ireland will not mean a return to Stormont type rule.  Nobody at the talks is advocating that position. The assembly must be a new creation, with new structures which reflect the unique political situation in Northern Ireland.  Weighted majorities must be built into the decision-making process of such an assembly as a guarantee against any possibility of a majoritarian abuse of power and also as a signal of a determination to pursue a <Col N="1168" /> less confrontational and more equitable decision-making process.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the political movement there has been among many members of the republican movement.  The journey from paramilitarism to democratic politics is a difficult one.  I suspect that most of the republican leadership know there can be no going back, and that the challenge facing it is to conclude an agreement with the other parties that will deliver the maximum that can be feasibly accommodated on all sides.  Sinn Féin represents a significant strain of political opinion within Northern Ireland.  I genuinely hope that, notwithstanding the difficulties in the talks and the provocative actions of organisations like the LVF, they will remain with the process.</P>
    <P>All parties must remember that the talks process provides that whatever conclusions are finally reached must be placed before the people in a referendum.  This requires that any new arrangements must be acceptable to the broad community in Northern Ireland.  A political accommodation in Northern Ireland is possible if all parties recognise the absolute need for compromise.  The stark reality is that without compromise by all concerned there can be no settlement.  It is, therefore, disappointing that some of the participants in the talks seem, from time to time, to be more interested in tribal politics rather than in listening and being accommodating.</P>
    <P>Last week we saw David Trimble, leader of the largest Unionist party, convulsed with laughter as his colleague, Jeffrey Donaldson, tore up a copy of the Framework Document.  That is not the behaviour one expects from the leadership of the largest party in Northern Ireland at a time of crisis.  What is needed are cool heads and sober judgment.  A few days later there was the spectacle of Sinn Féin attempting to exploit the peace rally in Belfast.  That also was a provocative action calculated to stir up sectarian passions, and there was more from the same quarter in Derry at the weekend.</P>
    <P>Against that background the announcement by Prime Minister Blair last week of a new inquiry into Bloody Sunday was a significant and welcome development and a relief.  The dead of Bloody Sunday should be remembered and the full story of what happened on that day must be told.  The Widgery tribunal was an affront to justice and truth and an understandable source of grievance for the injured and the relatives of those who were killed.  I hope the new inquiry will bring some peace and solace to them.</P>
    <P>This month also marks the 20th anniversary of another shocking outrage in Northern Ireland.  I refer to the firebombing by the Provisional IRA of the La Mon hotel on 17 February 1978 when 12 innocent people were burned to death and 23 were injured.  Does Martin McGuinness MP support the prosecution of the people responsible for that atrocity?  I say this not to score a point but to underline the need for this House and especially the Government to remember all the <Col N="1169" /> victims of the conflict in Northern Ireland.  There should be no selective remembrances.  Instead there should be a collective determination to bring an end to political violence, an end to all political killings.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there are elements in Northern Ireland intent on precipitating a full scale resumption of violence.  The INLA and the LVF are extremists <i>in extremis.</i>  The fact that they represent the tip of an iceberg of sectarian hatred that could sink the peace process should not be ignored.  Some who should know better because they claim to speak for their God are not beyond silly and dangerous statements.  We have become used to the utterances of the Rev. Ian Paisley, but what are we to make of Fr. Joe McVeigh?  Speaking at a meeting in the Pilots Row community centre in Derry last Sunday, Fr. McVeigh stated that the issue for Nationalists was defeating Unionists.  I hardly think he had chess or basketball in mind.  As a Christian cleric I would have expected him to practise reconciliation, not promote conflict.</P>
    <P>It is up to the political leaders in Northern Ireland to give leadership, not to follow the band. They have the opportunity to lead their followers to a peaceful, democratic and honourable agreement, but it will not be easy.  They face formidable obstacles that will not be easy to overcome, but if they concentrate on what is feasible, and if the two Governments guide them in this direction agreement can be reached.  It must be made clear there will not be the slightest sympathy for anyone who would attempt to oppose through violence an agreement that is reached.  The violent minority should not be allowed to sabotage the democratically expressed wishes of a cross community consensus.</P>
    <P>Agreement has yet to be reached and we should not underestimate the difficulties that lie ahead.  These difficulties are rooted in the tangled history that gave rise to the two states on this island, but today's generation should not be allowed to become prisoners of history.  We should learn from history, and the most important single lesson of history is that dialogue and negotiation can lead us forward.  Confrontation and conflict will condemn Northern Ireland to endlessly repeating the past.  This prospect should not be entertained.  The politicians involved in the talks should, without further ado, get down to the business of politics.  Stop the play-acting; stop the excuses; stop the cheap publicity stunts; just get on with it.  If we have learned anything in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years it must be that sectarian violence creates many victims but no winners.  Nobody, other than a small embittered minority on both sides, wants a return to the violence that has scarred Northern Ireland for almost three decades.</P>
    <P>Despite all the gloom of the past few weeks, we must not lose sight of what has been achieved. Contrary to the gloom-laden predictions of many commentators, the talks have survived.  The two Governments are working in tandem, and this is <Col N="1170" /> always when most progress has been made.  The political representatives of more than 70 per cent of the people of Northern Ireland are engaged in real dialogue and a genuine effort to develop a consensus.  The principal political representatives of Unionism and loyalism are engaged in a talks process that includes not only the Irish Government but also Sinn Féin.  The documents published by the two Governments provide a real prospect not just of progress but of agreement on new structures that will prove acceptable to the majority of Unionists and Nationalists.  No one must allow the sectarian murder gangs to frustrate the clear will of the people of Northern Ireland for a peaceful, negotiated settlement to the conflict there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking about Northern Ireland it is dangerous to speak of the past because in the past the seeds of hatred were sown in Northern Ireland.  When seeking to move forward we must avoid looking over our shoulders at a past that is tortured and often impossible to make sense of.</P>
      <P>I commend the STOP &mdash; solidarity to organise peace &mdash; initiative which asks all of us to observe two minutes silence on Thursday, 12 February in remembrance of those who have suffered.  For those of us who believe in a Christian God, it reminds us to pray.  Prayer was critical in the South African conflict, and it must not be forgotten in this one.</P>
      <P>It is two years since the Canary Wharf explosion which blasted the real hopes for peace created with the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire.  That was an act of violence that characterised a political process which, by then, had run out of steam with the failure of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to reach a consensus with an agreed report.  The failure of the forum to act in a consensual way and achieve a consensual result between parties with a broadly similar philosophical outlook augured badly in setting a precedent for the setting up, and the successful progress of talks within Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>An admission needs to be made that the flaw at the heart of the discussions at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, and one that is all too apparent in the current phase of Northern Ireland talks, is that participants cannot be prodded towards a predetermined outcome.  For a peace process to be successful it needs to be open and inclusive.  It needs to arrive at a conclusion which can surprise, and which will be different and distant from long held positions, a conclusion that participants can feel was shaped by them, is owned by them, and can be delivered through them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of our dilemma on this island is that the fears of each community involved in the ongoing conflict are mirror images of each other. Within Northern Ireland the Nationalist republican population feels denied, oppressed and dominated. On the island of Ireland the Unionist loyalist population suffer from exactly the same torn <Col N="1171" /> emotions.  These fears are born by the practice of an extremely limited form of democracy, where majoritarianism &mdash; the making of decisions and policies by gaining the approval of a bare majority of people, 50 per cent plus one &mdash; is predominant. It is important to remind ourselves, given the horrific loyalist killings which have been reported recently, that the fear of being outnumbered and the numbers game is what is driving that type of bigotry, revenge and demonisation of the opposing community.  It is important that we face the reality of the failure of majoritarianism in this conflict.</P>
    <P>While it is accepted that any settlement in Northern Ireland must involve the creation of new and better forms of democracy where views can be freely expressed, openly acknowledged and properly responded to, we cannot blind ourselves to the realisation that such changes are needed in this State.  The improvement of the quality of democracy in Northern Ireland must be mirrored by a willingness to improve our own quality of democracy if it is our collective desire to bring about the truly effective working of democracy on this island.</P>
    <P>The Green Party has argued, and continues to argue, that we should not be totally preoccupied with the main political actors or with the political process itself because, for the peace process to be fully successful, it must be inclusive, not only in the political sense but also in a way which seeks to involve all those who are involved in whatever aspect in the community life of Northern Ireland. To this end, the Green Party has proposed a parallel process through the establishment of a civic forum composed of community representatives who are outside the party political process and who can discuss more dispassionately and with less ideological baggage, the needs and the preferred solutions for the future of Northern Irish society.  This proposal met with considerable support at the most recent Forum on Peace and Reconciliation.  Hopefully, it can be acted upon.</P>
    <P>One of the worst aspects of the ongoing tragedy in Northern Ireland is that so many voices go unheard.  This is especially true of women, notwithstanding the determined efforts of the Women's Coalition in recent years.  It is one of the major reasons we believe that a civic forum is necessary.  Some might feel that this approach would lessen the importance of the political process, but it can also be argued that a less partisan body can be of assistance if it operates in a less nakedly partisan fashion, putting it up to the political establishment in the North as to how things could be done and how progress can be made.  The approach of the Australian Government in establishing a constitutional convention largely made up of everyday ordinary Australians to determine the constitutional future of that country shows there are others who see merits in this.</P>
    <P>While not agreeing with the notion of a predetermined approach to a Northern Ireland settlement, <Col N="1172" /> the Green Party sees three important elements that must be covered in the course of such a settlement.  These are, one, the internal institutional recognition of the Irish identity; two, power sharing and, three, North-South institutions. While the actual balance between these elements is quite properly a matter for negotiation, their importance and the recognition of the relationship between them should not, and must not, be a matter for negotiation.</P>
    <P>A current sticking point in the ongoing talks between Northern parties is the weight, importance, powers and functions of North-South institutions. The Green Party believes it is necessary for the importance of the North-South institutions to be stressed and guaranteed.  These institutions are needed to recognise and protect the Irish identity in Northern Ireland as much as east-west institutions are needed to protect the British identity.</P>
    <P>The status of North-South institutions could be enhanced through the introduction of a parliamentary tier.  Such a body, while not possessing executive powers, could operate much as the European Parliament currently operates and if constituted through consensual decision making means and properly guaranteed through the appropriate intergovernmental machinery, could prove to be a useful forum.</P>
    <P>The Green Party sees merit also in the proposal for a council of the isles.  It is a mechanism which is found within the Green Party.  It is the means by which Green Party policy on Northern Ireland was formulated and collectively agreed by Green Party members throughout these islands.  Therefore, it is obviously an approach with which we would find great favour.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these statements today is to review the progress of the process, such as it is and as it is intended to continue.  It is a process which we all hope will succeed, but we fear may not.  The approach to Northern Ireland in this House has always been largely bipartisan and it is hoped that this will continue.  The Green Party will continue to support the Government in its efforts, agreeing to support the purpose of its policy while reserving the right to criticise when the party sees that the approach it is adopting is incorrect.</P>
    <P>That said, the Government and its predecessor is deserving of praise for securing the agreement of the British Government to hold a new and independent inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday in Derry.  It is unfortunate that this inquiry is being taken by some to represent a defeat for the Unionist community.  The need to finally get to the truth behind Bloody Sunday is, and always was, primarily a human rights issue. The Unionist community, while it has endured many appalling injustices caused largely through terrorism, has not had to endure state terrorism. This State has never condoned or endorsed terrorism.</P>
    <P>The new inquiry is largely as a result of the dossier compiled by the Irish Government, and <Col N="1173" /> all those responsible are deserving of great credit. However, the Green Party has a concern that, for the new inquiry to be effective, it must have access to all relevant information.  In this regard, the party is concerned that the reported moratorium on the use of British medical records until the year 2047 must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Government needs to settle on a strategy on Northern Ireland and decide whether it is necessary that the ship that is the peace process should drift in peaceful waters waiting for the next available wind, or whether it should infuse forward motion by making the ship lurch violently from side to side as it seeks to mollify the side which has the most recently hurt feelings.</P>
    <P>Much has happened in Northern Ireland in recent months that has made many feel uncomfortable &mdash; the visits to the Maze Prison, the subsequent return to blatant sectarian murder and the expulsion of the Ulster Democratic Party. It is a peace process that is far from pacific, but possibly through this turmoil there may be the opportunity to question and reassess.  The Green Party will continue to offer strong support to the Government as long as it chooses to use this opportunity wisely.  Rath Dé ar an obair.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: At a mass rally organised by the trade movement in Belfast on Friday, 30 January, a banner held by supporters of the Socialist Party stated clearly that there can be &ldquo;no going back&rdquo;.  That expressed the aspiration of the overwhelming majority of people in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Sectarian polarisation has developed to an acute level in Northern Ireland and, unfortunately, it has intensified in recent years.  However, only a handful of lunatics wish to return to sectarian conflict.  They must be stopped.  If the ceasefires were to break down and sectarian paramilitary organisations were to set the agenda, the possibility of horror without end would beckon. A new generation of youth could be sucked into sectarian violence which could spiral out of control. The logical outcome of this would be another Bosnia; a nightmare of ethnic cleansing, pillage and sectarian reaction.  Protestant and Catholic people in their huge majorities would suffer greatly as a result.</P>
      <P>The vicious campaign by the LVF against innocent Catholics was intended to provoke a sectarian response.  On the republican side, groups such as the INLA and the Continuity Army Council are also prepared to provoke sectarian reaction.  Working class people, who form the majority of the population in Northern Ireland, must stand together to demand that the activities of these groups cease and that the killing must end.</P>
      <P>In finding a permanent solution to the problems in Northern Ireland, my hope is not primarily invested in the entrenched political parties which are locked into bunkers on one or other side of the political divide and limited by their own members or their right-wing ideology on economic and social issues.  As signalled last Friday, a campaign of mass action by working class people coming together across the divide can make a major difference.  The peace process began when tens of thousands of people took to the streets in response to the Shankill and Greysteel massacres.  Following the IRA's bombing of Canary Wharf, the pressure exerted by the thousands of people who again took to the streets stayed the hands of those intent on the full resumption of paramilitary campaigns.</P>
      <P>In the wake of last Friday's demonstration, I call for a parallel peace process driven by the aspirations of ordinary working class people coming together to overcome the divisions in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> A process based on the efforts of workers, trade unions and genuine community organisations can fill the existing vacuum.  The common interests of working class people, Catholic and Protestant, must predominate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  At the outset, I compliment the staff of An Bord Pleanála on the effective and efficient way they carry out their work.  I understand the Bill is designed to give the Minister the power to add to the membership of the board.  While I have reservations about the method he is using, the Bill is welcome if it means that existing delays in the processing of applications will be shortened.  On that basis, I welcome the Bill's provisions.</P>
      <P>In recognising the effectiveness and efficiency of An Bord Pleanála in carrying out its work and processing appeals brought before it and taking account of the recommendation that we add to its membership, I hope the Minister will recognise that the number of applications received at the lower level, namely, by local authorities, have also increased dramatically.  Additional staffing should be provided to help the authorities process these applications.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the 4,000 appeals made to An Bord Pleanála last year required a major effort on the part of its officers and staff.  At present, there is a delay of 16 weeks in processing such applications and a minimum eight week delay at local authority level which is unacceptable Additional information is often required by local authorities which further extends the period required to process applications.</P>
      <P>Ireland is unique in so far as it has an independent authority to adjudicate on planning appeals. It is also unique in that individuals or agencies retain the right to object and, in so doing, delay applications on small, technical or trivial points. The Minister of State is aware of that from the many years he spent as a member of Galway County Council.  At one point, members of the council were so frustrated by An Taisce's objections to the legitimate rights of individuals living in localities classified as highly scenic amenity areas that we used the section 4 process to direct local authority officials to grant planning permission. We knew this would prompt An Taisce to appeal the decision.  I am glad that process has been discontinued to a large extent as a result of greater consultation between public representatives and planning officials and the introduction of greater flexibility in county development plans. However, it is wrong that faceless individuals within these organisations can object to people living in rural areas by citing them as national heritage areas.  I hope that when new recommendations are introduced on planning, this unusual, unique facility which is not common throughout the EU, will be restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála is inaccessible to people with a legitimate point to make whether they are involved in an outside interest group or their <Col N="1177" /> application is being processed.  The procedures for applicants are difficult, aside from paying a fee, and the board must do a big public relations job.  Its activities are not well known and it appears as if it has something to hide, which is not the case.  However, it must be more forthcoming and transparent as the public is not aware of its work and the parameters within which it operates.</P>
    <P>There is great concern, particularly in rural areas, about mobile telephone masts.  The issue has been raised several times in the House but it seems that an agreement has been reached between the Government, the Garda and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform where no planning permission is required for the erection of such masts.  It is not fair to people who have concerns that no one can provide a clear indication on the safety of the masts.  If people have a legitimate fear they are entitled to have recourse to an agency which will give them an opportunity to express their views and have them examined.</P>
    <P>In some countries, masts are erected a minimum distance away from residential housing and it is unfair that Garda stations in residential areas are used as sites for them.  This concern has been highlighted by one family, in particular, in recent times.  Esat should not continue to tap into local sites.  For example, the mast in Portumna is located in the middle of the town.  Apart from the visual impact, it is also a highly residential area and that is not acceptable.  There is a fear that people who object legitimately will be penalised and identified for the wrong reasons and the Minister must take cognisance of this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the composition of An Bord Pleanála, is the Minister taking on the function of appointing new members to the board and increasing staffing to an appropriate level or will new members be drawn from the four panels in existence since the inception of the board as is the norm?  Despite the fact it must be sanctioned by the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister should only be allowed to do this for a fixed term and we should then revert to the original procedures for appointing members to the board.  It is important this is clarified before proceeding.</P>
    <P>Today the Government was asked by the European Commission to account for the expenditure of EU funding on projects which have changed our environmental heritage.  It has queried the implementation of certain EU directives and environmental impact assessments, particularly in the area of architectural heritage.  Another agency has taken great pleasure from the fact that the Commission responded to its initial complaint. I am not happy that the agency could bring this matter to the notice of the Commission and it in turn could respond in such a fashion.  This has serious repercussions for many fine projects in Dublin and nationwide which were EU funded, but which will now be queried unless Ireland complies with the directives.</P>

      <P>The Bill is very important in regard to planning and the role it plays.  I have been involved with Cavan County Council since 1974 and have the highest regard for An Bord Pleanála and the planning department in Cavan. It annoys me that people constantly point the finger.  It is a topical subject and the notion of brown paper bags being used to obtain planning permission for various projects is wrong and totally out of line.  Local authority officials are honest, hard working and decent as are those involved with An Bord Pleanála.  No matter what business one is in there will always be a bad apple that taints the entire organisation.</P>
      <P>People tend to get very worked up about planning issues and think a certain agenda operates in respect of planning applications.  That is not true. From my experience, local authorities and the planning board hand down decisions in as fair a manner as possible.  The board of An Bord Pleanála, which comprises a chairman and five members, is inadequate to deal with the number of appeals that come before it.  Some 4,000 were lodged last year.  This reflects the amount of development taking place.</P>
      <P>While I take issue with the Minister on some matters, I congratulate him on the way he has dealt with the backlog of planning appeals.  Time is money for business people and young couples wanting to build modest homes.  The price of houses and land is accelerating.  It is important, therefore, that decisions are handed down within a reasonable timespan, which should be one month.  In the age of computers and fax machines it should not be necessary to wait for a reply by post from a local authority.  While I support the right of every individual to appeal a case to An Bord Pleanála, as Deputy Burke correctly stated, the system is being abused by frivolous appeals. A certain gentleman who is masquerading as an environmentalist should get his act together and do something good so that people can get on with their lives.  He is creating a great deal of annoyance and turmoil and does not know what he is talking about.  He is a nuisance, but out of respect for his family, I will not name him.  I am sure the Minister and others know the person to whom I am referring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is practically impossible to get permission to build on a good site.  Many planning applications are refused because the sites are near bends in the road.  I do not agree with that.  I accept this is important on national, primary and secondary roads where there is fast moving traffic, but a person should not be refused planning permission for <Col N="1179" /> a site along by-roads because of a bend in the road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>People should not travel at 50 or 60 miles an hour on by-roads.  Because of the high cost of sites in more open areas, it is not fair to refuse planning permission to young couples who want to buy sites at a reasonable price merely because of the danger of fast moving traffic.  I stated many years ago that speed is the main cause of all accidents on our roads.  Drivers will have to slow down.  It is unacceptable that people should be prevented from building houses along by-roads because of the danger of fast moving traffic.  Many of the developments that were built before the planning laws were passed would not be acceptable under current regulations.  I know of a filling station adjacent to a dangerous and busy junction, but there has not been an accident at the junction.  One would be refused planning permission for a similar site today because of that junction.</P>
      <P>We are restricting building on good development land because of these regulations.  Young couples have been told that if they have the bends removed they will be given planning permission. That places an enormous cost burden on young couples.  I understand the agenda of local authorities is to make roads, not improve road alignment. If hedgerows were properly trimmed and the laws stringently imposed, everybody would have a proper view of our roads and more land could be used for development purposes.  That would also relieve the housing problem.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister examine the past records of the people who wish to develop piggeries before giving a blanket refusal for that type of development? Alternative enterprises are very important to small farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The sooner it is signed into law and given effect the better. There has been a belated recognition of the need for action in the planning process because of the criticisms levelled at An Bord Pleanála for the length of time it takes to process planning appeals.  I fail to understand why the problem was so obvious before action was taken.  The Minister is taking action, but some of his predecessors and members of the board of An Bord Pleanála <Col N="1180" /> should have foreseen these delays.  The additional staff will be welcome.  In a few years' time there may not be as much demand for these services and the legislation may be excessive in the workings of An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure a system of checks and balances is in place?  The current criticisms of An Bord Pleanála are valid because of the length of time it takes to process appeals, but more staff is needed.  Will the Minister make local authorities accountable for the length of time they take to process applications?  The legislation sets a target of four months for An Bord Pleanála to make a decision.  I understand that when the two month statutory period for local authorities has lapsed it is common practice for letters seeking additional frivolous information to be sent out one week before a decision on an application is due.  This automatically extends the time involved and, consequently, it can take up to 12 months to process such applications.  That should not be tolerated. Local authorities should not be able to abuse their position in that way.  They may not have enough staff, but it is up to the managers and elected members to ensure they have sufficient resources.</P>
      <P>There are wider implications in the planning system.  When Minister for Local Government in the early 1970s Deputy Molloy was probably in office when the first county development plan was introduced.  What happened to the planning process and the proposed five year reviews of the development plan?  The first plan was not reviewed until 1983.  That is deplorable.  The next time round it took seven or eight years.  Over a 20 year period in County Dublin there were two reviews.  On top of that Dublin Corporation, at managerial level, had the running of the county as part of its brief in that the city and county manager assigned responsibility to various deputy, city and county managers.</P>
      <P>My constituency is unique.  In the first plan it was decided to embrace two new satellite towns in Dublin West: Clondalkin-Lucan and Blanchardstown. When I first sought public office in 1974 these were villages with 1,000 to 2,000 people.  The proposal to build two satellite towns and the lead satellite town, Tallaght, was visited on that part of the east region.  Unfortunately the plan was flawed from the beginning because City Hall decided to reject the Myles Wright recommendation of four satellite towns and put together Clondalkin and Lucan which was never a natural entity.  The planning system was used to solve the Dublin city housing crisis and what happened is well documented and is now history. I make constructive criticisms because there are lessons to be learned and the crisis is still visiting the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation set about building thousands of houses in my constituency and in adjoining constituencies.  It was not a planning process, it was a housing emergency building programme. Deputy Deasy, in agreement with the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, was able to rattle off place <Col N="1181" /> names in north Clondalkin, Neilstown and Ronanstown, in my constituency, as areas which needed some hands-on attention, courtesy of the inefficiencies of an historical planning system. During that period there was the substantial overhang of vast landbanks, owned by the then Dublin Corporation, the private sector was pushed partly to one side and persistently lobbied politicians to take action.  The best single example, which is welcome, is that Judge Flood is conducting a tribunal to examine the planning laws in north Dublin.</P>
    <P>Why should Dublin north have problems <i>vis-a-vis</i> planning?  This is easy to understand because the planning system in the greater Dublin area did not intend that one new house would be built in north Dublin during the lifetime of the previous county development plan.  The idea was that those who wanted to set up home in the Dublin region would go to one of the satellite towns, but this ignored the Dublin Airport economic hub, its growth, its prosperity and its potential population spin-off.  If you worked in Dublin Airport you did not want to live in one of the satellite towns since we did not have the M50.  Those people wanted to live in Swords or &mdash; if one was a pilot &mdash; in Malahide or Portmarnock.  During that period politicians were continually forced into making decisions over the heads of the planners which was seen as contradicting the experts.  Subsequently some of the experts left the system, went into the private sector and tried to recommend the policies they had been defending previously. Many times in that period the planners repeatedly said to elected members they did not disagree with what was being suggested but had to put it on record because management was dictating the trend.</P>
    <P>Did we ever contemplate a time when an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> would refer to the lack of zoned land?  That newspaper, through the courtesy of some of its journalists, would have bitterly opposed every decision or view expressed over a period.  For the 1990s and beyond it seems the buzz words will be to zone more land.  Unfortunately this became a controversial subject but, thankfully, the smaller authorities and the South Dublin and Fingal county councils are in the process of reviewing their plans.</P>
    <P>Prior to Christmas, to everybody's amazement, South Dublin County Council decided at managerial level to put to its elected council that it should not put an extra 5,000 population into south Lucan but 5,000 extra houses.  This was decided by the planners, managers and experts but there was not a word about it.  Many of those on the left of the political divide would have made a strong case for all the negative criticism trotted across the political agenda in the 1980s and early 1990s.  They are the people who are now shedding crocodile tears about the price of houses for young couples.  They are paying £10,000 to £20,000 more than they should as first time purchasers. The reason for the excessive house prices in the greater Dublin region is that the system <Col N="1182" /> was not capable of foreseeing and keeping up with the demand.  In reply to how to control the price of building land, Seán Lemass was quoted in the 1960s as saying: &ldquo;you service more than you need&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Recently the Department allocated £15 million to improve sewerage schemes.  Will somebody in the Department ask Dublin Corporation why in respect of the Ringsend treatment works or the proposed so-called north fringe treatment works there is still not a spade in the ground?  We scarcely comply with the EU requirement for coastal water clean-up.  Why has this taken so long?  Why did ESB International get a large consultancy fee from Dublin Corporation to locate a treatment works on the north fringe only to discard the whole project after three years and go to Ringsend? All that work and the 20,000 placement that could have been put on the north fringe will not come about until three or four years from now.</P>
    <P>What has happened to house prices in the greater Dublin region is that the incompetence of Dublin Corporation, at managerial and engineering level, and the Department of the Environment under successive Ministers, have not seen the capital works spent.  For many years I chaired a body called ERDO, the then east regional development organisation, when its report suggested that to the year 2011 the population in Swords would grow to 100,000 population, north Kildare to 50,000, the satellite towns by an extra 10,000 or 15,000 and the north fringe by an extra 20,000.  That report was made available seven or eight years ago, every syllable of which will come to pass.  It was representative of management, engineers and planners from the local authorities in the east region.  The Minister and Minister of State are struggling to catch up.  Consultants have been appointed to ascertain why house prices are so high.  The reason is that it took Dublin Corporation, initially, far too long to make planning and, more importantly, engineering decisions.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation exerted too much influence on the planning process until the then Minister decided to reform the local government system in Dublin by creating three new county councils, following which it dumped on the market vast tracts of land zoned residential instead of allowing it to be transferred to Fingal and South Dublin county councils.  As a result private developers are making vast profits.  This land should be in the hands of Fingal and South Dublin county councils which ought to be in a position to offer sites at realistic prices to young couples to build starter homes.</P>
    <P>I welcome this small step which should speed up the planning process.  The more permissions granted the better and the greater the benefits for young couples.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Lawlor for sharing his time with me.  I support the legislation and compliment the Minister on bringing it forward. It is designed to expedite the planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> As Members are aware, there have been many delays which have impeded the progress of particular projects.  That is the case in relation to some projects under the resort renewal scheme. As the Minister is well aware, the deadline specified will be extended by one year provided a certain percentage of the proposed works is completed by July.  The promoters of three major projects in Kilkee, which I represent, with a total investment of between £16 million and £18 million, will find it difficult to comply with the strict criteria laid down.  If the decisions are appealed to An Bord Pleanála, it is difficult to see how the projects will be completed within the timeframe specified.  The scheme has been very successful. For the first time in many years there is investment in Lahinch and Kilkee.  It will be unfortunate if some projects do not proceed because of delays in the planning process.</P>
    <P>Last August the Minister announced that he was initiating a planning review.  I presume this was one of the areas identified in the review but there is a necessity for greater co-ordination of the activities of local authorities.  Limerick city and county, where a by-election is to be held within the next few weeks, and south-east Clare, including Cratloe and Meelick, are stagnating because of the lack of a cohesive regional development plan, incorporating water, sewage and effluent disposal facilities and ring roads.  I am not certain whether under current arrangements where each authority has its own responsibilities it is possible to adopt a co-ordinated approach to such development.  Unless remedial action is taken speedily Limerick city will continue to stagnate.</P>
    <P>There should be greater co-operation and co-ordination between agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and An Bord Pleanála. It appears, particularly in the technical area, that there is much duplication and overlapping.  In the Estimates for 1998 £7 million has been provided for the Environmental Protection Agency and £3 million for An Bord Pleanála where there is a huge turnover of staff.  This presents a difficulty in ensuring continuity.  Is there an explanation for this?</P>
    <P>There have been delays in County Clare where there have been some spurious court challenges. Overall, however, the response of the local planning authority and An Bord Pleanála has been positive.  I welcome the legislation as it will help to eliminate some of the delays and ensure uniformity. Concessions should be made on the issue of charges.  Those living in rural areas, which are in decline, have to pay the same charges as those living in the more prosperous built-up areas.</P>

      <P>In a democracy such as ours when a State institution such as An Bord Pleanála is unable to function properly it leads to major problems.  People must be listened to.

The ESB submitted a proposal to Cork County Council to erect 81 pylons around Cork Harbour to supply power from Aghada power station to the opposite side of the harbour.  No one is opposed to this proposal.  However, many people have objected to the proposed route.  Erecting 81 steel towers in an area already littered with them is not welcome.  There were many objections to this proposal.  Urban district councils passed motions, tourism bodies and Cobh and Harbour Chamber of Commerce objected also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The timing of this Bill is appropriate as public concern about child sexual abuse is at an all time high.  There has been a series of cases which have been very shocking in the extent of the awfulness of the abuse and the period over which it took place.  The Bill is a welcome measure as it provides an important step towards the protection of those who might be inclined to report cases of sexual abuse where they have reasonable suspicion that such abuse is taking place.</P>
      <P>The reporting of abuse to the relevant authorities is obviously important as it allows those responsible agencies investigate valid suspicions that children are being sexually mistreated.  While sexual abuse is exceptionally traumatic and painful for the children involved, it is fair to say that it is also a traumatic and disturbing experience for adults by virtue of their becoming aware of an occurrence of child sexual abuse.  The Bill will at least remove one concern of adults who become aware that child sexual abuse may be taking place and who might hesitate because they are exposing themselves to legal risk by reporting such a case.  It will remove a barrier which might act as a deterrent against reporting cases of abuse, and that in turn may be relevant to some sections of the public.</P>

    <P>The Bill is an important statement of intent on the part of the Oireachtas to do what can reasonably be done to eliminate this menace from Irish <Col N="1185" /> society or at least reduce it to the lowest level possible.  The Bill will also encourage a culture of openness, of being more frank about this dark and dismal part of Irish life.  This problem was brushed under the carpet for far too long.  It was an unmentionable which had to be avoided at almost any cost.  It is good that it is now coming into the open because it will facilitate the public in confronting the problem and help them come to grips with the extent of it so that solutions can be found.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder why so many people in Ireland are unaware of the extent of these problems and why they seem to have gone along with the brushing of this problem under the national carpet.  If people had listened to some of the older folk they would have become well aware of the extent of the problem.  Some of the older people I encountered in my youth left one in no doubt about the existence of such matters, even if they were not explicit in relation to the nature of them. Nobody was left in any doubt about the fact that it was imperative to avoid having anything to do with certain types of people.  Indeed many of these older people, while remaining vague about the specifics of these matters, were well able to get the message across to young people that there was an element in society they should keep away from for reasons that related to sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>In combating this problem it is extremely important that we become aware of its full extent and of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the people who engage in this practice.  That is fundamental to addressing the problem and either eliminating it or reducing it to the lowest possible level that can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, in its 1990 report on this matter, indicated that the reported incidence of child sexual abuse in Ireland was low by international standards.  It reached the conclusion that there was a significant level of under reporting of this problem.  The commission indicated, with some reservations, that it favoured a proposal that reporting of child sexual abuse should be made mandatory.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business yesterday the Taoiseach assured the House that there was no conflict between the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, on this matter.  To the extent that there is any difference between the Minister of State and the Tánaiste in regard to the emphasis they place on the best way to address this problem, I agree with the attitude adopted by the Minister of State in this regard.  He is being responsible in that approach and in sounding a note of caution in relation to the resources needed which are in the order of £100 million.  It is important that we provide the resources and there is little point in believing this problem can be solved without any cost.  It is fundamental also that the appropriate professional back-up, which seems to be extensive, is put in place and that an undue burden is not put on health boards and <Col N="1186" /> various agencies which are not equipped to cope with the problem.</P>
    <P>Resources must be provided as quickly as possible but we must not pretend that there is an instant solution to this problem.  It will take some time to build up the levels of expertise and infrastructure needed to address it in the manner it deserves.  I fully agree with the attitude of the Minister of State in that regard and I have no doubt about his good intentions in reaching a solution to this dreadful problem.</P>
    <P>On the question of mandatory reporting, I sound a note of caution in relation to the enthusiasm with which this strategy appears to be embraced by some elements.  It is worth pointing out that a majority of the professionals &mdash; nurses, psychologists, doctors, social workers and various other professionals engaged in dealing with child abuse &mdash; are opposed to mandatory reporting. That is something of which we must take note.  I accept the Law Reform Commission is in favour of mandatory reporting but I would be slow to disregard the reservations of those professions who seem to be speaking with one voice on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning the public position taken by some people in the medical profession and in particular by Professor Denis Gill, Professor of Paediatrics in the College of Surgeons, who must know a great deal about these matters.  One presumes he deals with this type of problem in his daily practice.  He has sounded a strong note of caution on the question of mandatory reporting. He pointed out, with some validity, that some of the worst cases were known to the agencies including the Kelly Fitzgerald, the Kilkenny and the McColgan cases.  Mandatory reporting would not provide a solution to those problems as they were already known to the agencies.</P>
    <P>In the course of a letter he wrote to <i>The Irish Times</i> last Friday, Professor Gill asked, where is the evidence that mandatory reporting prevents child abuse?  That is a valid question.  I do not know whether that evidence exists because I am not expert in that area, but it is an appropriate question to ask.  Before we enshrine this in law, it is important that such evidence is presented and debated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak on the principle of this Bill. In light of recent serious developments we have been shocked and scandalised by the terrible cases of abuse that have gone undetected dating back 30 to 40 years.  The issue of abuse is of concern to everyone, particularly the people in my constituency who witnessed the terrible circumstances of the Kelly Fitzgerald case, the case involving the Western Health Board, the Brendan Smyth case and more recently the Derry O'Rourke case.  Ordinary people find it difficult to understand how such serious levels of abuse occurred and went undetected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the general election campaign last year a commitment was given by the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="1187" /> in its programme for Government that it would introduce mandatory reporting of abuse within the life of this Government.  That important commitment will be honoured by the Government and it has cross party support in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Government ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The child is also protected under our Constitution.  While recognising that the child has rights, when discussing this issue it is also important to recognise and bear in mind that parents have rights.  This is a sensitive area and we must tread carefully.  The definitions in the Bill are important in terms of future consequences which will affect children, parents, statutory and non-statutory bodies.  It is important to consider them in light of the serious problems in this area today and not to rush to introduce legislation which might be wrong for the future.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves what we are trying to achieve.  We all recognise the objective of this Bill and the Government's commitment is that any child abuse should be reported to the appropriate authority.  That appropriate authority is the statutory authorities, the health boards and the Garda Síochána.  We want to ensure that when abuse has been reported, adequate services are available in the health boards to provide for those concerned. An individual worried that a child may be suffering some level of abuse wants to know that if he or she reports it the child concerned will receive the necessary attention and that adequate resources are in place to provide for that.  That cannot be emphasised enough.</P>
    <P>People should report abuse cases to the statutory bodies, in particular the health boards and the Garda Síochána.  That is important for a number of reasons.  Officials in the health boards and members of the Garda Síochána have the necessary experience and expertise to deal with sensitive reports and to make judgments on the action that should be taken.  It would be helpful if people could report cases of child abuse centrally as there might be many reports relating to one child or family.  Reporting incidents to statutory and non-statutory agencies would involve many people receiving reports which may not be co-ordinated or centralised.  From the point of view of confidentiality, it is important that alleged cases of abuse are investigated by the proper authority.  Therefore, it is necessary that the people to whom reports are made have the necessary expertise to deal with the sensitive issues in this area.</P>
    <P>Regarding the definition of abuse and what we are trying to achieve in this area, I draw Members' attention to the problems the Law Reform Commission envisage in the definition of abuse and the possibility that there could be a problem with over reporting in this area.  The report of the Law Reform Commission states that, if people are obliged to report potential, as opposed to actual, cases of abuse, or if the definition of abuse is vague or uncertain, professionals <Col N="1188" /> may seek to protect themselves and avoid prosecution or penalty by reporting every possible case of abuse leaving it to the health board to distinguish between fact and fiction.  That is an important statement.  Where there is a relationship between a doctor and a family and one parent brings his or her child to the doctor and the doctor suspects everything is not 100 per cent correct, the definition of abuse in the Bill, if enacted, would force the doctor, even if he or she has the slightest doubt about the case and without investigating it further, to immediately report that case to properly protect himself or herself.  I am not convinced that is the correct way to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>The general principles put forward by the Law Reform Commission state that the law should be specific enough to discourage over reporting. That cannot be emphasised enough.  Many people are over zealous and that can be unhelpful but it is regrettable that more people were not over zealous in the past.  However, if there is over reporting of cases, the health boards and Garda Síochána will be inundated with reports and the children with serious problems could well be passed over because of the glut such over reporting would create in the system.</P>
    <P>The definition of child sexual abuse should lay down a minimum rather than an optimum standard of care for children.  The Law Reform Commission states that derives from the need to recognise that methods of child care may properly vary between different families and that the capacity of the child care services to respond to reported abuse is limited by finite resources.  We all recognise that although we would all like adequate resources to be channelled into every health board to enable them to deal with the problems associated with various areas not only the areas of child abuse.  It is important to ensure serious cases of abuse are dealt with properly by the appropriate agencies.</P>
    <P>I question the definition of a person reporting an abuse on the grounds it is &ldquo;reasonable and in good faith&rdquo;.  That wording is a little loose and requires further examination by the Government before legislation is introduced.  It is important to recognise that there are many professionals doing an excellent job, such as teachers and nurses, who report cases of abuse that occur in the classroom or of which they might become aware in a hospital.  They consider there is an adequate system of reporting in place and that their professional ethos would encourage them to report such abuse.  It is important to recognise that professionals have done a good job in the past when they saw evidence of abuse, but we have all learned in recent years that many matters have been hidden and many people in our society were afraid to report cases of sexual abuse for one reason or another.  We must recognise the need to report such cases and the serious consequences for children of remaining quiet.  The Derry O'Rourke case, which has been reported extensively in recent weeks, has shown that in many <Col N="1189" /> cases people were aware of problems that existed but unfortunately remained silent.</P>
    <P>I accept the principle of the Bill and know Deputy Shatter when introducing it to the House was well motivated in light of the recent tragic cases.  However, rather than rush to introduce legislation that may not be in the best interest of everybody in the long run, it is important to examine the definitions in the Bill and, more importantly, to ensure adequate resources are made available to the health boards and every assistance is given to ensure that when an alleged abuse is reported the proper treatment is given and a proper investigation is carried out.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Shatter on continuing his fine record of introducing legislation from the Opposition benches and the Minister on his openness in accepting the Bill.  I join in expressing sympathy to those who have suffered abuse and courageously taken action in the courts.  We saw how difficult it was for them.  I congratulate them because their actions will affect those who have suffered abuse and have misgivings about going further.  Justice has been seen to be done, at least in the sentence given in last week's case.</P>
      <P>The Kilkenny incest report was produced around the time I was appointed to the Seanad in 1993.  I said then if Members of both Houses paid lip service to reports on the Kilkenny incest case and Kelly Fitzgerald, we were not only doing a disservice to those who suffered &mdash; and in one case, died &mdash; but we had no right to speak unless we could match our words with deeds.  This legislation and the Minister's approach to the issue are positive proof we are coming of age and are prepared to match our words with deeds.</P>
      <P>This Bill is part of legislation which needs to be enacted to ensure children are protected by the State.  This was not the case in the past.  There is no guarantee we can close every loophole but we can make it easier for children to come forward and more difficult for perpetrators to get away with it.  If we do nothing else, what has happened in the past few years sends a message to adults who have suffered and children who are suffering that we believe them and will believe them when they come forward with allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent press reports on the swimming coach case and one other case highlighted the perpetrators' lack of remorse, despite the fact that they had embraced religion.  The perpetrators of these crimes continued to block investigations and thwart Garda efforts until they were cornered.  This feature of the crime is thoroughly sickening.  The announcement today by the Minister for Tourism and Sport, Deputy McDaid, of <Col N="1190" /> an inquiry into the swimming cases may help to ensure our children know we believe them when they allege someone has done something inappropriate. The Minister referred to the stay safe programme and I congratulate the teachers involved.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister said the legislation needs to be amended, I support Deputy Shatter and I am pleased the Bill does not only refer to sexual abuse.  While it is traumatising and a dreadful abuse of any vulnerable child, the area of neglect and other areas covered by this legislation are important.  In the Kelly Fitzgerald case, neglect was the cause of her death.</P>
    <P>The area of sexual abuse is the only one where there are accepted definitions.  Neglect and other areas covered by this Bill do not have such clear definitions.  The Minister said he could not accept section 3(c) of the Bill which refers to circumstances where &ldquo;a child's health, development or welfare is likely to be avoidably impaired or neglected&rdquo;. However, he indicated his willingness to accept section 3(b) which refers to cases where &ldquo;a child's health, development or welfare has been or is being avoidably impaired or neglected&rdquo;. Social workers say that because of the horrific nature of child sexual abuse and the impact on the victim, responses to such cases are quicker.  Perhaps psychological abuse and neglect are not receiving such immediate attention.</P>
    <P>On the rights of children, I am at loggerheads with my colleague, Deputy Cooper-Flynn.  I agree the family has rights which must be respected. However, this has been abused.  In the Kelly Fitzgerald report, it was obvious that the social workers and agencies involved felt the rights of the family superseded the rights of the child.  I have grave misgivings about that.</P>
    <P>On page 326 of the report of the constitution review group, section 5 refers to the expanded constitutional guarantee of the rights of the child. It states:</P>
    <P>There is no express reference in Article 41 to the child.  As already indicated, the focus of this Article is on the rights of the family as a unit and on protection of it from intervention by the State rather than on the rights of the individual members of the family.  Only Article 42.5 refers to the rights of the child and imposes any specific obligation on the State. The Report on the Kilkenny Incest Investigation, chaired by Judge Catherine McGuinness, observed that &ldquo;the very high emphasis on the rights of the family in the Constitution may consciously, or unconsciously, be interpreted as giving a higher value to the rights of parents than to the rights of children&rdquo; and went on to recommend the amendment of the Constitution to include &ldquo;a specific and overt declaration of the rights of born children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As a member of the constitution review group, I support this.  I have not heard as much lobbying for the rights of born children as for the rights of <Col N="1191" /> the unborn.  We need to ensure a balance in terms of the rights of born children.  I support any review which enshrines that in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Shatter will be responsible for protecting me from myself as, on foot of information passed to me by grandparents, neighbours etc., I regularly report cases to health boards where children are at risk of abuse or neglect. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has responded very well to cases I have asked him to deal with.  I was not aware I was leaving myself open to possible litigation, from which this legislation would protect me and others.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the over-emphasis by health boards on keeping a child in a family situation.  This seems to be presumed to be the right thing in cases where there has been abuse, not necessarily sexual.  It is seen as the best way to deal with the problem if health boards can put resources behind the family unit to keep it together.  I am not sure that is the best way to deal with cases of abuse.  At least the perpetrator can be removed where there is violence in the home.  In cases of neglect and sexual abuse, whoever is responsible should be removed from the family home.  I know from experience that health boards have tried to support families where both parents are involved in neglect or abuse.  It may be safer to place children with foster parents in the interim.</P>
    <P>Health boards seem to have to protect themselves because all these cases have consequences and there are implications if they make a wrong decision.  I heard of a case where a young boy was in care and a couple, not registered foster parents, offered to care for him.  Because of the particular circumstances the social worker recommended that the boy should be placed in care and not with foster parents.  We must be careful to ensure that health boards and carers do not see themselves operating entirely to the letter of the law.  In one of the interviews after the case last week, a social worker was asked why he thought it had reached the situation it had and why the abuse had continued for so long.  In response he said it was because the parties involved, leaving aside the abuser, simply took legal advice.  They did not follow their gut instinct which might have been to ensure that the allegation was dealt with, including the removal of the person responsible.  They took legal advice which was that if they took course A they might leave themselves open to further legal challenge by the person involved.</P>
    <P>If we go too far down that road we may leave health boards hamstrung in that everything they do is based on the letter of the law and options available to them may not be taken on board.</P>
    <P>The 1988 report of the inquiry into the operation of Madonna House stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Child abuse is so central that as a society we choose to reject our knowledge of it rather than make the changes in our thinking, our institutions and our daily lives that sustained <Col N="1192" /> awareness of child abuse victimisation demands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is ten years since that was written and I hope the situation is changing.  Societal attitudes have changed; children are no longer being told to be seen and not heard.  Their voices should be heard loudly and clearly.  All our legislation should be child centred.  I commend Deputy Shatter on his Bill and I welcome the opportunity to deal with it further on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and commend Deputy Shatter for presenting it to the House.  It deals with a serious aspect of reporting child abuse and it is clearly an important element in the response necessary to tackle it.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I listened with interest to the speech of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.  As far as I am aware, it was the first time the Minister made a comprehensive statement on any issue relating to the rights of children.  A name change does not make a Minister and it is clear from the record of this Government that we do not have what is actually needed.  We do not have a Minister for Children whose focus and authority are sufficient to the task.  All we have is a Minister of State whose brief has been too narrow to make any real impact.</P>
      <P>This lack of leadership in relation to the rights of children has led to considerable confusion, particularly on the issue of mandatory reporting. A commitment to the mandatory reporting of child abuse is clearly outlined in the Government's programme, yet on 9 October 1997 in this House the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, urged against &ldquo;proposals that apply a simplistic, prescriptive, legal solution to a very complex problem&rdquo;.  He then assured the House that he did not intend to introduce legislation on the issue.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, we have had a number of statements from Progressive Democrats Ministers stating a contradictory view to that of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey.  On television last Monday, for example, the Tánaiste flatly opposed his approach.  Last night the Minister, Deputy Cowen, presumably in a definitive statement, indicated the Government would proceed with legislation.  However, he then proceeded to outline all the reasons he could not proceed, or at least he defined the hurdles that had to be overcome before he could do so.</P>
      <P>During the last general election there was no evidence of such reflection or thought being given to the subject by Fianna Fáil.  That party operated as it always does.  Simply put, their line is to tell lobby groups what they want to hear and when the election is out of the way they do what you want.  Is it any wonder that voters are cynical?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> In this instance the fact that Fianna Fáil is in coalition does make some difference, although I would not hold my breath about seeing legislation. I happen to agree with both the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, on this matter.  I believe caution is warranted on the introduction of mandatory reporting, but I also believe in being straight with the electorate when it comes to election time.</P>
    <P>What concerns me about the debate is not the issue of immunity from liability or the issue of confidentiality, important as these are.  What concerns me most is the lack of any clear, overarching policy from this Government.  The care of children is a much broader issue than that of simply reporting abuse or protecting those who report it.  The requirements to meet the needs are complex and demand resources.</P>
    <P>Any incoming Government should have seen that the process of co-ordinating services is a difficult one, but it had been begun by the rainbow Government.  It should have been made more effective, not less so, yet the Taoiseach rolled back on efforts towards more effective co-ordination. What is now glaringly obvious is that nobody is taking charge and that, in Dr. Anthony Clare's words, &ldquo;the current situation is in a shambles&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reforming work started by Deputy De Rossa in supporting children living in poverty was not continued or completed by this Government. Instead we got payback time for the well-off.  The Celtic tiger reigns but the care and support services for children at risk are either overloaded or non-existent. However, if we cannot deal with these issues now when will we ever be able to do so?</P>
    <P>The submission from the Children's Rights Alliance to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child showed that 1,242 children were waiting for in-patient procedures in two public hospitals in Dublin alone.  From 1995 to 1997, however, 135 children who were not sick were kept in hospitals because there was nowhere else to put them. Others were accommodated in bed and breakfast establishments and even adult psychiatric hospitals have been asked to take in psychiatrically sick children.  Prison has also been used to accommodate children who are non-offenders.</P>
    <P>Recently the Government was represented at the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  I fully accept that many of the issues I have outlined and that need to be addressed are long-standing and cannot be resolved overnight.  What I find unacceptable, however, is the dismal lack of any serious, organised commitment on children's rights.  There is no strategic approach, no vision and no plan.  The crisis management that characterises services at home was presented without much grace as policy abroad.</P>
    <P>The UN Committee report stated:</P>
    <P>Eventually the Government replied to the reasonable question put by the Committee on the adoption of a comprehensive national strategy for children.  Eventually it would be our intention to draw a wide range of individual <Col N="1194" /> developments together in the context of a national strategy.</P>
    <P>How abstract, vague and incredible it sounds.  The lack of a clear strategy is the single greatest need in relation to children at risk.  They need early prevention before crises occur, along with residential care, family support systems and alternatives to secure facilities, such as new models of open residential care.</P>
    <P>Many homeless children end up exploited as child prostitutes because they were originally victims of abuse at home.  When we discuss mandatory reporting I hope we might also talk about a mandatory, comprehensive and effective strategy that would transform the current situation from one of crisis into one of care, capability and compassion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Government, the Minister for Health and Children and his Ministers of State to accept Fine Gael's legislationentitledthe Children (Reporting of Alleged Abuse) Bill, 1998.  I congratulate Deputy Shatter on bringing the Bill forward and on his work on family issues over the years.  Our children are the most precious part of our society and the State must protect them. Everything must be done to ensure that children are protected from abuse or neglect.  Barriers or obstacles which prevent the reporting of suspected child abuse or neglect to the appropriate authorities must be removed.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House removes one such barrier.  It protects those who have reasonable grounds for believing a child is at risk and report it to the appropriate authorities from civil litigation or dismissal from employment.  This is an important proposal to facilitate the reporting of child abuse and neglect.  Recent court cases have outlined in graphic detail the level of child abuse in our society.  Both the McColgan and O'Rourke cases exposed a level of cruelty and abuse which has shocked society.  Those and other cases, such as the Fr. Brendan Smyth case, has exposed to the public the level of abuse which takes place and the consequences of such abuse for the victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the destruction of self-esteem experienced by victims of child sex abuse stems from the fact they may not have been believed in the first place.  Describing the abuse in court, especially in a case where an abuser is convicted, can end in the vindication of the plaintiff.  The McColgan family and the young women abused by Derry O'Rourke expressed the need for victims of abuse to regain publicly the dignity and sense of worth of which they were robbed.  The State should facilitate this opportunity for expressing such a need.  The Minister should examine the statute of limitations with regard to taking civil cases relating to sex abuse in childhood. This limits the time lapse in which such cases can be taken.  A guilty plea means the victims do not have to give evidence or be cross-examined by defence lawyers for the accused <Col N="1195" /> which could prove painful.  However, it also robs the victim of an opportunity to confront their abuser.  Recent cases outline the importance of this to victims.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that the victim of calculated violence is likely to suffer deep and serious effects as a child, teenager and adult.  Many suffer from multiple personalities, bouts of alcohol consumption and some have suicidal tendencies.  They suffer from depression, elation and nervous breakdowns and they spend long periods of life in self-imposed isolation due to a mistrust of and a disbelief in humanity.  They discard friendships and are unable to see the difference between reality and fantasy.</P>
    <P>Evidence in recent cases justifies a change in the law to allow victims of abuse to confront in court their abusers or those who, directly or indirectly, protected the abusers.  Where an abuser pleads guilty in a criminal trial, the abused victim should be allowed to describe the abuse, as happened in recent cases.  This could be done after the conviction but before sentencing.  It could supplement the victim impact statements used in some cases to assist the judge in sentencing.</P>
    <P>It is ten years since the Law Reform Commission reported that fear of being sued for defamation is a barrier to reporting abuse.  In 1989 the commission stated that legislation should be enacted to confer immunity from liability for bona fide reports of child abuse made with due care.  This Bill will improve and facilitate the reporting of child abuse and create an environment which will help to facilitate such reporting.  It will also facilitate co-operation between professionals and agencies dealing with children who are suspected of being at risk.  I welcome the fact the Government is prepared to accept the Bill and address this fundamental gap in the law.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent announcement that the Minister of State of the Department of Health and Children will have a comprehensive brief for children which will not only include his Department but the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education and Science.  I am pleased the Government recognises that the old system of fragmenting responsibility for children's legislation and services is no longer suitable and that one Minister will now have responsibility for this area.  The fact the Government was forced to correct this situation at a hearing of the UN committee on the rights of the child speaks for itself.  I welcome the announcement at that meeting by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, who was questioned for a gruelling six hours by the international members of the committee.  She listened to considerable criticism and acknowledged that much of it was valid.  She accepted that there was a lack of co-ordination between different Departments and a piecemeal approach to child care in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> The UN committee made it clear to the Government that signing the convention on children's rights involved obligations.  In its interim submission, the committee said that the Government reacted to specific situations rather than acknowledging that children had rights, including that of having a safe childhood.  Will the Minister for Health and Children present the report from the UN committee to the Dáil when the Government receives it?  It is important that there is a full and detailed discussion on the findings of the committee which was established to monitor the implementation of the 1989 UN convention on the rights of the child which Ireland signed in 1993.</P>
    <P>One committee member said the Government adopted a patronising approach to children and he was not alone in his comments on two profoundly different philosophies of children's welfare. He believed that children did not feel they were full members of Irish society.  The chairperson stated that the Irish submissions lacked the sense of the children as people.  He said there was much talk of the protection of children but not enough of their empowerment.  Children did not seem to participate in the formation of these policies. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, acknowledged the problem and promised to press the issue with the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>This morning on RTE radio a victim and the mother of a victim outlined the horror story of sexual abuse caused by Derry O'Rourke.  The Minister must ensure that all the information in the case is made available.  The role of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association must be fully examined.  The mother outlined that her 16 year old daughter had been abused by Derry O'Rourke in November 1992.  She was completely devastated.  In the six days before she told her family about the abuse she was ill with migraine headaches and could not go to school.  She had an open relationship with her family which facilitated discussion of the matter.</P>
    <P>The family immediately contacted the committee of the club who confronted O'Rourke. However, he denied everything.  The committee then asked the child to put the complaint in writing and the family met three of the committee members.  The mother explained on the radio that this meeting was a difficult and stressful experience. They were asked if they were overreacting and one of the committee members asked if they were aware that children in the US swam naked to increase their times.  Guarantees were eventually given that O'Rourke would not be allowed on the side of the pool on his own, he would not bring the girls to the board room and he would cease measuring the inside legs, hips and busts of girls.</P>
    <P>The parents subsequently saw a copy of a letter which was sent to the Garda Commissioner which stated that &ldquo;there was only one incident in the last 22 years of coaching to this Committee's knowledge from a family regarding their <Col N="1197" /> daughter, which might be construed as sexual, which was investigated by three Committee members who were in unanimous agreement that the claim was mistaken and the incident without foundation&rdquo;.  O'Rourke, however, pleaded guilty to this offence in court.  I outline this incident which is in the public domain to highlight the need to ensure that a full investigation is carried out into all matters in this case.</P>
    <P>During Question Time last week the Minister stated that the appointment of an ombudsman, which was identified as being necessary by the Children's Rights Alliance and the United Nations committee on the rights of the child, had been put on the long finger.  Last December it was announced that the Government would not establish such an office but I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, changed that decision in Geneva.</P>
    <P>Much work needs to be done in this area.  Children must feel part of society; they must be consulted. This Bill is an important step in ensuring that children's rights are upheld.  I congratulate Deputy Shatter for his initiative in introducing this Bill and I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Shatter for introducing this Bill.  There is such a contrast between his efforts and those of the Government to address this complex issue.  I welcome last night's announcement by the Government that it intends to accept this Bill.  It is welcome whether or not mandatory reporting of child abuse is implemented, because it addresses the real problems of professionals working with children in the area of child care.  It will give protection to teachers, nurses, doctors and community workers who may wish to report their suspicions of child abuse to the health boards or to the Garda Síochána. The Bill specifies that people who make reports in good faith cannot subsequently be sued or dismissed from their posts.  Conversely, the Bill will not provide shelter for those who make malicious or false allegations.</P>
      <P>I know from professionals in the field that fear of legal proceedings, although such fears are often unfounded, is usually the reason people hesitate to report their concerns to health boards.  People are often unwilling to give their names when making a report.  This is evidenced by the large number of anonymous reports to the health boards each year. Clearly an anonymous report will not be given the same weight as a report that someone is willing to stand over by giving their name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill will offer protection to professionals such as teachers who report their concerns in good faith to the health boards.  Before making such a report professionals would have to have reasonable grounds for believing that a child has or is being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused or that his or her health or welfare is being avoidably impaired or neglected.  Teachers spend a large <Col N="1198" /> proportion of time with our children and get to know them very well, and they are often the first to pick up on a child who is troubled or distressed for whatever reason.  I know of a teacher who was very concerned about one of her pupils.  She followed the relevant Department of Education guidelines and the matter was referred to the health board.  This teacher was subjected to a barrage of harassment and abuse from the child's father, and she lived under the threat of legal proceedings for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>We should not forget that the purpose of our debate is to try to protect children.  Enough abuse has been reported lately to make us all stop and think about how this could happen in our country and how we could let children be abused, physically, sexually or mentally.  Who was responsible for those children?  Why was the abuse not reported, and who should have reported it?</P>
    <P>In 1993 an IFPC survey asked Irish adults about their experience of sexual abuse in childhood. Sixteen per cent reported having been sexually abused, and 12 per cent reported having been contact sexually abused in childhood.  Only 2 per cent of those abused said they had reported this abuse to a social worker or to a garda.  I am not surprised at the low level of reporting.  Children depend on adults to guide and protect them, and they are physically as well as emotionally threatened in this situation.  They live in their own small world, in their own immediate surroundings, and have no competence or even knowledge of how to deal with an abuser.  They do not even recognise that what is happening to them is wrong or that someone should be helping them.</P>
    <P>For some people childhood has not been as carefree and happy as it should have been, and many of these people are adults today carrying that burden.  Their lives have been irreparably damaged.  They did not get the help they needed. That creates further problems for themselves and for others with whom they come into contact, and the cycle continues.  How often do we hear that a person in a position of trust with children abused those children physically, sexually, emotionally or through neglect, and that the reason for the abuse stems from the fact that the abuser was abused as a child?  If that abuse had been recognised and proper help and professional counselling given, the situation might have been rectified, although it is quite possible that victims of childhood abuse never recover from the wrongdoing, carrying the burden through life and, perhaps, suffering from personality disorders and bouts of alcoholism.</P>
    <P>Fear and mistrust are the reasons we do not get voluntary reporting of child abuse.  Consider a mother whose husband abuses their children. Because she cannot be confident that the State will support her emotionally, physically and financially, she thinks she is doing the best she can for her children by letting things rest, perhaps believing that the situation will rectify itself.  It is difficult for family members to bring outsiders into their home.  Often this is because of fear of the perpetrator of the abuse and the knowledge <Col N="1199" /> that if they upset the <i>status quo</i> the abuser is likely to become more violent and more abusive and those living with him will suffer more.</P>
    <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Shatter.  I emphasise the need for more support for the health boards, financial and otherwise, in implementing the reporting of child abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the fact that the Government has accepted the Bill and that we will have an opportunity to discuss it further and perhaps talk about resources to back it up when it comes to Committee Stage.  I thank Deputy Shatter for using his legal and legislative expertise in bringing this Bill before the House because we all share a sense of horror and guilt at what seems to be an endless saga of suffering and long-term fundamental damage caused to victims who have the courage to make a statement, whether in the courts or before a health board, and convey to us the enormity of what was done to them and the extraordinary sense of injustice they live with. What should galvanise us is that this Bill and the support services we hope to put in place will not and cannot help those victims, but they can give us a sense of their pain and suffering and allow us as a society to ensure that the loneliness, the isolation, the guilt and the incredible personal responsibility heaped on vulnerable children who had to come through this dark tunnel by themselves will never be allowed to be repeated and that we, as the elected members of our society, will ensure that, regardless of where the money comes from, resources will be put in place.</P>
      <P>I remember hearing and taking on board a long time ago that all real learning is painful.  It has not been more painful for anybody than for the victims, but something we, who saw our society as child-centred, have to face up is the sense of wanting to block off what we felt was unacceptable, that is, that vulnerable children under the authority of an all-powerful adult should have felt there was nowhere they could turn and that there were no support services if they voiced the horrors of what was happening to them.  Let us use the pain of the victims but also the painful realities we have had to face up to. Constitutionally we have said we will protect our children, that we will protect the family unit because without the family unit the common good cannot be served.  Despite that, it is in these areas that people have to beg, plead and almost scream for resources.  We have to get our priorities right.  In the light of the painful experiences of these victims we need to use the expertise of people like Deputy Shatter.  We need more enlightened and more sensitive judges.  We all need to be aware of people's need to tell their story.  Having told their story, there must be adequate backup, counselling and support services available for victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way we can ensure total confidence in the service and adequate expertise and resources is through the appointment of an <Col N="1200" /> ombudsman to whom victims can go in the knowledge that he is independent and will act on their behalf regardless of where they come from or what type of abuse has taken place.  Children still do not have rights and we must move away from a cultural mindset where children are seen and not heard and where the adult is always correct. We also need to move away from authoritarian educational, church and parenting systems, meet the challenges and try to make up for what has happened.  Above all, the Minister must be given the necessary resources to enable him to protect children's rights.  If we fail to do this then we cannot call ourselves civilised, Christian or family orientated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Children (Reporting of Alleged Abuse) Bill, 1998.  Any measure which seeks to protect children is good and no right thinking person should oppose it.</P>
      <P>The large increase in the number of child abuse cases reported in recent times is due to the increase in the level of reporting.  We are lifting the veil on what has been happening for many years and showing that we are more open and mature and are willing to face up to the difficulties in society.  Child abuse is not a new phenomenon and the increase in the number of cases reported does not mean the problem is getting worse.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter on bringing forward the Bill and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and the Government on accepting it. While I support its objectives, I have a problem with section 3 which refers to &ldquo;no person acting reasonably and in good faith&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;no person&rdquo; can refer to anyone and it would be better if it was more specific.  Having listened to Opposition Deputies one would get the impression we are talking only about health professionals.  It is important to make this term more specific.  Who will decide whether a person is acting reasonably and in good faith?  There must be some way of measuring this.  I am worried this could lead to unnecessary reporting.  I am happy to support this section provided these terms are clearly defined. The Bill refers to children under 18 years.  The age of consent is 17 years and this ambiguity must be addressed.</P>
      <P>The Bill must be balanced.  While there is nothing worse for a child than to be abused and be unable to report it, there is nothing worse for an adult than to have a malicious report made against him.  The Bill should provide for the imposition of severe sanctions against people who make reports for malicious reasons.  If a report is made for malicious reasons a person's reputation, life and marriage can be destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What constitutes abuse?  I live in a rural area where many teenagers work on the family farm or help out in the family business.  I do not consider this abuse but someone else might believe these children are being worked to the bone.  The terms used in the Bill should be more specific. There has been a reference to the need for <Col N="1201" /> resources.  It is not merely a question of providing adequate resources; there must also be a change in attitude and culture.  We can allocate all the funding we want to this area but if we do not have a right attitude then it will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Many of the cases which have come to light recently have involved people from rural areas.  I would like to know if there are factors in rural areas which give rise to more cases of this kind or whether it is simply that these are the cases which have been reported.  Has the Department a view on whether there are certain factors in rural areas which give rise to more of these cases?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter for introducing the Bill.  While I agree with the principle of it, there are some problems which need to be ironed out on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the victims of child abuse for their courage and resilience.  The cases which have come to light in recent days highlight two fundamental truths: first, child abuse is an enormously complex area where professional, objective, trained personnel must be available to recognise cases, to take appropriate action and to have the resources to do so and, second, society has changed forever and will no longer tolerate nor keep hidden such callous, heinous corruption of the young.  In so far as the Government and my Department are concerned, there is no hiding place for the perpetrators of child abuse.  Whatever we have to do to root them out and deal with them will be done.</P>
      <P>Since the work of the Kilkenny incest investigation team huge advances have been made in terms of child protection and in the development of an infrastructure which was non-existent a few years ago.  However, there is no room for complacency. Even though 900 extra staff have been employed in recent years and an extra £43 million has been spent &mdash; the total expenditure in this area, excluding certain areas of child welfare, is approximately £80 million &mdash; there is still a need to make significant strides forward.  I have put in place a strategic plan.  While Deputy Shatter criticised me in a fairly trenchant manner last night, I take that criticism on the chin as I know it is well meant.  However, I have to say in my defence that the situation I inherited last July was not perfect. I am aware of efforts made by my predecessor in memoranda to Government to get extra resources, which were refused by the Department of Finance.  I have made efforts to get a significant increase in resources and, while I got an extra £13 million, it is far short of requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constructive approach adopted by all speakers in this debate is welcome.  Deputy Barnes summed up the real problem in this area. Up to now the whole issue of children has not been significantly dealt with.  The previous Government, particularly my predecessor, Deputy Currie, is to be complimented on giving special attention to this issue.  In recent years a number of Governments have put in place <Col N="1202" /> increased resources.  Deputy McManus is incorrect is saying that there is no strategic plan and no vision.  Just because the Deputy and others are not aware of it does not mean there is no plan. My Department has worked on a three year co-ordinated millennium plan for children and it was put to Government in recent months.  I have no doubt about the priorities and how they should be met.  Massive resources are needed to put the plan in place.</P>
    <P>All Governments in recent years have failed to recognise the major issue of the welfare of our children.  Debates such as this are of significant importance in outlining to the House, the Government and the community at large that a new approach must be adopted to the welfare of our children, and that assists me in my job.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties to be overcome.  There is a first class staff in the Department of Health and Children, but only ten or 11 people are doing a job that rightfully should be done by perhaps three times that number.  The budget is far short of that required to deal with the vast expanse of difficulties that exist for thousands of children. Let us not make a political football of our children. I will respond always as honestly as I can.  I will outline the difficulties and hope we will assist one another in overcoming them.</P>
    <P>One of my priorities is the establishment of a social services inspectorate, a critically important resource needed to respond to the reports of recent weeks and months.  We are proceeding with speed to set up that inspectorate and I have provided £300,000 in this year's budget for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised for lack of co-ordination. I have continued in exactly the same way as my predecessor, Deputy Currie, in the Department of Health and Children, a Department with improved status for children.  I have had ongoing meetings with officials in the Department of Justice and on many mornings on my way to Dublin I spent time in the Department of Education and Science in Athlone dealing with officials about this matter.  It is incorrect to say there has been no co-ordination and that there is not an important role for all three Departments involved.  Under the strategic initiative of 1997 those Departments work together on this matter, and I reject criticism of that nature.  I welcome the decision by the Government to bring together the three Departments in dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>Significant progress is being made in this area. Child abuse is not about mandatory reporting &mdash; that is a red herring.  Mandatory reporting is not the panacea for success in tackling child abuse. Major resources must be put into this area and I am committed to work hard to get those resources.  New structures must be put in place. There are thousands of children who are vulnerable and seriously at risk of abuse, physical, emotional and sexual, and until such time as we put in place the necessary resources we will be unable to deal with that problem.  If the people <Col N="1203" /> knew how bad the position is in terms of physical and emotional as well as sexual abuse, there would be an outcry.</P>
    <P>I am happy to move this Bill into Committee and I hope to get the resources in terms of new legislation and initiatives in all health boards to give every child the lifestyle he or she deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill and commend Deputy Shatter on bringing it forward. It is an indictment of legislators that it is almost a decade since the Law Reform Commission recommended &ldquo;the conferring of immunity from liability for bona fide reports of child abuse made with due care&rdquo;.  This legislation is thus long overdue. In the nine years since the Law Reform Commission report the issue of child abuse, sexual and otherwise, has moved to the top of the political agenda.  It is a horrific reality that children have had to live in secrecy and in silence. This issue more than any other demonstrates that the most vulnerable section of society is also the most abused.</P>
      <P>Child sexual abuse was for a long time an unspeakable issue.  The victims and survivors of sexual abuse were rendered voiceless because of the unwillingness of society in general and those in authority in particular, those in Church and State, to confront this most serious and fundamental problem.  Far from confronting it those authorities often protected the abuser, hid the abuse and abandoned the victims.</P>
      <P>It is only in recent yeas the full extent of the problem has been highlighted.  The shameful regimes which existed in institutions run by religious and State bodies have been exposed. Individuals of authority, supposedly people of trust and responsibility, have been found guilty of the most heinous abuse of vulnerable children. There is much wider appreciation of the tragic reality that it is most often in the home, at the hands of parents and other close relatives, abuse occurs.  There can no longer be doubt that this problem is widespread and deeply ingrained in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to monitor continuously the reactions of the various State agencies to child sexual abuse and the preventative and interventionist programmes that are being developed. It is imperative that the safety of the child is a priority, and that must be ensured with proper consultation and the co-operation of the nonabusing parent.  There is much to be done in legislative terms to tackle this problem and, as Deputy Shatter pointed out, much more than legislation is required.  This Bill, however, provides a necessary reform to protect those who are in a position to report suspected abuse.  Any obstacle which might prevent the rescue of children from the horror of abuse should be removed.  The Bill does <Col N="1204" /> that.  I again commend its mover and am happy to record my support of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those on all sides of the House who spoke on the Bill and made kind remarks about it.  I had two objectives in bringing forward the Bill.  I had hoped we would join across the floor of the House in order that, without acrimony of a party political nature, the Bill would pass through Second Stage, and I am pleased that has proved possible.  The winners in that outcome are not the Fine Gael Party or any party in this House; they are children in this country. There is a need for us to deal with this type of concern in this manner in this Chamber when we can.  That does not mean that this Chamber should not be used to raise other issues of concern in relation to children, to tease out from the Opposition benches, as is our duty, our concerns about what we see as failures in the policy of the Government and to set out areas which we believe should be addressed.  We have used this debate as a vehicle to do that.</P>
      <P>The second objective was to focus on the needs which this Bill cannot address, the needs which must be addressed by Government and the gaps which must be filled if we are to have not simply legislation but social services which truly respond to the needs of children and families in trouble. Often the fact that a child is in difficulties is simply a reflection of disintegration within the family unit of which that child is a member.  It is all too easy on occasion to see the child who is the victim of neglect or abuse in isolation and not see that child in the overall context of the family.</P>
      <P>I want to raise one or two issues with regard to matters brought to our attention by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey.  Before I do that, I want to refer briefly to some of the criticisms of the substance of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that we agree on the principles of the Bill.  That is of great importance.  I know from the public reaction which I received during the course of the day, from people in the medical profession and the teaching profession and from some members of the general public who do not fall into these categories, that the Bill is welcome. I can say something which is not often said to Governments from the Opposition benches, that the Government has done its image among the general public no harm by not opposing this Bill. The approach from all sides of this House is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been some criticisms voiced of the substance of the Bill and I fully accept that is part of the parliamentary process.  Every Bill published by a Minister is criticised from the Opposition benches and is often subject to amendments tabled by that Minister.  I never take the view that any legislation published by the Opposition or the Government is written in stone and that it should not be amended.  However, some of the criticisms are inaccurate and based on misunderstandings. We will have a great opportunity to <Col N="1205" /> tease this out on Committee Stage, but I do not want the view of the Bill as portrayed by some Deputies and by the Minister to gain any credibility or currency.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that to some degree the Bill is too broad and that to preserve it as it is could result in irresponsible people being given some sort of licence to make unwarranted reports to the detriment of the individuals who it may be alleged have been abusing children and in respect of whom the allegations are incorrect. The Bill has been drafted very carefully.  For a person who reports abuse to be exempt from civil liability, he or she must behave reasonably and act in good faith, and the report must be on reasonable grounds.  Some speakers have asked what those phrases mean.  Those are well worn phrases which have been teased out by the Judiciary in a variety of different areas of our law and to which the courts have had no difficulty in attaching a meaning.  It is the formula to which Deputy Ó Caoláin and my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party referred and which was recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  By saying that the person making the report must act reasonably, it is to some degree even more careful than the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the case that reports should largely be confined simply to health boards and the Garda, that he is concerned about reference to other bodies involved with the care and welfare of children.  He made the somewhat ludicrous suggestion that this could result in allowing people to make reports to whomever happens to be running the local crèche and sports club.  That is not the case and it is not the intention. The formula used in the legislation with regard to non-governmental bodies concerned with the welfare of children is one which actually replicates a provision in the Children Act, 1908, which gave the ISPCC the status to bring child care proceedings from 1908 to the 1970s and 1980s.  If an individual reports his or her concern that a child is being abused to an organisation, such as the ISPCC or Barnardos, he or she does that responsibly and in good faith, and he or she seeks advice as to how to proceed further, that individual should not be at risk of civil liability.</P>
    <P>It is curious that the Government should disagree with my view in that context because the Minister referred to the fact that the Department of Health and Children has asked health boards to ensure that funding to voluntary agencies dealing with children is conditional on those agencies having procedures in place to deal with allegations of child abuse.  He said that most voluntary agencies with responsibility for children in the health area have well developed procedures in place and work closely with health boards when such allegations arise.  The Minister is providing funding for voluntary agencies which he acknowledges have roles to play in dealing with child abuse and at the time suggesting that when <Col N="1206" /> people report child abuse to these agencies they should not have immunity for civil liability.  That makes no sense.  Perhaps when the Minister teases out this aspect to a greater degree he will see that what I am saying makes sense.</P>
    <P>There are other issues relating to the phraseology of the Bill which we will deal with on Committee Stage.  The Bill is not written in stone.  If the Government comes forward with constructive amendments which will improve the Bill I will be quite happy, but l will not agree to amendments which would undermine the objectives of the Bill. That is important.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will get every support possible from this side of the House to ensure that the resources he needs for the child care services are made available.  Our concerns are that it is the Government which prioritises how moneys will be spent, determines what moneys will be raised by taxes and what tax changes will be made.  It has been the decision of this Government to date not to provide the resources which are needed for the child care services.</P>

      <P>If the child care services cannot cope with the demands being made by the increase in the reporting of child abuse, it is the responsibility of the Government to set as a priority the allocation of the funding needed to ensure that the personnel required are available to the health boards, and that those personnel have the training needed to ensure proper responses.  That is an issue of Government priority.  One can not say &ldquo;payback time&rdquo; out of one side of one's month and say that we do not have the money to protect our children out of the other side.  The sum of £20 million per year has been lost to the Exchequer on the Government's calculation, which I suspect is a conservative one, by the change in capital gains tax rates from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  Without that change substantial additional resources would be available for the care of children.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to an issue omitted from the speech of the Minister for Health and Children but to which the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, made brief reference.  It is very significant that in the Minister for Health and Children's speech there is no reference to the children's ombudsman.  Deputy Barnes is quite right in saying that we need a children's ombudsman to monitor the services in place for children, to independently highlight their deficiencies, and to ensure that the Government is put under pressure to meet its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it curious and difficult to understand why the £100,000 the previous Government proposed for a public information campaign to heighten <Col N="1207" /> awareness of child abuse &mdash; which is much needed to ensure proper reporting &mdash; is being diverted to moneys to be given to the Children's Rights Alliance to campaign for awareness in respect of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  I would have thought that money would be better spent in ensuring greater awareness of child abuse.  Everyone is aware that the Government has been criticised by the United Nations committee.  In that context, I am not sure the diversion of the £100,000 is a proper use of resources.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is familiar with the Enterprise, Trade and Employment brief.</P>
      <P>If the Tánaiste and her Department have not already done so, I ask that they become involved with negotiations in respect of the strike at IJM in Monaghan.  More than 130 jobs are at stake at this long established, family-owned timber frame factory, the success of which is due to IDA funding and, more importantly, the foresight of the McCaughey family and the commitment and hard work of the local workforce.  Unfortunately, an impasse has arisen a short time after the signing of an important American partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To some people this may seem to be just another strike.  However, the owners have made it clear they are prepared to relocate their operation. <Col N="1208" /> Given that a similar factory moved operations from the Clontibret area in County Monaghan to Dundalk, we have good reason to be concerned.  County Monaghan depends, in the main, on locally based industry.  Few foreign IDA-supported industries have been placed in the county.  On many occasions, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has remarked on the fact that few foreign industries have located in the Border region. Therefore, these family-owned industries are very important.</P>
    <P>IJM and its workforce is just as important to Monaghan as any of the factories in Tallaght, Galway, Clonmel, Cork, etc., which have closed. Successive Governments established task forces in a number of these areas.  The people of Monaghan do not want a task force, they want every effort made to ensure that the IJM factory is retained in Monaghan.  I urge the Minister to take the necessary steps to facilitate a return to work and a resumption of production before important orders are lost.</P>
    <P>I use this opportunity to urge the factory owners and the workforce to avail of mediation services offered from any source.  Every dispute must be settled by parties sitting down around a table and making a real effort to iron out their differences rather than continuing their stand-off, which can only do serious damage to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I am genuinely concerned that the IJM factory could be transferred to another area.  The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, recently attended the official launch of IJM's partnership with an American company.  Perhaps he was joking, but the Minister was overheard stating that it would be great to see such a factory established in Dundalk. I do not want to see IJM establishing its operations in Dundalk.  I do not mind if another concern wishes to set up a similar factory there, provided the opportunity to do so exists.</P>
    <P>IJM was established more than 30 years ago and it has been through a difficult period. However, in recent years, like the Monaghan Century Homes factory, it has made a niche for itself in the international market and become a major benefit to Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The issues which caused the strike can be easily solved.  I accept that the workforce may not have been provided with the requisite facilities.  It is clear there is a need for flexibility in respect of working hours because people in the building trade work longer hours in summer than they do in winter.  There is also a need for intervention to ensure that a company which has served County Monaghan well, and which was grant-aided by previous Governments, continues to provide employment there.  I ask that the Minister and her colleagues ensure that the necessary action is taken to retain this valuable industry in County Monaghan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Tánaiste and the Minister of State <Col N="1209" /> at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt.  I recognise the sincerity with which Deputy Crawford made his case.</P>
      <P>I had lunch today with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy O'Hanlon, and we discussed this issue.  That was before I discovered I would be coming before the House to reply to this debate. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is also concerned about the way this problem has gathered pace. Reading the background note to the reply, I was amazed at how quickly this matter reached a serious impasse.</P>
      <P>I share both Deputies concerns about the events that have transpired at this factory.  IJM was established in 1965 as a general joinery company manufacturing timber frame housing and quickly established an expertise in that area.  The background note provides interesting information about this issue and indicates that timber frame housing is one of the oldest forms of construction of its kind.  As already stated, IJM quickly established an expertise in this area which, both nationally and internationally, is second to none.</P>
      <P>IJM provides employment for 130 people and has done so for many years.  It is very important to the local economy.  Everyone is shocked when a factory employing large numbers of people sheds jobs or closes.  However, in a proportionate sense, the loss of employment at a plant of this kind can also wreak havoc.  I pay tribute to the McCaughey family for its long record of good work at IJM.  However, it is disappointing that the company and its long-standing workforce should have arrived at the present impasse.</P>
      <P>I am informed that earlier this week, employees received a letter from the company purporting to terminate their employment and offering re-employment under a new contract. Subsequently, the workforce commenced a picket at the plant.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 refers to an enterprise culture under a partnership arrangement.  The provisions of that agreement seek to encourage management-employee co-operation through a partnership approach to the changes needed.  In this dispute management and employees appear to have moved away quickly from dialogue to a confrontational stance.  I remind the parties of statutory obligations and rights that may govern their actions, for example, protection of employment and industrial relations legislation.  It is preferable to follow the example of an increasing number of Irish companies who have been able to agree with their workforces changes in work practices using the principles of a partnership approach.</P>
      <P>It is important good relations between management and the workforce at the factory are restored as a continuance of this dispute will undo relationships built over a long period.  The parties should immediately demonstrate a willingness to reach a settlement of the dispute by taking urgent steps to engage in dialogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to meet the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade <Col N="1210" /> and Employment, Deputy Kitt, tomorrow and report directly to them.  I acknowledge the Deputy feels very strongly about this issue and I will convey the urgency of the matter to them. My colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, will be doing the same and I also acknowledge Deputy Ó Caoláin's representations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased, a Leas Cheann-Comhairle, that you have facilitated the debate this evening and that the Minister for Public Enterprise is present to reply.  She has an interest in the matter as she hails from an adjoining constituency to mine.  I hope I do not have to impress upon her the importance of the power generating station at Ferbane in County Offaly to my constituency and the midlands.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the importance of the twin public enterprises of Bord na Móna and the ESB for generations to the area.  A total of 155 full time workers are employed at the power station.  They are closely associated with 200 Bord na Móna workers and their families in the adjoining bogs, particularly at Boora in west Offaly and a number of seasonal workers whose families are dependent upon the efficient working of the power station to facilitate the generation of electricity. It is important in the context of Bord na Móna and the ESB which have represented the lifeblood of the midlands since the early part of the century.</P>
      <P>It was with great satisfaction, therefore, that almost 11 months ago it was announced by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dukes, and the ESB amid great fanfare in west Offaly that the sum of £11 million was being made available for the refurbishment of Ferbane which would allow for the revitalisation of unit 4 of the power station.  I regret progress on the matter since then has been less than the people of my constituency and the midlands would like.</P>
      <P>The station, up and running with the money spent, would allow for the harvesting of 300,000 tonnes of milled peat in the immediate area per year and would consequently ensure the existence of the station operating at full steam into the next century for a period of between 15 and 20 years.  There is widespread concern in the area at the lack of progress on the matter.  I accept the discussions, negotiations and the preparatory works are detailed and complex and that the ESB had to comply with EU regulations as far as procurement and tendering was concerned.  Progress has been unduly slow and we are now reaching a critical stage where the patience of workers and their families is rapidly running out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the delicate negotiations in the cost and competitiveness review by the ESB where much sacrifice was made by workers in the context of reaching an agreement on rationalisation.  It was my understanding that as soon as the agreement was <Col N="1211" /> reached, the necessary funds would be made available for the refurbishment works.</P>
    <P>Has there been an increase in the overall cost having regard to the time lapse?  I remind the Minister to look at the record of the ESB in recent times.  Only last week there was a fire at Ferbane's sister generating station in Rhode.  The plant, if not closed down completely, is working at far less than capacity and this has raised concern among the workforce and local people.  An indication of how these stations have been neglected over the years is that there has been very little in terms of investment since they were built in the 1940s and 1950s.</P>
    <P>I also remind her that in my constituency in Portarlington not only has the generating station been closed down, it was demolished and razed from the landscape last year by the ESB.  There needs to be an injection of funding and a significant investment in the locality to ensure the future viability of the ESB and its very good and long standing relationship with Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to use her good offices to ensure there are no more delays in the matter. Unemployment in Laois-Offaly is higher than the national average and the Celtic tiger is very much an endangered species in the midlands.  The community has for generations been almost exclusively reliant upon these companies.  It is unacceptable that £11 million was made available almost 13 months ago and that nothing has happened since to make that investment a reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  Ferbane power station was the first electricity generation station fuelled by milled peat to be built in Ireland.  It was commissioned in 1957 and, with the four other peat stations which were subsequently built, continues to have an important role to play in Ireland's indigenous energy policy.</P>
      <P>The station is critical to the economic life of the west Offaly region.  Of course, I am interested in it, apart from my current position, because it is near me and many of the workers in Ferbane live in my constituency.  Over the past 40 years it has been the source of valuable employment to the local community, not only in the station itself but also on the bogs at Boora which supply it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ESB workers in Ferbane and Bord na Móna workers in Boora are to be complimented on taking the initiative on the future of the station. There was a plentiful reserve of peat in the Boora group of bogs for many years to come, but they recognised that Ferbane station was rapidly nearing <Col N="1212" /> the end of its operational life unless early action was taken.</P>
    <P>They highlighted the need for action to ensure the continuation of electricity generation from peat in Ferbane.  Their constructive interest and foresight led directly to the feasibility study into the future of Ferbane and, in turn, to the decision now to proceed with the major refurbishment of unit 4.  Since the announcement of the refurbishment project 12 months ago, the ESB, late last year, completed the tendering process for the procurement of works and equipment, in accordance with EU requirements.  The Deputy referred to that matter.  The process into which the ESB had to enter is well known.</P>
    <P>Detailed discussions between officials of my Department and ESB personnel on the recovery by the company of the cost involved in the investment have recently been successfully completed. As part of the cost and competitiveness review, detailed arrangements were agreed between management and unions on staffing and work practices. I understand final discussions are now taking place between the ESB unions and management on implementation of the agreed cost and competitive review arrangements for Ferbane.  Those arrangements are pivotal to the future of the ESB.  It has assured me that, subject to the successful conclusion of the discussions with the unions, the refurbishment of Ferbane will get under way quickly and will be completed during 1999.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan asked if the price had increased.  While I should say it has not, extra money spent will be good for the area.  The refurbishment work will cost in excess of £15 million, a considerable amount of investment in that important station.  I intend to keep a watch on how matters develop there.  The tendering process for the procurement of works and equipment was in line with EU obligations and was completed only at the end of last year.  Advertisements had to be placed in various journals and people had to be invited to submit tenders.  The conclusion of the detailed negotiations formulated within the cost and competitive review will proceed.  I agree with the views of Deputies from the region.  Members of all parties are interested in the matter.</P>

    <P>I intend to keep a close watch on developments at the station.  The Deputy also referred to Rhode, which I hope to visit shortly.  The fire at <Col N="1213" /> that station last week is regrettable.  I have been assured that employment will not be affected and it will be soon back in business.  I merely refer to that because the matter was raised during the debate.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to reply to the debate.  I do not miss an opportunity to reply to an Adjournment matter.  They are one of the most important aspects of democracy.

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me an opportunity to raise this very important matter concerning the sewerage systems in Schull and Baltimore in south-west Cork.</P>
      <P>Schull is a progressive seaside resort that relies mainly on tourism and fishing.  Several holiday complexes have been built in the area in recent years.  The current sewerage system is outdated and not capable of catering for the huge influx of visitors to the town and its hinterland each year. Furthermore, the condition of the sewerage system does not comply with EU standards.  The farming community, shopkeepers and all other businesses are told they must adapt to EU standards, but the Minister for the Environment and Local Government appears to be immune from those standards when it comes to allocating money to bring sewerage systems up to EU standards.</P>
      <P>Baltimore, which is also an important tourist resort and fishing harbour, has an old and outdated sewerage system.  As a Cork man, the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, is well known in Baltimore and Schull.  He often goes there on holiday.  I hope he is the harbinger of good news tonight.</P>
      <P>Cork County Council and local development committees cannot understand why the Minister and his Department have ignored the request for approval from Cork County Council to employ consulting engineers to design a suitable sewerage scheme for both areas.  The original request in each case was made by the council on 3 April 1991.  Seven years later we do not have approval from the Department.</P>
      <P>We are told tourism will be our greatest industry when we enter the new millennium.  Let us create the infrastructure to cater for that upsurge in tourism.  The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, referred in a jocose manner to the Celtic tiger.  It should be called the &ldquo;Celtic leopard&rdquo; because the prosperity hits in spots, in Limerick, Dublin and Galway. I suppose we must excuse the Government for wanting to pump money into Limerick and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister of State agree that a seven year waiting period for approval to employ consulting engineers to design two suitable sewerage schemes is acceptable for two internationally <Col N="1214" /> renowned tourism centres?  We certainly need our share of the cake in south west Cork.  According to the Constitution all citizens should be cherished equally but apparently there are favourites in certain areas.  What is the reason for the Minister's delay in issuing approval to Cork County Council to start the ball rolling in those two schemes?</P>
    <P>I was informed recently by the Minister that given the high level of commitment under the water and sewerage investment programme he could not say when they would be approved.  That is why I am raising the matter on the Adjournment. I do not understand why it takes seven years for the Minister to make up his mind.  The time has come when justice must prevail.  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government and as a fellow Cork man to give favourable consideration to my request on behalf of two of the most important tourist resorts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sheehan for raising this matter.  I take this opportunity to say a few general words about the 1998 water and sewerage investment programme, details of which were published on 2 February, before turning to the specific point he raised about approving the appointment of consultants for the Schull and Baltimore sewerage schemes in County Cork.</P>
      <P>This year's water and sewerage services capital works programme is the largest in the history of the State.  Under the programme, State and EU investment in water and sewerage services will amount to almost £185 million this year and represents an increase of some 13 per cent on expenditure in 1997 which amounted to over £160 million.</P>
      <P>The investment programme for 1998 will permit some 61 major public schemes, the total cost of which amount to some £470 million, at various locations all around the country to start construction this year.</P>
      <P>There are many competing demands on the resources available for sewerage and water services both within the county of Cork and the country generally.  Cork is a large county with substantial water and sewerage requirements to meet the needs of industry and tourism especially. In recognition of these requirements, the 1998 water and sewerage services investment programme includes schemes in County Cork with an overall value of over £84 million.  This investment will secure the development of water and sanitary services in many parts of the county.</P>
      <P>In this context I was pleased to include the water supply schemes for Fermoy, Blarney and Cobh among those schemes to go to construction. The urgently needed Midleton sewerage scheme will go to construction this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Design briefs for the Schull and Baltimore schemes are with the Department.  In common with many other worthwhile proposals, both in <Col N="1215" /> County Cork and throughout the country, it has not been possible to provide financing up to now due to the pressure of other priority schemes within the water and sewerage services investment programme.  The position as regards these two schemes will be kept under review when considering priorities for 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing Deputy Ferris and me to raise this matter.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Ferris who has taken a keen interest in the matter of abattoirs throughout the country.  There are a large number of abattoir owners who slaughter up to 1,000 cattle units per annum, in premises which have been adopted and licensed for use as abattoirs under the Abattoirs Act, 1988, and the abattoirs regulations, 1989, and extended by the Fresh Meat Directive 64/433/EEC as amended by Council Directive 91/492/EEC.</P>
      <P>These abattoirs are small units providing for a small throughput and the majority are used simply to provide supply to the abattoir owners and butchers' shops in the immediate locality.  For the most part these abattoirs are located in rural areas, and facilitate local farmers, especially heifer producers &mdash; and helped to maintain the price recently when under threat &mdash; as the abattoir owners buy produce from local farmers and sell it to the local population.</P>
      <P>These regulations imposed a huge financial burden on these small abattoirs, to keep their premises up to the designated standard.  Failure to do so led to closure of many as, due to financial constraints, they were unable to bring their premises up to the required standard.</P>
      <P>The owners were allowed up to a maximum of five years within which to bring their premises up to the licensing standard.  The 1984 regulations applied the same standards to the larger factories as to the small abattoir owner without any derogation or exception.  There was no financial assistance, grant or tax incentive to help the owners bring the premises up to standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1991, the EC introduced Directive 91/497/EEC setting out the hygiene and structural standards which must be adhered to by all abattoir owners involved in the production of fresh meat.  In this case, the legislation provided for a derogation for small abattoir owners, for example, an exemption was provided to smaller abattoir owners whose throughput capacity did not exceed 1,000 cattle units per annum.  These throughput figures were advised to the Department of Agriculture and Food by the abattoir owners.  The abattoir owners brought their premises up to the standard required to comply with the 1988 regulations, and spent about £17.5 million pounds without grants or any other financial assistance.  The meat markets suffered serious losses due to BSE from 1995 to 1997.  This involved enormous financial pressure for all <Col N="1216" /> sections of the beef industry, not least the section dealing with abattoirs and butchers.</P>
    <P>The bombshell arrived when, in a letter dated 20 June 1997 from the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Irish Butchers' Association was informed that the Department had decided, following a review by a team of EU veterinary inspectors, that the 1989 regulations did not fulfill the requirements of Directive 91/497 in all respects and that there are a number of matters which are now required in each small abattoir to bring them up to the standard required.</P>
    <P>This was contrary to the expressed representation given by the Department in December 1991, that the 1991 EEC Directive corresponded and equated with the 1989 regulations.  This means that in addition to the expenditure of £17.5 million already incurred by the abattoirs in upgrading their premises they will now have to spend a further £20 million by virtue of the fact that the works already done will have to be undone or further upgraded.  Many of the premises have been upgraded in a specific fashion and are virtually incapable of being structurally adapted to the new regime or requirements.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister help the abattoirs to deal with the problem which is not of their making and promptly consider either one or all of the following: direct financial assistance, grant aid and tax incentives?  Further, a reasonable period should be allowed for the abattoirs to carry out the necessary work as set out in the Department's letter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not give us joy to raise this matter but it is essential that public confidence is restored in politicians, particularly those who make promises before, during and after elections. Replies by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to questions from Deputy Sheehan, others and myself, have indicated it is not possible to provide aid from the resources available to the Department.</P>
      <P>Prior to the election, I had a letter from him, re package of support for domestic abattoirs as follows:</P>
      <P>Dear Colleague,</P>
      <P>You will have received a copy of the Fianna Fáil document, Food, blueprint for optimal development, which was launched yesterday.  I would like to point out that Fianna Fáil, on assuming office will introduce a package of measures to assist local abattoirs to upgrade their premises to meet the demanding standards under the Abattoirs Act and EU regulations. Perhaps you would like to bring this provision to the attention of any family butchers in your constituency.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P>Joe Walsh, TD,</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil Spokesman on Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also published a manifesto during the election stating he would grant-aid small <Col N="1217" /> domestic abattoirs if he was elected.  Commissioner Fischler has said in writing that an exception is made under the criteria which is fairly restrictive for abattoirs.  This exemption is made for investments provided they do not lead to an increase in slaughtering capacity.  We are talking about small abattoirs, small family butchers, for whom we have set high standards through local authorities which we have helped to fund for carrying out inspections of the regulations.  All small butchers are now faced with the cost of upgrading further their premises in line with the new regulations.  These people are not unreasonable but they have been let down by the Government. Promises were given in writing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It made no such promises.  A sum of £1 million has been provided in the Estimates for abattoirs but butchers will not receive any of this.  They will threaten us outside the House on Ash Wednesday because the Government has broken its promises.  Because they are not increasing throughput and are producing meat of the standard required by the Minister and the European Union for human consumption the Minister should consider introducing a capitation grant of, say, £10,000 per abattoir.  This would satisfy them.  There is a need to avoid rationalisation to the point where there would be only three or four big municipal abattoirs which would not meet the demands of butchers in small towns and villages.  The Minister is a man of his word and I know he will live up to the promises given in writing before the election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House for my late arrival.  I welcome the debate on this issue.  The Abattoirs Act, 1988, was introduced to address public health concerns regarding meat produced in domestic abattoirs. Its aim was to ensure that meat produced in these abattoirs met the same standards of fitness for human consumption as that produced in the larger meat plants which were subject to EU rules.  When the Act was introduced representations were made for grant aid to assist abattoir owners in bringing their establishments up to the required standards.  These were rejected because the national policy was not to grant aid slaughtering facilities because of the excess slaughtering capacity.  The view was that any grant aid should be directed towards export oriented and added value products.  However, to alleviate financial hardship, a period of five years was allowed to <Col N="1218" /> upgrade small abattoirs.  The Department adopted a lenient approach in this matter and a longer period was allowed in many cases.</P>
      <P>With the advent of the Single Market, EU rules for meat production were extended to all meat producing establishments, including domestic abattoirs, under Council Directive 64/433/EEC as amended by Council Directive 91/497/EEC and later by Council Directive 95/23/EEC.  Following the visit of an EU inspection team in 1994, it became clear that regulations adopted in 1989 under the Abattoirs Act did not comply with EU requirements in relation to the structure and operation of small abattoirs in all respects.  In accordance with our obligations under the Treaty, draft regulations were drawn up and these were circulated to interested parties last November. The Irish Butchers' Association, which is the representative body of small abattoirs, met the Minister, Deputy Walsh, on 12 November to present its case.  At the request of the Minister, officials of the Department met representatives of small abattoirs on 18 November to discuss the regulations. Detailed clarification was provided at that meeting about the standards required and the procedural arrangements which would be put in place to meet the concerns of small abattoirs. Provided hygiene standards can be guaranteed, these procedures will help to ensure small abattoir owners will not have to make substantial additional investments to comply with EU requirements.  The regulations came into operation this week.</P>
      <P>The small abattoirs sector is facing stiff challenges. The BSE crisis in March 1996 led to widespread public health concerns resulting in ever increasing demands and regulatory requirements for the highest possible food safety standards. The decision of the Government to establish a new Food Safety Authority is a recognition of this fact.  Small abattoirs, with other sectors of the industry, will have to adapt to meet the new situation. This sector is also coming under pressure from the big multiples which are able to sell meat at prices with which small butchers would find it difficult to compete.  However, small abattoirs have significant advantages in that they source their product locally thus guaranteeing the traceability and quality of their meat.  This sector must develop a strategy for the future which takes into account the need to adhere to the highest possible standards of food safety while promoting the considerable strengths of its product.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The Government at its meeting on 21 January 1998 appointed Deputy Frank Fahey, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, with special responsibility for children, to be also Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and at the Department of Education and Science.  The allocation of responsibilities between Departments is not being amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State will co-ordinate the activities of all these Departments in the child care area.  He will be supported in this task by a cross-departmental team of officials, who will report to him directly.  I believe these arrangements will expedite implementation of the <Col N="1220" /> Government's initiatives to address issues in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the report discussed with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, at her meeting with the UN Committee at Geneva was submitted in April 1996.  It was Ireland's first report under the UN Rights of the Child Convention, ratified in September 1992.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that co-ordination of child policy is a key element in safeguarding children's rights in our society.  I am satified that the new arrangements will ensure the efficient and effective delivery of services in the child care area.</P>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, or 24 in the case of a retirement pension, registered <Col N="1221" /> since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.  The yearly average condition was reduced to ten contributions for the new <i>pro-rata</i> old age (contributory) pension which came into force with effect from 21 November last.  To qualify, a person with a yearly average of between ten and 19 must have 260 rather than 156 paid contributions.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable &mdash; national health insurance, widow's and ophan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions.  These gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
      <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of this pension.  However, as a concession and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of satisfying the yearly average test.  However, contributions paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age contributory pension purposes in satisfying the first two conditions, set out in the first paragraph above, but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that men and women are treated equally in relation to access to all social welfare schemes and services. Considerable progress has been made in recent years in implementing the principle of equal treatment in the social welfare code with the result that all of the social assistance and insurance schemes operated by my Department are available equally to men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All initiatives undertaken by my Department are gender-proofed as a matter of course in line with my Department's high level goal, as provided for in the strategic management initiative, of providing services in an efficient, effective, non-discriminatory and caring manner which are responsive to the needs of all our customers.  In doing this, account is taken of gender research that is generally available such as the recommendations of the Second Commission on the <Col N="1222" /> Status of Women.  My Department is represented on the Gender Equality Monitoring Committee established to oversee implementation of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the Beijing Platform for Action.</P>
    <P>The national anti-poverty strategy was launched in April 1997 with the main objective of tackling poverty and social exclusion.  Several principles underlying this strategy are implicitly related to equality of access and addressing discrimination. These include ensuring equal access and encouraging participation by all and the reduction of inequalities and, in particular, addressing the gender dimensions of poverty.</P>

      <P>Family income supplement, FIS has, since its introduction in 1984, been confined to employees on low incomes with families and is designed to provide them with an incentive to take up or remain in full-time employment.</P>
      <P>Self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  The rate of unemployment assistance payable depends on the person's means.  In assessing means, account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the extension of FIS to self-employed people with children could cost in the region of £30 million in a full year.  This cost assumes a 100 per cent take-up and is in addition to the existing expenditure involved in providing unemployment assistance to self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances.  In view of the significant additional costs involved, the question of extending FIS to self-employed people would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context and in the light of other priorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with a commitment given in Partnership 2000 and in the context of reducing disincentives to work, FIS is being reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, as has been the case.  This measure will come into effect in October 1998.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid October to mid April.</P>
      <P>In order to be eligible for assistance under the national fuel scheme the income of a contributory pensioner and his household must be below a certain limit, currently £15 per week in excess of the maximum contributory pension rate.  This means that a person may have a combined household income of up to £15 per week over the appropriate Irish maximum pension rate, or savings of £8,000, and still qualify for the fuel allowance. Changes in the national fuel scheme should not be viewed in isolation from the primary schemes. Substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £5 per week were announced by me in the December budget and will be paid from June 1998.</P>
      <P>Any changes in relation to the national fuel scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 38 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the situation of those former community employment workers who revert to the live register, and who, by virtue of having paid class A PRSI contributions, may qualify or re-qualify for unemployment assistance.  I have explained the position to the House in replies to questions on several occasions in the past few months.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the situation arises as a direct consequence of the extension of class A PRSI to community employment (CE) workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996. The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them. However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.  The social welfare secondary benefits, including butter vouchers and the free fuel allowance, are payable only with the long-term social welfare payments.  Similarly, the continued payment of child dependant allowances in respect of children aged over 18 and in full-time education applies only to recipients of long-term payments.  Unemployment benefit claimants do not therefore have an entitlement to these benefits and payments.</P>
      <P>Secondary benefits can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a community employment scheme to a back-to-work allowance scheme or Jobstart, etc.  It is important to note also that as regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former community employment workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment would continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I recognise that community employment workers who re-qualify for unemployment benefit when their period of community employment finishes can face difficulties as a consequence of no longer having entitlement to certain secondary benefits, I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for such people without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment <Col N="1225" /> recipients.  Any such concessions would, accordingly, carry an extremely high cost and could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern) Dermot Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is acknowledged that women, in both urban and rural areas, can experience particular problems arising from poverty and marginalisation and that women's groups and community groups have an important role in tackling these problems.  Particular emphasis is placed in the various grant schemes operated by my Department on support for community-based initiatives targeted at disadvantaged women. Schemes of particular relevance in this regard are the community development programme; the family and community services resource centre programme; and the scheme or grants for locally-based community and family support groups The community development programme was established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling poverty and disadvantage.  The programme provides financial assistance to projects towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in the area and to other specialised community development projects and initiatives having a strategic importance.  The projects provide a range of supports, development opportunities and services to community groups and individuals within their areas.  However, work with women and participation by women are high priorities across most projects in the programme.</P>
      <P>At present there are some 90 projects participating in the programme or in the process of being set up.  An additional £1.233 million over the 1997 Estimate has been provided in 1998 for the continued expansion of the CDP.</P>
      <P>In 1994, to mark the International Year of the Family, an allocation of £250,000 was made available by the Department to fund a number of family resource centres.  The decision was motivated by the perception of a possible gap in statutory support for community development activities focused on support for families and tackling child poverty.  Ten centres were funded on a three year pilot basis and all centres were characterised by a focus on work with women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An evaluation of the work of these centres was published in 1997.  The key recommendation of the report was that funding of these centres should be mainstreamed by this Department as a family and community services resource centre programme.  In addition, the Commission on the Family, in its submission on the 1998 budget, considered <Col N="1226" /> that these centres have significant potential as a primary preventative strategy and endorsed the recommendation for significant expansion of the Department's funding programme to support a network of centres throughout the State.</P>
    <P>Recognising the important role played by these centres in supporting families this programme is being expanded in 1998 and an additional £700,000 was provided in the 1998 budget to this end.</P>
    <P>The total provision in 1998 for both these programmes is £7.76 million.</P>
    <P>My Department has for many years provided assistance to voluntary and community groups through a range of once-off grant schemes: scheme of grants to voluntary organisations; scheme of grants to locally-based women's groups; scheme of grants to locally-based men's groups; scheme of grants to lone parent groups and community development education and training grants scheme.</P>
    <P>As many of these groups provide supports for the family my Department has, in 1998, introduced a new integrated scheme of grants to community and family support groups, integrating the former schemes of grants to locally-based women's groups, locally-based men's groups and lone parent groups.</P>
    <P>This scheme will provide grants to locally-based community and family support groups involved in programmes of self-help and personal development designed to tackle poverty and disadvantage and improve family life.  This scheme will continue the existing supports for women's, men's and lone parents groups, while also giving the Department the flexibility to respond to the needs of local community development groups that comprise both men and women, family support groups that focus on helping individuals and communities in the family context.</P>
    <P>In addition to the main schemes, a total of 27 more established women's groups and networks are in receipt of three year core-funding in the range £8,000 to £35,000 under this scheme.  A total of £354,000 is committed to these groups in 1998, which represents an increase of £41,000 on 1997.  This funding category will continue to be expanded in 1998.</P>
    <P>The total budget for the scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups and other once-off grants schemes operated by the Department is £2.825 million in 1998. Another initiative being undertaken by my Department and targeted directly at women relates to access by women to labour market opportunities and supports including mainstream vocational education, training and employment programmes.  A working group under the chairmanship of my Department and representative of all the four pillars represented at Partnership 2000 is currently reviewing the underlying issues in this area with a view to increasing gender equity in access to such programmes and improving <Col N="1227" /> job opportunities.  I expect to receive the group's report by the summer.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the increase announced in the recent budget in the minimum weekly rate of maternity benefit to £83.70 which is payable to women for up to 14 weeks.  This new rate will be paid the first week in June 1998.  The estimated cost of the increase in 1998 will be £90,000 in a full year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for payment under the various benefit, pension and allowance schemes administered by my Department, applicants must satisfy a number of statutory conditions which include the need to claim in time.  Where a claim is not made within the prescribed time, the person is disqualified for receipt of payment in the case of contributory widow's, widowers, retirement or old age pensions in respect of any period more than 12 months before the date on which the claim is made.  Prior to 1 January 1997, the disqualification applied in respect of any period more than six months before the date of claim.  Section 32 of the Social Welfare Act, 1997 provided for 12 months backdating in respect of claims made after that date.  This section also provides power to make regulations, which will extend the periods for which claims may be backdated in certain circumstances.  These regulations are intended, <i>inter-alia</i>, to meet the Ombudsman's concerns that the substantive principle of proportionality should be brought to bear in the treatment of arrears cases.  The regulations will also put on a statutory basis, the existing extra-statutory arrangements, which enabled payment of arrears for more than the relevant statutory periods of six or 12 months to be made in certain exceptional circumstances.  The regulations have now been finalised and they will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas in accordance with the relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>All claims which are affected by the provisions of the regulations will be reviewed as soon as practicable and the persons concerned will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputies refer to the position of self-employed people who were over age 56 on the extension of social insurance to the self-employed in April 1988.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the old age (contributory) pension, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age. This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age (contributory) pension. They may be covered for widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions subject, of course, to satisfying the normal qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>However, self employed people in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for the old age (contributory) pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
      <P>Refunds of the old age (contributory) pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either an old age (contributory) or non-contributory pension.  In the 1997 Social Welfare Act provision was made for self employed contributors, who entered insurance in 1988, but were already over the age of 56 at that time, and, who had previously paid social insurance contributions as an employee, to receive a refund of the pensions element of their self-employed social insurance, provided that they do not qualify for an old age (contributory) or non-contributory pension.  Heretofore, their earlier contributions precluded them from receiving such a refund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 21 November last new <i>pro-rata</i> pensions were introduced so that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age (contributory) pension.  A yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions <Col N="1230" /> gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 gives a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  To qualify a person also needs to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions.  This measure will be of benefit to many self-employed contributors.</P>
    <P>Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years contributions or becoming voluntary contributors after age 66 in order to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension would be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor of buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>I will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible.  I have asked my Department to examine the general issue relating to the self-employed group aged over 56 in April 1988.  As any proposals would have a major cost implication they would fall to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>Any person resident in the State can, of course, qualify for an old age (non-contributory) pension which is payable subject to a means test.</P>

      <P>My Department has a network of offices throughout the country, 57 of which are local offices staffed by Department staff and 71 of which are branch offices operated on a contract basis by independent operators on contract with the Department.

    <P>Since the end of the 1980s my Department has been engaged in a programme of fundamental change in the way it delivers its services to the public.  As a result of this programme of change the departmentally staffed local offices now provide a wider range of services to customers including more modern systems of payment.  It is my intention that the improved level of service currently being availed of by customers of departmentally staffed local offices will also be made available to customers of branch offices.  Officials from my Department are currently in discussion with the Branch Managers' Association, in relation to the future role of the branch office network and with a view to upgrading and modernising the level of service which those offices provide.  The contractual arrangements under <Col N="1231" /> which branch managers currently operate will be revised in the context of these discussions.</P>

      <P>The means tests used in determining entitlement to all social assistance payments include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments which the applicant may have.  As there are over 470,000 people in receipt of social assistance payments it would not be feasible to assess means from capital on the basis of actual returns from investments as this would necessitate frequent reviews of the entitlements of a very significant number of recipients whenever interest rates fluctuated.  For this reason a notional value is ascribed to the capital owned.</P>
      <P>Recently the process of standardising the assessment of capital across the different social assistance schemes has been initiated, so as to improve the equity of the system.  Under the new assessment provisions, the first £2,000 of capital is disregarded, the next £20,000 is assessed at 7.5 per cent of the capital value and the balance is assessed at 15 per cent.  The Social Welfare Act, 1997 provided for a further extension of the revised capital assessment provisions to the old age (non-contributory) pension, widow's and widower's (non-contributory) pension, orphan's (non-contributory) pension, carer's allowance and pre-retirement allowance schemes, with effect from 17 October 1997.</P>
      <P>The revised capital assessment provisions are of benefit to the majority of social assistance recipients who have capital.  For example, a single old age pensioner can now have capital of up to £6,160 and still qualify for the maximum rate of old age (non-contributory) pension &mdash; an increase of £3,173 on the previous arrangements.  A married couple can have capital of up to £12,320 and still qualify for the maximum pension &mdash; an increase of £6,345.  A single pensioner can have up to £37,150 from June 1998 and still qualify for the minimum rate of pension, while a married couple can have up to £74,300 before losing entitlement to the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the effective assessment rates of capital have been lowered for most recipients with capital.  For example, under the former arrangements the effective assessment rate for all levels of capital for old age (non-contributory) pension purposes were approximately 10 per cent in the case of a single people and 5 per cent for a married couple.  Under the new procedures, <Col N="1232" /> capital of up to £20,000 is now assessed progressively up to a rate of 6.75 per cent in the case of a single pensioner and up to a rate of 3 per cent in the case of a married pensioner couple.  As only about 2 per cent of single old age pensioners and 4 per cent of married pensioners have capital in excess of £20,000, the new arrangements have improved the income position of the vast majority of old age pensioners.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Commission on the Family will finalise its report over the coming weeks.  I intend to submit it to Government with a view to publication as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the commission that the report contains a comprehensive analysis of issues affecting families.  The recommendations will provide the basis for the development of an integrated &ldquo;family policy&rdquo; to strengthen and assist families in coping with change and to put in place the supports to prevent family breakdown. In addition, the commission has undertaken some original and significant research work which will be of benefit to analysts and policy makers, including a national survey of the child care arrangements which families make, sociological research on fathers and their role in family life and an overview of family policy in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission brought forward some aspects of the final report for consideration in the context of preparations for the 1998 budget.  In response to the commission's recommendations, the Government has provided significant allocations for the development of family services in my Department in 1998 including £700,000 for the phased introduction of a network of Family and Community Services Resource Centres (25 centres in 1998); an extra £600,000 for marriage counselling services bringing the total provision in 1998 to £1.5 million; an extra £600,000 for the Family Mediation Service for the establishment of additional centres towards the development of a national service, bringing the total provision to £900,000; and £850,000 for a new family affairs unit in my Department to co-ordinate family policy, pursue the findings in the commission's final report, undertake research and promote awareness about family issues.  In addition the new unit will have responsibility for a number of family services including support for the marriage and child counselling services, the Family Mediation <Col N="1233" /> Service, provision of improved support at local level to families and a new information programme on parenting issues.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the commission's final report in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In May 1997 the Statistical Office of the EU, Eurostat, issued a paper based on data drawn from the European Community Household Panel which found that in 1993, 28 per cent of children in Ireland lived in poor households, the second highest proportion in the European Union.</P>
      <P>While the higher risk of poverty for households with children is a continuation of a trend apparent since 1973, the findings of the Eurostat study quite rightly gave cause for concern.  However, since the survey took place there has been an ongoing policy response by successive Governments to this serious social policy issue.  This response has been twofold.  First, in the area of income support measures, such as child benefit and family income supplement and secondly, in the introduction of measures aimed at removing disincentives to taking up employment.</P>
      <P>In the four year period since the survey was carried out, the economy enjoyed a period of very stronggrowth.  Employment  growth  was especially strong with non-agricultural employment, excluding schemes, increasing by 126,000 between 1993 and 1996.  Unemployment fell from 15.3 per cent in December 1993 to 9.8 per cent in December 1997.  This is particularly important since over half of all poor children were living in households headed by an unemployed person.</P>
      <P>There is widespread agreement that child income support policy should focus on improving child benefit and this is the approach which I followed in last December's budget.  The child benefit increases in the recent budget represent, in part, a targeting of resources at larger families who are more at risk of experiencing poverty.  A further initiative which impacts on children was the amendment of the family income supplement scheme; income limits were increased and eligibility for the supplement is now based on net income.  The budget also provided for the establishment of a new family affairs unit in my Department to co-ordinate family policy and the development of family service in my Department.</P>
      <P>Child poverty is perhaps the greatest single justification for a national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS.  Educational disadvantage, central to the perpetuation of poverty within families and communities, and unemployment are two of the key areas identified in the NAPS for particular attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of these policies, combined with the improved economic situation in the four year period since the survey took place, should impact positively on the level of child poverty. <Col N="1235" /></P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners operate a system whereby contractors and workers are informed by way of general guidelines of the difference between a contract of service i.e. employment and a contract for service i.e. self-employment.  If both sides complete a declaration after reading these guidelines that they are satisfied their contractual relationship is a contract for service, the principal contractor deducts an amount of tax at source.  This is known as the C45 system.  The Income Tax (Relevant Contracts) Regulations, 1996, were specifically introduced to ensure that the C45 system is applied only in genuine sub-contract cases.</P>
      <P>The fact that an agreement is made between a contractor and a sub-contractor to operate the C45 system does not in itself mean that a contract for service situation applies.  It is a matter for deciding officers in my Department and, if necessary, the social welfare appeals office to decide whether a contract for service exists or whether an individual is in fact employed under a contract of service and hence fully insurable under the social insurance system.</P>
      <P>My Department is aware from discussions and correspondence with interests in the construction industry of their concern that, in some cases, workers insurably employed under contract of service are required to revert to self employment type arrangements to secure or remain in employment.</P>
      <P>My Department is in discussions with the Revenue Commissioners with a view to taking additional measures to ensure that contractors and sub-contractors in the construction industry fully comply with their legal obligations and to enhance the control of fraud and abuse in this sector.  The particular issue referred to in the question is also being raised with the employers and unions in the sector as part of the ongoing discussions with them on issues of mutual concern to see what further specific measures may require to be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years. Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday. This applies to long-term payments (such as pensions) only; it does not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.  The favourable treatment of people on long-term payments is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the thrust of child income support policy in recent years has been to target resources towards providing increases in child benefit, as part of a strategy aimed at ensuring that child income support is more neutral <i>vis-a-vis</i> the employment status of the parents.  Child benefit remains one of our more effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes.</P>
      <P>In the 1998 budget this policy direction has been continued through further enhancement of the child benefit scheme.  Child benefit will be increased by £1.50 per child per month for the first two children and by £3.00 per child for the third and subsequent children, thus bringing the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.00. In addition to special supplementary payment in respect of twins will be introduced.  These measures will take effect from next September.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the findings of the most recent household budget survey released by the Central Statistics Office, which revealed growing disparities between the wealthiest and the poorest in our society, and between urban and rural households.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Deputy is <Col N="1237" /> referring to Volume 2 of the Household Budget Survey for 1994/95 which was published in November 1997 by the Central Statistics Office.  The previous household budget survey took place in 1987.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the primary purpose of the surveys is to determine in detail the current pattern of household expenditure for the purposes of updating the weighting basis of the consumer price index.  However, additional information is also gathered, including household income details.</P>
      <P>In relation to the disparity between the wealthiest and the poorest households, the survey shows that the average disposable income per head of the highest income households was three times that of the lowest income households, as opposed to 2.9 times in 1987.  I should add that the household budget survey indicates that comparisons between the income levels of different groups of households could be quite misleading and should be avoided particularly where income sources differ appreciably &mdash; this is especially relevant when comparing urban and rural households.</P>
      <P>The Government is aware of the extent of marginalisation in society.  An Action Programme for the Millennium recognises the need to establish a more inclusive society.  In relation to rural development, a key priority is to proof all policies to ensure that they do not discriminate against rural areas.</P>
      <P>The 1998 budget addressed many of the issues affecting social inclusion.  In relation to areas covered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs progress was made on a number of fronts.  There was a real increase in welfare rates, especially for the elderly.  Family income supplement will, later this year, be calculated on a net basis and the income threshold was increased by £7, (the average weekly payment will increase by £11).  In addition provision was made for an extra 5,000 places on the back to work allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>In other areas of public policy the social inclusion agenda has been addressed by, for instance, the provision of an additional £2 million for adult literacy, an additional £3 million for people with physical or sensory disabilities and the special tax allowance for the long-term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, there is a recognition that poverty in a developed country like Ireland is not just an income issue but involves isolation, lack of access to services and exclusion from the normal activities of society.  This understanding of poverty is reflected in the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, which aims to reduce by half the numbers identified as consistently poor in the 1994 Living in Ireland survey by the year 2007. Recognising the spatial aspects of poverty, the NAPS identifies &ldquo;rural poverty&rdquo; and &ldquo;disadvantaged urban areas&rdquo; as two of its five key themes. <Col N="1238" /></P>

      <P>The additional cost of increasing the fuel allowance to £8 per week for those not already in receipt of that rate is estimated at £22 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A fuel allowance of £5 per week is paid to qualified householders for 26 weeks from October to April each year.</P>
      <P>An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week was introduced in October 1990 to assist people living in the built up areas of Dublin to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas. This was later extended to Cork city and adjacent areas to coincide with the ban on the sale of bituminous coal which came into effect there on 13 February 1995.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to make the additional £3 per week allowance available to people who live outside designated smoke free zones.  However, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is currently considering proposals to give effect to the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to extend the ban on bituminous coal to major urban areas.  The geographic areas covered by the smokeless fuel allowance will be reviewed in that context.</P>

      <P>Unemployment assistance is a means-tested payment paid to unemployed people between the ages of 18 and 66 not entitled to insurance-based unemployment benefit.  Payments are means-tested to ensure that the limited resources available are directed at those most in need.  In assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have together with the value of any capital or property.  In addition, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant, such as that of free board and lodging in the family home, is assessed.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes alleged that the benefit and privilege rule for young unemployed people, encourages them to leave the family home in order to qualify for higher unemployment assistance payments and rent supplements.  However, the limited evidence which is available does not suggest that this is happening to any significant degree.  I have mentioned the main findings of this research in recent replies on this topic.</P>
      <P>While the available evidence does not support the notion that the benefit and privilege rule is a highly significant factor in the movement of young people out of the family home, my Department will, nevertheless, continue to review this provision in the light of any new evidence which becomes available.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the assessment of benefit and privilege as means would have significant cost implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to a widow's or widower's pension depends, in the first instance, on the status in law of the relationship between the parties prior to the death of one of them.  If the parties, at the date of death, were married within the meaning of the laws of this State, then the survivor of that marriage is a widow or widower for the purposes of the social welfare legislation relating to widow's and widower's pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare legislation contains provisions to ensure that a spouse will not be disadvantaged in <Col N="1240" /> terms of his or her social welfare entitlement as a result of their legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, it is assumed that the initial marriage was recognised in law as valid.</P>
    <P>In that event, the survivor of that marriage would be regarded as a widow for social welfare purposes, assuming that she has not herself remarried.  A legal separation or a church annulment does not affect the status of the survivor as a widow or widower for social welfare purposes, as the marriage has not in effect been legally disolved. If a marriage is legally dissolved by divorce, the survivor of that marriage continues to be regarded as a widow or widower for social welfare purposes, by virtue of the provisions in social welfare legislation already mentioned.</P>
    <P>If the second relationship was entered into without the legal dissolution of the first marriage by a recognised divorce, the second relationship would not constitute a legal marriage under the laws of the State.  The survivor of that relationship could not be regarded as a widow of the deceased.</P>
    <P>The difficulty inherent in the situation as outlined was one of the reasons for the enactment providing for the legal dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the importance to all concerned of ensuring that their marital situation is resolved from a legal as well as a Church perspective in circumstances such as those outlined by the Deputy.  If this is done both survivors would be entitled to a widow's pension under the special social welfare arrangements applicable in such circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for greater awareness of poverty and its causes and, indeed, for greater awareness of the existence and implications of the national anti-poverty strategy (NAPS) itself, is a priority for the implementation of the strategy.  My Department, and the Combat Poverty Agency have been working on drawing up an information and public education strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The promotion of the NAPS will take place using two complementary approaches.  On the one hand, the importance of creating a profile for the NAPS throughout the public sector, the social partners and the general public is a priority, showing how it can contribute to setting and influencing the agenda for anti-poverty work and to creating a greater appreciation of the issues <Col N="1241" /> involved in policy that favours the socially excluded.  On the other hand, increasing poverty awareness itself is crucial in creating a climate in which the NAPS can be implemented with the fullest support.  A more informed analysis and understanding of the causes, extent and experience of poverty is fundamental to support for the need for economic and social change in favour of the poor.</P>
    <P>A discussion paper on the information strategy has been drawn up by the Combat Poverty Agency and is currently being considered by the NAPS inter-departmental policy committee. When the strategy is ratified by the committee, its implementation will begin immediately.  There has, however, been much groundwork done already on the promotion of the national anti-poverty strategy.  A range of information initiatives have been undertaken in recent months, including the following: a NAPS seminar, for the Dublin and Mid-Eastern Regional Authorities, took place last month in Tallaght.  It is proposed to repeat this exercise elsewhere; preparation has been made for the publication of the NAPS document on the Internet.</P>
    <P>In relation to budgets, the Combat Poverty Agency has set aside £12,000 for the NAPS information strategy over the coming year, supplementing the budget within my Department for this purpose.  In so far as individual Departments are concerned, promotion of NAPS-related initiatives will be carried out under existing information and publicity budgets.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is particularly important to note that the information strategy will be subject to regular review and its impact will be evaluated as part of the overall NAPS evaluation.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest payments to any person in the State whose means are sufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is to assist eligible persons who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to a mortgage interest supplement is determined by the health boards and supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution <Col N="1242" /> which applicants are required to pay from their own resources.</P>
    <P>To qualify for mortgage interest supplement, the claimant must satisfy all the general conditions of entitlement to SWA as set out in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993; and the conditions of entitlement to a mortgage interest supplement as set out in the Regulations (S.I. 382, 1995).</P>
    <P>Those generally excluded from receiving assistance under the SWA scheme include people in full-time employment, people in full-time education, and people involved in trade disputes.</P>
    <P>The scheme operates on the basis that the person shall be entitled to a supplement towards the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only, provided that: the loan agreement was entered into at a time when, in the opinion of the health board, the claimant was in a position to meet the repayments thereunder, and the residence in respect of which the loan is payable, is not offered for sale.</P>
    <P>In addition, the health board must be satisfied that: the amount of the mortgage interest payable by the claimant does not exceed such amount as the health board considers reasonable to meet his or her residential needs, and; it is reasonable to award a supplement having regard to the amount of any arrears outstanding on the loan.  [S.I. No. 382, 1995).</P>
    <P>For the purposes of the regulations, &ldquo;loan&rdquo; means any loan or advance by which interest is payable to a bank, building society, credit union or the Housing Finance Agency plc.  Banks, building societies, and credit unions are also defined under the regulations and come within the scope of one of the following: The Central Bank Act, 1971, or the Trustee Savings Banks Acts, 1863 to 1979; the Building Societies Acts 1876 to 1989 and the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1978 by virtue of the Credit Union Act, 1966.</P>

      <Col N="1243" /> Arrears of PRSI-PAYE amounting to £10.1 million were determined and appropriate follow-up action to recover these arrears is under way.  In addition to ensuring compliance with PRSI rules, checks are carried out by inspectors to ensure that employees are not concurrently working and claiming unemployment or illness payments.  As a result of these checks, 4,157 persons stopped claiming during 1997.  which resulted in savings amounting to £11.53 million.</P>

      <P>I understand that the prisoners concerned, who were sentenced in 1977, have declared their interest in a transfer to Ireland. However, a formal application from the United Kingdom authorities has yet to be received.  As the Deputy may be aware from recent media reports, the Home Secretary announced on 30 January last that he had decided to set whole life tariffs in the cases of the prisoners concerned. The tariff is the period to be served by the prisoner in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence.  The position as regards their transfer applications has been that it is the policy of the United Kingdom authorities not to transmit applications in respect of prisoners whose tariffs have not been set.  Now that their tariffs have been determined, I understand that the applications are being forwarded immediately <Col N="1244" /> by the UK authorities to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is this Government's policy that, whenever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families, and I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to process these applications as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>The Government is very concerned at the increased tension in the Gulf and Middle East regions resulting from the failure of Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The Government has taken the position at the UN, and in discussion with EU partners, that the completion of this task be pursued most urgently through diplomatic contacts and that military action be considered only as a very last resort. We support the positive efforts to achieve the peaceful resolution of the crisis.  We earnestly hope that the efforts in this regard, notably by the Foreign Ministers of France and Russia, will proved successful and we are continuing to make our support for this approach known.</P>
      <P>As part of the international effort to restore stability to the Gulf and Middle East regions after the Gulf War, the terms of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 699 of 1991 lay down that WMD held by the Iraqi forces are to be destroyed.  The practical implementation of this decision is the brief of a UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) currently headed by Ambassador Richard Butler, an Australian.</P>
      <P>Iraq provided full, final and complete disclosures on its prohibited biological and missile programmes in May 1992.  This was challenged and found to understate seriously the true amount of chemical, biological and nuclear material and delivery systems held.  Iraq subsequently provided full, final and complete disclosures on its WMD capacity on no less than four further occasions, all of them proving to be less than comprehensive.</P>
      <P>The maintenance of such weapons by the Iraqi forces poses a threat to the stability of the volatile Gulf and Middle East regions.  To put pressure on Iraq to comply with the Security Council Resolution, the UN imposed sanctions against Iraq. These have had significant detrimental effects on the economic and social situation of the Iraqi people, but not perceptibly on those in positions of power to circumvent these effects.</P>
      <P>To make better provision for an adequate supply of food and medicines, the Security Council adopted Resolution 986 in 1995 to allow for the exchange of oil for food and medicines.  Ireland has been very active with other UN members to expand the scope of this resolution.  The Secretary-General is preparing recommendations on how this might be achieved, which should result in the early implementation of an expanded humanitarian programme.</P>

      <P>The refurbishment of Ferbane station is of critical importance to the economic life of the Midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> The completion of the project will extend the life of the station for about 15 years.  It will provide continuing valuable employment for ESB and Bord na Móna staff.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of the refurbishment project 12 months ago, the ESB proceeded with the tendering process for the procurement of works and equipment, in accordance with EU legislative requirements and this has been completed.  Detailed discussions have taken place between officials from my Department and the ESB in relation to the recovery, by the company, of the costs involved in the investment and these have recently been finalised.</P>
    <P>As part of the cost and competitiveness review (CCR) detailed arrangements were agreed between management and unions in relation to staffing and work practices in power stations and final discussions are taking place on the details of the implementation of these for Ferbane Unit 4.</P>
    <P>I have been in contact with the ESB and have been assured that, subject to the successful conclusion of the discussions on the implementation of the agreed CCR staffing and work practices, the refurbishment of Ferbane will get under way quickly and will be completed during 1999.</P>

      <P>As a response to the BSE crisis, Council Regulation (EC) No. 1357/96 provided for payment of a supplement to each 1996 special beef premium received by a producer.  Payments were based on the number of animals paid 1995 special beef premium with provision for a subsequent adjustment, if necessary, to take account of the actual number of animals qualifying under the 1996 special beef premium scheme.</P>
      <P>The person named received a BSE compensation payment of £1,049.40 (i.e. 55 × £19.08) based on the number of animals paid 1995 special beef premium.  However, he did not apply for such premium in 1996 and this entire £1,049.40 had to be designated an overpayment as a result. A total of £721.08 of it was recovered by offset against his 1996 slaughter premium application (12 animals × £60.09) and the remainder by offset against other payments being made to him.  This explains why he received no 1996 slaugher premium payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1998 budgetary allocation for the Department of Social, Communty and Family Affairs provides for increases in social welfare payments and other improvements amounting to £225 million in a full year.  I propose to circulate a table showing the breakdown of these moneys.</P>
      <P>Of the £225 million, just over £180 million was allocated to increases in weekly social welfare payments.  Over £28 million was allocated to child benefit and £10 million to family income supplement. The total of these three items is £218 million; the remaining £7 million was allocated to other improvements to the social welfare code, including carers, free schemes, community and voluntary supports, and a substantial increase in funding for family services.</P>
      <P>In line with commitments made in An Action Programme for the Millennium and in the Partnership 2000 agreement, the Government placed particular emphasis on improving the weekly social welfare payment rates.  The maximum rate of all pensions for people over 66 was increased by £5 as a significant first step towards meeting the commitment to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 per week over the five year period of this Government.  Furthermore, a £3 increase was awarded to weekly personal rates of payment for people under 66.  This increase is substantially above the expected rate of inflation. When these rate increases come into effect in June 1998, all but two social welfare rates will have exceeded the target recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Carers benefited from these rate increases along with other groups.  As well as providing for the general £3 increase in the weekly rate of payment for the carer's allowance, and the extra £2 increase for those aged 66 and over, I have also made the following three improvements in the carer's allowance scheme: 1.  the introduction of a disregard of non-national disability pensions; 2. the introduction of six weeks payment after death to carers whose spouse was not in receipt of a social welfare payment; and the provision of a free travel pass to carers in receipt of carer's allowance.  All carers will benefit from this measure at an annual cost of £0.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the free schemes, the budget provides for the retention of entitlement to these by people, regardless of age, who transfer from invalidity pension, disability allowance or blind <Col N="1258" /> person's pension to any other social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>In addition, the free travel scheme will be extended to grant a companion free travel pass to all people who are permanently resident in the State and who satisfy the following conditions: are aged 75 years or over; and are medically certified as being unfit to travel alone.  This will allow the holder of the pass to have a person over age 16 accompany him or her free of charge when travelling.  This measure will come into effect in September 1998.  The main group who will benefit from this measure are single people aged over 75, who are unable to travel alone.  It is estimated that 17,000 people will benefit from this measure at an annual cost of £0.5 million.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a total of 2,691 persons failed to qualify for the full rate old age contributory pension due to an insufficiency of contributions during their working lives.  The majority of applicants were rejected on the basis of an insufficient yearly average number of contributions. However, 209 &mdash; 8 per cent &mdash; of these individuals may qualify for a reduced rate pension.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions registered since January 1953, when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>A new <i>pro rata</i> old age &mdash; contributory &mdash; pension was introduced with effect from 21 November 1997.  The yearly average condition was reduced to ten contributions.  A <i>pro rata</i> pension is payable depending on the yearly average number of contributions.  To qualify a person with a yearly average of between ten and 19 must have 260 rather than 156 paid contributions.</P>
      <P>While it is estimated that approximately 8,500 people will benefit immediately from the new provisions, some 1,300 persons will benefit every year thereafter.  These will include categories such as women who have spent long periods outside the paid workforce and who do not benefit from the 1994 homemaker's provisions; returned emigrants who entered the workforce here for a short spell before working abroad for a long period and who then returned to take up employment here; and people who entered social insurance at an early stage and then became self-employed for a long period before the extension of social insurance to the self-employed in 1988.</P>

      <P>From 21 November last new <i>pro rata</i> pensions were introduced so that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age &mdash; contributory &mdash; pension.  A yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 gives a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  To qualify a person also needs to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions.  This measure will be of benefit to many self-employed contributors and to those, mainly women, who took time-out of the paid workforce for family reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have no specific plans for the further extension of <i>pro rata</i> pensions, I will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension <Col N="1261" /> cover to as many categories as possible.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have asked my Department to examine the general issue relating to the self-employed group aged over 56 in April 1988 who do not currently qualify for an old age &mdash; contributory &mdash; pension.

      <P>I believe that greater integration of income support and related services and service delivery between different Government Departments and agencies is essential in the interests of making these services simplier, easier to understand, more accessible and better managed.</P>
      <P>The 1996 report on the development of an integrated social services system identified a number of main areas which need to be addressed in the context of delivering a more integrated system. These are: introduction of a unique public service identifier, for the customer, across the Departments and agencies involved; sharing of data within and between agencies; development of intergrated systems e.g information, payments etc.; development of one-stop shops; creation of a central means database; expansion of payment methods and development of deduction facilities; modernisation and computerisation of the general registers office; and greater use of social services cards across the public service, in particular, for security and payment automation.</P>
      <P>I am examining the question of appropriate legislation to allow for the introduction of the RSI number as a unique public service identifier, for the sharing of data between public service organisations and for the expanded use of social services cards.</P>
      <P>My Department has developed a central means database for storing and accessing details of means assessments which, subject to the necessary legislation and the technical infrastructure being in place, could be made available for use by other public service organisations.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the updating of legislation in relation to the registration of births, marriages and deaths has been assigned to my Department. This is a complex matter and I will bring forward proposals in this area as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social services cards are in use at present as a record of a person's RSI number, to support identity when claiming social welfare payments and in encashing-collecting payments.  In this regard computerisation and integration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme with <Col N="1262" /> other social welfare short-term schemes will be completed by the end of 1998.</P>

      <P>Regulations, which came into effect in October 1991, provide that where a pensioner, or a person of pension age in receipt of a means tested payment from the Department, sells his or her principal residence and either buys or rents alternative accommodation or moves into a private nursing home, the income derived from the sale shall be exempted from the means test in relation to the pension, or other relevant payment, up to a limit of £75,000.  Where the applicant has a spouse he-she must also be over 66.</P>
      <P>In relation to statistics published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the average price of second hand houses for which loans were approved has risen from £51,452 in 1992 to £67,438 in 1996.  This relates to the country as a whole and there may be substantial divergences between different areas.  As can be seen the £75,000 limit was above average in relation to average house prices as calculated by the Department of the Environment during that period.  I have no proposal to revise the limit but I will be keeping the matter under review.</P>

      <P>Having been employed on a full-time basis the person concerned voluntarily moved to part-time working which resulted in a reduction in wages.  She made a claim for unemployment benefit on 23 April 1997.  Following investigation her claim was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment.  This decision was upheld on appeal. An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> Each claim for an unemployment payment is decided on its own merits and the evidence available. I am not aware, however, of any other case where the circumstances giving rise to the loss of employment were similar to this case and where unemployment benefit is in payment.</P>

      <P>My Department seeks to keep up to date with the development of social policy in other countries and, in that context, has reviewed the welfare to work programme being implemented in the UK.  A central element of this programme is the new deal which is aimed at people aged between 18 and 24 and at the long-term unemployed.  It includes provision for intensive job counselling and advice and access to basic skills training, and where subsequently required, subsidised placements with employers, placements with the UK Government's Environment Taskforce and with voluntary organisations, and access to education and training.  The scale of this intervention can be seen by the projected cost of up to ST£3.5 billion, which is to be funded from the windfall levy on the privatised utilities.</P>
      <P>It is notable that many features of the new deal are already to be found in the Irish system.  The revamped back-to-education programme, the back to work allowance scheme and the PRSI exemption scheme, are examples of measures which have been designed to ease the transition from unemployment into employment.  Furthermore, schemes under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, such as community employment and jobstart are similar to some of the job placement aspects of the UK new deal.</P>
      <P>My Department will follow with interest the progress of the UK programme.  I should mention that Irish policy in this area in the near future will be guided in particular by the recently adopted EU guidelines on employment.  The aim of the guidelines is to ensure that economic recovery is accompanied by a sustained high level of job creation and a stable macroeconomic environment.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 339 of 2 December 1997 and to replies to previous Questions, No. 101 of 27 February 1997 and No. 31 of 13 May 1997.  An information note regarding compensation, which was sent by my Department to all those thought to own or use land in proposed SACs, is available from Dúchas, the heritage service, and I am forwarding a copy to the Deputy for his information.  In addition, the following has been offered recently as the standard level of compensation for turf cutting restrictions: purchase at £1,000 per acre or undifferentiated turbary right &mdash; this is considered reasonable given that my Department has wide experience of purchasing similar land for lower prices than this around the country; relocation where available as an alternative to outright purchase.  Once-off compensation of £100 per mile will be paid for additional travel.  It is considered that it will be possible to offer relocation to those affected in many, although not all areas.  Where a turbary right owner considers there are particular circumstances justifying a higher level of compensation, such cases will be looked at on a case-by-case basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 contains a number of provisions which deal with the problem of drinking in public places and abusive behaviour.  Section 4 of the Act makes if an offence for any person to be present in a public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he or she might be a danger either to himself or to herself or to any other person in the vicinity.  The penalty on conviction is a fine of up to £100.  Under section 5 of the Act it is an offence for a person to engage in disorderly conduct in a public place either between certain night-time hours or at any other time after having been requested by a garda to desist.  The penalty on conviction for this offence is £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person uses or engages in any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour in a public place with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or being reckless as to whether a breach of the peace may be occasioned, section 6 provides that he or she will be liable to a fine of up to £500 or to imprisonment for up to three months or to both.  Furthermore, section 8 of the Act empowers a garda to &ldquo;move on&rdquo; persons <Col N="1270" /> who are acting in a manner contrary to the provisions of sections 4, 5 or 6.  A person who is found guilty of failure to comply with such a direction may be liable to a fine of £500 or to imprisonment for up to six months or to both.  I believe that the penalties provided in the Act are sufficient and I have no plans at present to increase them.</P>

      <P>Lucan multi-denominational school opened, with temporary recognition, in September 1997.  The purpose of temporary recognition is to enable the school to demonstrate over a period of some years that it has a viable future. During that period, the onus is on the school management to provide temporary accommodation for the school.</P>
      <P>The granting of permanent recognition would be considered when the school has been in operation for a number of years.  In the absence of such recognition, the Rules for National Schools preclude the payment of capital grants towards the provision of school accommodation.  Accordingly, my Department is not in a position to pursue the acquisition of a site or the provision of a new school building at this stage.</P>
      <P>Criteria for the recognition of all categories of national schools, including multi-denominational schools, and related matters such as funding, were the subject of a review carried out by a technical working group of the Commission on School Accommodation Needs.  This report will be considered by the commission's steering group which will prepare its own set of recommendations.  Current policy in relation to the recognition of national schools and their funding will be re-examined in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>Strand 1.  This strand is open to teachers with not less than 15 years wholetime or pensionable service who are consistently experiencing professional difficulties in their teaching duties.</P>
      <P>Strand 2.  This strand is open to teachers aged 55 years or more who have a minimum of 20 years pensionable service, where the school managerial authorities verify that the retirement would provide opportunities to enhance the educational services provided by the school.</P>
      <P>Strand 3.  This strand is open to permanent teachers who are in posts which are surplus to requirements and from which they may not be redeployed readily and which will not be filled should they leave the posts.  It is expected that applicants under this strand will have at least five years pensionable service since teachers with less than five years pensionable service will not qualify for the award of a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offers of early retirement under strand 3 will be confined to teachers who are in one of the <Col N="1275" /> following situations: (a) The teacher is confirmed as holding a post which is surplus to requirements; (b) The teacher is in a school where the holder of a post which is surplus to requirements does not wish to retire; an offer will be made where the teacher has applied for early retirement and occupies a post to which the surplus teacher could and would be assigned; and (c) Where neither of the teachers at (a) or (b) wish to avail of an early retirement offer, then an offer of early retirement under this strand may be made to a teacher who occupies a post in another school to which the teacher in the surplus post could and would be redeployed under the relevant redeployment panel arrangements.</P>
    <P>Strands 1 and 3 are, together, subject to an overall quota of 150 retirements per year. Strand 2 is subject to a quota of 250 retirements per year.</P>
    <P>Priority will be given to older teachers where the number of applications exceeds the quota.</P>

      <P>Funding for the works requested at the school referred to by the Deputy must be looked at in the light of existing contractual commitments for 1998 and other priority projects.
