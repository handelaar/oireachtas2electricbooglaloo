      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1, the Gas (Amendment) Bill, 1998 [<i>Seanad</i>] Second Stage (resumed), and No. 22, the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, 1997, Order for Report and Report and Final Stages.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter which was mentioned yesterday, namely, the legislation which must be enacted before the end of next month on the release of prisoners under the Northern Ireland Agreement.  Will the Taoiseach agree to having the heads of the Bill discussed under Standing Order 78A in the justice committee of the House immediately in order that there can be maximum public debate on the criteria to be used in sanctioning releases and clarity as to whether the release policy applies only to those already convicted or to those who may be convicted in the future of offences of a paramilitary kind committed in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated yesterday, the heads of the Bill or any work on it has not yet come to the Government.  In numerous cases there has been discussion of heads of Bills in the relevant committee and I have no objection to getting the views of Members on various aspects in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that a measure of clarity is necessary as it is not clear from the Belfast Agreement whether the relevant provision applies only to those already convicted or to those who may be convicted in future of offences committed in the past?  The Agreement specifies that such people to which it applies will be released within a maximum of two years.  Will the Taoiseach ensure maximum transparency regarding individual decision making and the procedures adopted in view of the understandable concern of victims' families?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there must be maximum clarification.  In the Good Friday Agreement we were talking about the release within two years of people already convicted. There is no doubt about this and I am certain of it as I have been asked a similar question on at least three occasions in the past 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the issue raised by Deputy Bruton and which I mentioned in the House yesterday.  The normal practice in the past has been that under pressure of time a Bill is introduced at the very last moment and effectively guillotined with little or no discussion due to the exigencies of parliamentary time.  In view of the unique sensitivity of this legislation as a cornerstone in building confidence in Northern Ireland, will the Taoiseach consider developing the idea proposed by Deputy Bruton, namely, that the relevant committee would discuss the parameters of the legislation in an open and comprehensive manner, that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would then draft the Bill which would be returned to the committee and enacted so that those North of the Border and elsewhere can be assured that the House has had a full and comprehensive debate on all issues surrounding this very sensitive measure?  It is a unique approach to drafting legislation and I do not suggest it be made a precedent for other legislation, but given the amount of work the Department must do and the number of Bills currently on the Order Paper, will the Taoiseach consider this approach and perhaps consult the party leaders to find a mechanism which addresses in a constructive manner the concerns we are articulating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to what has been said by the party leaders.  The work on the legislation is not advanced &mdash; much work remains to be done.  I am aware that this is a sensitive and very important issue in the context of the families of victims, many of whom I and others in the House have met.  Given that we must move fairly quickly on this issue and the huge workload of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I do not have a problem with working out a mechanism with the Whips in this case.  The heads of the Bill will be brought to a committee of the House in some form, even if they are preliminary, at as early a stage as possible where they can be discussed in detail and subsequent to which the Bill can be drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for that statement.  Can the House take it that all the Government has agreed to with any external party is that which is contained in the Agreement, that there are no other agreements on this topic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>What initiatives is the Taoiseach taking to bring the Garda pay dispute to an end?  The dispute is having an enormously damaging effect on Garda morale and on public confidence.  It is important that the issue be brought to a speedy conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be more appropriate to raise this matter by way of a parliamentary question.  However, the Taoiseach may wish to make a brief comment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government would like to see the Garda negotiating teams return to the negotiating table.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has invited them to do so on a number of occasions.  If that could be achieved, we could move on within the parameters set out under the PCW and conclude these matters.  The Government is very anxious to see the matter brought to a successful conclusion.</P>

      <P>Irish troops serving in South Lebanon came under mortar and artillery fire yesterday. Will the Taoiseach or the Minister for Defence make a statement on the situation in order to reassure the families of those serving in the Lebanon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence is awaiting a full report on this matter.  These unfortunate incidents occur from time to time.  Our main priority is the safety of the members of our Defence Forces and I am happy to inform the House that the personnel involved in the serious incidents yesterday are all safe.  As I understand from the preliminary report I received, indiscriminate shelling was carried out for a number of hours.  I am sure the Minister for Defence will make the full facts available when he receives them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I was informed on 1 April 1998, in a written reply from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that legislation on the ratification of the Convention on the Safety of United Nations Troops and Associated Personnel would be brought forward. That convention cannot be ratified until a number of states pass the necessary legislation.  In view of the concern of the Taoiseach and the House about continuing attacks on UNIFIL, will the Taoiseach assure the House that information will be made available in the near future to allow the House to debate the continuing attacks on Irish troops, particularly in South Lebanon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the Deputy's comments and I will check the matter with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The ratification of the convention is, however, some way off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the House have an opportunity to examine the recent evidence from Greenpeace that contamination from the Sellafield plant in Cumbria has resulted in parts of the Irish Sea being categorised as nuclear waste?  Will the Government bring legislation forward to deal with this matter or will it fully support the STAD group in its court case on THORP which is closely related to this matter?  What measures does the Government propose to undertake in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The OSPAR Convention is due to hold its ministerial meeting in July.  Will the Taoiseach agree to provide some time in the House for a debate on the Government's preparation for that in view of the disturbing information released yesterday about the extent of radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea?  It is desirable that the House should debate the matter and elicit what action the Government proposes to take under the OSPAR Convention to deal with this important question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has not yet received the Greenpeace survey.  It is understood that the survey suggests the level of radioactive contamination found in sediment near the Sellafield discharge pipe exceeds the EU Basic Safety Standards Directive due for implementation by the middle of 2000.  Ultimately, the Government wishes to see contamination being eliminated completely.  BNFL is fully aware of our views on this matter from the content of successive statements made by Irish Ministers over the years. The revised BNFL discharge authorisations are being considered by the UK environmental agency at present and the Department of Public Enterprise has forwarded two detailed submissions to the agency as part of a consultation process.  The Government's views have recently been discussed directly with UK Ministers by the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, and he will take up the matter again at the OSPAR ministerial meeting in July.  It is for the Whips to decide whether some discussion can take place on the matter in the House prior to the meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago on the Order of Business, the Taoiseach promised a full Dáil debate and question and answer session on Luas. I understand there was a tentative agreement among the Whips that such a debate would be taken tomorrow but, when the business of the House was ordered, such a debate was not included.  It is important that a question and answer session should take place before 38 boreholes are drilled in the inner city area.  Will that commitment be honoured and can the debate be taken next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding on the matter is slightly different.  A long and detailed question <Col N="721" /> and answer session took place in the House on a series of Private Notice Questions some weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I waited for more than an hour to take the Order of Business while the question and answer session was ongoing.  While there was a tentative agreement to hold a question and answer session, Deputy Yates tabled a Private Member's motion on the matter and it was also taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I was entitled to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That superseded the agreement which existed.  If the Deputy still wishes to have a debate on the matter, his party Whip should raise it with the Government Whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I wish to clarify the matter for the Taoiseach.  I have already raised the matter with the Government Whip and requested that the debate take place tomorrow.  I would not like the Taoiseach to have been misled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be seeking Government time to debate this matter.</P>
      <P>In regard to Sellafield and the dumping of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea, the Taoiseach mentioned that Government time could perhaps be made available for a debate.  In view of the fact that myriad issues seem to be lined up for discussion in the House, I ask that an urgent meeting of the relevant committee take place at which the matter could be discussed.</P>
      <P>I remind the Taoiseach that, during the previous Government's term of office, the Dumping at Sea Bill was introduced, the toughest piece of legislation in Europe in regard to this matter.  I am sure the Taoiseach would agree that there is no point in having tough legislation on dumping in our seas when we find that the outflow from Sellafield is causing grave concern.  Will the Taoiseach arrange for the relevant committee to meet urgently today or tomorrow to discuss the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of promised or necessary legislation, is the Taoiseach satisfied the Government possesses the necessary legislation to enable the contingency plan to be put in place which would allow the Army to provide the necessary security to ensure that the Tour de France proceeds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated previously, I hope we will not experience any difficulties in regard to <Col N="722" /> the Garda.  If such difficulties arise, the necessary security will be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will presumably rise at the end of June or beginning of July.  Legislation may be necessary to provide the scale of security arrangements which the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Defence envisage.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the necessary legislation exists to enable a contingency plan to be put in place and, if not, when will such legislation be brought before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are operational matters and there is a long-standing practice that, where necessary, the Army may be called on to assist the civil authority.  I do not believe there is any need for that to be put on a legislative basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach sure?</P>

      <P>Ireland has the largest battalion serving for the longest period of time in UNIFIL and it has recently come under attack. Legislation has been promised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give effect to the convention on the safety of United Nations troops and associated personnel, a convention which cannot be ratified until the accession of 22 countries.  Why is that legislation not scheduled to be introduced sooner and will the Taoiseach take steps to bring its introduction forward?  He can put it before a committee if necessary while the House is in recess during the summer.  Our troops are under attack and this legislation should be brought before the House.</P>

      <P>I seek your advice on a point of order.  Ireland has ratified a number of UN conventions and I am aware that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is due to answer questions in the House tomorrow.  However, when matters arise with regard to a breach of a UN convention, such as the United Nations convention against slavery, as was demonstrated by the appearance last weekend of a photograph of 368 people being marched to a market to be sold as slaves, what mechanism exists in the House to raise such matters? Can a matter be referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs as a matter of urgency?  Can the committee be asked to report to the House within a certain time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> Obviously, there is no time now to put down questions on this matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <P>I will now give the House a brief account of the current state of the natural gas industry and the general direction of its future development.  BGE has a <i>de facto</i> but not a statutory monopoly in the purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of natural gas.</P>
      <P>In the relatively short period since its establishment in 1976, BGE has achieved significant progress in the development of the industry.  It now supplies natural gas to 280,000 residential consumers and 10,000 commercial and industrial consumers. By the end of 1998, it hopes to serve 297,000 residential and 10,500 industrial and commercial customers.  Natural gas now meets 20 per cent of our total primary energy requirements. BGE operates in a highly competitive market and must fight for market share against other fuels, such as oil and electricity.</P>
      <P>A key priority for the energy sector in the Programme for Government An Action Programme for the Millennium is to extend natural gas as far as practicable to major towns and cities.  BGE is currently arranging gas supplies to the towns of Fermoy, Carrick-on-Suir, Cobh, Annacotty, Ashbourne, Bettystown, Clane, Kildare, Dunshaughlin and Ratoath and extending supplies in Mitchelstown and Mallow, where natural gas has been available for some time.  It is currently studying the possibility of extending the gas network to areas in close proximity to the network, particularly in Counties Louth, Meath, Kildare, Laois, Wicklow, Limerick, Tipperary and west Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surveys of the load potential for the residential and commercial markets in these areas are ongoing and should sufficient loads be identified for extensions to be economically viable, the projects will be included in the BGE programme. New areas are continuously being added for surveys <Col N="725" /> as the network gradually extends to economically viable locations.</P>
    <P>A proposal to extend the gas network to the midlands and west of Ireland, serving Trim, Mullingar, Athlone, Ballinasloe, Galway, Ennis and Shannon, was drawn up in the early months of 1997.  The economics of the proposal are such that it would not satisfy BGE's investment criteria.  In the circumstances, BGE was not prepared to undertake the extension without the assistance of £60 million in Exchequer funding.  In May, 1997 the then Government decided that further inquiries should be made in respect of the State aids aspect of the proposal before proceeding further with the project.  The necessary formal notification of the proposal was submitted to the European Commission in September, 1997.  The Commission recently indicated that it will not raise any objections to the proposal.  I am taking a further look at the details of the project in consultation with BGE and having regard to the current study of gas demand to the year 2025.</P>
    <P>The natural gas market is one of the sectors being opened up to further competition.  Last December, the EU Council of Energy Ministers reached political agreement on the terms of a directive which will introduce competition into the natural gas industry in the form of third party access to gas networks throughout the European Union.  The competition will be introduced on a phased basis over a period of ten years.  Following consideration of the draft by the European Parliament, which made no amendments, the directive was formally adopted by the Council of Energy Ministers on 11 May.  Broadly speaking and allowing time for publication of the directive, member states have a period of two years to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions to comply with the directive.</P>
    <P>Ireland has already provided for this form of competition and the necessary detailed operating rules are being developed.  Our domestic legislation, the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995, which provides a legal framework for third party access by large consumers to the BGE gas network, is broadly in line with the draft EU Directive.  This facility enables eligible gas consumers, such as the ESB and NET and other large consumers, to purchase their supplies direct from gas producers and to have the gas transmitted through the BGE network on commercial terms. The threshold in the 1995 Act is 25 million standard cubic metres of gas per annum.  On the basis of that figure some 75 per cent of BGE's market is potentially opened up to this new form of competition, but the number of eligible customers is fewer than ten.  The Act also provides for the giving of ministerial general directives to BGE relating to transmission and pricing aspects of third party access.  I have prepared draft Directives and published them for comments.  The comments received are now being examined.  My Department has invited the various bodies which submitted comments to a meeting to discuss the comments. <Col N="726" /> In addition, BGE, in consultation with interested parties, is busily engaged in the preparation of the technical and operational rules in a code of operations document.</P>
    <P>Hydrocarbons play a significant role in Ireland's energy mix and, therefore, it is of considerable importance that we continue with the efforts being made to establish further Irish production. The economic benefits &mdash; royalties, tax, jobs, support services and so on &mdash; resulting directly from the natural gas produced from the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton fields illustrate the importance of indigenous energy supplies.  As I have already stated, however, that supply of natural gas is depleting, resulting in an increasing dependency on imports.  That is sufficient reason for us to continue to make every effort to promote the search for additional indigenous supplies and, whenever possible, to get discoveries developed.</P>
    <P>I understand from my colleague, Deputy Woods, Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, that we now have a high number of exploration licences in place.  This is the result of the new licensing terms introduced in 1992, the consequent licensing rounds in 1994, 1995 and the most successful of all, the Rockall Trough Licensing Round last year, which gave rise to 11 new licences.  At present 28 exploration licences are held and each carries a specific work programme involving a high level of exploration activity.</P>
    <P>The licensees include many of the major exploration companies, several of which returned to Ireland in 1997 after periods away, while others reaffirmed their commitment to Ireland by taking on further licences and building on their existing positions.  The number and quality of exploration companies now involved in offshore Ireland inspires confidence that the present level of exploration activity will be maintained in the coming years.</P>
    <P>In 1996, Enterprise Oil discovered gas in their second well in the Slyne Trough but, despite their best efforts, they were unable to test this discovery because of mechanical problems.  I understand that during 1997 Enterprise acquired new seismic data in the area of the discovery and that they propose to drill an appraisal well in the prospect shortly.  During 1997 two exploration wells were drilled in the Porcupine Basin by Total and Marathon and another exploration well was drilled by Enterprise Oil in the Kish Bank Basin off Dublin.  In addition 1997 was the busiest year for acquisition of new seismic data since records began with the acquisition of in excess of 28,000 kilometres of seismic data.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a vast Continental Shelf and much of it remains under-explored.  Deputy Woods considers it important that we see an exploration presence in areas in our offshore not currently subject to authorisations.  One such area is the 156 blocks in the South Porcupine Basin which is now the subject of a licensing round, the closing date for which is 15 December 1998.  Data acquired there in 1997 &mdash; 17,000 kilometres of seismic data, <Col N="727" /> a high resolution aeromagnetic survey and a seep detection survey &mdash; shows it to have considerable interest for explorationists.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the Bill is very short and straightforward and that there is no provision to deal with the future of the gas industry.  As I mentioned already, EU member states have a period of about two years to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions to comply with the recently adopted EU directive on natural gas.  This work will entail a major review of the Gas Acts and a substantial new Act will have to be drafted.  It is my intention to have the widest possible consultation in relation to drafting the new legislation.  Within the next two years, therefore, this House will have the opportunity to debate detailed proposals for new legislation dealing with not only compliance with the new EU directive but with the future structure of the gas industry.</P>
    <P>I will now return to the purpose of this Bill, to repeal section 37 of the Gas Act, 1976.  Subsection (1) of section 37 provides that all natural gas landed in the State, or got within the jurisdiction of the State, for consumption therein, by the holder of an exploration licence or the holder of a petroleum lease shall be offered for sale to Bord Gais Éireann on reasonable terms.  It also provides that any gas which is so offered to and purchased by the board shall, unless a consent is given by the Minister for Public Enterprise under section 8(7) of the Act to export the gas, be disposed of by the board for consumption in the State.  All natural gas produced to date from our indigenous reserves has been consumed in the State and no consents under section 8(7) have been sought or given.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 37 provides for an exception to the foregoing.  It provides that the requirement to offer gas for sale to BGE shall not apply in cases where the Minister, in approving a plan for the development or exploitation of a deposit of natural gas, requires that the gas be offered for sale to a person other than BGE for a specific industrial purpose.  That provision has never been used.  In any event, I have reservations about its compatibility with competition rules. Subsection (3) provides for a dispute resolution mechanism for dealing with disputes regarding the reasonableness of terms on which natural gas is offered for sale to BGE.</P>
    <P>Section 37 of the Gas Act, 1976, is clearly anti-competitive and incompatible with the competition requirements of the Energy Charter Treaty. That section is also in conflict with EU competition rules.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short Bill which my party will support and I am interested in facilitating its early passage through the Dáil.  This debate, particularly on Second Stage, gives us an opportunity to consider a number of very important energy and gas issues which have not been debated in the House.  The question of gas <Col N="728" /> may seem boring to people but, compared to oil, coal and other resources, gas is the most competitive energy resource.</P>
      <P>Therefore, energy prices <i>per se,</i> as part of our overall competitiveness, including electricity prices based on gas, are critical to the future growth of the economy and require careful consideration. During my brief contribution, I will comment on the Bill, third party access, the future competitive environment in terms of gas, the potential expansion of the gas grid and the need for further interconnectors north and south and east and west.  We must all avail of the dynamic European developments in the international gas market.</P>
      <P>We are obliged to pass this Bill to repeal section 37 of the Gas Act, 1976 to enable us ratify the Energy Charter Treaty.  I understand that treaty was designed primarily to facilitate international trade in gas between the EU and east Europe, but as a member of the European Union we are obliged to ratify it.  Even if we were not, it is fundamental to providing a legal framework for the type of competition we want in the area of gas supply.  Unlike the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, which we will traverse later, this is not a Bill that requires amendment, but it provides an opportunity for an important debate.</P>
      <P>I understand that in April the Government published draft ministerial directives to Bord Gáis Éireann governing third party access to the national gas network.  The Minister referred in some detail to the provisions of the 1995 Act whereby an organisation that consumes more than 25 million standard metres of gas per annum could have access to Bord Gáis Éireann's pipeline and stated that this represents 75 per cent of its customers.  These customers, which are fewer than ten in number, include the ESB, NET and other major employers and providers of services in our economy.</P>
      <P>The directives are seriously deficient in various respects.  If they comprise the bible for access to gas, they require political scrutiny.  I refer in particular to the directives concerning standard service transmission and standard service pricing. While I welcome the publication of the directives for public comment, I want the Minister to clarify a number of points.  He stated that we have two years to put the legislation in place.  Will this be done by way of primary legislation rather than directive so that Members will have an opportunity to scrutinise it?  I am working on that assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a conflict of interest in this because the Minister is the shareholder and regulator of Bord Gáis Éireann.  There could not be a more fundamental conflict of interest.  I am not necessarily calling for the privatisation of Bord Gáis Éireann.  Gas was found in the Porcupine Basin in Kinsale and it was worth a lot of money.  The State was able to realise the asset by utilising it through Bord Gáis Éireann and that was the correct way to proceed.  An asset in the ground gave <Col N="729" /> us a licence to make money.  We now have an opportunity to buy gas from Europe as we face the prospect of the gas in the Kinsale field drying up in three years' time.  Competition will be fundamental to future energy and electricity prices. If the ESB decided to build a new generating capacity, in its opinion the cheapest and most efficient use of energy for electricity would be natural gas at European prices.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about a number of points in the Minister's draft directives.  He did not set out a clear framework for price determination.  The directives also state that we should operate on the basis of a ten year framework of regulations. Charges need to be reviewed annually to get the maximum benefit in terms of lower cost.  The directives do not make a clear statement on a procedure for appeal or dispute resolution.  For example, if the ESB wanted to use Bord Gáis Éireann's pipeline for gas bought from, say, Georgia, a dispute could arise about the cost of transmitting it through the pipeline.  The Minister should provide a procedure for appeal and dispute resolution.  The directives do not refer to the appointment of an independent regulator to oversee this area.  In the context of telecommunications, Deputy Stagg and I debated the role of a regulator as being fundamental to policy determination.  The Government and Europe have some serious thinking to do on this matter. In making its observations on its memorandum to Cabinet, could the Department of Finance state it is not going to do something that would write-off profits of a wholly owned subsidiary of the State, namely, Bord Gáis Éireann?  The Minister must act as regulator and place the assets at one remove or &mdash; the more likely option &mdash; appoint an independent regulator.  Does the Minister intend to appoint an independent regulator?</P>
    <P>Policy decisions are implicit rather than explicit in terms of the rate of return to Bord Gáis Éireann in the standard service pricing directive. Is the rate calculated on the basis of cost recovery of the asset, with or without EU funding, or is some other cost formula used?  In other words, could gas prices in one part of the country be different from those in other areas?  An Post claims the economic cost of delivering a letter to Malin Head is different from that in Dublin.  Will there be more than one tariff?  I support a unified tariff and uniform gas prices for the entire island.</P>
    <P>There is also insufficient information in the pricing directive to assess the reasonableness of the pricing proposals.  How will the asset value be calculated?  What will be included or excluded? Will it be independently assessed?  Will Bord Gáis Éireann determine the cost or will outside experts be appointed to determine the price?  If, say, Aughinish Alumina wanted gas, how would future planned investment by Bord Gáis Éireann be calculated?</P>
    <P>That brings us to the question of the treatment of depreciation.  There are a number of different approaches, including straight line depreciation, but it depends on what way this goes.  It is just <Col N="730" /> like getting a phone connected; there is a cost to access the system and a tariff rate.  It is not clear to me how this price review will be undertaken. How much of the recovery of the price will be in the connection fee or will it be built into the usage tariff, including the ratio of fixed and variable costs?</P>
    <P>As a general principle, I would like to see the maximum level of transparency, either through an independent regulator or through Departmental guidelines, so that an explicitly transparent formula is established and an appeal mechanism put in place.</P>
    <P>The tone of the standard service transmission directive appears to be anti-consumer.  There seems to be no incorporation of quality standards or what householders are entitled to in terms of efficiency, customer care and codes of conduct.</P>
    <P>I am not clear as to how the Minister of State's proposals marry with the EU gas directive.  Perhaps he can clarify whether they are totally synchronised.</P>
    <P>To summarise my position, I am looking for a clear commitment to separate the Government's conflict of interest between the regulation and ownership of Bord Gáis Éireann.  We should have a policy of getting gas for the cheapest possible price.  Such a policy would achieve a great deal.</P>
    <P>As part of the ESB's cost and competitiveness review it sought a 3 per cent electricity price increase but the Government said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The Government, however, cannot have it every way. If it says &ldquo;no&rdquo; to price increases &mdash; and, of course, there is public support for a rejection of electricity price increases &mdash; it must facilitate cheaper gas to the ESB instead of maximising the profits of BGE.</P>
    <P>Third party access is the most critical area of the entire gas industry.  The ten year review, the absence of a regulator, transparency and answers on the basis of how we arrive at cost and value must be set out.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should circulate to Opposition spokespersons his considered view on these points before decisions are made.  This is a crucial matter and I would not like to see a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    <P>On the gas grid itself, I was told by a reliable source that there would be a major announcement this week concerning the extension of the gas grid to the midlands and the west.  However, knowing the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke's local geographical interest and the way in which these things work, I would say that a bigger and better splash is being planned in a further announcement.  I see that Athlone, Ballinasloe, Galway and Mullingar were mentioned in the Minister of State's speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no gas there at the moment.  I understand the EU has now given clearance for an Exchequer grant of £60 million which will be required to extend the gas pipeline into the midlands and the west.  I support the maximum extension of the gas pipeline.  Given that we will move into a new era where 75 per cent of the customers of Bord Gáis will have new rights in two years time, now is the time to put the structure in place.  If we do not do so, there may be huge peripheral disadvantages for the location of manufacturing companies and other large scale users.</P>
      <P>We have discussed the massive development of the greater Dublin area &mdash; including the adjoining counties, where one third of the population lives &mdash; and its transport problems.  We will, however, reinforce the peripherality within the State if we do not have an extended gas network.  I support that project and I look forward to the announcements that will be made about it.</P>
      <P>The question of gas interconnectors, however, is a more important one.  The Minister of State in his speech said:</P>
      <P>A joint North-South study of the feasibility of providing a natural gas interconnector between Dublin and Belfast was completed last year. The study report concluded that such an interconnector is technically possible and represents the most cost-effective means of the potential solutions considered in relation to gas supply issues for both sides of the Border.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State also said the study report formed a basis on which to proceed.  I support that.  A two-way flow of gas prices is fundamental to a competitive dynamic in the market.  The Minister of State should not become bogged down in a paralysis of analysis.  I see that a further report on gas demand is now being considered. The interconnector plan is important as part of the prevailing peace process.</P>
      <P>Our own natural gas reserves represent an exhaustible resource.  While there may be future gas discoveries and notwithstanding the exploration that is going on, Irish gas reserves are finite. Given the potential competitiveness of gas, a second interconnector must be constructed on an east-west basis.  The previous interconnector was built in 1990 for £265 million.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of tunnels we have now are different from the ones we had then.  Given the projected growth in energy consumption, particularly electricity, a link from Wexford to Wales can no longer be deferred.  It would have the side benefit of providing natural gas to my county, but the main point is that it can link up to the grid.  This project must be included in the next round of EU Structural Funds after 1999, whether or not the resources are meagre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks at the geography of gas resources <Col N="732" /> in Europe, from the Urals to the Atlantic, one can see there is real potential and a competitive force for the exploitation of gas.  Once the super-structure is there to link into the UK system we could obtain the full benefit of the cheapest possible prices by making on the spot purchases.  The UK has gone further down the road than any other EU member state in terms of privatisation and all the rigours of competition.  British and Irish gas prices are substantially out of line, as are electricity prices.</P>
    <P>The existing pipeline capacity cannot meet demand.  In any case, this needs to be done because of the exhaustion of the gas fields.  A second gas interconnector should be the major infrastructural project during the Minister of State's tenure in the Department.  There is no longer any security threat to such a project from terrorism.  It is imperative and will create a real basis for us to improve our energy-based competitiveness into the new millennium.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and will facilitate its passage. If the Minister of State wants to expedite Committee and Report Stages I see no difficulty in moving forward on them.</P>

I hope the political process will be part of such discussions.  I hope we do not lose sight of the proposal to extend the gas grid, which is politically and geographically pleasing, and the east west connector.  The technical, planning and investment requirements to make that happen should be put in place sooner rather than later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume his presence in the Chamber is indicative of some of the remarks made by the Minister and Deputy Yates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduced the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995, which gives the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, the weapons to introduce these regulations.  He was a senior member of the party which accepted that Act.  I deliberately retained in that legislation the power of regulation for the Minister in the full knowledge that the regulatory situation was being examined separately. The intention at that time was to introduce legislation with the regulatory commission which would set up a super powered regulator who would have more power than the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  I am glad we at least blocked or delayed that during my period in the Department and I hope it is not resurrected in that form.  Because that was in the offing, we retained the power of regulation for the Minister <Col N="733" /> in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995.  The Minister is now making regulations under that legislation.</P>
    <P>We must decide if we want State companies to be profitable and commercial and to do the best they can to get every pound for their shareholder or to be a social service.  We cannot tell Bord Gáis Éireann to cut its profits because if it is profitable, it is charging too much for gas.  It should get the best price it can for gas because it is in competition with other energy sources.  Do we want it to give gas away at 4p per unit, which is approximately what it buys it for, or sell it at 8p per unit? It currently sells it at 62p per unit because that is competitive.  Because Bord Gáis sold it for that price, it was able to pay for the interconnector and the expansion of the grid and to give approximately £300 million to the Government over five years.  We must make a choice about which we want it to do.  As a shareholder, the Government could direct Bord Gáis to sell gas at cost price and make no profit.  That would reduce energy costs but it would also reduce the Government's income.  I presume it would have to collect that income through taxes.</P>
    <P>This legislative measure repeals section 37 of the Gas Act, 1976.  The repeal of this section will allow Ireland to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty and the protocol on energy and efficiency and related environmental aspects which accompanies the treaty.  Ireland is one of only three EU members which has yet to ratify this treaty and, in that context, this legislation is welcome.</P>
    <P>This is one of the shortest Bills to come before the House and I do not intend to spend long discussing it in detail.  However, its introduction allows us to have a timely debate on the future of the gas industry in Ireland and how best to harness that resource for the benefit of the island.</P>
    <P>The contents of the Bill are straightforward. Legal advice from the Attorney General indicates that section 37 of the Gas Act, 1976, is in conflict with the Energy Charter Treaty and an obstacle to its ratification.  It is also worthwhile to note that the anti-competitive nature of section 37 is probably in conflict with EU competition rules and will have to be repealed on that basis.  The administrative act of repealing section 37 is contained in the Bill but it goes no further than that.</P>
    <P>One important point is that when section 37 is repealed there is nothing proposed to take its place.  We are creating a legislative vacuum. Senator Costello raised this valid point during the debate on the Bill in the Seanad.  This aspect of the Bill smacks of the old Thatcherite liberalisation regime of total unhindered free markets or the policy of &ldquo;survival of the fittest and damn the weakest&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The intention of the Energy Charter Treaty is to regulate the market but this Bill will give us a free for all.  What would happen if a company made a large gas discovery in the Porcupine Basin and decided to build a pipeline directly to mainland Europe, to France, for example, and bypass this country?  This is not only possible but likely. <Col N="734" /> What advantage would Ireland get from such a discovery and exploitation of our natural resources?  The answer is little because the exploration and production terms are so generous, there would be little or no benefit to Ireland or the economy from such a discovery unless the product is landed in Ireland with the consequent economic activity that would generate. I urge the Minister to examine this as part of what he is proposing to ensure Ireland's interests are safeguarded as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The deletion of section 37 effectively removes the legislative obstacles to competition in the gas industry.  It removes the obligation for all gas landed in the State to be offered for sale to Bord Gáis Éireann.  This requirement was necessary and beneficial during the early years of BGE's operation.  However, it is no longer tenable in the new competitive European environment.</P>
    <P>Taken in tandem with the provisions of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995, which allow for third party access by large consumers to the BGE network and open up 75 per cent of BGE's market to competition, we now have the basic legislative framework to allow for competition in this sector of the market.  During his contribution in the Seanad, the Minister alluded to the fact that a draft directive on the introduction of competition into the natural gas sector has been agreed by the Council of Energy Ministers and is now being deliberated in the European Parliament.  I would be obliged if the Minister would expand further on the contents of the draft directive agreed by the Council of Energy Ministers and how it will impact on the natural gas sector in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The threshold for competitive consumption in the 1995 Act is 25 million standard cubic metres per annum.  This enables the largest gas consumers in the State to avail of a competitive market. Does the draft directive substantially alter this threshold?  In his Seanad speech the Minister stated that our current domestic legislation was broadly in line with the draft EU directive.  I ask him to outline the areas where the draft directive differs from our national legislation and what further changes he envisages implementing to accommodate the terms of the directive.  While I appreciate that the European Parliament may propose significant changes to the directive, the Minister should outline the Government's intentions on this matter.</P>
    <P>In its relatively short history, Bord Gáis Éireann has a tremendous record in developing our gas infrastructure.  BGE now serves approximately 280,000 domestic customers and over 10,000 commercial consumers of natural gas.  It has secured 20 per cent of the energy market in Ireland in the face of strong competition from other sectors.  I am confident that BGE can continue to thrive as the energy market is further liberalised. I do not agree with the view that our semi-State industries should feel threatened by competition.</P>
    <P>BGE is a well managed company.  It is headed <Col N="735" /> by its chairperson, Dr. Michael Conlon, and chief executive, Mr. Phil Cronin, and staffed by dedicated professionals who have a progressive attitude to the energy industry and the future role which gas will play in that sector.  BGE has been to the forefront in developing our gas infrastructure. This has ensured that the maximum number of customers are connected to the natural gas network and that the future supply of gas from indigenous and foreign sources is secured.</P>
    <P>The recent decision by the EU Commission to approve proposals for a natural gas trunk line from Dublin to Galway and west Limerick is welcome. I was deeply involved in this project when I was in Government and I am delighted the EU Commission has no objections to it.  I spent two years fighting with the officials in my Department and, when I had convinced them, with the officials in the Department of Finance and with BGE about the merits of the project.  I am delighted we got it to the point where it was technically approved by the Government subject to EU approval of its State aid aspect.  I am also delighted that the Minister of State said positive things about it in the House today.  I expect a further announcement by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, whose constituency will be directly and positively affected by the proposal in the near future.  I was pestered during that period by my colleague, Deputy Penrose, as to why I was not getting the project on the rails. I am pleased all the work during that period is coming to fruition.  I expect the Minister will invite all those involved in the project at any stage to the announcement which I hope she make shortly.</P>
    <P>The construction of the Dublin to Galway-Limerick trunk line will be of great benefit to both domestic consumers and industrial interests throughout the whole of the midlands, the midwest and the Shannon area.  It will also provide a great boost to industrial development throughout the whole region.  For too long lip service has been paid to the needs of the midlands and other areas outside Dublin.  When in Government I was determined to take effective action that would produce long-term benefits for communities outside the immediate Dublin area.  The gas trunkline project is a prime example of how a major infrastructural project has the potential to reinvigorate a whole region.  It has the potential to attract further investment into the area.  As well as this it makes the towns along the route more attractive to reside in and may, in the future, relieve the population pressures on the capital city and address the severe depopulation affecting many rural areas.  It is important when a major infrastructural development of this nature is being developed that we have a broad vision of the future.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications revolution continues at an incredible pace.  It is possible that work practices and methods which today we accept as essential may well lose their central role in the <Col N="736" /> coming decades.  For instance, modern telecommunications may remove the need for workers to attend office buildings in central locations every day.  This is already happening to some extent.  It is quite common for academics and professionals, particularly in the software sector, to co-operate on projects across huge geographical divides.  This process will undoubtedly filter down through mainstream industry and business.  The future work patterns of people may well differ significantly from what we take for granted today and highly skilled workers may quite easily work on projects in their home or local office while communicating effectively with their colleagues.  This would make residing in towns beyond the traditional Dublin commuter belt a more attractive option for thousands of workers.  It is essential that we invest now in the infrastructural projects that not only recognise the needs of the future but actively encourage certain social shifts that we deem beneficial.</P>
    <P>With the clearance of the EU secured the Government must act swiftly to ensure this project commences as soon as possible.  I would be obliged if the Minister of State would outline his intentions in this regard.  I am aware that his immediate superior, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has a habit of producing grand schemes with no budget, no start date and no prospect of competition.  I hope this policy malaise has not pervaded the entire Department. Perhaps the Minister of State can provide us with a firm timetable for the construction of this trunk line to towns such as Trim, Mullingar, Athlone, Ballinasloe, Galway city, Ennis and Shannon. Spur lines to Longford, Sligo, Roscommon, Ballina and Castlebar would then be a real possibility.</P>
    <P>The supply of gas to these towns will bring the type of benefits that the original rural electrification scheme brought to Ireland outside of Dublin. In office I prepared the scheme in great detail and it is now ready to go ahead.  I note it was included in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  I urge the Minister to grasp the nettle without further delay and seek Cabinet approval for this project which will bring wealth and comfort to areas that have long been neglected.</P>
    <P>On the issue of securing gas supplies from indigenous and foreign sources I welcome this Bill so far as it enables Ireland to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty.  This treaty, which should prove beneficial to all signatories, has the ability to increase co-operation specifically between the European Union and the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and Russia.  The expanding European gas network, which includes the interconnector between Ireland and Scotland and the British European interconnector, provides Ireland with a secure source of natural gas in the future.  It is extremely important given the completion of the Kinsale Head Ballycotton field.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of continued exploration of our continental shelf and tapping into our indigenous natural resources.  However, it is vital to secure <Col N="737" /> supply from such large gas fields that exist in the former eastern bloc countries and the Soviet Union.  This should be possible under the terms of the Energy Charter Treaty.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will expand on the contents of the protocol on energy efficiency and related environment aspects that accompanies the energy charter.  The protocol is crucially important to future energy exploration on the continent of Europe and beyond.  However, I have concerns regarding the implementation and monitoring of this protocol, especially when one considers the huge degree of destruction that energy production methods pursued in Eastern Europe countries have inflicted on the environment there.  There is an attempt to establish international environmental standards for energy production but what procedures are in place to enforce these standards?  We cannot accept exploration companies that trade in the east, utilising cheaper and more environmentally damaging methods there than they would use to exploit resources in the west.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party does not oppose this Bill.  I accept the suggestion that we take all stages together.  While we are prepared to accept it as a necessary administrative act to comply with our international obligations, further actions are required to protect consumers in the evolving competitive energy market.  We are determined to ensure that the people, through their elected representatives, have a central role in establishing the basic social principles to which a new liberalised market must adhere.  We must ensure that the operation of that market remains accountable to the democratically elected representatives of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am here is well known.  I thank the House and my colleague, Deputy Stagg, for allowing me a few minutes to make a short contribution.  I will not go back over the ground covered by Deputy Stagg in relation to the central thrust of the Bill which basically is the repeal of section 37 of the 1976 Act.  This is necessary to conform with EU rules governing competition policy in the energy sector.  Given that it would be deemed under Article 86 to be in breach of EU competition rules, it requires to be repealed and the Minister has brought forward the Bill to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the concerns expressed by my colleague, Deputy Stagg.  Obviously the repeal of section 37 leaves a legislative vacuum because there is nothing put in its place.  The unfettered liberalisation aspect of the repeal is a matter of concern to us in the Labour Party and I ask the Minister to examine it.  Frequently we hear that liberalisation brings many benefits but there are also some drawbacks.  It is easy for people in the marketplace to say certain industries and companies had monopolies, especially in the State or semi-State sectors.  These are often important industries where competitors come in, take the most profitable lines or routes and leave the area with <Col N="738" /> few services.  For example Bus Éireann serves rural people whom other companies may not serve.  That is the focus of my concern in relation to this matter.  In our rush to liberalisation I want to ensure people are not left behind.  We must ensure our natural resources are for the benefit of all as opposed to the gainful profit of a few.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, said this Bill does not deal with the future of the gas industry but certainly it will help.  I was pleased the Minister of State took on the task initiated by my colleague, Deputy Stagg, in Government concerning the proposals put forward for the funding of the natural gas trunk line from Dublin to Galway-west Limerick.  This trunk line will pass through the midlands and serve a number of the main towns en route.  I was pleased to hear the Minister of State confirm that the EU Commission has cleared these proposals.  It is now up to the Government to ensure the necessary Exchequer funding.  The Minister said this matter would go back to Government and that the level of Exchequer funding will have to be examined. My understanding is that we are talking about an injection of £60 million over a 20 year period. That is small fry in relation to the overall moneys required and the benefits that will flow from it are extremely significant.</P>
    <P>The proposal involves the construction by Bord Gáis of a trunk line from the gas interconnection at north County Dublin through the midlands and south to Limerick.  The corollary of that will bring forward the supply of gas to towns on the corridor of this trunk line which include Trim, Mullingar, Athlone, Ballinasloe, Galway, Ennis and Shannon.  The spur lines will be completed by means of open competition and that is necessary under EU rules, but we are talking about a small amount of money.  Our economy is growing and we hear a great deal about the fruits of the Celtic tiger.  This is an area the Government could examine, on any cost benefit analysis, with a view to injecting the necessary funding for this project.</P>
    <P>Towns in my own area of Mullingar and Athlone would receive a tremendous boost if this proposal were put in place.  It is important that rural people receive the benefits and that they do not feel excluded.  We talk about proposals that are inclusive.  This is one way of ensuring that the benefits of a natural resource are fed down along the line to facilitate the maximum number of people.</P>
    <P>When he was in office I pestered the former Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, to the point of distraction about progressing this proposal.  I am delighted the Minister was in a position to give the news that it has been given the green light from Europe.  I note this proposal was in his party's manifesto and I am even more heartened because I trust it will be honoured in full.  It is important that the Minister of State pursues this matter with his senior colleagues with a view to getting work started without delay.</P>
    <P>There should be a time frame in regard to when the work should begin because last week I <Col N="739" /> spoke to two industrialists in Mullingar who are waiting on the commencement of this project.  As far back as 1993 people spoke to me about a project like this, and they are anxious to know when an announcement will be forthcoming.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to indicate it will not be too far down the line.</P>
    <P>Rural areas have suffered severely from depopulation and degeneration.  I have no doubt the announcement of a major infrastructural project of this nature will accelerate the reversal of this process.  I come from the midlands where we lost 2,000 jobs in Bord na Móna, and many words have been spoken and written about the need to develop the infrastructure of the midlands from that time.  A supply of natural gas will give an important boost to the prospects of the areas affected in attracting industry and creating jobs. It will also give households a choice of energy which creates competition in the energy area.</P>
    <P>In Athlone, Mullingar and other rural areas a level playing field will be created between the midlands and the areas currently served by natural gas.  That will be a tremendous boost, both for consumers and industries, in these towns.  It is time for action and this project will be a major move.  In that respect, today's announcement is welcome.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Minister will try to secure Exchequer funding for this project but a natural resource should be made available to areas which otherwise would be deemed to be economically inaccessible.  When the cost benefit analysis is done in the Department, the Minister should make a strong case for Exchequer funding to be forthcoming without further delay.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that we pursue policies that permit the maximum level of participation of our people as consumers of natural resources.  We do not have many natural resources but there should be a level playing field in regard to those we have. People in isolated rural areas should enjoy the beneficial effects of the natural resources enjoyed by those in large urban areas and hinterlands.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing forward the Bill and giving us the opportunity to speak about a matter that is probably not directly related to it.  I am sure he will understand the reason we are making contributions on the EU Commission proposal to approve funding to supply natural gas to the midlands.  I hope the Minister will be successful in securing the necessary Exchequer funding. He will have support from this side of the House in those endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small Bill and what I have to say will be correspondingly short so I do not anticipate using the 20 minutes available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not share the general welcome for this legislation before the House.  It is a very short Bill and in so far as the text is concerned, it is difficult to find, as one would with more extensive legislation, specific provisions with which one might <Col N="740" /> find fault or about which one might be critical. There are a number of grounds, however, on which the Bill needs to be examined in a more critical manner.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Stagg pointed out, the Bill repeals section 37 of the 1976 Act which provided for the sale of natural gas to Bord Gáis Éireann and provided for the controlled use of the natural gas resource.  I understand the repeal of that section is necessary because it is in conflict with the competition requirements both at EU level and those of the Energy Charter Treaty.  However, it is not being replaced by any kind of regulatory framework and it seems to me that what is being put before the House today is probably the baldest piece of legislative free marketeering we have seen for a long time.  Section 37 will be repealed and it is open season after that with regard to where, to whom or how the natural gas may be sold.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister did not give any indication as to the source from which any competition might come.  On the face of it, one could say this legislation is anti-Bord Gáis Éireann since, up to now, it exclusively had the right to purchase natural gas.  I am not here to bat for Bord Gáis Éireann, but it would be helpful if we had some indication of from where the source of this competition will come.  If it is argued, for example, that it is to come from areas of the private sector, I would have to say that the private sector, particularly in the area of gas distribution, has had a poor record in recent times.  It is not that long ago, as many Deputies will recall, since the risk to which the then Dublin Gas Company put domestic users of gas in this city when that company was in serious trouble and Bord Gáis Éireann had to bail it out.  It is a pity that the opportunity has not been taken to put in place some kind of regulatory framework for the competition which is anticipated for the sale of gas rather than the free market which will result from the bald repeal of section 37 in isolation.</P>
    <P>I also regret that the opportunity has not been taken to rebalancing to whom the gas is sold.  In particular, I refer to the use by ESB of 50 per cent of the national gas resource for conversion to electricity.  There is a strong body of opinion which would argue that that is a wasteful use of the scarce natural gas resource, that there is a certain degree of absurdity in converting one form of energy into another in this way, at considerable cost, to generate electricity.  It is a pity that that aspect of our natural gas resource has not been addressed.</P>
    <P>The Bill arises from the requirement to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty.  As I understand it, the motivation for the negotiation and agreement of that treaty arises from the need to provide for competition essentially in the Siberian gas fields. I want to make two points about that treaty.  First, the treaty was negotiated, agreed and signed in 1994 by the then Government.  The Minister stated that this country agrees with the treaty and <Col N="741" /> strongly supports it.  We are now being presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  We are being told that we must pass this Bill to ratify the treaty.  As a Member, I resent that approach to the negotiation of international treaties, the presentation of the consequences to this House as a <i>fait accompli</i> when they have been negotiated, agreed and signed, and to be told on the introduction of a Bill that it must be passed quickly so that the treaty can be ratified.  I do not recall &mdash; I stand to be corrected on this &mdash; that there was any debate in this House about the Energy Charter Treaty prior to its negotiation.  We should move to a situation soon in the way we do our business here that if a Government is to negotiate a treaty on behalf of the people of this country, there should be a requirement that the Minister leading that negotiation should inform the House that it is proposed on behalf of the people to negotiate a treaty, outline the general principles and issues involved, enable the House to express its view and give, or if need be withhold, a general approval for that process.  It is not acceptable that the way in which we deal with the ratification of international treaties is that the Government engages in negotiations over a number of years and then at some point late in the day presents the result to the House when we are told essentially that we have no choice at that stage but to ratify it.  I remind the Minister that there have been a number of occasions when that approach to the negotiation of international agreements has landed this country in considerable difficulty and local conflict.  For example, difficulties arose in relation to abortion as a result of the Protocol which was slipped into the Maastricht Treaty during its negotiation.  There have been repeated opportunities to revisit the proposed Loran C mast in County Clare which resulted from an agreement which was negotiated before it was brought before this House.  The mast has not been built and it is still causing considerable local grief.  More recently, there was the agreement by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance to sign away the duty free arrangements, which again are now the subject of considerable difficulties. Therefore, as a general principle, before agreements and treaties of this kind are negotiated there should be prior discussion here so that the House can express an opinion, first, on whether it is a good idea to proceed with that particular treaty and, second, on its contents.</P>
    <P>With regard to the contents of this treaty, I do not accept the assumption that competition for the exploitation of gas resources is a good thing <i>per se</i> and that we should all acquiesce in that general view.  This treaty is essentially about competition for the exploitation of natural gas in Siberia. It is about the various big players in the hydrocarbons industry exploiting the natural gas resource in Siberia.  The argument repeatedly made for competition is that it reduces price, increases efficiency and is ultimately good for the consumer.  As a general principle, I accept that. However, with regard to the exploitation of <Col N="742" /> hydrocarbons there is a further dimension which should be taken into account in this equation which is that, inevitably, competition will increase economic activity and result in an increased pace in the exploitation of the resource.  If there is competition in the exploration for and exploitation of natural gas in Siberia, it means that natural gas will be taken out of the ground at a more accelerated pace.  Will the Minister state how that is squared with the high aspirations which are repeatedly expressed by the Government, the European Union and the international community on the need to reduce the use of hydrocarbons and fossil fuels, to reduce the level of greenhouse gases in particular, and to deal with the problem of climate change?</P>
    <P>Recently there were statements in this House on the Kyoto Summit.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government explained the laudable position which the Government took at that summit.  He spoke of the progressive EU position that greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced and that there would be a reduction in the use of hydrocarbons.  He spoke of how if people continue to use fossil fuels as they do at present &mdash; pumping them into the atmosphere and overheating the planet &mdash; the known horrendous consequences of climate change, rising sea levels, flooding, and the El Nino effect which we have seen over the course of the past year or more, will be reproduced exponentially in the form of the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  We know, for example, that if we continue to use greenhouse gases at the present level, within the course of the next century some coastal regions in this and other continents will be flooded and will effectively become part of the sea.</P>
    <P>On top of that, we know the awful consequences of an erratic climate.  It is not just a question of warmer summers.  An average rise of 1 per cent in global temperature would have horrendous consequences in different places. The imperative to reduce the use of hydrocarbons is extremely strong.  Natural gas contributes 12 per cent to greenhouse gases, and here we have an international treaty, to which this country enthusiastically subscribed, which provides for the accelerated exploitation of that resource.  That does not square with the objective of reducing the use of hydrocarbons as a source of energy.</P>
    <P>I make that point because of the inconsistency of on the one hand signing up to ecological and environmental objectives and, on the other hand, negotiating and signing up to treaties that provide for an accelerated exploitation of these resources. It also has economic consequences for us.  The Minister referred to our objective as an economy to exploit oil and gas resources off our own coast. The day will come when we will be told we cannot do that.  The international requirement to reduce the use of hydrocarbon resources may prevent us from exploiting the oil and gas resources off our coast, because we have signed <Col N="743" /> up to a treaty which provides for an accelerated exploitation of them somewhere else in the world. It is very short-sighted to simply go along with the idea that competition for the exploitation of natural gas in Siberia will inevitably be good for this country.</P>
    <P>Another factor is the exhaustibility of these resources.  If we continue to take natural gas resources out of the seabed, at some point they will be exhausted.  It is an object lesson in the exhaustibility of these resources that the Kinsale-Ballycotton field will be gone in five years' time. We all recall when it was discovered.  There was a great deal of excitement.  It was what sparked the establishment of Bord Gáis Éireann under the 1976 Act which we are now amending.  The Aghada plant in Cork and the national gas pipeline were all about bringing ashore the Marathon field.  We were told at the time that it would last for 30 years.  Thirty years seemed a long time in the early 1970s.  That time is almost up.  The gas is almost gone and it cannot be replaced.  The same will happen in relation to every other gas field that is exploited.  In the interests of conserving the resource, does it make sense to encourage competition in the kind of free market unregulated way that the energy charter treaty prescribes and which it is proposed to put in our domestic legislation?  I would argue that it does not.  It is something about which we should express a degree of caution before simply going along with the idea that signing up to the Energy Charter Treaty is a good idea, that competition for the exploitation of a scarce resource, particularly one that contributes to enormous environmental crisis on the globe, is necessarily a good idea.</P>
    <P>Since all politics is local, I will return to one or two more immediate considerations.  I congratulate Bord Gáis Éireann on the excellent work it has done over the years in the provision of natural gas, and on the success of the company.  There is one small gripe which may appear tangential in the context of what we are discussing.  It is probably more about contractors used by Bord Gáis Éireann than about the company.  I refer to the difficulties that arise in reinstatement of roads, footpaths and so on after natural gas is supplied in many urban areas.  There has been a poor record of reinstatement on the part of the contractors engaged by the gas company.  Inevitably, as the grid is extended, as more homes are connected to natural gas, that is something that will need attention.  I am very happy for Deputy Penrose that natural gas is coming to County Westmeath, but I would hate to see him having to come in here repeatedly on the Adjournment to raise with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the state of the roads after the work has been done.  I would appreciate it if some attention could be given to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob) Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to be as <Col N="744" /> brief and comprehensive as possible.  I thank the Deputies who contributed and will give careful consideration to their views.</P>
      <P>The Bill is simple and straightforward.  Its purpose is to repeal a single section of the Gas Act, 1976 to enable Ireland to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty.  There is an urgent need for Ireland to ratify this treaty as it is a valuable mechanism for ensuring the provision of secure energy supplies and facilitating investment in energy projects in the former Iron Curtain countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland is one of only two EU member states that still have to ratify the treaty.  France is the other one.  Security of supply is the bell that rings most urgently with me.  Gas production from the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton fields is already in decline.  Unless there is success in the discovery of further commercial reserves we will be totally dependent for gas supplies on external sources within the next five years.  The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is continuing to provide every possible encouragement and is providing a range of incentives to companies that wish to explore for natural gas on our Continental Shelf and onshore so that further reserves of a commercial nature can be discovered and developed.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann is a highly successful commercial State body which has performed satisfactorily since its establishment in 1976.  Deputies paid a well deserved tribute to BGE.  The company has served the country well in developing the natural gas industry.  It supplies a varied market including residential, commercial and industrial users, the ESB and NET.  The gas industry supplies 20 per cent of our primary energy requirements compared with 6 per cent in 1980. This progress has been achieved without any State investment.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the Exchequer has received over £400 million in contributions from BGE. Therefore, not only gas consumers but the whole economy has benefited from BGE's success.  I congratulate the chairman of the company, Dr. Michael Conlon, the board, the chief executive, Mr. Philip Cronin, and the management and staff on their excellent work, expertise and resourcefulness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future holds formidable challenges for BGE.  The advent of further competition in the form of third party access to the gas network will provide both a challenge and an opportunity for the company to continue to show its mettle in the highly competitive energy sector.  An EU directive has recently been adopted detailing the establishment of common rules for the internal market in natural gas.  As well as establishing common rules the directive requires the phased introduction of third party access to gas networks. I am committed to the promotion of competition in the gas sector.  Ireland is to the fore in this respect in that legislation is in place for third party access.  The Department and BGE are busily engaged in the drafting of the necessarily detailed and technically complex operating rules <Col N="745" /> for third party access.  This important work is designed to contribute to the growth of the economy through competitive energy pricing and quality of service.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my speech, the House will have an opportunity in the next two years to debate detailed proposals for new legislation dealing with compliance with the EU gas directive and the future structure of the gas industry.  In addition, BGE is importing an increasing amount of gas and the cost of this gas is adding to the company's operating expenditure.  BGE is developing new products and services and is engaged in a major transformation programme in consultation with staff and unions.  In other words, the company is taking a proactive approach to preparing for the new competitive and challenging environment.</P>
    <P>Neither the Government nor the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources can do anything about the difficult physical environment in which exploration for hydrocarbons takes place in Irish waters.  Nevertheless, the Government is anxious that our natural resources should be discovered and developed for the nation's benefit, cognisant of the fact that there has only been one commercial find after more than 30 years of exploration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates was concerned about the uniformity of the tariff for third party access.  I assure the Deputy that it is the intention to introduce a single postalised tariff irrespective of location or area of consumption for third party access.  The Deputy will remember buying fertiliser by this method.  I was involved in its distribution and it was a meritorious system which worked well, offering a standard price anywhere in the country. The Deputy raised a range of other issues which will be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be an independent regulator? That is a fundamental issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to address that issue.  A number of Deputies also mentioned the interconnector between the UK and Ireland.  As I have stated, the Government and BGE are urgently examining the optimal gas infrastructural transmission requirements to cater for the accelerating growth in the demand for gas.  Consultants have been engaged to produce a report on the required infrastructure and that report is expected by September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Stagg and Penrose raised the issue of the gas extension to the midlands and the west. They are supportive of the proposal and strongly argued for spur lines for transmission to other towns.  I am looking again at the proposal in consultation with BGE and having regard to the study of gas demand up to the year 2025 which is under way.  Therefore, I cannot give a timetable. However, the Government will have to reconsider the proposal now that the EU Commission has cleared the State aid aspect.  I compliment and congratulate Deputy Stagg on his initiative <Col N="746" /> on the westward extension of the network during his time as Minister of State.  He was instrumental in driving that issue.  Perhaps his colleagues in Government were not all that supportive but the Deputy did all possible to put this in motion and the Government will now examine the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputies Stagg, Penrose and Gilmore expressed concerns about the new regime following the repeal of section 37.  The repeal of section 37 of the 1976 Act will not cause a problem for the purchase of natural gas supplies by BGE.  The board will still be able to bid for the purchase of natural gas whether discovered within the jurisdiction or otherwise and to continue to transmit, distribute and sell the gas for industrial, commercial and residential purposes.  In the event of an energy crisis and where there would be a need to control the use of energy sources, there is provision in the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts to enable the making of orders governing the acquisition, supply, distribution and marketing of natural gas.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies were concerned about the EU gas directive.  The directive will introduce competition into the natural gas market in the form of third party access to gas networks throughout the EU.  Initially 20 per cent of the gas market will be opened to this competition.  This will increase to 28 per cent after five years and 33 per cent after ten years.  Gas-fired power generators, irrespective of their natural gas consumption level, and other final customers consuming more than 25 million cubic metres of gas per year on a consumption site basis will be eligible for third party access.  Member states have until the year 2000 to implement the directive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore is concerned that the Energy Charter Treaty is a <i>fait accompli</i> and is objecting to it on the basis that the House will not have an opportunity to agree to it.  The terms of the Treaty were approved by the House in November-December 1994 as required under Article 29 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Treaty creates the conditions necessary to encourage investment in the energy sector and facilitates economic recovery in the former Iron Curtain countries.  In doing so it opens up opportunities for Irish enterprise in consultancies, joint ventures, construction and equipment supplies.  It contributes to the security of oil and gas supplies for the west.  Much of the world's oil and gas supplies are located in eastern Europe in the former Soviet Union countries.  It is important that the necessary investment to exploit these resources is made in a way that promotes long-term co-operation in the energy field.  The legal framework created by the energy charter allows this to happen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stagg referred to the Protocol on Energy Efficiency and Related Environmental Aspects.  Article 19 of the Energy Charter deals specifically with the environmental aspects, embodies the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle and encourages the promotion of market oriented pricing which reflects environmental costs and <Col N="747" /> benefits.  The Protocol has the specific objectives of promoting energy efficiency policies consistent with sustainable development and creating conditions which induce producers and consumers to use energy economically, efficiently and in an environmentally sound way.  Its detailed measures place binding obligations on contracting parties to ensure energy efficient policies are co-ordinated among all the responsible authorities; to encourage the adoption of new methods and approaches for financing energy efficiency and energy related environmental protection investments; and to encourage commercial trade and co-operation in energy efficient and environmentally sound technologies.</P>
    <P>On competition, Deputy Gilmore expressed reservations.  The customer must come first.  I am committed to competition for industrial and domestic consumers.  Natural gas is the cleanest and most environmentally friendly fossil fuel.  While the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has the lead role in relation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Minister for Public Enterprise has a major contribution to make to national policy in that area.  The exploitation of gas reserves is a matter for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, to whom I will convey the Deputy's comments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised the matter of pipe laying. I took this issue up with BGE after it was raised in the Seanad.  BGE has informed me that while a degree of inconvenience to the public during street works is inevitable, it endeavours to keep this to a minimum by providing suitable notification of works to adjacent residents and business owners, setting agreed standards and monitoring the performance of its contractors. BGE is aware that a uniformly high standard of reinstatement and site husbandry is not always achieved during construction operation undertaken on its behalf but it has assured me that steps are taken to rectify the matter where its contractors under perform.  A high standard of operation is required for all gasworks.</P>
    <P>For logistical reasons it is not always practicable to lay a permanent reinstated surface over excavations at the end of a day's work.  In such cases temporary &ldquo;delay set&rdquo; macadam is laid to secure the excavation which is replaced with a permanent reinstated surface as soon as conditions allow.  BGE has taken note of adverse comments about this temporary surfacing and plans to keep its use to a minimum.  It has advised me that account should be taken of the fact that Telecom, Esat, the ESB, the local authorities etc. are extremely busy with ducting and pipe laying activities and that it has received complaints about problems which, on examination, were not caused by Bord Gáis.</P>

Continuous efforts are made to ensure this is achieved.  I share Deputy Gilmore's aspiration that the matter be addressed.  I will continue to raise it with BGE.  I said in the Seanad that one cannot make an ome-lette without breaking eggs.  Gas pipelines should be laid with great care and consideration for local people.</P>

In this respect it is very important that the ten year framework is reviewed annually to ensure transparency.  I raised the issue of connection charges versus tariffs. I understand the Minister of State is involved in a consultation process and has received submissions. Does he intend to become involved in a political process?

      <P>In page 10, after line 51, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) the company may, subject to subsection (4), issue shares from time to time as part of one or more employee profit sharing schemes subject to such terms and conditions as may be approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>(4) the aggregate amount of shares of the company standing issued at any one time as part of one or more profit sharing schemes shall not exceed 15 per cent of the total issued share capital of the company.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> This amendment adds two subsections to section 9 and provides for an employee share ownership or shareholding option.  The Minister indicated she would examine this matter between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  It is in line with current thinking and it does not place any compulsion on the Minister or the shareholder, but provides for the possibility of a shareholding option in the company in legislative form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  We discussed this matter on Committee Stage and the Minister was in favour of it in principle.  Deputy Stagg made the point that if there was no legal provision for it, even though the Minister might favour it, it would require separate legislation. The Minister said it was provided for somewhere else.  In view of the Telecom Éireann experience and international experience, this proposal should be supported.  The amendment provides for profit sharing schemes of up to 15 per cent, but it could be a smaller amount.  The net point that needs to be clarified is that if this matter is not agreed now, the Minister must tell us where else in the legislation this can be provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  Greg Sparks wrote eloquently about that in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last Friday and there will be a further chapter from Deputy Dukes next Friday, which will be <Col N="751" /> interesting.  I fully agree with ESOP, employee share ownership, but I cannot include it in this Bill.  As I said on Committee Stage, this is not the vehicle for it and I still hold that view.  Deputy Yates asked if it cannot be included in this Bill when and where will it be provided for.  An Aer Lingus ESOP and a Telecom ESOP could be provided by way of amending legislation.  That is what happened in regard to Telecom.  ESOP was included as a principle in the 1996 Bill introduced by the Labour Party and it could be provided for in legislation on Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to convert Aer Rianta from its present status to PLC status.  I give a firm commitment that the Government is in favour of ESOP.  I am sure other Governments will also favour it because it is seen as a most useful conduit for modernisation and participation in the fullest sense.  I suggest the compact for constructive partnership, which has facilitated significant changes and harmonious work, could be the setting or the ambience against which talks could begin in that regard.  I repeat the commitment I gave to the trade union and which I followed up by correspondence.  The Government and I are committed to ESOP.  We look forward to the dialogue I hope will ensue in the company under the compact for constructive participation and to bringing forward this matter.  I hope I will be Minister in charge when that happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's response because during the debate on Committee Stage amendments I felt she would propose her own amendment.  The Bill is suitable for the inclusion of such a measure.  It does everything else, including setting up the board.  Perhaps the Minister will explain why it is not suitable and why it cannot be done in the Bill.  Paying lip service to ESOPs&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a good opportunity for the Minister to follow through on that.  The ESOP in Telecom Éireann, which the Minister continues to speak about and which I congratulate her on completing, was practically a <i>fait accompli</i> when she began dealing with it.  It was a matter of tidying up the loose ends.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an opportunity to do something new in a different area in the context of ESOPs and I am very disappointed she is saying this is not a suitable vehicle in which to do something. Will the Minister explain why it is not suitable?</P>

      <P>The talks on this have not begun.  I hope they will begin and I give full support to their commencement and the ongoing management of the Compact Talks for Constructive Participation.  I feel strongly that the way ahead for semi-State companies is through ESOP as part of an overall examination of semi-State companies.  Regarding what Deputy Stagg said, nothing had been concluded on ESOP.  He spoke about it being tidied up, but in fact it had faltered. There is no point in discussing the matter as the freedom of information legislation will show exactly the stage it was at and the ideological hump that developed from which there was to be no movement.  Things did not work out, even during the last desperate hours in Kerry when Deputy Spring sought to intervene with Deputy Dukes.  That is the nature of politics and I am not complaining about it.</P>

We ran into exactly the same difficulties as the previous Government except that we flexed up.  Talks between management and employees have not yet begun on the matter, but when they do and reach a certain stage they will come to me for further discussions.  I am sure this is the way forward.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 2 and 3, to delete &ldquo;as soon as practicable following the commencement of this Act&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and which shall be the 1st day of September, 1998&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure a definite starting date for the commencement of the legislation. The purpose of the Bill is to change the financial and legal framework of Aer Rianta from being an agent of the Minister to being a private limited company.</P>
      <P>It is most important that vesting day occurs before duty free sales are abolished.  The Government's campaign on duty free sales has run into the sand following the ECOFIN meeting of 19 May.  That is regrettable but the agency most affected by that decision will be Aer Rianta.  A bad practice has developed of setting imprecise vesting dates for the commencement of legislation.  However, the vesting day of this Bill is the date on which Aer Rianta will be hit by the triple whammy of paying rates and corporation tax, paying for the assets for which it has already borrowed and paid and paying a dividend, similar to what it has always paid, to the State.  This will cost the company about £30 million extra, which is probably the real object of the legislation, and it is better that it should happen this year rather than next year when the fourth undercut &mdash; the abolition of duty free sales &mdash; occurs.</P>
      <P>A vesting date of 1 September offers a reasonable period for the company to get its affairs in order and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Save as authorised by the following subsection, the Minister shall not transfer or alienate any of his or her shares in the company.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not have the right to transfer or alienate his or her shares in the company without legislative authority.  When this issue was discussed on Committee Stage, the Minister said the authority already existed in the Bill.  She and I had an argument about this because she would not point out where it was included in the Bill.  I have failed to find it and others whom I asked to examine the Bill also failed to find it.  There is nothing specific in the legislation.  If there is, I will be happy to withdraw the amendment.  If not, it is an important issue that should be addressed in a legislative manner.  Perhaps the Minister will expand on her remarks on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on Committee Stage that the nature of the controls imposed on Aer Rianta in the Bill meant that any future plan to sell shares would have to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I also gave a commitment to give further clarification of the matter on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advice I received confirms my remarks on Committee Stage.  The key point is that the level of State control acts as a deterrent to the sale of shares.  The Bill is silent on the express issue of the sale of shares in Aer Rianta by the Minister for Finance or on the company issuing shares to a third party.  However, as was found to be the case with regard to Telecom Éireann, it would be impossible for the Minister for Finance to sell shares in Aer Rianta without first adopting amending legislation with regard to the extensive range of ministerial controls on the company. Nobody with an interest in acquiring shares in <Col N="757" /> Aer Rianta would purchase such shares while existing legislation provided for the level of ministerial control contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will recall that, as Minister of State, he introduced amending legislation in 1996 with regard to Telecom Éireann.  That legislation permitted the acquisition of a strategic partner, changed the composition of the board with regard to worker directors and facilitated the ESOP arrangement.  I am assured that a proposed sale of shares in Aer Rianta would have to be brought before the Houses.  It could not happen otherwise because existing legislation would not permit it. Nobody could acquire the shares while they are held by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is still non-specific about where there are powers to prevent the sale of the shares without reference to the House.  The legislation permits the establishment of subsidiary companies by Aer Rianta.  Subsidiary companies could be set up to run Cork, Dublin and Shannon Airports and it is possible to sell such subsidiaries, as was seen in the case of TEAM Aer Lingus and Cablelink, without reference to the House. They can simply be put on the market and sold.</P>
      <P>I wish to ensure that if there is a decision to sell Dublin Airport to a private operator in the future, the Minister will have to seek the approval of the House for that decision.  If the House so decides, that will be the expression of the will of the people.  At present the Minister could put the various sectors, including the core activities of the company, into subsidiaries and subsequently sell the subsidiaries.  I am not suggesting that is the Minister's intention, but I want to ensure some malign Minister in the future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy raised two issues, Aer Rianta and the subsidiaries.  In regard to Cablelink, movement towards the sale of that company by Telecom Éireann was started by Deputy Dukes and we picked up on that.  He had encouraged Telecom to either invest or divest, neither of which it did, but that is being done now.  On Aer Rianta, the power of control vested in Aer Rianta legislation would not allow shares to be sold.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of all semi-State bodies, it would have to come back to the Dáil. It is the subsidiaries that are in question.  Amendment No. 6 seeks to ensure that shares of a subsidiary &mdash; the Deputy referred to Cablelink and TEAM &mdash; carrying on a principal object of the company shall not be sold.  Aer Rianta carries on its principal objectives, the management of State airports.  Ministerial approval would be needed to establish a subsidiary and transfer a principal function of the company to that subsidiary.  The company, therefore, cannot dispose of its airports, as suggested by the Deputy.  If Aer Rianta, through its subsidiary, Aer Rianta International, purchased and managed an airport at Dusseldorf, Birmingham or elsewhere, the Deputy's amendment would have the effect of preventing the company from disposing of that investment, which is an overseas investment.  Aer Rianta would become a company that could accommodate airports abroad but could not dispose of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that subsidiaries may be set up and that any part of the core activity or otherwise of the company may be transferred to that subsidiary.  Without reference to the Dáil and without legislative requirement, the Minister could sell that company.  I want to ensure that is not possible, that legislation will be required before Shannon, Cork or Dublin airports could be sold.  In the case of TEAM, it had to go through all the channels, but legislation was not brought before the House to sell either TEAM or Cablelink.  I want to ensure legislation would be required and the proposal would be dealt with in detail before the Dáil if Dublin, Shannon or Cork airports were put up for sale. In regard to TEAM, while the Minister was forthcoming in recent days on the issue, I would like to have had a debate on the desirability of the sale and legislation should have been passed to enable it to take place.  I intend to press the amendments on foot of what the Minister has said.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) In the first financial year the dividend shall not exceed the value of the assets transferred under section 14 of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue, which was debated on Committee Stage, is the most important financial aspect of the legislation from Aer Rianta's perspective.  I wish to ensure that in the first year compromise is reached on the dividend which would take into account that Aer Rianta would be asked to pay for its assets, for which it has already paid through borrowings, repayments and <Col N="760" /> depreciation.  Essentially this legislation was designed not to bring a financial windfall to the Exchequer, which would happen, but rather to change the corporate legal structure of the company. To avoid that happening, leaving aside that the company would be liable for rates to local authorities and corporation tax, to which it was not previously liable, the first year concession should be made.</P>
    <P>Given the debacle about duty free and the failure of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to even get a study not to speak of a derogation, which is bitterly disappointing and has negative ramifications for the company, I ask that this amendment be accepted.  The effect of amendments Nos. 7 and 8 would be to combine the dividend and asset requirement into one payment which would not exceed £14 million, the annual payment made in recent years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I had a three hour meeting with Prime Minister Aznar of Spain in Madrid on Monday, 25 May, last.  We discussed a broad range of European issues, including preparations for the forthcoming Cardiff Summit, the ongoing Agenda 2000 negotiations and bilateral relations between Ireland and Spain.  I took the opportunity to brief the Prime Minister on the Northern Ireland peace process and the passing of the two referenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be pleased to know it is a highly effective mechanism for bilateral contacts to resolve difficulties that may arise in that area and it is working extremely well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach outline to Prime Minister Aznar the details of the agreement concluded between Dublin, London and the parties in Northern Ireland and, if so, did he say if such <Col N="761" /> a modality could be applied to the problems in the Basque region of Spain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined the framework of the Agreement to him in detail.  The entire press conference, which was attended by large numbers, related to the problems in the Basque region and how they might relate to Northern Ireland.  I made is abundantly clear &mdash; I believe the Prime Minister agrees &mdash; that parallels cannot be drawn between the two conflicts.  I stated many times at the press conference that, like all other conflicts, Northern Ireland is unique and it is wrong to draw parallels.  More importantly, because the drift of the debate was that the Prime Minister should take an initiative in this regard, I made it abundantly clear that could not happen until all forms of violence ceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While the parallels between South Africa and Northern Ireland were not the same, South Africa was able to provide inspiration and courage to participants in Northern Ireland to go the extra mile.  Since Spain is an old friend of ours and many of us can empathise with the sentiments of some of the Basques, is this not an opportune time to consolidate our friendship and, with the assent of the people in the Basque region and Madrid, provide an opportunity for the people involved in the talks process in Northern Ireland to simply describe their experiences to the antagonists in the conflict in Spain?  As in the case of South Africa, it might be possible to reach a compromise similar to that which underpinned the success of the Good Friday Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to be careful on this matter.  Prime Minister Aznar has been dealing with a very difficult matter for a long time.  I am sure those involved could draw consolation from the agreements reached in South Africa and Ireland if there were no violence, but I do not want to even suggest that as long as the violence continues.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We also discussed the question of Irish citizens living in Spain who are evading justice here.  Earlier that day I visited Ireland House where, as the Deputy is probably aware, a member of the Garda Síochána is based.  He is involved in security arrangements and developments to foster a <Col N="762" /> better bilateral relationship between the two countries.  A number of people are evading the authorities and, while I have not discussed the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the authorities in Spain and the member of the Garda Síochána stationed there, believe this arrangement is working well.  From here on in, having developed the contacts and with the mechanism in place, with total co-operation from the Spanish police, we will see ongoing success.  Much contact has been built up in recent months on a few high profile cases.</P>

      <P>I wonder about the Taoiseach's enthusiasm for this committee because there is tangible evidence of many problems with regard to the 150 Spanish flagships which are registered in the UK.  Is the Taoiseach aware that in recent times the biggest fines in history, totalling £1 million, were imposed on 12 trawlers as a result of personnel from Irish naval vessels having boarded them.  The fines were imposed at Milford Haven.  Surely the Taoiseach is aware that his party is committed to seek a ban on such flagships. This is one of the issues he should be raising with that committee.</P>

We have a common position with Spain perhaps more so than with any other country, apart from Portugal.  The Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. Aznar, the Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr. Guterres, and I are trying to negotiate a common <Col N="765" /> position as best we can.  In particular, we went through the detail of our problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Common Agricultural Policy and our concerns arising from EU Agriculture Commissioner Fischler's report of 18 March.  We managed to develop close to a 100 per cent common position. We also went through the concerns on enlargement and what will happen up to 2006 and afterwards.</P>

      <Quest>the members of his Government, if any, who have made joint orders under section 12 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, assigning responsibility for the performance of functions in relation to cross-departmental matters to specified civil servants; if so, the matters, functions and Departments affected; the proposals, if any, being considered for making these orders in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of section 12 of the Act is to provide, as necessary, for the assignment by Ministers or Ministers of State of responsibility to civil servants for cross-departmental issues and the associated accountability arrangements.  The Act also requires, at official level, that the heads of Departments and offices ensure that appropriate arrangements are put in place to facilitate an effective response to these issues.</P>
      <P>Orders have not so far been made under section 12 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997.  However, I am advised that, to support him in his role, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children, Deputy Fahey, intends to make an order establishing a cross-departmental team of senior civil servants from his Department and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Education and Science.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the strategy statements of Departments and offices, which were prepared for the first time under the 1997 Act, were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by 1 May.</P>
      <P>I am arranging that these statements of Departments and offices now be reviewed to identify key cross-departmental issues and the appropriate arrangements to address them.  The question of making orders under section 12 will be considered further in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Taoiseach has been extraordinarily busy with matters of State, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland, but the revelation he has put on the record of the House is a scandal.  He has misled the House in <Col N="766" /> his suggestion that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, has been given cross-departmental responsibility for a number of matters on foot of reconsideration, following initiatives made by the previous Government led by Deputy John Bruton, where it was necessary to address a particular issue by giving responsibility in a number of different Departments.  The Public Service Management Act, 1997, which I introduced, made explicit legal powers available for the assignment of a departmental official in Department X to responsibilities under Department Y. I am shocked by the Taoiseach's revelation.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the statement made by the Taoiseach on the allocation of additional responsibilities to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, the necessary orders have not been made under section 12 and not one public servant has been assigned cross-departmental responsibilities under section 4.  I do not wish to be antagonistic, but has the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for Finance, looked at this Act?  Is he not aware that all public servants must answer to the Accounting Officer and Secretary General in each Department and that the effectiveness of announcing in this House some months ago that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, had cross-departmental responsibilities has been made null and void as a result of what he put on the record of the House today?</P>

      <P>The announcement about the additional duties of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, was done under the orders put before the Cabinet.  That was a Cabinet decision with orders from each of the relevant Departments.  I am well aware of this Act as I brought it into effect on 1 September 1997 rather than in the spring of 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the process of identifying cross-departmental opportunities involves detailed work?  With all due respect to the staff of the Department of the Taoiseach, for whom I have the utmost regard, they do not have the detailed knowledge of individual micro-areas for opportunity or co-operation between individual Departments.  They do not have that experience and to pretend that they do is foolish.  Surely the public expenditure division of the Department of Finance, which has an efficiency responsibility, should be involved with the Department of the Taoiseach in identifying areas for co-operation? Is it not the case that this division has detailed knowledge of the operations of public expenditure in every nook and cranny of Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct but, as a former Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton should know that someone must take the lead in trying to co-ordinate matters.  The officials in my Department work in conjunction with other Departments.  If it was left to the public expenditure division of the Department of Finance, I am not sure it would receive the relevant priority because it has a different focus.  A small number of people in my Department are trying to drive the strategy statements and SMI process forward. They do not have all the knowledge but at least they have the authority to push the process forward. If nobody does this work, nothing will happen. As the Deputy is aware, it is not an easy task to get the Departments to co-operate in these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it would be a far better approach to set up a cross-departmental team under the SMI and the legislation in his Department and the Department of Finance to drive this process forward?  Does he also agree that he should use the instruments under the legislation to create new instruments <Col N="768" /> for co-operation between other Departments rather than attempting to have this job done in the Department of the Taoiseach which does not have the staff or the range of detailed knowledge necessary to put the detailed arrangements in place?  That is not a criticism of the staff of that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that is not a criticism. An interdepartmental committee and a management group, which represents eight Departments, have been established to drive this process forward. The structure is in place.  The detailed strategy statements will be laid before the House and I am sure people will be impressed by them.  We are now on the fourth stage and we need someone to drive it forward.  My officials will use available people, the interdepartmental committee and the implementation group to ensure this happens. It is one thing to introduce legislation and publish strategy statements, but it is another thing to implement it.  That is the next phase.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The time taken to prepare a Bill in the office of the parliamentary draftsman depends on a number of interrelated factors. These include the length, nature and complexity of the proposal in question, the urgency accorded to the proposal in the Government's legislative <Col N="769" /> programme, the instructions given by the sponsoring Department and the extent to which Departments are in a position to respond to queries or issues arising during the drafting and the existing workload of the office.

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Has the Government made any effort to ensure that a trained person is appointed in each Department to liaise with the Attorney General's office and the parliamentary draftsman's office so that there is adequate pre-legislative planning in the drafting of legislation?  Has that proposal been implemented, and, if so, in what Departments? What is its present status and state of play?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the proposal.  It is one with which I strongly agree and had it developed in a few Departments.  It has not been implemented in all Departments but I will certainly continue to drive it.  It has been implemented in Revenue, the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children, Environment and Local Government and in most of the main Departments.  It is an extremely desirable proposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That Department has over 30 legislative measures and the problem is that there is always so much legislation and litigation on hand because of the nature of the Department. There are many staff in the Department who could do that type of work but they are forever tied up in other work.  In fairness to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as it has done in recent years, it deals very quickly with specific Bills but may not be as successful as it should be on all Bills.  This is due to the volume of legislation but the officials do a tremendous job.  It is our aim to continue to have the proposal implemented in all Departments.  The more work that can be done of a preparatory nature, cross referencing and so on, while it will still have to go to a parliamentary draftsman, the quicker we will get through the legislative measure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn will be aware of the long-term problem, the shortage of parliamentary draftspeople across the world and particularly in this country.  Even when they are trained they move on so it is a continuing problem.  It takes about three years to train a parliamentary draftsman to a useful level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time to consider the decentralisation or the extension of the staffing arrangements to all Government Departments in a manner not dissimilar to that which operated when the Government Information Service had a centralised <Col N="770" /> service with spokespersons for Departments being located in the GIS and not in the Department.  When the Taoiseach was last in Government a decision was taken to decentralise and each Government Department took on its own information officer service who had a knowledge of cross-departmental activities and the interdepartmental activities in each Department. Is it time to formally ensure each Government Department has a legal officer who would prepare the draft of documentation in a quasi draft legal parliamentary format which, when it goes to the parliamentary draftsman's office, would be capable of more speedy dispatch, because that is part of the problem?  Will the Government give consideration to that suggestion?  The Government will not meet its legislative programme given that it is running so far behind.  We were trying to be helpful earlier today on the Order of Business.  The Government is heading for legislative paralysis unless something is done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to answer the question but before the Deputy gets carried away, the only paralysis we might hit is time.  Every day we have seen people scrambling because there is so much legislation.  The House has already been sitting late for several weeks and, if the Whips agree, it now looks as if there will be Friday sittings.  All the committees are bogged down in legislation. We are trying to force extra time slots for the committees to meet.  I have been urged by Opposition leaders, including the Deputy, to try to force the chairmen to allocate more time. Recently I have been forced to allocate time slots to the chairmen and say they have to take them because there is so much work.  I am afraid that part of the Deputy's question is incorrect.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view in terms of his analysis in that the more work that can be done on a decentralised basis the better.  The Deputy's suggestion of formally doing that would have to be considered by the Attorney General.  Given the way our system operates, the Attorney General is the law officer and all legislation has to come back to him.  Parliamentary draftspeople, and this has been proved over the years because of the number of challenges to legislation that end up in litigation in one form or another, have to cross reference it.  If they get it in a form that makes that process quicker I am in favour of it. If there is some way in which that could be formalised I would be in favour of it but at the end of the day the decentralisation process must come back and be checked rigorously by the parliamentary draftsman.  I have experience of how much time could be saved.</P>

The work was franchised out and <Col N="771" /> checked in the final form.  That is ideal for consolidation Bills.  Consolidation Bills, while difficult, are only consolidating.  We are not trying to go back over many of our legislative measures as we do here every day.  We are still referring back to the 1750 legislation.  I do not believe the expertise for that work would be in a Department, it would only be in the Attorney General's office.</P>

      <P>The first results from the quarterly national household survey were issued at noon yesterday by the Central Statistics Office.  These results summarise the labour force situation in the three months period September to November 1997.  Copies of the CSO statistical release have now been laid before the House.</P>
      <P>The quarterly national household survey, which was launched last September, is a continuous survey covering 3,000 households per week throughout the year and has been designed to replace the annual labour force survey.  A full report on the April 1997 labour force survey was published in October last year.</P>
      <P>While the production of the first results from the quarterly national household survey is approximately one month behind target, it nevertheless compares favourably with the timeliness of the labour force survey results.  This is particularly the case when account is taken of the scale of the task in getting the new surveys successfully under way over a relatively short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next quarterly national household survey report, which will cover the next two quarters, is <Col N="772" /> planned for October this year.  The Central Statistics Office expects to be in a position early next year to issue quarterly reports within three months of the end of the reference quarter.</P>

      <P>Has the attention of the Minister of State been drawn to comments published in today's newspapers by the head of the CSO about the teething troubles of this whole exercise and the one month delay in publishing statistics?  The value of statistics is precisely that they are up-to-date. As Chief Whip and as Minister of State in the Taoiseach's Department with responsibility for the CSO does he intend to meet the head of the CSO to discuss the problems which the Chief Executive of the CSO has placed on record?  Can he give an assurance there will not be a month's delay in the publication of further quarterly reports?</P>

      <P>I am aware of what has been said.  I will meet the senior officials in the CSO.  I had a meeting yesterday with quite senior officials in the CSO and they pointed out there are teething troubles.  As the Deputy is aware, there was an annual labour survey on which both the previous Government and this Government have worked.  We have now changed from an annual labour force survey to a rolling survey whereby 3,000 houses per week are visited by the CSO.  Instead of annual figures we now have quarterly figures.  On average 39,000 houses are visited every quarter.  The figures produced are those at the mid-point of the quarter.  These figures are produced from October.  While there are teething troubles they are being overcome.  I congratulate the staff of the Central Statistics Office for their enthusiasm for the quarterly national household survey.  It will provide much valuable information, some of which is reported on in today's newspapers.  It shows increases in the labour force, increased participation by women in the labour force, a reduction in the number of students and so on.  Until now this information was available only once a year.  It will be very valuable and I will meet the CSO.  They have assured me that as the quarters go on, they get the information out in a more timely fashion.</P>

Is it his intention in attending Cabinet to bring to the attention of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs with responsibility, among other things, for the live register the discrepancy between two sets of figures?  Today's figures show that 171,000 people are unemployed yet the live register figures, which are not a measure of unemployment but of the number of people signing on for unemployment benefit or assistance, show a figure of approximately 230,000.  In other words, there is a gap of 60,000 people in absolute terms.  Is it the intention of the Minister of State to bring this statistical gap to the attention of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs?</P>

      <P>I will discuss the matter again with the Minister but, like previous Ministers for Social Welfare, including Deputy Woods, he is well aware that there is a problem.  It has been discussed in the House many times.  There is a statistical gap between those who draw benefit and those who describe themselves as being available for work when asked the question in a survey. Interestingly, that gap has been closed by these recent quarterly figures and I am told that as the quarters roll on, we should be in a position to bring those two figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to do with how people describe their situation when asked to do so in a survey.  For example, a feature of the quarterly survey over the annual survey has been that when people were pressed and visited more regularly, they began to take the view that they might now be available for work.  An interesting aspect is the number of people who now describe themselves as being available for part-time work, which has increased dramatically, whereas in annual surveys they did not volunteer that information.  We are getting more accurate information as a result of these quarterly figures and the gap between the live register figures and the quarterly survey has begun to close, but more work will have to be done to reconcile the figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the recent UK court decisions which imposed severe fines for fishing offences by flagships in Irish and UK waters.  The outcome is a clear demonstration of the practical benefits of co-operation on fisheries enforcement between member states and I commend the Department's sea fisheries inspectorate and the Naval Service for their important contribution in getting this result.  The clear message emanating from these court proceedings, and the co-operative approach which underpinned the outcome, is that illegal fishing will not be tolerated. The Irish and UK Governments are at one on this.</P>
      <P>Our own fisheries protection services at sea and on land are co-operating closely to ensure that fisheries protection in the Irish zone operates with maximum effectiveness to reduce and eliminate illegal fishing.</P>
      <P>I have been pressing hard to get better co-operation from other member states on fisheries enforcement and to ensure a level playing field for all EU fishermen.  I have raised the particular enforcement difficulties associated with flagships with my UK and Spanish colleagues at every opportunity and I will continue to pursue the matter actively with the Commission and bilaterally. I will raise the outcome of the recent UK court cases directly with my UK and Spanish counterparts as well as with Commissioner Bonino. I will underline strongly to them that, from each of their perspectives, there is an imperative to deliver continued co-operation to ensure rigorous inspection and control of flagships at sea and on land.  This is essential in order to back up Ireland's endeavours as the coastal state most directly affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but is this not the tip of the iceberg?  We are talking about £1 million in fines and 13 vessels boarded by the Irish Naval Service, which is to be congratulated, but the court in Haverfordwest described these cases as the worst example of over-fishing ever to have been detected.  We are talking about in excess of 150 flagships.  These were random boardings which led to subsequent fines of £1 million on vessels registered in the UK, operating in Irish waters and sailing back to La Corun a in Spain.  The Taoiseach indicated earlier that the special liaison committee on the <Col N="775" /> fisheries issue put in place by the former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, is working effectively. What discussions have taken place to date between the Minister and the Spanish Government with regard to seeking to ban flagships? That promise was made to fishermen prior to the last general election.  It was advertised in a particular paper by a fisheries group indicating that people should support Fianna Fáil on the basis of such promises.  Does the Minister seriously intend to seek the banning of flagships?  I would like him to come clean on this particular issue because it is pertinent in regard to over-fishing in Irish waters and makes a mockery of the European common fisheries policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, I pressed this matter both at the Council and individually with the Ministers concerned.  The co-operation which led to these charges has been successful and we plan to continue that.  There are certain weaknesses in the system.  We now have tight inspection procedures at Irish ports, as well as at sea. That is also the case to a large extent in the UK. Nevertheless, when these ships return to Spain it is clear there is difficulty in providing the level of inspection we provide here.  That is a serious matter from our point of view.  Irish ships also land in Spain with whitefish.  From 1 July we will have the opportunity to carry out real time checks on quantities on board vessels.  That is a major step forward and one to which I encouraged the Council of Ministers to agree.  It is a major improvement because we will be in a position to check the quantities on entering and leaving a particular area.  That will strengthen our hand in exercising control.  I agree with the Deputy that there must be better controls and we need co-operation from Ministers in other countries.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the quantities involved in some of these cases.  It would be wrong to think that all the penalties relate to that size of additional catch &mdash; the records show that many vessels have smaller additional quantities on board &mdash; or that they were imposed for some other irregularity.  I am including in that Irish vessels caught for such irregularities.  Notwithstanding that, the courts applied the penalties which, as the Deputy stated, were substantial &mdash; £1 million in total.  Nevertheless, we are coming to the time when we will want to give consideration to the revoking of licences which is an administrative, rather than a court, action.  They are two separate issues.  One is the imposition of penalties, which can be substantial as it can involve the impounding of gear, by the courts.  The other is on the administrative side.  In some of these extreme cases, it is time to give a clear warning that such excesses will not be tolerated.  In a meeting with Minister Cunningham in Britain shortly, I plan to state clearly that it is time warning was given that licences will be revoked if this kind of excess occurs again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Minister of the quantities involved.  We are talking about 12 vessels, repeated offences and the random boarding of these vessels.  It is worth bearing in mind that they exceeded the monkfish quota by 250,000 kilograms. There were 361,000 kilograms of illegal hake and illegal anglerfish.  That is a random example.  Surely if there are 150 flagships involved, those quantities of fish caught are only the tip of the iceberg?</P>
      <P>In a parliamentary question on 31 March, Deputy McManus asked about the Government's commitment <i>vis-à-vis</i> the banning of flagships. The Minister did not respond to that specific issue again today.  If it is no longer a foreseeable objective, at least the Minister should be honest and say so rather than have us table that question again in three months.  While I admit the Minister is going in the right direction when he speaks of revoking licences, desperate diseases need desperate remedies.  Our fisheries are being ravaged by the Spaniards.  What will be left to Irish fishermen in future will be minimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Effectively, the revocation of the licence would ban such a flagship if that was the case.  I would generally accept that it is not a fair and even playing pitch and that excessive quantities are taken by a proportion of the boats. However, the prosecutions and investigations which are carried out &mdash; a large number of vessels are boarded by the Naval Service &mdash; would not bear that out.  I am not disagreeing with the Deputy that there are vessels fishing to excess, but the numbers of such vessels which are boarded and caught is not high.  A proportion of the vessels are engaging in this activity.  The vessels which are boarded are of Irish as well as of Spanish and other origin.  Quite a large number of Irish vessels are boarded and they receive penalties also.</P>
      <P>The major problem is the one of huge excesses which the Deputy cited.  That is bringing us to the point where we must look at the administrative arrangements for the revocation of licences which will effectively ban the vessels which are causing major problems.  That is of most interest to people and it is the policy I will be pursuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to allay the Deputy's concerns about the status of the Irish Box in the EU <Col N="777" /> fisheries policy and under EU law.  Maintenance and recognition of the Irish Box is enshrined in Community legislation.  The existing arrangements which apply to the area are not up for renegotiation or for reopening under the CFP review in 2002.  Therefore, they are ringfenced and safeguarded.</P>
      <P>Political and legal recognition of the sensitive nature of the Irish Box was negotiated successfully by Ireland in the 1994 Council agreement on the integration of Spain and Portugal into the CFP.  While it did not exist previously, that was negotiated and ringfenced at that time.  This agreement was given legal effect in Council Regulation 685 of 1995.  The arrangements totally exclude Spanish vessels from certain parts of the box &mdash; that is, the Irish Sea &mdash; and allow access to 40 named Spanish vessels into other parts of the box based on existing effort levels.  All fishing vessels over 15 metres have been obliged since 1 January 1996 to report to Ireland on entering and exiting the box.  The entry/exit reporting regime will be critically expanded and enhanced by the introduction of real time catch reporting from 1 July next.  Under existing arrangements, they have to report when they enter and exit.  From 1 July next they must also report their catch on entry and on exiting.  That will greatly facilitate subsequent inspections.  The Irish Box, therefore, is a component both politically and legally of EU fisheries policy.</P>
      <P>There are three specific legal provisions in the 1992 Common Fisheries Policy Regulation which must be decided upon by the Council before the end of 2002: first, access to waters within the 12 mile limit; second, the rules applying to the Shetland Box; and, third, arrangements for access to the North Sea for vessels from Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Finland.  The first of these issues is obviously of direct concern to Ireland.  In the absence of an explicit Council decision, the rule restricting access to waters within the 12 mile limit will disappear.  However, no member state will want to concede such access and the Commission has already publicly stated that it does not see any appetite for change to the <i>status quo</i> on this issue.  We will certainly wish to secure embodiment in the CFP regulation of the six and 12 mile limits.</P>
      <P>There are of course many aspects of the CFP which need improvement, in some cases radical improvement.  Every opportunity will continue to be taken to advance Ireland's case for the equitable share of the EU fish quota.  Fisheries management, regulation enforcement and marketing aspects also require review and enhancement, some of which is under way already.  The continuing difficulties with flagships point to the need to look at how the review might be used to address the inconsistency underlying the quota regime which allows flagships to benefit from national quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the CFP review is four and a half years away, I consider it essential to begin the strategic process of preparing the national position <Col N="778" /> now.  I will be establishing shortly a national CFP strategy group involving all key players, including the industry.  The group will consult, develop and advise on national objectives and strategies.  I want to bring together and use to best effect all relevant expertise to inform our national negotiating position in the run up to the review.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for that detailed reply.  It seems to specifically indicate there is no possibility that the existing arrangements, which will apply up to 2002, will be altered in the meantime.  What concerns the industry is that we should commence discussions with the relevant EU people at Commission level in relation to what will happen after that.  I am glad the Minister intends to do this without further delay.  Will the Minister state that it is not possible to change existing arrangements up to 2002 and that it is his intention to at least hold on to the arrangements we have and to endeavour, on behalf of the industry, to improve on that from 2002 to 2006?</P>

      <P>It depends on the negotiations and on the interests of those countries.  It is something that will have to be followed very closely in the negotiating period.  We have seen what happened as different countries joined the EU and special arrangements were made. There were very special difficulties when Spain and Portugal joined.  That is something we will have to look at very closely and it will be a matter for negotiation.  Theoretically they could lay claim to a share of all the fisheries and that would be a greater problem.  If they are interested, or if they are fishing in the first instance, we will have to be prepared to negotiate our position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Licensing of sea fishing vessels is governed by section 222B (as amended) of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  The key objective of licensing policy is to ensure the conservation and rational exploitation of available fish stocks by the fleet, consistent with Ireland's legal obligations under the Common Fisheries Policy in relation to fleet capacity, fishing effort and conservation parameters.  The setting and implementation of transparent and equitable licensing rules and regulations to underpin policy is an ongoing objective in its own right.</P>
      <P>The principles and criteria of sea fishing licensing policy have been publicly articulated on frequent occasions in replies to questions in the House, responses to particular inquiries and in other public statements.  It is the basic requirement of fishing boat licensing policy, reflecting mandatory EU fleet policy, that a licence may only be granted for the introduction of a new vessel to the fishing fleet where the applicant has undertaken to remove capacity at least equal to the tonnage and engine power of the boat to be introduced.  Another key licensing policy requirement is that an applicant must provide demonstrable proof of the safety and seaworthiness of any boat proposed for introduction to the fleet.</P>
      <P>While I believe that the current licensing procedures and criteria are generally understood by the fishing sector, I plan to publish shortly comprehensive guidelines on the licensing process, procedures and criteria.  These will fully reflect the spirit and intent of our commitment to freedom of information and quality customer service and will set out all the policy considerations which are taken into account in granting fishing licences.  I am fully committed to ensuring that there is transparency in relation to licensing policy and procedures and that fishermen have confidence in the process.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has consistently stated that the issue of licensing is a private matter for the Department.  The Minister has spoken about transparency but in issuing sea licences the Minister should act in the public interest.  It should not be a private matter.  Could the Minister not consider a system such as operates within the Department of Tourism and Trade where there is an independent product committee?  Such a committee, even if the Minister was involved, would be far more open and transparent.  We understand the parameters under which licences <Col N="780" /> are granted, but a cloak of secrecy surrounds the issue.  If the Minister meant what he said in December last about transparency, if he really means what he says today about transparency, it is necessary to change the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy in relation to the desirability of making the whole system transparent.  There are technical elements which do not help transparency.  One of the main arguments relates to the measurements themselves and the conventions under which they are made.  That is all the more reason it is necessary to be explicit and transparent.  I take on board the point made by the Deputy regarding open involvement in the process.  There may be some merit in having a form of independent advisory committee to advise the Minister on this area, and to have people of high repute involved in such a committee so that it can be clearly seen to represent the public interest and to be open as to criteria.  There are many arguments about this, I have made some arguments about it myself.  An individual may say he cannot understand what is happening in relation to his case, but the deeper one goes into it the more technical it becomes. Therefore, much work is required to make it clear.  That is what I intend to do in the first instance by producing a document which will set out such criteria and how they will be implemented.  It may be necessary to go further than that and to make sure that Ireland has a licensing system which is fair to our own fishermen, because some countries seem to adopt a less rigorous approach to the detail of the licensing system.  The systems exist and they can be compared. They look similar, but when one gets down to the detail one finds that different kinds of decisions are being made.  It needs to be looked at broadly but I will try to hurry up my activity in that area.</P>

      <Quest>when he will provide funding for the £15 million development plan for Castletownbere fishery port, County Cork in view of the fact the proposal was submitted to his Department in September 1997.</Quest>

      <P>The Castletownebere users committee submitted a consultancy report last September outlining development proposals for the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre.  This was a very useful first step in quantifying and assessing the infrastructural needs at Castletownbere. It was agreed that further detailed analysis of the needs of the fishing industry and the development options were required.  Accordingly, the Department agreed to commission a detailed technical assessment of the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre which would inform and underpin future investment decisions. <Col N="781" /> In January 1998, following a tendering process, I appointed Coopers &amp; Lybrand management consultants to undertake a comprehensive cost benefit analysis of the infrastructural requirements at Castletownbere to service the fishing and processing sectors and other downstream industries.  The consultants were mandated to recommend appropriate investment and development strategies on foot of their analysis.  The consultants have been engaged in considerable research on the ground and have met local interests to determine their priorities for the development of the port.  I expect to receive the completed report next month.  I will make the report available to the Castletownbere port users and other interested parties with a view to getting their response and feedback on the proposals.  I will make the report available to spokespersons and other interested Deputies.  Future funding decisions will be fully informed by the report and the consultative process.  I have already signalled to Government that I will pursue funding for development at Castletownbere and other major fishery harbours in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state the priorities as regards the fishery port development plan for Castletownbere given that a comprehensive plan was submitted to the Department?  Was there any need for a further report from Coopers &amp; Lybrand?  The Minister has better information on that matter.  However, given that the Minister is committed to spending £20 million on the Killybegs port development project, will he make a similar commitment to the Castletownbere port development plan as it is one of the largest fishing ports in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is catching up.  The port users engaged John O'Donovan and Associates consultant engineers to produce development plans for the harbour.  That report was to produce an outline proposal on infrastructure and building projects.  It produced a recommendation for a development costing in the region of £15 million, excluding fees and VAT so the figure would not be far short of £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report recommends a number of further studies including a feasibility study to determine the viability and market prospects for the proposed development.  This was an engineering report and the authors suggested there should be a broader investigation.  The Coopers &amp; Lybrand study will look specifically at: sufficiency of berthage for existing and future fleet levels; developments in the Irish fleet and, in particular, the Castletownbere fleet; possible developments in the Common Fisheries Policy; dredge levels in the harbour and approaches; the existing and future levels of fish processing activity in the Castletownbere region; the levels of activity in ancillary <Col N="782" /> sectors such as chandlery and repair and the infrastructural options for development and costings associated with each of these options.  That study will give a comprehensive report on the harbour and its future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan mentioned Killybegs.  I have indicated that I plan to bring a number of proposals to Government in the near future as we have to take a serious look at some of our major harbours and their requirements.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the ice plant in Castletownbere is obsolete?  Will he also agree that spending £80,000 upgrading that plant is not a feasible solution and will he review the situation?  The plan submitted to him includes provision for a new ice plant to be constructed on Dinish island.  Will he make this his number one priority, even in the plan to be submitted by Coopers &amp; Lybrand?  This would be a major step in the development programme for the harbour. I agree that Coopers &amp; Lybrand have probably made a more comprehensive report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have already signalled to Government that I will pursue funding for a number of these developments. Unfortunately there are a number of ports.  These ports are becoming more important. We predicted this some years ago but it is happening now.  They are doing and will continue to do more business.  I am trying to get the message across that we must provide the infrastructure.

      <P>There are two aspects involved the first being EU funding.  Proposals are being put together for the next tranche of EU funding and I would wish to see Castletownbere included in the Minister's plans for any such proposals. I hope he will be able to give such an assurance to the House.  Even though the final report is not to hand he must be aware that there is a need for major investment and it is a worthwhile investment.  Second, the Minister has talked about pressing the Government.  In his own list of priorities does he accept that Castletownbere is one of the main priorities and must be funded from wherever the money comes?</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; after Duncannon and Killybegs. Obviously it is a priority.  I might have said &ldquo;after Union Hall&rdquo;.  Union Hall has done extremely well during the years.  Some believed it did not have a future.</P>

      <P>On the application for EU funding, the Deputy can take it that funding will be sought in the next round for Castletownbere and Killybegs. A number of other key ports require further development leading to job creation.  This is vital. In County Donegal where there has been substantial job creation in the hinterland any port which can contribute must be supported The leisure sector must also be developed.  The Deputy can take it that people in his neighbouring constituency are anxious to secure development.</P>

      <P>I am negotiating with the Commission my programme to deliver renewal of the whitefish fleet.  In addition to ongoing support for modernisation of existing vessels, my renewal programme involves a new capital grant aid scheme to support industry investment in new and modern second hand vessels.  The scheme will utilise available funding under the Operational Programme for Fisheries.  I secured in this year's Finance Act an exceptional package of tax incentives to attract additional much needed investment in the whitefish fleet.  I am confident this package will help to ensure the safety, competitiveness and long-term future of the whitefish fleet to support jobs and encourage growth.  I have underlined to Commissioner Bonino the importance of a speedy decision by the Commission whose approval is required from a state aid and fleet policy perspective.  I will be meeting her within the next two weeks and expect to be in a position to launch the package next month.</P>

Will the Minister agree that substantial grant packages are available in other member states, in particular Spain where provincial, regional, national and EU grants are available?  In some cases 60 per cent to 70 per cent grants are available.  Will he agree that a generous and attractive grant package should be available?

      <P>They can make use of funds provided under particular headings whenever an issue arises.  If funding was available which could be used to enhance the grants package, the Commission might suggest that it be used in dealing with other issues.  All that would be required is verbal approval.  Some member states have spare funds available and all they need to transfer them is Commission approval.  We are not in that happy position.  Any outstanding issues should be resolved fairly soon.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that I established the task force on the dumping of radioactive materials in the maritime area last year in the wake of revelations by the UK authorities that documents had come to light which showed that radioactive waste had been dumped in the Beaufort Dyke in the north Irish Sea during the 1950s.  Additional archival searches carried out by the UK authorities uncovered a number of other incidents of dumping during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, not just in the Beaufort Dyke but also at a number of other locations around the coast of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force is chaired by Nuala Butler, barrister, and includes representatives from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, University College Dublin, the Marine Institute, the <Col N="786" /> Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  It was asked to review and assess the information available on the dumping of radioactive materials in the maritime area and, based on this review, to advise on survey-monitoring and management measures to ensure maximum protection for our marine resources and restore public confidence in the quality of the marine environment.</P>
    <P>I understand that since its establishment the task force has carried out an examination of the archival material made available by the UK authorities concerning the dumping of radioactive material.  It has also conducted studies designed to assess the radiological implications of the dumped material.  I am advised that the preparation of the task force report is at an advanced stage and I expect to receive it in June.  As previously indicated, it is my intention to publish the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if the task force is addressing the issue of direct radioactive discharges from Sellafield into the Irish Sea?  Is he aware of the report published yesterday by Greenpeace which suggests the level of discharges from Sellafield into the Irish Sea are worse than they have ever been and the level of radioactivity in it is critically high?  Is the task force addressing those matters?  What steps is he taking as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to protect the Irish Sea from this level of radioactivity?  Will he agree Greenpeace's report has enormous consequences for the Irish Sea environment, the fishing industry there and people's concerns about the Irish Sea as a resource and as a source of food?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is responsible for matters relating to dumping at sea, not for matters related to Sellafield.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, is directly responsible for matters related to Sellafield, the Department of Public Enterprise and the Radiological Protection Institute.  I am concerned with the secondary effects of anything that happens at Sellafield and its effect on marine life, our waters and shores.  I asked the task force to take that into consideration. I have not seen Greenpeace's report, but I am concerned about the questions it raises.  From reports I saw on the outfall from Sellafield, the area immediate to it is the prime one of major danger, particularly to marine life.  We examined the effect of the outfall and found it diminished as one travels away from it, but I do not know if there is further evidence on that aspect.  I asked the task force to closely examine that matter.  The Department of Public Enterprise, through the Radiological Protection Institute, continuously monitors the level of radioactivity in the water from the middle of the Irish Sea, where our responsibility begins, to our coastline.  Those figures and anything that is relevant will be included in the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat surprised at the Minister's reply.  He seems to rely on the division of functions as between himself and the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob.  Is the ministerial interdepartmental committee on Sellafield still functioning? Is the Minister a member of it?  Has it held meetings recently?  Is it co-ordinating the Government's response to the threat posed by Sellafield?  Has he sought information from the Radiological Protection Institute or the Marine Institute on the effect on marine life, particularly fish, of the discharges from Sellafield?  After all the years of talk about Sellafield, the level of radioactive discharges from that plant into the Irish Sea are now higher than they have ever been and are at an alarming level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to radioactive dumping in the Irish Sea.  A long pipe from the Sellafield plant is discharging radioactive material into the Irish Sea.  The Minister established a task force, but it is not clear if it is dealing with that important matter.  If it is not, it should be.  On foot of information that has become available in recent days, what action is the Minister taking to deal with that matter?  In what way is the Government co-ordinating action between his Department and other Departments that have a responsibility in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was a Minister of State in the area of the marine up until last June and is fully aware of all the elements involved.  The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is responsible for matters relating to dumping at sea.  The Department of Public Enterprise is responsible for matters related to Sellafield and energy.  The former Government had a Minister of State with specific responsibility for targeting that problem.  I can comment on many of these matters and I am generally aware of various matters in other Departments.  The normal procedure is that a specific question on Sellafield is tabled to the Minister for Public Enterprise, but one on dumping at sea is tabled to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.  I am answering questions on dumping at sea.  They relate specifically to dumping because they would not have been tabled to me if they did not.  From the point of view of the task force, I said I do not accept a division of responsibility that is absolute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outfall from Sellafield can affect marine life, the water and eventually the shoreline on this side of the Irish Sea.  I told the Deputy of my knowledge of that.  At the outfall it can effect marine life, but in previous studies any effects of the outfall that come across the Irish Sea to where there is <Col N="788" /> fishing on our side have been minimal.  I asked the task force to specifically examine that in great detail.  I do not understand how the Deputy can say he does not know whether the task force is examining that matter, when I said it was examining it.  I asked it specifically to examine it and I did that purposely because I am responsible for matters relating to dumping at sea.  There is a danger the outfall from Sellafield might not be considered.  For that reason I considered the effects of it on marine life, water, etc., had to be considered in the study being undertaken by the task force.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked about the interdepartmental committee.  There is such a committee, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, is chairman of it, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is a member of it and it is continuing to do its work.  If the Deputy had listened to the radio this morning, he would have heard the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, comment on it, which is his area of responsibility.  It is an area we will be closely monitoring.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, which is under the Department of Public Enterprise, constantly monitors the effects on the Irish side in the water and on beaches and marine life.  It produces substantial reports, abstracts from which will be included in the task force report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regard a nuclear wastepipe discharging material into the water, with evidence of contamination of the marine environment off the coast of England, Scotland and Wales and contamination of crabs, clams and seaweed, as a matter for his Department?

I have to work within that legislation.  The matter comes within the brief of the Minister for Public Enterprise.  I have tried to explain at some length my interpretation that if the outfall results in radioactive material entering the sea from Sellafield, then I must be concerned with it.</P>
      <P>The question concerned the work of the task force and whether the matter is being examined by it.  I have said the matter is being closely examined by it in accordance with my request.  The task force is examining the overall issue and I am confident the report will be substantial, fundamental and clearly scientifically based.  I asked it to carry out the examination even though Sellafield, <i>per se</i>, does not come within my area of responsibility.</P>

      <P>Why did the Minister not include Question No. 26 in his reply?  It deals with exactly the same subject.  In particular the question asks the Minister to indicate the outcome of his meeting with Dr. Jack Cunningham, an issue he very quickly responded to.  There is always some confusion <Col N="789" /> over which Minister is responsible for issues relating to Sellafield, a problem which has arisen today.  In view of the fact that Question No. 26 is relevant to what we are discussing, will the Minister tell us the outcome of his discussions with Dr. Jack Cunningham and whether he will be making an urgent effort to talk again with him in the context of the two Departments concerned with Sellafield having been clearly misled, as were the people who attended the conferences before the last election when British Nuclear Fuels told us a cock and bull story about what was happening? Will the Minister indicate whether there is a better way to monitor the system rather than waiting for Greenpeace and other organisations to send divers to investigate something we should be investigating?</P>

      <P>Regarding Question No. 26, I answer questions as they are associated in agreement with the House.  It has many similarities with the questions I am answering, but it relates particularly to the effects on the marine life of Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about Sellafield, but it is not specifically my area.  We are measuring the indirect effects of discharges.  Those in the Opposition who have served as Ministers will be aware that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is a very fine body with people of very high standing.  I know of their work over the years and it would be foolish to disregard it by comparison with any other work.  I strongly rely on the institute.</P>
      <P>I am very interested in the Greenpeace report. We are undertaking a comprehensive study on the effects of dumping and the indirect effects of Sellafield on marine life.  It is a thorough study being carried out by our best experts.  There is nothing shallow about it.  The RPII is continuously monitoring the position in the Irish Sea in relation to marine and shore life.  The outfall pipe of Sellafield is where Greenpeace concentrated its efforts.  There is clear information in the public domain regarding the position around that pipe. That information has been published and Dr. Jack Cunningham, the UK Secretary of State, has drawn attention to it.  It shows the difficulties in the area immediately around the outfall pipe and our people are very much aware of them.  I do not know the technical detail of the further claims being made by Greenpeace, but we will closely examine them, the effects on marine life and our responsibility in that context.  The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, is directly concerned with this issue and is following it up.  Assisting him is the RPII which comes under the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>

If not, will the recommendations be used as evidence in the court case being taken by STAD, the Dundalk residents against Sellafield?</P>

      <P>The first thing to be done with the report is to make sure it is properly analysed so that we know exactly what we are talking about and where it fits into the overall picture.  I will meet Dr. Jack Cunningham who has been very co-operative and has provided much information which has been used by the task force.  The need to raise the matter at the Intergovernmental Conference is a matter which the Taoiseach will consider. It will depend on the facts and information we have and the proper and full analysis of the report.  I have not as yet seen the report.</P>
      <P>In regard to fishing, we are prohibited from fishing in that area anyway.  I hope to attend the OSPAR conference where I intend to raise a wide variety of issues.  The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, will specifically represent the Government on the Sellafield issue.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(3) In the first financial year the dividend shall not exceed the value of the assets transferred under section 14 of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Amendment Nos. 7, 8 and 11 are being discussed together.  The issue at stake here is the one of payment by the company to the Government on vesting day.  During the debate on Committee Stage, I described this as a double &lsquo;smash and grab&rsquo; or double whammy.  That description was valid.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take into account the fact that £207 million has been paid in dividends to the Government by Aer Rianta in the recent past. That does not take into account the large amount of taxes paid by the company and its workers in PRSI and PAYE.  The company is now also faced with the certainty of the loss of duty free sales which will have a serious impact on the number of jobs in the company and will lose in the region of £6 million in revenue per annum.  This loss arises directly from the fact that a previous Fianna Fáil administration agreed to the abolition of duty free at a Council of Ministers meeting in 1991.  At that time the former Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds, had just been sacked by the then Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, and the present Taoiseach had not at that stage been appointed as Minister for Finance.  The Government did not send any Minister to the meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of a Fianna Fáil Minister at the meeting, a decision was made to abolish duty free sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituency colleague, the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Public Enterprise are currently engaged in a duet of shadowboxing. Fianna Fáil had the opportunity to veto the decision on duty free but did not even send a Minister to the meeting to exercise it.  There is no possibility of reversing that decision at this stage. We have witnessed a great deal of crocodile tears on the issue since this Government came to power.  The loss of duty free sales will now be <Col N="793" /> piled on top of the double whammy, smash and grab proposed in this Bill.  Amendment No. 11 in my name is intended to prevent the Minister making that grab.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very long and detailed discussion on this matter on Committee Stage during which I more or less revealed the Government decision on this matter.  That may have been somewhat risqué on my part.  I stated then that it would be possible to enter into discussions with the Minister for Finance if we found that the provisions of the Bill would impose undue hardship on Aer Rianta.  However, I was not listened to.</P>
      <P>I took the opinions expressed in the Committee Stage debate very much to heart and I give credit where it is due.  Deputies Stagg, Yates and Daly all spoke on the matter.  A series of discussions was subsequently instituted between my Department and the Department of Finance, myself and the Minister for Finance and the chairman and one board member of Aer Rianta.  The outcome of those discussions is that there will neither be a double whammy or a smash and grab in regard to this issue.  In spite of Deputy Stagg's exotic language, the Committee Stage debate had the desired result and is proof that there can be co-operation.</P>
      <P>The board of Aer Rianta held its AGM today which I visited.  The company is recording good results of which Members will receive a copy in due course.  During the course of my visit today, I was informed that representatives of the company had an hour long meeting with Commissioner Monti in Brussels yesterday after making several attempts to meet with him.  It was very interesting to hear details of their meeting with him.  A press conference on the matter will be held this afternoon and the board will outline details of the meeting.</P>
      <P>The case for duty free is certainly not lost.  I commend Deputy Stagg's constituency colleague, the Minister for Finance, for the work he has done in this regard.  I am sure Deputy Stagg would wish to commend him too in spite of his reference to crocodile tears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I have a good understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has succeeded in bringing several countries round to his point of view although more work needs to be done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates was correct in saying that the financial aspects of the Bill are the most important ones.  Most time was spent on them in the drafting of the Bill and a good result was achieved.  Following discussions with the company chairman and the Minister for Finance, I believe it will be possible to deal with Deputies' concerns without having to amend the Bill.  Their amendments are a credit to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members were concerned to ensure that Aer Rianta will not place an unacceptable drain on its <Col N="794" /> resources in any one year as a result of the timing of events associated with the implementation of this Bill or of the amounts paid over.  The payments in question are once-off cash payments in exchange for the airport assets and, in the future, the expected payments of dividends on the company's profits, the payment of rates on property vested and the payment of corporation tax.  As regards the timing of the different charges to which the company will become liable once its status changes, the dates payments will become due will depend on the date agreed for vesting day.  I have agreed with the Minister for Finance that the following dates and payments sequence would be the most appropriate.  Aer Rianta will pay its normal dividend or cash surrender of approximately £14 million in the current year, 1998.  That amount is similar to the amount paid last year.  That is the only sum Aer Rianta will pay to the shareholder in 1998.  I plan to order vesting day to be 1 January 1999.  Aer Rianta will then pay approximately £14.5 million to the Exchequer in return for the land and assets vested.  The shareholder will receive no dividend payment in 1999 so the £14.5 million which Aer Rianta will pay for the assets will be the only cash paid to the shareholder in that year.  Corporation tax on company profits earned in 1999 will fall due in the year 2000.  In that year Aer Rianta will also pay the dividend on the profits achieved in 1999.  It will also pay rates on property vested in the company from the commencement of the next following financial year after vesting day, which is the year 2000.</P>
    <P>To summarise, Aer Rianta will pay its normal dividend this year, it will make a single cash for assets payment in 1999 and, like any other company, it will pay rates, corporation tax and dividends from the year 2000.  There will, therefore, be no &ldquo;double whammy&rdquo; or &ldquo;smash and grab&rdquo; and the proposed amendments, Nos. 7, 8 and 11, are not necessary.</P>
    <P>These decisions arose as a result of the discussion on Committee Stage and from my intention to revitalise the Government decision which permitted further discussion of the matter with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and take note of the fact that debates on Committee Stage can yield results.  I thank the Minister for taking heed of our arguments and for acting effectively on them in Cabinet, where the essential decision was made.  I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister's response.  Her decision meets the objective of amendment No. 7.  It is a just solution.  The situation would have been slightly different if in 1984 a large subvention had been paid by the State to build Dublin airport or other assets but Aer Rianta paid for these assets from its resources and revenues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will withdraw amendment No. 7 but amendment No. 8 applies to any year.  It would prevent <Col N="795" /> a future Minister &mdash; or malign Minister as Deputy Stagg termed it &mdash; demanding too high a dividend. In five years' time a Minister for Finance could tell Aer Rianta: &ldquo;we did you a favour in 1999 to the extent of £14 million and now there is an election coming up and we are stuck for cash&rdquo;.  The annual dividend should always have due regard for the cash and borrowing position of the company so I intend to press that amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 12, line 27, to delete &ldquo;£250 million&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£350 million&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I said the borrowing ceiling of £250 million was too low and the Minister said she would review the provision on Report Stage. I also said it was inadvisable to determine the borrowing ceiling in primary legislation.  Amendment No. 10 appears to permit the Minister, in consultation with the company, to alter the ceiling by order rather than through legislation.  If that amendment meets the point at issue, I will not delay the House by pressing amendment No. 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On consideration of this amendment following Committee Stage, I accepted the need to allow an increase in the borrowing level as it might be required in certain years.  In addition, the inclusion of a borrowing limit might, in other circumstances, limit the company's actions and amending legislation would be required if more money had to be borrowed. Amendment No. 10, therefore, will permit the borrowing limit to be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for a borrowing ceiling of £250 million.  In the 1997 annual report Aer Rianta's total borrowings are listed at £90, an increase from £35 million the previous year.  The increase is in line with expectations and is due to the purchase by Aer Rianta of stakes in Dusseldorf and Birmingham airports as well as investment in the three State airports.  Amendment No. 10 will allow the Minister to amend the £250 million ceiling on borrowing by ministerial order.  The <Col N="796" /> corporate plan for the next five years shows projected peak borrowings at £219 million in the year 2000.  However, circumstances can change and as projections and aspirations increase, the amount of money required might also increase.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for pursuing this issue by putting down his amendment but the Government's amendment meets his objective.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 were proposed by the parliamentary draftsman who said that amending legislation would be required in the future if they are not made.  They ensure that the conferring on the company of powers of compulsory acquisition will relate to land and airports within the State.  They make it clear there is no attempt to confer such powers in relation to Aer Rianta's airports abroad, now or in the future.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 34 is an important technical amendment which will ensure that the Minister will only retain powers to regulate airport charges imposed by the company in State airports and not in airports abroad.

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 9 to 11 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) to own and manage the airports vested in it by section 14, and to own either in whole or in part or manage alone or jointly with another person any other airports, whether within the Sate or not, whenever it considers it to be advantageous to the development of the company to do so,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this amendment I am trying to protect all the assets of the company from sale.  We are describing here a core function of the company, to own and manage the airports vested in it by section 14, that is the three Irish airports owned at present by Aer Rianta.  They are specifically described by the term &ldquo;vested in it by section 14&rdquo;.  Without taking from the rest of the amendment, I am specifically including those airports. This changes the core function to own airports to include specifically the transferred airports of Dublin, Cork and Shannon, thus emphasising that they cannot be divested by the company without statutory change.  I hope the Minister understands the logic of my argument.</P>
      <P>The amendment originates from my fear that under this legislation the core activity of the company may be transferred to subsidiaries of the company.  I am satisfied that is possible under this legislation and, therefore, this protection is necessary to ensure a statutory change is required for the sale of any of the core activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 deals with the section which sets down the principal objects of the company.  Section 23 is the key enabling section.  Its intention is to give as broad a charter as possible to Aer Rianta for its core business.  Its key purpose is to normalise Aer Rianta's position as a stand-alone commercial semi-State body.  The section sets out the principal objects of the company and gives it the power to do anything that is necessary, advantageous or incidental to the attainment of its objectives.  The more general non-exclusive text <Col N="799" /> in the Bill is the correct approach.  It seems to be the general opinion with such Bills that company objectives should be of a general character and an enabling nature.  My purpose in this legislation is not to bind the company &mdash; far from it &mdash; but to ensure its charter is broad and flexible to allow it to adapt to prevailing circumstances.</P>
      <P>In this section Deputy Stagg has proposed a rewording of paragraph (a) of section 23(1) which would restrict the company from entering into a partnership management arrangement at any of the State airports, but that would be too restrictive.  This Bill is an enabling Bill.  It is not intended that it should introduce new restrictions on the company's commercial freedom of action.  In these days of strategic partnerships, public and private investment initiatives and other such innovative schemes, it would be unwise to limit the scope of the company in the manner proposed.</P>
      <P>If amendment No. 20 was accepted, the provision would be unworkable.  The Bill is intended to give the company a commercial mandate to manage State airports.  This may from time to time involve the purchase of extra land by the company and the sale of land which may no longer be required.  Amendment No. 20 would not allow the company freedom to purchase or sell, which are ordinary commercial decisions in the life of a semi-State company.  While the amendments were put forward from an excellent standpoint, they would have the effect of stifling the normal commercial activities of Aer Rianta.</P>

      <P>I fail to understand how inserting a specific clause into a general provision, that the company will own Cork, Dublin and Shannon airports, would restrict the company in any way or limit the scope of its commercial activity.  Perhaps the Minister will say how that could be.  The amendment simply proposes to insert the names of the three airports in addition to the general description of the activity of the company.  That will not limit the functions of Aer Rianta concerning Shannon, Cork and Dublin.  I cannot understand the logic of the Minister's arguments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g) to promote the maximum level of air traffic into and out of the State.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Stagg's last amendment the Minister said that the purpose of section 23 is to set out in a general way the objectives of the company.  I propose an addition to that, to promote the maximum level of air traffic into and out of the State.  Successive Ministers <Col N="800" /> received requests from regional airports for a marketing programme to support their efforts to boost them.  Aer Rianta is doing very well &mdash; its annual accounts were launched today &mdash; while regional airports are faring very poorly and in some cases finding it difficult to manage.  They are now faced with the abolition of duty free sales, which will scupper them.  I recently met a group from Knock airport who are devastated by the potential loss of duty free sales.  In that context I ask the Minister to accept this amendment, which does not have a hidden agenda. With sea travel and other methods of travel, it is a reasonable request that part of the functions would be to promote the maximum level of air traffic into and out of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage we discussed the objective of maximising air traffic into the State.  Obviously, the more traffic that uses the three State airports, the more Aer Rianta benefits.  The number of people using those airports increased significantly in 1997.  A general provision is best in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>Section 23(3) states the company shall have the power to do anything which is advantageous to the performance of its functions.  It will also take measures to develop those airports.  Those measures, and the normal ambition of any company to grow its business, would lead it to promote the optimum level of air traffic.  Aer Rianta is responsible for encouraging air traffic through its airports which include Dublin, Shannon and Cork.  It does not have responsibility for other privately owned airports, such as Knock, Waterford, Sligo and Farranfore.  This amendment would imply that Aer Rianta has a role to play in respect of those airports and that would not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the Deputy's amendment relates to regional airports because Aer Rianta would encourage as many passengers as possible to use its airports.  Successive Ministers, such as Deputies Dukes and Stagg, were responsible for the first three years of the marketing programme to provide funding for regional airports.  I am continuing that programme.  The regional airports operate under tight controls.</P>
      <P>The decision to abolish duty free will have a major impact on them, although I do not foresee that happening.  In the case of Farranfore, Knock and other airports, the sale of duty free allows them to operate on a viable basis.  I believe Knock only breaks even and duty free certainly helps to keep it viable.  I hope we will be successful on the duty free agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acceptance of this amendment would imply that Aer Rianta has a role in the management and encouragement of air traffic through regional airports.  Apart from the State airports of Dublin, Shannon and Cork, Aer Rianta does not have a role to play.  I cannot give it a role in respect of regional airports which are privately owned and run.  The State provides a flight subsidy for all regional airports except Knock. <Col N="801" /> Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

      <P>In page 19, to delete lines 7 to 11.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of the lines I seek to delete would make the company immune from the law.  I fail to understand why Aer Rianta would not be subject to court proceedings and penalised for breaking its own rules.  If its articles of association prohibit it from making a contribution to a political party and it makes a contribution to the Government, this section would exclude the possibility of any action being taken against it. Will the Minister explain why it is necessary to include this measure in the Bill?  Why is Aer Rianta not subject to the law the same as everybody else?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but I am perplexed by it.  I am told the deletion of this section, as proposed by Deputy Stagg, would mean the company could be pursued through the courts.  The subsection proposed for deletion is a standard safeguard provision used in legislation relating to all State bodies.  It appears that what applies to one applies to all.  While I am perplexed by the measure, if it applies to all State bodies it would not be within my remit to change it in respect of this one.  The current text reflects identical provisions in recent Acts relating to the IAA and in the Harbours Act of 1996.  The parliamentary draftsman has advised us that section 24(2) is an important safeguard &mdash; for who I wonder?  Section 23 simply provides the full scope of activities which may be legitimately undertaken by the company.</P>
      <P>Removing section 24(2) would mean that anyone could bring a case against the company to oblige it to carry out any of its principal objects. In my opinion that would be an admirable thing to do.  While I do not fully agree with this measure, if it applies to all State bodies I cannot accept the amendment.  I am told that if people endure an injury or are mistreated by a company they can take a civil case in a court against a company.  I am puzzled by this measure, but I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

It would be above the law and could not be sanctioned for breaking its own rules.  The Minister <Col N="802" /> might sack the board, particularly if the contribution were given to the wrong party, but this measure reflects the old protectionism under which semi-State bodies protect themselves against the public.  I suggest the Minister should break the mould in this case.</P>

      <P>Not that either.  I can see some merit in the subsection in so far as articles, memorandums and objects of a company are ideals, just as a manifesto is an ideal.  In the real world, which is more difficult, it does not always work out ideally.  To give criminal or civil litigation sanction for this, as opposed to where someone robbed money or perpetrated a fraud or was negligent in some way, is another category of crime.  One could argue that one is really asking for sanction to be there for ideals as opposed to specific legal matters and to that extent I agree with the subsection.</P>

      <P>In page 19, line 29, before &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 26(1) states:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would prevent this section being used as a vehicle or a licence to sell airport ground permanently.  We dealt with that matter elsewhere in the Bill.  The word &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; should be inserted before the word <Col N="803" />&ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;.  That is the basis of my amendment. The Minister said she would look at this on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>Section 26 provides a legal basis for the company's practice of allowing business entities concessions or leasing them space so they may conduct their businesses at State airports. All such legal agreements entered into by the company are limited to three years.  That is the limit under which those leases are granted.  In the course of the debate Deputy Yates said he knew from personal experience of cases that would apply if one had an office or another property.</P>
      <P>Section 56 exempts the company from the provisions of the landlord and tenant Acts.  Therefore, there is no question of lettings becoming permanent rights of the lessees due to the length of the lease which, at three years, is of a temporary nature.

    <P>Essentially, we are setting up powers for the company to have subsidiaries and to have their core activity included in subsidiaries.  I would envisage a situation where a subsidiary of Aer Rianta would run Dublin Airport, with other subsidiaries <Col N="804" /> for Shannon and Cork.  That is certainly possible and in that situation worker directors should be represented on the boards of the subsidiaries. My request is that not less than one-third of board members should be worker directors. That is the standard formula for worker directors.  I know the Minister's sympathies lie in the direction of this amendment and I hope she can be as positive about it as she was with the double whammy amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is half &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and half &ldquo;no&rdquo;. I will explain the options and we should look at them.  On Committee Stage I included an amendment to reinforce the <i>de facto</i> position that three of the directors of the main company should be worker directors.  As we know, this position has already been legislated for in the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts.  The Deputy's amendment seeks to provide that worker directors would be appointed to subsidiaries.  If the intent of the Bill was to devolve the core functions of the company into operating subsidiaries then the amendment would make eminent sense. The intent of the Bill, however, is not to devolve the core functions of Aer Rianta into operating subsidiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The core business of the company is not being devolved, indeed, anything but. However, on Committee Stage I undertook to look at it in connection with the two subsidiaries, Great Southern Hotels and Aer Rianta International. Schedule I of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act provides for participation by workers in consultation processes known as sub-board participation.  Great Southern Hotels is already listed under Schedule I, thus ensuring that Great Southern workers may participate in consultation processes.  The normal provision for State company subsidiaries already applies in the case of Great Southern Hotels under legislation and is listed under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta International is not listed under that Act simply because this subsidiary company was only established in late 1988.  The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill became an Act earlier that year.  Schedule II of the Act lists those State companies to which worker directors should be appointed.  Aer Rianta is listed under Schedule II and three worker directors currently sit on the company's board.  That is the amendment we agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has advised me that at <Col N="805" /> present no subsidiaries of State enterprises are included under Schedule II.  To add either Aer Rianta International or Great Southern Hotels to Schedule II would be breaking new ground.  Perhaps we will see how this could be done under industrial relations legislation.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta International is in an unusual position in that its staff of 100 or more are largely at managerial level.  They have not sought direct representation on the subsidiary board.  However, the current practice is that Aer Rianta's own three worker directors are appointed to the board of Aer Rianta International by the chairman and I want to see that practice continued.  This subsidiary did not exist when Schedule I of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act was last revisited in 1988.  If the staff of Aer Rianta International express a wish for their company to be added to Schedule I, I would support that, as would the management of the company.  I would request that an amendment to the Schedule be made by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is for that Department to adopt appropriate regulations.  If I received a joint request from Aer Rianta International's staff and management I would put it to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Such orders have been made in the past; when Irish Fertilizer Industries took over the core operating functions of its parent company NET, and in the case of Team Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>In 1995, even though there was no statutory requirement to do so, SIPTU was invited by the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, to nominate a staff representative to the board of Great Southern Hotels.  The workers of the day made their case to the then Minister.  An employee representative was selected by GSH workers and appointed to the board of GSH.  As I have already pointed out, Great Southern Hotels is already a specified body for sub-board structures but the other company is not.</P>
    <P>I now come to the options for legislating for worker directors on subsidiaries.  If the Minister of the day wanted to give workers in GSH and ARI a greater degree of representation at board level the Minister, with the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, could opt either to include GSH and ARI under Schedule II, thereby allowing for direct elections by workers in those subsidiaries to the board, or to allow workers in GSH and ARI to participate in the election of worker directors to the board of Aer Rianta itself, giving them a direct voice in the people then elected to the main board.</P>
    <P>The second choice would, perhaps, be the correct one in that regard.  If that is the case, there are two options.  I could request the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make an appropriate order implementing the change under the worker participation legislation &mdash; her intention to do so could be outlined on Report Stage in the Dáil and Opposition amendments would then not be accepted &mdash; or the Minister could, with the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, implement <Col N="806" /> the necessary change by means of a Government amendment to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this matter with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and it has been suggested that an appropriate amendment could be prepared in time for Committee Stage of this Bill in the Seanad.  It seems logical to use the procedures provided under the worker participation legislation to allow the workers in GSH and ARI to participate in the election of worker directors to the board of Aer Rianta.  This seems to be the least complex solution and, therefore, the one which should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement and I appreciate her genuine intentions. However, I also know how busy she is and the size and complexity of her Department.  I am fearful that once this matter leaves the Dáil today, particularly if it goes to the Seanad without a definite decision being made, it will be put on the back burner and other urgent matters will be attended to.  Perhaps the Minister could be more forthcoming, although I appreciate the difficulties in doing so.</P>
      <P>I am not just fearful about Aer Rianta International but I am convinced that it is possible under this legislation, although it may not be its intention, to hive off the core activities of Aer Rianta to subsidiaries.  If that is the case, we could have worker directors on the main board of Aer Rianta with no effective role because it might only be an umbrella board for a number of subsidiaries carrying out the core activities of the company.  I am anxious that the Minister be more specific before we leave this issue today because I am conscious of the danger of moving on to other Bills and crises and forgetting about it.</P>

      <P>There are two options.  The <Col N="807" /> first is to request the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a ministerial order which would allow the workers of the subsidiaries to participate in the election of worker directors to the board of Aer Rianta.  That seems to be the most simple method of doing it.</P>

The matter must be dealt with through consultation with the Minister responsible for worker participation legislation.  The second option is to implement the necessary change by means of a Government amendment to the Bill.  The first option is better.

    <P>This amendment restores a provision deleted from the scheme that the board as a whole, not just the chairperson, should make an annual report.  The Minister said the chairman might have sensitive information to report to the Minister which should not be published, which is acceptable.  However, the section as drafted fails <Col N="808" /> to provide for a public annual report from the company.  The chairman should continue to report confidential matters to the Minister.

      <P>The annual general report is published and the chairman's report is sent to the Minister, which appears to be confidential.  I do <Col N="809" /> not see any difference between what is in it and the annual general report.  Some chairpersons have difficulty trying to think up something different for the confidential report to the Minister. The report might outline events which are anticipated in the year ahead and include detailed information.  The Deputy wants the board, as distinct from the chairperson, to send a report to the Minister.</P>

      <P>When the chairman presents his report to me, I accept he is acting in good faith with the board.  In the annual general report he is shown as chairman of the board.  When he or she writes to me, I presume it is from a position as chairperson of the board and in full confidence of board members.

      <P>In my limited experience as a Minister of State I found it useful to get a report from the chairperson of companies.  It was different and distinct from the annual report which was published.  Much of the information in that report would have been valuable to the Opposition and other Members.  This information was not of a confidential nature and was not contained in the annual report.  I suggest the board should also report to the Minister in a non-confidential form which could be laid in the Library of the House and available to Members.  This would open up the debate and allow transparency to work and be seen to work.  That is effectively what I am saying.  I am not cutting across the function of the chairman telling secrets to the Minister if necessary.</P>

I assume the annual report is coming from the chairman and the board.  I have not differentiated because I have the other report which is personal to me and marked confidential.  I assume the annual report, which contains the chairman's report, is from the chairman.  It also contains a photograph of the chief executive and all the others.  I assume the chairman and the board are conveying their message to me and the wider public through its publication.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I suggested that whatever rights Aer Rianta staff had as an agent to the Minister they would have under the new legal framework.  I do not say that my amendment is a work of art in legalese but the Minister promised to come up with something which would give the same legal guarantee.  On the TEAM Aer Lingus vote, I was shocked to learn the reason the 4l per cent in favour was not higher was due to confusion over the superannuation and pension scheme.  It would be extraordinary if FLS was not prepared to guarantee the pension scheme.  When I raised this matter with union officials I was told this was misinformation and that they had been given guarantees.  It is difficult to understand how after five months that matter was not spelt out.  If one is trying to sell something, it is the height of incompetence if the facts are not made clear.  This is not a subjective matter, it is a black and white issue and it is extraordinary that that should be an issue.</P>

When I met the employees on the morning of 16 or 17 December and management in the afternoon, I asked for the most open discussions and the fullest information to be given to whatever was requested.  Irrespective of the answer and whether it was thought well of they should have had the facts.  Whether that remains the situation I do not know but it appears from what I hear and what I have been told that there is confusion about pension rights &mdash; and I mentioned this last night.  The union representative on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; was of the opinion that there had been the fullest explanations.  It seems there are different variations of what was said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 25 is a technical Government amendment and will serve to clarify the definitions. The staff of Aer Rianta and its subsidiaries participate in three pension schemes.  The bulk of <Col N="811" /> the staff of Aer Rianta and its subsidiaries are members of the Irish airlines general employees scheme, a joint scheme with Aer Lingus.  Two of the Aer Rianta subsidiaries, i.e. Aer Rianta International and Great Southern Hotels Limited have set up pension schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 32 is an enabling provision.  It will allow for the future establishment of a new pension scheme for employees of Aer Rianta if and when agreement is reached on such a change.  This means that the approved provisions in section 32 will apply to all relevant pension schemes involving staff of Aer Rianta and its subsidiaries. However, if and when a new separate pension scheme is established for Aer Rianta staff only, those staff will transfer out of the joint scheme and into a new scheme.  The staff of Aer Rianta International and Great Southern Hotels Limited schemes will remain in their own separate scheme.  I am informed that this is the one that best accords with what the Deputy had suggested.</P>

      <P>I am hopeful the Minister will accept this amendment also which deals with penalties for breach of confidentiality.  Section 34(6) states that: &ldquo;A person who fails to comply with this section shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.  One could inadvertently be guilty of an offence.  I suggest we insert the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.  On Committee Stage the Minister indicated that &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; was not a legally correct word and that perhaps some other word could be used.  It would then read: &ldquo;a person who knowingly fails to comply with this section shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>I recall this discussion because I thought &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; was giving the person a leeway they should not have because they should know in any event.  They could plead &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; when in actual fact they had known and were able to escape under it.  The word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; gives too much leeway.  I am not suggesting that anybody on State boards is transgressing.  It would give leeway for a transgression if they could plead &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.

      <P>A person could get drunk anywhere that sells drink legally.  I am concerned about the inadvertent breach.  I though the Minister indicated on Committee Stage that the existing wording was very harsh, and I knew she was concerned about the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; in case a person simply said they did not know and that would let them off the hook.  It certainly does not let them off the hook in another sense because they have to prove that they did not knowingly do something. The inadvertent breach of the regulation is causing the problem and it seems harsh that an inadvertent breach would be a criminal offence.  I ask the Minister to examine what is contained in other legislation and perhaps it might be considered in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>It refers in the main to potential clashes of interest on a board when matters are being discussed.  If such a clash of interest arises, a board member must remove himself or herself from the concerns of the board at that meeting.  I am sure that happens quite often. Board members know what their interests are and whether there is likely to be a conflict of interests.  I am not inclined to be as kind to board members as suggested in the amendment but I will examine it again in the Seanad and the Deputy can speak to his Members if he feels there is some word we could use.</P>

On Committee Stage she was supportive of this dialogue within the enterprise whereby employees made their suggestions and there was good dialogue between management and unions.  This constructive participation, as it is called in Aer Rianta, should not be inhibited by people believing they are breaching internal secrets.  I ask the Minister to allow latitude so that this dialogue would be unfettered by legal sanction and ask her to accept one or other of the amendments.</P>

      <P>This provision is not meant to muzzle people or disrupt good employee-employer communications.  It is intended to protect the company, its employees and their jobs by preventing damaging leaks of sensitive information. Sometimes that does not happen, as we <Col N="814" /> know.  To answer Deputy Yates, it may decide to change its name, although it is an excellent body which produced a very informative bulletin recently.  To include the limiting factor of the name as it currently stands in the legislation might not be the correct way to proceed, although I know that is not really the thrust of what the Deputy is saying.  It is an important safeguard that we would not encourage leaks of sensitive information. Members of the board have principles and obligations to the chairman, the board, the shareholders and to the country and in general those are upheld.  I have not seen anything that would lead me to believe otherwise.  To restrict this would not be the best way to proceed.  I will not accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy recalls, this came out of the issue of safety as he can see in section 38(2).  We dwelt on the safety aspect of it for a good while on Committee Stage and I looked it up when we were going over this.</P>
      <P>This is a standard provision in semi-State companies, but I was concerned by the difficulties encountered with the current working of section 38.  If the company considers that a direction given by the Minister may adversely affect the safety of aircraft, it is obliged to inform the Minister and the Irish Aviation Authority.  Following the comments and the debate on Committee Stage, I have reconsidered the matter and have decided to table amendment No. 31.  It will ensure the Minister will give due consideration to any information submitted by the company under this section.  The Minister may then use such information in amending or revoking any ministerial directive to the company.</P>
      <P>This limited power of the Minister is standard in all legislative provisions for semi-State bodies. It is necessary given the essential and central nature of the services provided by the semi-State sector. It is a recognition that there are occasions when it is necessary for the Government, acting in the best interests of the State, to have some means to direct a company to follow a general policy guideline.</P>
      <P>While I can accept the legitimacy of the concerns raised, I do not accept that the amendments to section 38 would be appropriate.  Amendment No. 30 suggests that the company need not comply with the ministerial direction.  This would set a precedent for such provisions for all legislative measures.</P>
      <P>I recommend to the House that we pursue amendment No. 31 as a halfway house between the other two.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about a typical situation which might arise at Shannon Airport.  Since the foundation of the airport, a search and rescue service has been provided where a boat, which is owned by the Department and operated by the security personnel in the airport, was successfully engaged in a number of incidents.  The record of Shannon Airport has been unique.  It is probably one of the safest airports in the world and great credit is due to all concerned.  Nevertheless, there is deep concern that in a rationalisation of search and rescue services there may be some decision by the company to terminate or curtail some of the operations of the search and rescue service, especially in relation to the provision of the search and rescue launch to which I referred.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is the one which probably covers the case where there might be an attempt by the company to curtail or terminate such a service.  It is an instance where the Minister would need to be in a position to give a direction and that should be maintained.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;48.  &mdash;&mdash;(1) Whenever the company is of opinion that the unrestricted use of a particular area of land in the vicinity of an airport owned or managed by it would interfere with the efficient operation or development of that airport, it may by order prohibit any person, save under and in accordance with a permit granted by the company, from erecting or adding to any building on the land specified in the order.</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister shall make regulations to enable this section to have full effect.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister withdrew this section which removed the power from the airport authority to stop skyscrapers being built on land adjoining the airport which might be in the flight path.  That could compromise safety in a serious way and compromise the future development of the airport.  I do not know why it was withdrawn.  As we were saying earlier, the same draftspeople were there then as now.  Therefore, we must blame the Minister for its withdrawal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Bill was combed for that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct.  The provision in Deputy Stagg's amendment is included in the scheme of the Bill.  The making of protected area orders was seen to be one of the Minister's powers which was related to the Minister's power to establish and manage airports.  The original intention was to transfer all such powers from the Minister to the company.</P>
      <P>A concern was raised by the company during the drafting of the Bill that perhaps some speculators &mdash; there are names given but I would not give them in the House, but the Deputy would know to whom I am referring &mdash; might position themselves to abuse the provision if the powers to make protected area orders were transferred to the company.  The company expressed the view that the Minister be regarded as less of a speculative target &mdash; I certainly would be in this respect &mdash; and asked that the <i>status quo</i> be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consideration within the Department, it is deemed that the protected area powers, if transferred to Aer Rianta, would represent a wide range of safety related powers to transfer to a commercial State body.  In effect, an individual's rights in relation to private property could be limited by enabling the company to restrict development on land not owned by the company <Col N="818" /> but adjacent to one of the airports.  It was felt that such wide-ranging powers such not be granted to a company which was to operate with a commercial mandate at arms length from the Minister. With Government approval, the provision was deleted before publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Irish Aviation Authority comes into it, as the House will be aware.  The Department has established a committee and intends to conduct a detailed examination of the entire regulatory regime for aviation safety.  The review will clarify where exactly the final responsibility for making protected area orders should rest.  We hope to have that soon and then the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993 may be amended.  There is a conflict as to who is responsible for safety in certain areas.  I propose that we go back to the broader question in a revision of the IAA legislation when the review committee has done its work.  In the light of this debate and pending matters, it was decided to deal with it this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the IAA can be developed into something of an independent republic.  We should be conscious of that reality. Is the Minister saying that the powers that were to be in this section and that previously were held by Aer Rianta are being held by the Minister?</P>

      <P>In page 38, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;52.  &mdash;A person guilty of an offence of disruptive behaviour holding any risk to the safety of air passengers on board flights, shall be liable&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £20,000 or to imprisonment <Col N="819" /> for a term not exceeding two years or to both.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for responding to my request with a brand new section which would not otherwise have been in the Bill.  The Minister's amendment No. 40 provides for fines of £500 and £700. My amendment provides for fines of £5,000 and £20,000.  I thank the Minister for her amendment because, in the course of this Bill it transpired that the two spokespersons were very nervous flyers, whatever about the Minister.  Much better legal language has now been brought forward in the Minister's amendment.  It will be an offence now to be so drunk on a plane as to cause fear and apprehension to others.  I very much welcome that for the first time this will be a criminal offence.  In addition, where someone engages in behaviour that is likely to cause serious offence to a person on board an aircraft, either crew or fellow passengers, that will be an offence.</P>
    <P>Recent cases of this got prominent publicity inside and outside the jurisdiction.  It really is not funny when someone goes berserk and air hostesses, who are used to the rough and tumble of flying, are terrified in a situation where nobody can leave because the plane is in mid-air.  These are serious matters and I do not regard £500 as an adequate fine.  I am glad it is being treated as an offence, but this matter might not be reviewed for another ten or 20 years.  Someone who can afford the price of a flight to New York could easily pay a fine of £500 with a credit card.  I would like to put a sting in the tail here and make the fine £1,000.  Where somebody engages in violent behaviour, is threatening, abusive or insulting, where we are dealing with a breach of the peace, £700 is not enough.  I am glad a prison sentence of four months has been included.  Even if the Minister does not accept my proposal to have a higher fine, which I ask her to consider, I thank her for her amendment because I want it to go out loud and clear from this House that truculent behaviour of any kind on board an aircraft is not acceptable and is now a separate offence in its own right.  Now that we have cheaper fares, some people flying to functions and matches or coming to Dublin for the weekend for stag parties, hen parties etc., feel they can behave like lager louts, take too much to drink and be abusive to cabin crew or violent to someone who is unfortunate enough to be beside them.  In a situation where people are apprehensive and nervous at the best of times &mdash; some people have to have medication to calm themselves before a flight &mdash; that is just not tolerable.  I am glad the Minister and her officials have responded so sensitively and rapidly to what I have proposed.  I will be happy to withdraw amendment No. 37 but I ask the Minister to go that little bit further by including higher fines.</P>

      <P>It is thanks to the Deputies who contributed that this amendment has been introduced.  The fact that they tabled an amendment provoked us to think about it more deeply. <Col N="820" /> I applaud their motivation, the action they took and the effect it will have.  People object to how long Committee Stages can take.  We have all muttered about that.  However, it shows that a properly researched Bill put forward with amendments can have a huge effect if everybody, Minister and Deputies, put their backs into it.  It is an appalling vista to be subjected to abusive and threatening behaviour in a confined space from which one cannot get out and in which one has little room to move.  People can very quickly look the other way and not do anything about it.  We spent a lot of time reading about this and we wanted a provision that could be implemented quickly.  This amendment went to Cabinet where we had a debate on it and two or three members mentioned things they saw happen on planes &mdash; this is one of those matters that leads to a good discussion.  We took advice from the Attorney General that a fine of £500 be imposed for intoxication, that disorderly conduct be made a direct offence and a similar fine applied.  In current law disorderly conduct becomes an offence only if persisted in having been requested by a member of the Garda Síochána to desist.  One might not be lucky enough to have a member of the Garda Síochána on the plane so that had to be changed. The offence of threatening behaviour will attract a fine of £700 or four months' imprisonment or both which is an increase from £500 and three months respectively in the current law.  This has the merit of making use of existing provisions of criminal justice and aviation legislation with only minor modifications.  That was advised by the Attorney General, and it allows for speedy implementation as part of the Bill.  If it proves necessary to revisit this matter then a more formal consideration of the issues over a longer timescale can be undertaken.  It was the Attorney General's office which came up with a direct way to approach this problem.  I applaud the motivation and civic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He was very exercised to ensure that it was a point of honour which should be followed through.  The workers had gone from Aer Lingus over to TEAM.  From 21 October 1998 local authorities and health boards will come within the scope of the Act.  In addition, the First Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act provides for the inclusion of bodies in the wider public service and those in receipt of public funding by regulation made by the Minister for Finance. The Freedom of Information Act gives powers to the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise, to decide whether it would be appropriate to extend the <Col N="823" /> scope of the Act to State bodies.  It is intended that the incremental application, the same as we had before, across the wider public service will be informed by experience gained at central Government level over the coming period.  This broad, phased approach was accepted by the last Government when the relevant Government documents were being passed on Freedom of Information.  When it had developed and brought forward the legislation it had agreed on the phased development.</P>

      <P>Any future proposal to extend the application of the Freedom of Information Act to commercial State bodies will be carefully considered.  These companies increasingly find themselves operating in direct competition with private sector firms.  If they are to have a fair chance it behoves us as legislators not to burden the commercial State companies with obligations that do not equally apply to their private sector competitors.  The Act is structured and designed to include a phased application.  This matter was discussed when the Bill was brought to Cabinet. I do not know what was discussed at Cabinet but the result was that the Act would be applied in a phased manner.  I cannot go against that decision for the commercial semi-State companies.</P>

I also thank Deputy Daly and others who had a great interest in the Bill because of where they come from.  It was a most interesting debate during all Stages.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Health Care and Personal Social Services: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Shortall on Tuesday, 26 May 1998:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, having regard to the widespread demand for health care and personal social services, the fact that in many areas this demand is not being met and the certainty that demand will increase in the future, as also will the costs associated with providing those services, noting, in particular, the urgent need to provide more hospital beds and to attack hospital waiting lists, to make further and more effective provision in the areas of care for children, the elderly and persons with mental disability, and to develop a comprehensive system of care in the community, bearing in mind that Irish <i>per capita</i> spending is among the lowest in the European Union, and believing that the present period of economic expansion should return a dividend to the people by way of a major and sustained increase in funds committed to the public health system, calls on the Government&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) to declare a target figure for public health expenditure, as a percentage of gross domestic product, and</P>
    <P>(2) to commit itself to a programme of spending increases until that figure is achieved and to the maintenance of spending at that level.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann,</P>
    <P>Affirms and supports the many initiatives already taken by the Minister for Health and Children in relation to the provision of improved health and personal social services and in particular,</P>
    <P>&mdash; The significant overall increase in health expenditure provided in 1998 together with the enhanced multi-annual capital programme put in place up to the year 2000; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; The increased funding provided for the development of acute hospitals, tackling hospital waiting lists, services for the elderly, child care, mental handicap and other community services;</P>
    <P>Further notes with approval the range of <Col N="825" /> commitments contained in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium and the determination to implement these developments within the life of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffat).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more than 500,000 patients within the remit of the Southern Health Board which has specialist responsibilities for up to one million people.  Many of its services are inadequately funded and not keeping pace with the needs of the sick.  What is most noticeable is that the staff-patient ratio is markedly lower than in any other health board.  In the community, the district nurse-speech therapist-social worker-patient ratio is also lower than that in all comparable health boards.  Our hospitals have the same deficiencies.</P>
      <P>It has been recognised by officials of the Department of Health and Children that the staff nurse-patient ratio in Cork University Hospital is much lower than in Dublin.  The rate of new consultant appointments in the Southern Health Board is 5 per cent compared to a rate of 14 per cent to 25 per cent throughout the rest of the country.  Junior hospital doctors in Cork and Kerry work one night in four whereas their counterparts in Dublin work one night in every eight or ten.</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need for capital and revenue investment in Cork University Hospital.  A submission regarding its requirements was made to the Department recently but I understand there has been no response to date.  On the capital side, several major items of equipment are obsolete. The normal life of a CT scanner is eight years or one million scans.  The CT scanner in use in the hospital has been operated night and day for ten years and 1.5 million scans have been taken.  It has broken down on six occasions in the last four months necessitating the referral of patients to the Mercy Hospital, causing major inconvenience to very ill patients and leading to delays in reaching a diagnosis and greater expense to the health board.  There is a six months out-patient waiting list.  It would cost £400,000 to replace the scanner.</P>
      <P>There is a need for an ophthalmology microscope which costs in the region of £150,000.  There is also a need for cardiac-telemetry equipment which costs in the region of £400,000.  Overall, some £2 million is needed immediately for capital investment to satisfy current patient requirements in Cork University Hospital alone.</P>
      <P>In Tralee General Hospital, with which I am familiar, there is a requirement for extra nurses for the coronary care unit, especially from 5.30 p.m. to 9 a.m., particularly in the step-down ward. There is also a need for up-to-date equipment, especially dinamaps for taking blood pressure and &ldquo;hi-lo&rdquo; beds.  Some of the equipment in use in the hospital is 14 years old.  The equipment transferred from the old hospital is antiquated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has great difficulty in replacing retiring consultants.  Two senior consultants have announced their imminent departure. <Col N="826" /> The board has applied to the Department for replacements but, to date, these have not been approved.</P>
    <P>Cork University Hospital is, undoubtedly, the flagship hospital in the Southern Health Board and provides more specialist services than any other hospital in the State.  However, without the financial support of the Department a further decline in services is inevitable.</P>
    <P>A constituent of mine who was recently diagnosed as having leukaemia could not be admitted to Cork University Hospital for treatment because there was no bed available.  This is unacceptable.  The person concerned had to travel to St. James's Hospital in Dublin resulting in considerable stress and hardship for his family.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has a statutory obligation to provide an acceptable service, comparable to that provided throughout the rest of the country.  To do this, it requires adequate funding which has not been forthcoming.  I understand the Minister has been requested to meet a deputation. I hope he will agree to do so within the next few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and congratulate the Labour Party on bringing it forward. I wish to refer to a disorder which, although the Minister has met delegations and is aware of the associated problems, the Department does not fully accept merits treatment &mdash; attention deficit disorder.  It affects the learning ability and behaviour of up to 10 per cent of all children.  There is much confusion among parents and children about the nature of the disorder and the treatment required.  It often remains undiagnosed. Children may be labelled anti-social, hyperactive or unintelligent while parents are incorrectly criticised for their poor parenting.</P>
      <P>For many children, growing up is tough.  For some, the going is even more difficult because the symptoms of attention deficit disorder are not apparent to the casual observer.  At school, they have trouble learning, disrupt classes and frustrate their teachers.  At home, they create many difficulties for their parents and siblings.  Often inattentive, overactive and impulsive, they can also be clumsy and aggressive.</P>
      <P>Despite the high percentage of children suffering from the disorder, it is largely ignored by some sections of the community, especially the educational and medical professions.  To them, these are not handicapped children but children who are not being taught appropriately or disciplined. The Department should promote greater public awareness of the disorder &mdash; particularly among teachers and the medical profession generally &mdash; to help parents of ADD sufferers to identify the disorder in their children as early as possible.  Left untreated, it can have serious consequences for the sufferer, his or her family and the community at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Psychologists have listed the symptoms as follows: short attention span, insatiability, inability to sit still for a reasonable period, easily distracted, often interrupts others, acts without thinking of the consequences, often loses things, moves from one uncompleted task to another, <Col N="827" /> often talks excessively and has difficulty in waiting their turn in games and so on.</P>
    <P>There is a large genetic ingredient.  The condition affects three times more boys than girls. Some 5 per cent of the population is affected. There is a higher incidence among children who have been adopted.  The disorder is believed to originate from an abnormality in the frontal lobe of the brain resulting in poor communication between the parts of the brain controlling impulses to act.  The effect is poor self-control and abnormal impulsive behaviour.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the mid-western branch of the association based in Limerick with which I have been working and which is working closely with the Mid-Western Health Board.  I congratulate the Mid-Western Health Board on its work in this area.  We are not happy with the progress being made, but are due to get a report in this regard at our next health board meeting.  I hope the Department considers this work a pilot project and that we can develop the views that stem from it.</P>
    <P>The mid-western branch of ADD, the adult family support group, is encountering growing problems with children in schools because there is an appalling ignorance of this disorder among school teachers and general practitioners.  That group stated many of these children will be dismissed from school because their disorder can make them unmanageable for teachers who have no training or knowledge to deal sympathetically and with patience towards them.  They also stated that if these children are left without schooling they will inevitably turn to drugs and anti-social behaviour which will later help to inflate the prison population, all because there are no adequate means to diagnose and treat this problem at local level.  The group further stated that since it came into existence it has received many telephone calls on this.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to address the House on this important subject and to take the opportunity to update Deputies on the delivery by the Government on its commitments in the health area.  Unfortunately, I was called away at short notice yesterday evening and I would like to thank my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, for moving the Government's amendment to the motion in my absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is almost inevitable that when there is debate about the health services the concentration is on deficiencies in the service.  However, we should not dismiss our current level of achievement.  A high number of people benefit every year from the availability of quality health and personal <Col N="828" /> social services.  Shortages and deficiencies exist in most health services, many of which absorb much greater amounts of money than our own.</P>
    <P>The OECD recently gave a positive assessment of our health services relative to those in other countries.  Its conclusion was &ldquo;The Irish health system.. has resulted in a good provision of health care at a relatively low cost to the taxpayer.&rdquo; Therefore, there is much to be proud of in the core service provided.  I do not wish to deny that problems exist in specific areas.  However, the Government will not walk away from addressing those issues.  It has set out clearly in An Action Programme for the Millennium its resolve to address, in a targeted fashion, the improvement of key aspects of our health and personal social services.  Very significant increases in both capital and non-capital funding were provided in 1998.  These increases have allowed me to make significant progress in implementing the Government programme.</P>
    <P>Further funding will be required over the life of the Government to achieve all we have set out. I welcome the general support during this debate for an increase in the resources devoted to our health services.  As a Government we are determined to carefully manage the economy and our success in this area should allow us to plan for increased resources being made available to health.  Continued economic success is the key to improving our social services since this will supply the base on which progress can be sustained over the medium term.</P>
    <P>This Government began to address the deficiencies which exist in our services almost immediately upon taking office.  Given that these deficiencies existed during the time of the last Government, it is ironic that those same parties are now scrambling to convey their commitment to the health services.  This Government was faced with a number of very urgent service needs in the health area and we responded by providing a very significant injection of funds in the latter half of 1997.</P>
    <P>In the acute hospital sector I made funding available for high cost drug treatments many of which, although very expensive, are of a life saving nature.  The sum of £3 million was made available for such drugs and a further sum of £2 million went towards the treatment of young haemophiliacs.</P>
    <P>Progress was also made in the child care area, in particular, the problem of homeless children and children with emotional and behavioural difficulties. A total of £4.5 million was provided on an ongoing basis to cover the additional costs incurred by health boards in caring for these children and to introduce targeted measures intended to alleviate this problem.  Funding of £6.9 million was provided to health boards to allow them to meet the increasing demand for subventions toward the cost of care of older people in private nursing homes. <Col N="829" /> A package of once off funding was also provided to meet pressing needs in relation to the disabled and the elderly at the end of 1997.  The sum of £4.8 million was provided for the purchase of equipment, aids and appliances by voluntary organisations working with people with physical and sensory disabilities and with older people.  A further sum of £4.5 million was made available in relation to services for people with physical and sensory disability.  That funding went towards the elimination of historical funding deficits in voluntary organisations which had built up over the previous years.</P>
    <P>On taking office I was very concerned at the serious under investment in our capital programme which has occurred in the past.  An extra £23 million in capital funding was provided in 1997.  Among the issues this allowed to be addressed was the replacement of urgently required hospital equipment, the purchase of which had been postponed in previous years under the previous Administration, and tackling the serious backlog in fire prevention and maintenance works which had also built up.</P>
    <P>The year 1998 has been the first full year in which the Government was able to address the necessary improvement in our health services. The net non-capital provision for health in 1998 shows a 10 per cent increase over and above the 1997 outturn.  Further progress has also been made on the capital programme wherein we have achieved a 12 per cent increase over the 1997 outturn. I do not have sufficient time to set out all the progress that this has allowed during 1998. However, I wish to refer to some of the areas raised in the Opposition motion to assure the House the Government is already committed to addressing these issues.  It is regrettable the Government is confronted by so many urgent problems due to the fact that the parties now on the Opposition benches failed to address these areas when they were in Government during a period of unprecedented economic buoyancy.</P>
    <P>Regarding acute hospitals, additional non-capital funding of approximately £30 million has been provided in 1998 in respect of acute hospital services, not including the new Tallaght Hospital. This funding will meet the additional costs of developments initiated in recent years and allow for further developments in relation to the ambulance services, the cancer strategy, the opening of new units which are ready to be commissioned, development of accident and emergency services and increased funding for the waiting list initiative.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies made a number of claims last night about waiting lists on which I would like to comment.  Deputy Shatter noted that waiting lists rose by 6,000 from 26,000 at the end of 1996 to 32,000 at the end of 1997.  He blamed the Government for the increase, but conveniently forgot to mention that the great bulk of the increase occurred in the first six months of 1997, when his party and other parties were still in office.  His claim that waiting list figures &ldquo;started to shrink <Col N="830" /> during the lifetime of the previous Government&rdquo; sounds unconvincing when waiting lists rose by 4,500 during the final six months of his party's participation in Government.</P>
    <P>The reason for this increase of 4,500 is quite clear &mdash; the last Government cut waiting list funding by £4 million in 1997 from its 1996 figure. When I became Minister I increased this funding to £12 million for 1998 and this represents a 50 per cent increase in the waiting list allocation over that provided for last year by the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan.  I also made the funding available to agencies much earlier in the year than my predecessor did.  As my colleague, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Moffatt, said last night, I also established a review group to advise on how best the waiting list funding could be utilised.  In these circumstances Deputy Shatter lacks some credibility when he attempts to criticise the Government for its action on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter also claims that the Government is seeking to suppress the true nature of hospital waiting lists to ensure that when statistical information becomes available it is outdated. I assure the House that this is simply not true. The information collected by my Department comes, not only from the health boards, but also from a range of voluntary hospitals.  Each set of data has to be obtained from some 45 different health board hospitals and voluntary hospitals. The figures must then be collated and rigorously checked.  I have emphasised the importance of validating all waiting list figures to ensure they present an accurate picture of the situation.  It would be very irresponsible to publish waiting list figures before they have been properly validated. I assure the House that the waiting list figures for the quarter ending 31 March will be released as soon as a validated set is available.  There is absolutely no question of delaying their publication in any way.  The attention to detail on the production of validated and accurate waiting list information has always been a necessary feature of the waiting list initiative, under each successive Government, since it started in 1993.</P>
    <P>On taking up office I was very concerned that there would be imbalances between services in different parts of the country, particularly in relation to hospital services.  The Government is very conscious of the need to achieve regional self sufficiency in the specialties where it is possible to do so with high quality facilities.  This is in keeping with the principles of the national health strategy.  The Government's actions bear out its commitments in this regard.  For example, I have proceeded with the implementation of the national cancer strategy which has as one of its main aims the provision of consultant oncology and haematology services in appropriate areas throughout the country.  I have also announced that a cardiovascular strategy will be prepared and work on it is already well under way.  As a practical indication of the reduction in regional imbalances, I announced plans for the provision <Col N="831" /> of cardiac surgery and radiotherapy in Galway. Similarly, the major capital projects at various stages of development in Galway, Castlebar, Mullingar, Tullamore and Roscommon are testament to the Government's commitment to developing services in a targeted way throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have accused the Government of failing the mental handicap sector. I immediately refute these accusations.  The moneys available to this sector in 1998, a sum of £16 million, are equivalent to the investment made in 1997 by the previous Government. However, the 1997 figure was the largest given by that Government during its term.  I have matched this figure in my first year.</P>
    <P>In addition, for the first time, I have agreed a major capital programme of £30 million for mental handicap services to be invested over the next four years.  This is the first time there has been a multi-annual capital programme specifically for mental handicap services.  The £5.25 million capital funding provided this year is the beginning of the programme of investment and will allow for the continued implementation of the assessment of needs report.  By utilising all the resources available to me the mental handicap services can be assured that the facilities and support services required will be available.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffat, last night set out the progress which has been achieved in relation to services for the elderly during the current year as part of a phased programme. Deputies will be aware of the increase in the population of older people, particularly the very elderly.  Work has already begun in my Department on planning for the implications of the ageing of the population for our health services. Already bed utilisation problems are arising within our hospital system due to an inability to promptly discharge elderly patients from acute hospitals after appropriate treatment has been given.  In dealing with the requirements of an ageing population one of my first areas of attention will be putting proper supports in place so that the elderly can be moved out of hospital to release beds for patients on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, one of the priorities I had on taking up office was to commence the process of increasing the capital budget to a realistic level.  It seems the last Government did not appreciate the importance of providing proper capital investment in our services.  I am pleased to say I secured an increase of about 35 per cent in capital funding for the period 1998 to 2000 over the outlay for the previous three-year period when Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left were in Government.  The Exchequer capital allocation alone for 1998 is £147 million while £155 million and £165 million will be provided in the years 1999 and 2000 respectively.  I am making every effort to further enhance the capital budget for 2001 and subsequent years in the context of future Estimates campaigns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="832" /> I am determined to ensure that the non-hospital sectors will get their fair share of available resources.  The continuing care services, which cover areas such as psychiatry, mental and physical handicap, services for the elderly, etc., are in a process of change, the major change being the provision of community-based services as an alternative to institutional care.  Evidence of this can be seen in the increase in the number of community residences, day hospitals, community nursing units, daycare centres and other community facilities which are being provided to replace services previously provided in institutional settings.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House in the name of the Labour Party suggests that the present period of economic expansion should yield a dividend to the people in terms of increased investment in the public health system.  There is some validity in this argument having regard to the substantial need for health services of which we are all aware.  We have delivered on that commitment to a far greater extent than did the Labour Party when in Government.</P>

      <P>The Government recognises the pressing needs within the health services and the 1998 Vote provision makes a significant start in addressing these.  Specifically, the funding provided allows us begin to implement the commitments contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium and to achieve the objectives set out in my Department's strategy statement, Working for Health and Well-Being.</P>
      <P>I have a very clear view of what must be done to keep existing services up to the appropriate level of quality and the areas which must receive additional investment in the medium and long-term. The Government's strategy in relation to the health services is clearly thought out and will be backed up by the necessary resources.  I therefore ask the House to endorse the Government's strategy as represented by our amendment to the Opposition motion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Government amendment to the motion put forward by the Labour Party.  Everybody in the public domain would like to see much more money being spent on health services, especially at a time when the economy is booming. However, we must also recognise that the resources available are finite and that, despite the fact that we are living in very good economic times, to maintain economic growth we must mind public finances.  In particular when looking <Col N="833" /> at spending on health services we must be careful we are getting good value for money.</P>
      <P>The Government in its programme is doing exactly what the Labour Party is suggesting, namely, spending more money on health services than was ever the case previously.  There has been a 10 per cent increase in non-capital funding in 1998 over the 1997 figures.  In addition, £3 billion is being provided in 1998 for non-capital funding of public health services.  This represents £8.2 million per day, a very significant amount of money.  The capital programme for health services has increased by 12 per cent on the 1997 figures.  Furthermore, an additional £7 million has been invested in health services for older people. We must always look out for the elderly who have contributed so much to the economy.  Four million pounds of non-capital money has been spent on subventions for older people in private nursing homes.  The Government is clearly living up to its commitment to spend more money on health services, something we have never before seen.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party motion speaks about increasing the number of hospital beds.  In a modern health service we must regard this as a fairly simplistic way of working out whether our health services are adequate.  It is far more appropriate and significant to look at the ability of a modern hospital to respond to the demand for daycare treatment which can be less costly than overnight treatment and care.  Many more patients can be treated through day care services.  We must also examine the proper use of outpatient departments, something that is vital in ensuring hospitals are responding effectively to genuine demand.</P>
      <P>There must be a packet of initiatives directed towards lessening pressure on hospital beds, including the setting up of facilities for the elderly and chronically sick, developments to relieve pressure on accident and emergency departments of general hospitals and co-operation between local general practitioners and general hospitals in the continuing care of patients.  We must also aim to reduce waiting lists and concentrate effort to ensure the general hospital programme, which consumes 50 per cent of the total health budget, delivers a cost effective service.  Focusing on hospital beds, therefore, is a simplistic approach. In terms of standards we compare very favourably to those available internationally.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Health and Children who is doing an excellent job, particularly in the Western Health Board area.  He visited the constituency last week and County Mayo and the Western Health Board area will enjoy enhanced services in the years ahead.  Some £7 million was provided specifically for the development of services for the elderly in the Western Health Board area.  This is over and above general increases for pay, inflation and other increases not directly related to service provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has provided £22 million for Phase 2 of Mayo General Hospital which will <Col N="834" /> make the hospital one of the finest in the country. After Tallaght Hospital and St. James's Hospital, this represents one of the highest capital spends on an Irish hospital.  I am delighted the hospital in based in Castlebar, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>It would be very unfair for anyone to allege that this Government is not looking at the health services in a caring manner.  The Minister for Health and Children will be seeking increased funding for the health services in the context of the multi-annual budget exercise covering the years 1999 to 2001.  It is important to note that other Departments will also seek funding. However, I am confident that the Minister for Health and Children will be successful in his bid to obtain additional funding in this area.  Costs arise in the health services due to pressures such as new technology, demographic factors, legislative obligations and so on.  Funding is also required to meet the capital and revenue commitments contained in the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>It will not be easy to secure this additional money but, with a committed Minister intent on improving our health services over the next five years, I assure the House this will happen while Fianna Fáil is in Government.  I commend the Government amendment to the House and I wish to share my remaining time with my colleague, Deputy Roche.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate as it gives us the opportunity to put on record the Government's initiatives in this area.  The Minister and the Minister of State pointed out last night that the Government has provided a 10 per cent increase in non-capital funding in the current year.  The Minister also updated the House on other initiatives in health services.  An additional 12 per cent was allocated to capital spending on health services, well in advance of the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the health services is massive; health services are a particular brand of public service to which the amount of funding allocated will never be sufficient.  More than £3 billion in non-capital funding will be spent on public health services in 1998; that is a phenomenal figure by any standards although it is not to suggest that more money should not be spent.  The reality is that health services are improving in leaps and bounds, not just because of the Minister's and Government's commitment but also because of commitments made by the previous Government. A real effort has been made in this area; when one considers that almost £8.2 million is being expended per day in this area, one gets some idea of the priority being accorded to it by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the years ahead, a more targeted approach must be adopted in regard to health services.  By their very nature, modern health services are very <Col N="835" /> costly and the more high tech the services, the more costly they will become.  The Minister should examine aspects of the health services with a view to improving them and to targeting services which will deliver maximum benefits, not just from the point of view of the taxpayer, but also from the point of view of the community as a whole.  Additional funds must be targeted in a way which will identify and address specific problems.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the lacuna which currently exists within the GMS.  Deputy Shortall and I both served on the Eastern Health Board and are aware of where the gaps in that service exist.  In the years ahead, as funds are allocated, the GMS must be targeted both from the point of view of value for money and improving people's lives. The Minister could make an immediate and beneficial impact for the maximum number of people by introducing greater flexibility in regard to medical card eligibility.  Notwithstanding the special arrangements and allowances made by chief executive officers, inflexibilities exist within the system in regard to the restrictive nature of eligibility, particularly at the margins.  Where means testing and cut off points exist, hardship will inevitably occur.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that families in which there is only one PAYE income earner can be dealt with particularly harshly as every penny of income can be means tested.  I know the Minister has a personal interest in reviewing medical card eligibility. Low paid public service families, in particular, find themselves marginally outside eligibility levels and some relief must be introduced in that respect.  Many such families deny themselves medical services until they reach a crisis and more expensive treatments are required.</P>
    <P>I have particular sympathy with old age pensioners who have small occupational pensions.  It is time we seriously considered the progressive extension of medical card cover to all old age pensioners.  This would result in far greater yields than investment in technology as it would help old age pensioners to stay within their communities and overcome some of the crises they face. The Minister could, for example, agree to extend full GMS medical card cover to all pensioners over a particular age, for example 75 or 80 year olds.  The State could then be committed to reducing the age for universal medical card eligibility on a year by year basis until medical cards would automatically become available to people on reaching pension age.  There are strong and cogent reasons that would be beneficial.  In the longer term, it would certainly help to overcome crises which arise because people deny themselves medical care because of their economic situations.</P>
    <P>The Minister could also consider families struck by chronic illness.  We are all aware of the 12 major illnesses which confer automatic medical card eligibility.  I recently had the harrowing experience of witnessing the partner of a well-to-do <Col N="836" /> constituent being struck down with MS.  Over a protracted period, that family suffered a very real economic plight and a medical card was only granted towards the end of the illness.  There should be a greater degree of flexibility in cases such as these.</P>
    <P>There is a mounting crisis in regard to children suffering from asthma.  Asthma is not recognised as a disorder which automatically entitles a child to medical card services, yet we are all aware that this disease can have an extraordinary impact on many families.  Such families may deny themselves necessary medical care and the crisis may reach a point where institutional care is required, or where serious illness or even death occurs.  We must consider this issue in the longer-term.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Government is as committed as any other group in this House to improving medical services.  The Minister has adopted a very progressive attitude in this regard and figures show he is prepared to put his money where his mouth is.  I do not blame the Opposition for tabling this motion, I would doubtless do likewise in their position.  We are all committed to a medical service which the people of the State deserve.  The medical services of the State are in sound hands at the moment.  I support the Government amendment because I believe in it.  I thank Deputy Cooper-Flynn for sharing her time with me and I thank the Minister for his initiatives to date, particularly in regard to the elderly. Ultimately we all hope to reach that status because the alternative is even less appealing.  I commend what the Minister has done.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion and I congratulate Deputy Shortall, who is committed to improvements in the health care sector on her initiative in raising this vital issue.</P>
      <P>Nothing defines the conservative nature of this Government better than its rigid refusal to live up to its commitment to deal with the plight of patients waiting for hospital procedures in public hospitals.  These procedures are so essential that for some patients they are a matter of life and death.  There are cost implications in dealing with waiting lists but if a Government cannot make the required changes now, one cannot envisage a time when a government will ever be able to act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some patients are dying as they wait in the queue.  Others are undergoing pain and suffering and a reduced quality of life that is simply unacceptable.  We do not need to be reminded by the Minister that this is not a new phenomenon which has appeared since this Government took office.  However, we live in an extraordinary time when the Minister for Finance can reward the <Col N="837" /> wealthy in the budget, when fortunes are made on every property deal and when prosperity is unprecedented for some.</P>
    <P>It is hard to understand that in such a climate an elderly woman can be left disabled for months while she waits for a hip replacement, an old man cannot see properly because he is waiting for a cataract operation and a child fails to perform at school because he or she is waiting for a grommet operation.  Over 30,000 patients are on hospital waiting lists at present.  We do not know the exact figure.  The Minister gave a stout defence of his position with regard to information on hospital waiting lists but one can only go so far in chasing supposed ghosts on the lists.  It is time to publish them.</P>
    <P>The central point is that if the people on hospital waiting lists had sufficient money, they could get the procedures they are waiting for without undue delay.  However, because they are poor they are denied medical attention to the point where some of them might even die.  It is deeply offensive that this should be so and that this situation is maintained at a time of plenty.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil was quick enough to sense the public desire for action and it promised to tackle the waiting lists when in Government.  However, now that it is in Government it has taken a U-turn on this promise.  The Minister for Health and Children lacked the necessary leadership and determination to make radical changes in order to achieve significant improvements in this area.  His defence is robust but the record is plain.  The objective is clear to Members who are committed to radical change.  It is outlined in the health strategy of 1994 which states that access to health care should be determined by actual need for services rather than the ability to pay or geographic location.</P>
    <P>The means to reach that objective are also clear.  First, a targeted waiting list initiative should be implemented in all important areas in the same way as the Minister has targeted the cardiac services, an initiative started by his predecessor. Other specialities must be resourced.  Orthopaedic procedures such as hip replacement operations, ENT procedures for children and adults and opthalmology and cataract operations must be dealt with also.</P>
    <P>Second, the issue of manpower must be addressed.  Setting up another forum, as the Minister has, will not deal with the problems that exist in our public hospitals.  There are too few consultants, their contracts are too loose and there are too many junior hospital doctors with not enough training to upgrade their status.  What is needed is a modern specialist provided service, but what exists is an archaic consultant-led service which is incapable of meeting the central objective of the health strategy.  The Tierney report has outlined what needs to be done and people such as Professor Muiris Fitzgerald and others have spelt out in detail the decisions that must be made.</P>
    <P>The difficulty lies with the Government and the fact that there does not appear to be a genuine <Col N="838" /> inclination to modernise our public hospital service or to make the decisions necessary to provide the conditions where doctors are appointed to specialist posts at an early enough age; where a high quality fast track specialist training programme provides the extra specialists that are needed; where the training authority is integrated; where female doctors, who now constitute the majority of medical graduates, are not lost to the service; where graduates do not leave the country in such numbers and where patients get the best possible treatment regardless of where they come from and whether they are public or private patients.</P>
    <P>There are also problems in accident and emergency units.  Not long ago a 93 year old man suffering from a stroke was left on a hospital trolley for 24 hours because he was not given a hospital bed.  That indicates the seriousness of the problems. Manpower restructuring would assist in making accident and emergency units more efficient.  There is a problem with turnover in manpower.  If one goes to an out-patients clinic in the first week in July the profile of doctors, apart from the consultant, is changed and rarely does one encounter a doctor one has met previously. Doctors stay longer in the television series &ldquo;ER&rdquo; than in Irish accident and emergency units.  The use of expensive equipment must be changed so that it is used more efficiently, if possible on a 24-hour basis.  Bed blocking, where hospital beds are occupied inappropriately, must also be addressed.</P>
    <P>These problems will not be solved overnight. However, the Minister has a responsibility to provide a well funded strategy &mdash; there is no way around the cost implications &mdash; to deal with one of the key priorities of this Government's programme, the waiting lists.  The Minister referred to geographic imbalance and I welcome the fact that he is tackling that problem.  There clearly is a requirement to reconfigure services to ensure that geographic handicap is tackled.</P>
    <P>In essence, good management, courageous decisions, vision and foresight are required. When the Minister was appointed he had a reputation for determination and tenacity.  Unfortunately, there is general disappointment that in office he has not made the expected significant impact.  I accept the problems are not solely his responsibility and that he is dependent on others, particularly with regard to funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has clearly won the battle with regard to whatever ambitions the Minister for Health and Children had on taking office.  Nevertheless, the latter has the responsibility of fighting his corner at Cabinet and he must accept that it is unacceptable, at a time of such prosperity, that so many poor people are condemned to waiting in growing desperation for proper hospital care.</P>
    <P>The objective and the means are clear.  They have been set out by people who were conscious of the inequities in our hospital service and who are committed &mdash; many are professionals within the health service &mdash; to providing the best possible <Col N="839" /> care but are prevented from so doing because of a lack of political will to face up to issues such as manpower, bed blocking, the problems in accident and emergency units and geographic imbalance. These are the key elements that must be tackled in dealing with waiting lists, rather than relying on the desperate hope that half the people on the waiting lists are not real or are not really sick.  They are sick and they require the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept the motion proposed by Deputy Shortall.  It sets out what must be done if the problem of waiting lists is to be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate but I am frightened by the attitude of the Minister to the proposals before the House.  He does not appear to be aware of the crisis in the health service.  I do not suggest the solution is easy but telling the House that everything is hunky dory is extremely dangerous and will make it difficult for the Minister to tackle the problem effectively.</P>
      <P>The motion is designed to address the severe funding problems facing our health service.  It is a constructive motion that proposes to establish clear targets for health spending as a proportion of GDP.  The indexing of health spending will enable our health service to plan strategically for the needs of the future.  At the moment this does not happen and it is a key problem with the operation of health services.  A large section of our health service stumbles along from crisis to crisis. This cannot be allowed to continue.  We must ensure that the benefits of economic growth are invested in our health service for the benefit of the community as a whole.  We must also ensure that the increased funding this motion would direct towards our health budget is invested in a way that produces real benefits for patients and staff.</P>
      <P>It is beyond doubt that a review of our funding for health services is urgently needed.  For example, the two main general hospitals that serve the people of Kildare are starved of resources.  The resulting waiting list crisis and overcrowding problems facing Naas General Hospital and the James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown are intolerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, a programme is now in place to deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday a delegation from the Irish Hospital Consultants Association visited Naas General Hospital.  They expressed their horror at the conditions they found there.  They described the facilities in the hospital as Dickensian and their observations are a damning indictment of the funding system operated by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996, the then Minister for Health, Deputy <Col N="840" /> Noonan, announced a £20 million investment programme for the hospital, yet the people of Kildare still have to endure the appalling conditions that pertain in one of the main general hospitals that serves the area.  The Minister should explain to this House why, given that £20 million had been approved for the hospital since 1996, no significant improvement in services to the public are visible.  What action is the Minister taking to tackle the crisis affecting Naas General Hospital?  Will he give a response to the comments of the delegation from the Irish Hospital Consultants Association?  Will he give a commitment today to the people of my constituency and the people served by my colleague in Kildare South, Deputy Jack Wall, that he will take immediate action to resolve the problems and ensure the necessary funding to eliminate the horrific conditions, which staff and patients in the hospital have to endure, will be eliminated as a matter of urgency?</P>
    <P>The problem facing James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown is equally grave.  The catchment area for James Connolly Memorial Hospital is one of the fastest growing population areas in the country, taking in most of the large towns in north Kildare and many large population centres in Dublin West.  There are thousands of young families in that area and the hospital cannot cope with the demand on its services. Patients have to endure appalling delays, overcrowded wards and an accident and emergency service that quite often cannot cope with the demands placed upon it.  By the Minister's admission, it is likely to be the year 2002 before significant improvements in the capacity of the hospital will be seen by the staff and patients.  In the intervening period the erratic level of service will continue.</P>
    <P>These are just two examples of the pressure on health services affecting the people of Kildare. Deputies from all constituencies can cite similar examples of serious health service deficiencies in their areas.  It is clear that our present health budget is insufficient to cope with the demands placed upon it.  I appreciate there has been an increase in spending, but it is not sufficient.  More funding is needed.  I do not accept that the provision of extra beds &mdash; it is demonstrably clear they are needed &mdash; is bad use of money, as Deputy Flynn seemed to indicate.</P>
    <P>The intent of this motion is not just to highlight deficiencies.  It also proposes a system of funding that will resolve these major deficiencies by proposing a system of multi-annual budgeting, linked to a measurable figure of economic growth throughout the State.  A funding system such as this allows for strategic planning of our health services within a proper budgetary framework. The motion would also enable transparent and measurable targets to be established.  This would not only assist in the administration of our health system but it would also introduce a level of democratic accountability that is currently absent from our system. <Col N="841" /> The complex system of health administration mitigates against real transparency and accountability. The layers of administration and red tape in the Department of Health and Children, the various health boards, independent hospitals and State-assisted voluntary organisations prevents many ordinary citizens from understanding the organisation and delivery of our health services and where responsibility lies for policy and administration in each area.  By establishing measurable targets, ordinary citizens will be able to judge the performance of individual Ministers in enhancing our health services over a sustained period.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend this motion to the House.  It has not been placed before the House in a belligerent or obstructive fashion.  My colleague, Deputy Shortall, has been eager to avoid political point-scoring in this debate and I commend her on her approach.  Deputy Shortall, in common with all members of the Labour Party, has a passionate political desire to improve the health services available to citizens.  The Labour Party believes the State is the only appropriate vehicle to deliver a comprehensive health care system to the citizens.  This must be a priority for the State.  This motion underscores that principle and provides an open and transparent way for successive administrations to achieve this goal.  I urge the House to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin" hpid="Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  Every day of the week I deal with a huge number of complaints from constituents about lengthy delays they experience within the health system.  The position is so bad in the Southern Health Board region that last Monday the chairperson and chief executive officer of the health board met Oireachtas Members from Kerry to highlight the chronic difficulties being experienced at present.  They also met Members from Cork and requested an urgent meeting with the Minister to outline the problems.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board seems to be penalised because it is a prudent manager of the funding it receives.  It should be complimented for working under such severe pressure.  That health board was led to believe that if it managed its budget well, increased funding would be made available to it, but that did not materialise.  Morale among the staff is very low.  It is unacceptable the Southern Health Board does not receive a fair crack of the whip.  The CT scanner in Cork University Hospital was mentioned.  It is outrageous that it has broken down on six occasions in the past four months, necessitating very ill patients to be transferred to the Mercy Hospital.  That has resulted in delays in reaching diagnoses and extra expense on the health board.</P>
      <P>Waiting lists in Tralee Regional Hospital are at an unacceptable level.  Approximately 260 women have to wait for up to a year for treatment in the gynaecological section.  There are approximately 2,700 people on the waiting list for ENT referrals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> There are up to 400 children awaiting appointment to see a paediatrician.  Those children will have to wait a further year before treatment is available to them.  In excess of 400 children from County Kerry are awaiting speech therapy and they will have to wait for a further 18 months.  By the time those children receive therapy it will be too late.  There are more than 600 children in Kerry awaiting orthodontic treatment following assessment.</P>
    <P>Another issue which concerns me is the treatment of home helps in the Southern Health Bord area.  Because of lack of funding those people receive the lowest rate of pay in the country at £1.70 per hour &mdash; that will be increased to £2 in July.  In other health boards the rate is £3.50 to £4 per hour.  Is the work carried out by home helps in Kerry and Cork worth less than that in other parts of the country?  The low rate of pay undermines the valuable work performed by those people and makes it very difficult for families to find people willing to work as home helps. It is a credit to the 2,000 home helps in the Southern Health Board area that, despite the extremely low rate of pay, they provide a very good quality service.  Many of those wonderful people go beyond the call of duty and work longer hours than those for which they are paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister should immediately proceed with plans to investigate the operation of home help services throughout the country and put in place structures to provide more reasonable pay and conditions in all health board areas.  If families cannot get home help, a larger number of people will have to go into long stay care, at greater expense to the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The Kerry Rape Crisis Centre is experiencing great difficulties because of lack of funding.  I implore the Minister to make £20,000 available to enable the centre continue its wonderful work.  Like all other rape crisis centres, it offers a very professional service and the commitment shown by all its staff is commendable.  Its work is of the highest quality.  If the health board were to deliver such a service, the current grant available to the Kerry Rape Crisis Centre would cover the cost of employing only two counsellors.  Under its current budget, the health board would simply not be able to deliver the range of services offered by the centre.</P>
    <P>Unless the centre receives additional funding in the near future, it will have to shed two staff members, open for shorter periods and will not be in a position to accept new referrals.  It received ten new referrals in one week last month.  Due to the lack of staff at the centre it will not be in a position to carry out some of its vital work.  For example, it will not be able to accompany clients to court, a service which makes a major difference to victims.  The majority of people who use the service are women and children who do not have a voice.  It is incumbent on me as a public representative from Kerry to <Col N="843" /> ensure this much needed service is kept at its current level.  I implore the Minister to make that money available to the centre.</P>
    <P>If I had more time to speak I would outline many other areas of need, but I am sure the Minister is well aware of the chronic circumstances.  I sincerely hope these issues will be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on my party's motion on health spending. I have always believed a nation can be judged on how it caters for the elderly, the sick and the handicapped.  We have an obligation now more than ever to ensure the fruits of our economic boom filter through to all sections of the community.</P>
      <P>In doing so, primary services such as health must be improved to a standard which means people do not have to wait and suffer before their needs are tended to.  Quality health care services are the key to the development of an economy. Unless we can deliver basic health services to all who require them, we have not reached a satisfactory state of development and all the talk about the Celtic tiger is meaningless guff.</P>
      <P>Social partnership lies at the root of our economic success.  To achieve this success workers, in particular, have made major sacrifices.  In return &mdash; most notably in the tax reforms delivered in the December budget &mdash; these people have not benefited proportionately.  It is time to deliver on the principles of Partnership 2000.  If we are to achieve social inclusion and equality in our society, basic vital services like health care must be accessible to everyone and not to the cheque book brigade.  There is no doubt we have a twotier health service.  In the 1960s my family valued the medical card because it provided access to many places.  A medical card no longer guarantees a bed in a hospital for a hip replacement operation, one must go on a waiting list. However, if one can produce £5,000, one will have access to the services within a few weeks.  A person from Kilbeggan waiting for a hip replacement operation brought this to my attention last week.  How can we stand over that type of service? Even if I were in Government I would suggest that we cannot plough enough money into the health services to ensure equality of access for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must change its policy of spending money where it is least needed and start building the foundations for a truly inclusive society.  Our economic growth means nothing to the ill person who is turned away from hospital because of the lack of a bed in a casualty ward or inability to pay for a hip operation.  What does it mean to the elderly person who cannot afford home care or secure a place in a nursing home due to a lack of space?  What does it mean to the hundreds of people who are waiting for organ transplants or the 1,000 or more waiting for cardiac <Col N="844" /> surgery?  Many of these people come from a background like mine where there were no silver spoons.  People do not mind waiting, but they should not have to wait for more than 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very familiar with the Midland Health Board area.  As a recent patient in Mullingar hospital, I express my gratitude to the staff in casualty, the ward service, the professionals, nurses and attendants for their professionalism and kindness.  However, there was an obvious lack of nursing staff in the hospital.  A submission in this regard was made to the Midland Health Board by the Irish Nurses' Organisation some months ago, but nothing happened.  I accept the Minister provided a sum of £1.5 million, but he knows £3 million was required.  All developments have been postponed until September.  As some 2,000 patients pass through the accident and emergency service on a monthly basis, more staff must be provided.  I ask the Minister to intervene directly with the Midland Health Board to ensure it considers the recent submission received from the hospital.</P>
    <P>We made a small change to the medical card system, but it was not enough.  Eligibility should be determined on the basis of net income.  Illnesses such as asthma and ME should be included on the list of long-term illnesses.  I lost an uncle and aunt from asthma, which is a serious illness. Coming from a family with a history of asthma and bronchitis, I get extremely angry when I hear professionals claim asthma is not a long-term illness. Perhaps those professionals should talk to people who have lost loved ones or suffer from asthma.</P>
    <P>When will the Minister be in a position to approve the necessary funding for the pathology services plan approved by the Midland Health Board at its April meeting?  This service would bring major improvements to all three hospitals in the midlands region, with microbiology being centred in Portlaoise, histopathology with fine needle aspination cytology in Tullamore and haematology in Mullingar.  Obviously, the principal function of the haematology unit will be a laboratory to guarantee the use of blood products to the highest level for all patients in the midland area, irrespective of which hospital they attend.  The same should apply in respect of the other services. In light of the major laboratory needs in the midlands, I urge the Minister to press ahead as a matter of urgency to develop these units in Tullamore, Mullingar and Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>When will the Minister give approval to proceed with phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath general hospital in Mullingar, bearing in mind that it has already been shelled out in conjunction with phase 2A?  Phase 2B will increase the number of medical beds in the hospital which are urgently needed because the old nightingale wards are less than satisfactory areas for patient care.  Those wards do not afford patients any degree of privacy, particularly where extra beds have to be put in place on a regular basis.  Phase 2B will also mean replacement of the current theatre block <Col N="845" /> which, while it has been well maintained over the years, is moving rapidly to obsolescence.</P>
    <P>The Minister set up a commission some time ago to examine the implementation of orthodontic services.  I would not need much time to outline the problems to him.  It is ridiculous that, because a young child has a growth in the mouth that is less than a millimetre outside limits set back in the early 1980s, the child is deprived of a service.  People have had to borrow £1,500 or more from the credit unions to have their children treated.  I know the Minister has a strong commitment to the health service and I implore him to bring the report forward as quickly as possible.  I commend my colleague for tabling this motion.  If I became somewhat emotional about the asthma issue it was because of personal circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all of the Deputies who participated in this debate.  The discussion has been wide ranging and the number of issues raised clearly shows how central the health services are to the lives of all of our constituents. I share the view put forward by many speakers that, where we are in a position to provide resources for improved public services, there is no more deserving area than our health services.</P>
      <P>In line with this thinking, the Government has already provided significant increased funding for the health services.  The net non-capital provision for health in 1998 shows a 10 per cent increase over and above the 1997 outturn.  The capital allocation which has been agreed on a multi-annual basis shows an increase of about 35 per cent for the period 1998 to 2000 over the outcome for the previous three year period.</P>
      <P>In my role as Minister of State with special responsibility for children I would like to summarise briefly the developments which have taken place and are being proposed in this important area.  As Deputies will be aware, since 1993 and up to the end of 1997 an additional £43.5 million on an annualised basis has been invested in the development of child care and family support services.  In 1998, an additional £8 million has been made available for the child care area together with £5 million for capital purposes.  This is a significant level of investment which will allow for the further development of our child care services.</P>
      <P>The question of resources is central and my Department is currently negotiating with the Department of Finance on the Estimates for the period 1999-2001 with a view to ensuring that child care provision is properly funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties I encountered when I took up my present responsibilities was that the child care policy unit of my Department, which plays a central role in driving policy developments in the health service, was totally under resourced.  I dealt with this issue and I have secured the agreement of the Minister for Finance to the creation of an additional 16 posts in <Col N="846" /> this area.  This is in addition to the existing 11 posts.</P>
    <P>The increase in staff will allow for rapid progress in implementing commitments in the Government programme as well as in other significant areas.  One of these is the proposed social services inspectorate.  My Department is now in a position to commence recruitment for this inspectorate which will play a central role in monitoring the standard of our child care services.</P>
    <P>There are specific commitments relating to children in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium and these are being implemented.  In particular, the Children Bill, 1996, has been restored to the Order Paper and the Government amendments are currently being finalised.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to bringing forward proposals for the mandatory reporting of child abuse within the lifetime of the present Dáil and, as a preliminary measure, a White Paper is being prepared on this complex issue.  Services to address child begging, child homelessness and child prostitution are being improved.  The problem is particularly acute in the Eastern Health Board area and this is where resources are being concentrated.</P>
    <P>Other issues will also be addressed now that I have the additional staff required.  Generally, we must recognise that our child care services have made huge strides since implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991 commenced and, while much remains to be done, we owe it to those involved in the delivery of services to acknowledge the progress and to recognise the achievements. Criticism for the sake of criticism is sterile and unproductive and it benefits nobody.  I regret the contributions of some Deputies yesterday fell into that trap.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the specifics of the Labour Party motion.  It seeks to commit the Government to setting a target figure for public health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product.  I do not remember Labour having put forward this suggestion when last in Government.  I was interested to see if during this debate it would specify what percentage it considers to be appropriate. While I held out little hope, I would have been even more interested to hear its proposals for funding any increase required.  In any event, while there is a need for measured increases in the health budget, I consider this proposal to be overly crude.</P>
    <P>The relationship between national income and health expenditure is but one of the factors which explain levels of health expenditure in different countries.  We should be wary of creating an artificial link which is of little use in planning over the medium term.  The health problems we are faced with and the availability of cost-effective responses to these should be the starting point in debates about resource allocation.  For example, work has already begun in my Department on the implications for our services of the ageing of the population.  The development of clearly thought <Col N="847" /> out strategies for tackling such issues based on the cost-effective provision of services allows us to decide on priorities and allocate resources accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, are taking a particular interest in a major move forward in the area of strategies for the elderly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Shortall and I thank the Labour Party for allowing me to contribute at this time.  I have raised the issue of home helps before in the House.  Last February the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt replied to my question and said he hoped that by now we would have doubled the payment rate per hour for home helps within the Western Health Board's area.  That has not happened. The 24p per hour increase is an insult to those who do valuable work.  I thought home helps were badly paid in the Western Health Board's area but when I heard Deputy Moynihan's statement I realised that it was not confined to that area.</P>
      <P>The Minister's officials should examine the work being done nationwide by home helps.  They should see the money that is saved by these people who visit the homes of friends and neighbours in need on a casual basis.  Such people are paid for one hour &mdash; or two hours if the health boards are being over generous &mdash; per day to enable elderly people to live at home.  People should realise that the Government, health boards and taxpayers are making massive savings through the work of home helps.</P>
      <P>If these people received an allowance of £4 to £5 we would have a far better health care service for the elderly in their own homes.  Disabled pensioners are entitled to that.</P>
      <P>I also wish to highlight the schools dental service in the Western Health Board area.  The Loughrea area was without a schools dental service for two years because of the ill health of the previous holder of that post.  After a long struggle, during which temporary appointments were made time and time again, a full time person was eventually appointed.  However, that dental surgeon provided one day's service and was gone.</P>
      <P>I do not know what must be done to attract people to provide a schools dental service in the Western Health Board area.  Some urgent action must be taken to rectify that impossible situation. Children have gone without a school dental service for three years.  Who will take the responsibility for the damage that has been done in that period?  I plead with the Minister to do something about this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Opposition benches highlighted the negative aspects, I acknowledge the improvements, particularly in relation to University College Hospital, Galway.  This is a major hospital in the west and it is important that essential specialised <Col N="848" /> services are fully developed there so that people do not have to be transported to Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this important debate.  Last night I moved a motion on our health services on behalf of the Labour Party.  The motion identified some of the huge unmet needs across various health areas.  It referred to our low level of spending on health compared to other OECD countries and called on the Government to set new targets for spending which would correspond with our new found increased economic wealth.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahy, made derogatory remarks about the motion and asked why we had suddenly decided to move it now.</P>
      <P>The emphasis in the past few years has been on developing our economy and we have had great success in that regard.  Having generated such wealth in the country, we now need to consider making serious efforts to develop our society. There is no feel good factor from our booming economy because there are so many gaps in our society.  We should look at where we are going as a society and try to have a yardstick to measure the spending required in different areas.  For that reason, I suggest that we link our spending in health to the OECD figures and that we measure ourselves against the amount spent in other countries to reach an OECD average.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahy, also asked how these measures would be funded.  Decisions on funding and spending are taken by Government at budget time.  Unfortunately, many of the decisions taken in the last budget were bad for our society.  Many of the choices made by the Government on how to spend money were bad because they put money back into the pockets of people who did not need it.  Money was not spent where it was most needed and the Government avoided making the necessary choices to improve our health services.</P>
      <P>The Government has responded with a meaningless and self-congratulatory amendment which completely fails to address the issues raised.  The purpose of the motion was not to slate the Government but to raise issues of genuine public concern and to look at what we can do about them.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Cowen, has difficulty accepting that some people are interested in having mature debate in this House. He seems incapable of addressing issues in an open manner.  He is defensive about his own position and trots out various things he has done without looking at the core issue of how to link spending in health to our economic growth so that our health services are not ignored, regardless of what Administration is in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion seeks to address the problems people face while they are waiting in hospital corridors, in doctors' surgeries and on treatment waiting lists or those faced by people who are isolated in their homes because they are denied access to health services.  No Deputy can claim to <Col N="849" /> be unaware of these serious difficulties and the human costs involved.  We need a funding framework to ensure these problems are tackled effectively.</P>
    <P>Our health system is in dire need of investment. There are 32,000 people on hospital waiting lists, several hundred elderly people are misplaced in acute hospital beds who should have nursing home care, over 3,000 mentally handicapped people are without a place and countless children at risk of abuse or neglect are without any service.  The message being sent to the vulnerable and weak is that there is no place for them in our society.  No matter how we try to put a gloss on our response by using the language of caring, we have been remiss in the practicalities of caring for our most vulnerable people.  The inclusiveness we readily advocate when we talk of bonding communities in Northern Ireland is lost when it comes to looking after the ill, the disabled or the elderly in our community.</P>
    <P>The Government has tabled an amendment which means nothing other than the maintenance of the <i>status quo.</i>  No one will get to the treatment table any quicker and children at risk will not see a social worker a day earlier.  All is fine in the Department of Health and Children as long as &ldquo;we are beginning to converge towards international averages&rdquo;.  We are coming from the wrong end and we are not getting there fast enough.</P>
    <P>At a time of unprecedented wealth, it is indefensible on social and moral grounds that our health services are desperately inadequate.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, used some familiar excuses yesterday evening.  He said that in countries with historically low GNP, health spending was low in tandem.  Yet at a time when our GNP has dramatically improved, the OECD has found that the share of GNP devoted to health in this country has gone from one of the highest to one of the lowest at approximately 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>In its amendment the Government refers to its commitments in An Action Plan for the Millennium. However, when it comes to establishing the funding framework to meet these commitments, the Government stops short.  The most important commitment it can give is a commitment to provide <Col N="850" /> the necessary resources.  Money and mouth are easily separated.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is not saying we should fix health spending to GDP just for the sake of it. The purpose of the motion is to impress upon the Government the absolute need to prioritise health as an important aim of Government and to provide it with some form of dedicated means. Lack of dedication is essentially what is wrong with our health service.  Our commitment to health spending is conditional each year on the prevailing generosity of the Minister for Health and Children.  In other words, there is little relationship between what is allocated and what is needed.</P>
    <P>This motion seeks two commitments from the Government.  The first is to set a target for itself to spend a set proportion of GDP on health annually and the second is to target spending in those areas of chronic need so that they are brought up to a basic level.  The Labour Party has identified five key areas which need Government support and where lack of funding has created enormous hardship.  We agree with the Minister that there must be a relationship between spending and the amount of overall funds available in every health care system.  Making a link with GDP conforms perfectly to that principle.  If the economy is buoyant, as it is at present, that buoyancy should be reflected in improved health investment.</P>
    <P>It is essential that as well as auditing our finances we start to audit our needs.  The needs in health are great.  The mentally handicapped need £63 million for the provision of adequate services.  The many people on waiting lists need treatment.  The child care service needs to be properly resourced &mdash; the Minister has already accepted that £100 million is needed in that area &mdash; and various other needs have been listed here during this debate.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to improve the health services.  The assumption underlying it is that to do so will require a considerable increase in investment.  However, problems exist in ensuring there is a long-term commitment to the health service.  One way of ensuring an ongoing commitment is to link health spending to GDP so that our increased wealth, in turn, can bring increased social benefit.  I urge the House to support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Partnership Tralee has forwarded documentation to the Minister's Department requesting that a local employment service be provided for the Tralee area.  I understand the Minister's Department is carrying out an evaluation of the existing 20 or so local employment service areas in the country and will shortly make his decision on the successful areas of the next programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local employment service plan presented by Partnership Tralee is a response to the identified needs of the people in their community who continue to be economically and socially excluded in a time of unprecedented growth.  It is the culmination of a long and thorough process that began with the contacts, relationships and networking initiated in the pre-partnership days of 1992 and through to the present time.  The process has resulted in learning for all the partners and this learning is informing the development of new employment services.  The plan has been researched and written by people directly involved at all levels in the partnership including the manager, board members, staff, people on <Col N="853" /> sub-committees and individuals who have identified with their goal of dismantling barriers that prevent people from fully participating in society.</P>
    <P>The following is a breakdown of unemployment figures in the partnership area.  As of December 1997, the total number of people signing on the live register was 4,343; the figures are higher now.  The number of males under the age of 25 is 525 and the figure for males over 25 is 2,227.  The number of unemployed females under the age of 25 is 375 while the number of females over 25 is 1,220.  Obviously there is a major problem in the older group and the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the area covered by Partnership Tralee is Ireland in microcosm.  There is a long established town with sprawling new coastal and rural areas of rich land but also areas of marginal land.  Anything that affects Ireland nationally is reflected in the partnership area like a mirror image.  Ireland has the fastest growing economy in Europe with a growth rate of over 8 per cent in 1997.  This is mirrored in Tralee with an unprecedented growth in construction in the town of new hotels and apartment blocks.  Just as Ireland has a large number of people out of the labour market, so too has Tralee with approximately 2,500 people in the town on the live register. Many more who are not active in the labour market are not counted in that figure.</P>
    <P>Although Tralee has developed enormously in the past few years, a large number of people continue to experience social exclusion because of economic disadvantage, as evidenced by the high rate of long-term unemployment.  The overall unemployment rate in Partnership Tralee is approaching 20 per cent, which is well above the national average.  In certain parts of Tralee the rate is as high as 75 or 80 per cent.  There are up to 5,000 people covered by the Tralee social welfare services office at any one time.</P>
    <P>These figures also highlight the huge growth in the numbers unemployed over the past ten years and the serious local problems of unemployment look set to continue.  Tralee has been hit recently by the closure of Klopman and the running down of Kerry Fashions.  Generally, Tralee has received few new industries to replace the ones which we have lost apart from recently opened Kleinhuis, which, although welcome, is a relatively small industry.</P>
    <P>The draft development plan of Tralee Urban District Council projects that the workforce in the Tralee urban area alone will continue to grow until the year 2011 by 41.3 per cent.  The plan states that to obtain full employment by the year 2011 approximately 2,000 additional jobs per annum will be needed and at the present rate this seems impossible.</P>
    <P>In the period from 1980 to 1998 a total of about 2,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Tralee and they were not replaced.  These manufacturing job losses were mostly among unskilled labour. They account for the bulk of job losses in the area since 1980.  The majority of these workers are still <Col N="854" /> unemployed.  The lack of job opportunities, coupled with an increase in the local labour supply and the lack of opportunities abroad, has exacerbated the situation.  The people who have not been in regular paid employment since 1980 are now likely to have outdated skills, little work experience and even less hope or confidence in the future.</P>
    <P>That is why it is important that a local employment service plan be provided for Tralee to build up skills.  The service would work closely with local employers to determine their needs, especially their training requirements.  It would also build up the skills and education of this pool of people.</P>
    <P>Whereas Tralee may be doing well in the tourism industry and in the services area, it has not succeeded in the manufacturing area.  I appeal to the Minister to seriously consider Tralee for a local employment service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The local employment service was established on foot of the central recommendation in the Interim Report of the Task Force on Long-term Unemployment in February 1995 that a national, integrated local employment service be put in place to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed to assist them re-enter the workforce.  The aim of the service is to &ldquo;provide the gateway or access point to the full range of options which should be available to enable a long-term unemployed person return to the world of work &mdash; these would include guidance, training, education and employment supports&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The service is operating in 18 areas throughout the country, namely, Cork city, south Kerry, County Waterford, northside Dublin, inner city Dublin, County Wexford, Mayo, Dundalk, Tallaght, Finglas/Cabra, Limerick city, Ballymun, Kildare, Clare, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Ballyfermot and Drogheda.  To date, the service has engaged with a total of 22,900 clients.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness commits the Government to the development of an effective public employment service, including the phased expansion of the LES &ldquo;initially to areas of concentrated unemployment, such that the LES will have commenced in all designated partnership areas during the period of the Partnership&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is the intention to honour that commitment. At present officials in the Department are examining how the service could be expanded this year and the Estimates for the Department this year will allow for an expansion.  The Department has met PLANET, the area partnerships' network, and with the Area Development Management to consider possible areas for implementation of the service during 1998.  Submissions have also been received from a number of areas canvassing for the introduction of the service.  Analysis of the candidate areas is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pace of expansion of the service and the <Col N="855" /> likely locations for this year's phase are currently being considered in detail, particularly in the context of the needs and preparedness of areas.  I am anxious that the areas which could be approved this year are the most appropriate in terms of those two criteria.  The Tánaiste hopes to be in a position soon to receive the recommended names and she will then put a memorandum to Government seeking approval for the expansion.</P>
    <P>Analysis of the proposed expansion takes place against the general background of the development of an enhanced employment-placement service by FÁS and a move, consistent with the EU employment guidelines, towards a preventative rather than curative approach to unemployment. This approach is set out in the Employment Action Plan approved by the Government on 7 April 1998, and subsequently published and submitted to the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>The enhancement of placement services and the more systematic engagement with unemployed persons will have implications for the LES, specifically for the relationship of each LES with FÁS.  It will be important to ensure that there is a complementarity in services provided. Given such complementarity and a clear focus on those at greatest remove from the labour market, the LES can play an important role as part of an employment service integrating it in its aims and approaches.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate the complexity of the question of expanding the LES and ensuring that the employment services generally are structured in a manner which makes optimal use of resources and serves the needs of the unemployed.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and assure him that the representations and the case he has made will be taken on board in our consideration of this request for an expanded LES service in this area.  I assure him also that submissions have been made on behalf of the area by his colleague, Deputy Foley.  Collectively, the Deputy can be certain we will give both of those submission strong consideration.</P>
    <P>The Department is fully aware of the unemployment problem in Tralee.  Officials in the Department have met a representative from the Tralee Partnership and have received detailed reports on the partnership's new employment services which are designed as a forerunner to the LES.  These consultations are an integral part of the analysis which is nearing completion.  The expansion of the LES in this as in other years will be made on objective criteria.  I assure the Deputy that the case of Tralee <i>vis-à-vis</i> other areas will be made and examined on its merits before a final decision is recommended to Government.</P>

      <P>Given the difficulties I encountered in raising this matter in the Dáil yesterday, I am particularly pleased there has been a change of heart and that the Minister of State is here to reply to the debate.</P>
      <P>The loss of 150 jobs in Duhallow, 120 at Alps in Millstreet and 31 at Keatings in Kanturk is a major blow to the local economy.  It is to the local region what Seagate was to Clonmel, what Asahi was to Killala and what Packard Electric was to Tallaght.  Consequently, I am looking for a similar response from the Government for Duhallow as was delivered to those other regions.</P>
      <P>Specifically, I want a task force established which is accountable to the Minister whose primary responsibility will be to attract additional inward investment and job opportunities to the area.  Like previous initiatives, the task force should consist of somebody from IDA Ireland, the local authority, the local enterprise board and representatives of local community and business groups.  With adequate resources and specific objectives, the present crisis can be resolved by such a task force.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has a significant land bank in the region &mdash; more than 5 acres in Millstreet, more than 6 acres in Kanturk and more than 8 acres in Charleville.  There has been no development in those land banks for more than ten years.  An analysis of new job announcements in the greater Cork region over the past 12 months confirms that they are either extensions to existing plants or new companies moving into existing vacant advance factories. It is obvious, therefore, that for Millstreet, Kanturk and Charleville to compete for new jobs, a mechanism has to be found to put advance factories on these sites.  Only then will the region be able to compete for new jobs.  This should be the first objective of the task force.</P>
      <P>Alps in Millstreet and Keatings of Kanturk have been valued employers in the region for many years.  With regard to Alps, it has to be hoped that the company can regain its former position of strength in terms of numbers employed in Millstreet as quickly as possible. However, the loss of 120 jobs highlights the excessive dependency of the local economy on one large multinational employer and is another good reason additional employment opportunities should be created locally.  It is not only the 120 jobs in Millstreet and the 31 jobs in Kanturk but the associated service jobs in transport and other related areas which will also be lost when these jobs no longer exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Finance Bill of 1998, my colleagues and I in Fine Gael sought the inclusion of the Duhallow region in the rural renewal pilot scheme.  This was rejected by the Government.  I urge the Minister not to deliver a second body blow to the region and to proceed immediately with the establishment of a task force. <Col N="857" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my dissatisfaction and regret at the recent job losses in Alps Electric (Ireland) Limited in Millstreet and Keatings in Kanturk.  This comes as a body blow to the workers of both towns and the general catchment area who have been made redundant. I sympathise with the workers who have lost their jobs.  Those with families, mortgages and children will find it increasingly difficult to meet their financial commitments.</P>
      <P>These closures are not acceptable.  I want a commitment from the Minister that positive action will be taken in the Duhallow area.  When does the Minister expect this area to be highlighted as one which needs significant job creation to maintain it as a vibrant community? Cork North-West, and particularly the northern side of the constituency, has not benefited from the Celtic tiger economy.  It is unacceptable that while jobs are being announced throughout the country Cork North-West and particularly my native Duhallow, are getting nothing.  We are faced instead with job losses.  It is time to turn this trend around.</P>
      <P>As its representative I cannot allow the deterioration of this area to continue.  As a young person it seems to me that Duhallow has never mattered. It has been completely ignored by successive Governments.  I am now calling for a stop to this unacceptable treatment.  I am demanding action.  Nothing has been done and it is the perception that nothing will be done.  This must be reversed.  I acknowledge the efforts of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to date.  The representative of the IDA, Mr. Paddy Gallagher, visited Duhallow in the past two to three weeks.  It is the first time this happened, and I commend him for doing so.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that Deputy Creed has taken such an interest in Duhallow.  The major body blow was the decision to allow Alps Electric to build their extension in Killarney and not relocate it in one of the IDA's land banks in the Duhallow region, in Kanturk, Newmarket or Charleville.  I ask the Minister and the Government as a matter of urgency to prioritise the greater Duhallow area, particularly the northern part of my constituency, and ensure that employment is brought in.  Our population is declining and it is only if we provide jobs for young people that the population of this area will grow.  We must ensure that it grows to maintain the economy and the vibrancy of its community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  I share fully their disappointment over the job losses in the Millstreet and Kanturk areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Alps Electric (Ireland) Limited, which was established in May 1988 in Millstreet, County Cork, to manufacture computer peripherals, the company is a division of the Alps Corporation of Japan who are one of the world's leading manufacturers of electronic components. In addition to manufacturing computer keyboards <Col N="858" /> and input devices, the Millstreet operation also has responsibility for design, development, sales and marketing activities.</P>
    <P>In 1996 Alps established a second operation in Killarney which manufactures electronic components for the automotive industry.  The Killarney operation has been experiencing rapid growth and currently employs 190 people, which is well ahead of target.  However, in recent years Alps computer peripheral business area has experienced intense competition due to the wide availability of competing products from low cost sources.  The IDA has been very conscious of the difficult market environment facing the company and has maintained close contact with Alps both in Ireland and Japan.</P>
    <P>Despite the company's best efforts to focus on the high end of the computer peripheral market, price competition from low cost locations continued to present serious difficulties in the marketplace. Regrettably, against this deteriorating market background, the Alps Corporation has now taken a strategic decision to restructure its manufacturing operations.  This will entail a substantial scaling down of non-profitable activities in the computer peripheral business and a refocusing towards the development of the electronic automotive components business.  This in turn has resulted in the announcement of the phased reduction in the Alps workforce in Millstreet from its current level of 150 permanent and 40 temporary employees, to approximately 70 in total.  The redundancies will take place on a phased basis from the end of June to September next.  However, I understand that some of these job losses will be offset by the continuing increase in the Killarney workforce.  I am aware that the Alps Corporation has been very impressed with the quality of the workforce in Millstreet.  Its commitment to maintaining a manufacturing presence at the plant and regrowing the operation as new business is developed is tangible evidence of this commitment.  I assure the Deputies that the IDA will work actively with Alps to assist in its efforts to seek new products to introduce to the Millstreet plant.</P>
    <P>I am informed that Alps hired a specialist consultancy team to assist employees in finding alternative employment.  Potential employers and recruitment agencies will also be invited to Millstreet to meet employees at a later stage. These concrete steps by Alps to manage job losses should give every employee the opportunity to take advantage of opportunities that arise in the region.</P>
    <P>With regard to the job losses at Keatings Kanturk. the company currently employs a total of 365 people in manufacturing and distribution in two bakeries in Kanturk.  The smaller bakery, formerly Binchys, is engaged in fresh confectionery and it is this business from which the company is withdrawing.  I understand that 15 full-time employees and 20 part-time people will be let go. However, 23 people will be retained in Binchys for specialist bread work.  It is hoped that the <Col N="859" /> fresh confectionery business will be picked up by other local bakeries with potential for job creation.</P>
    <P>Overall, the Cork region has benefited substantially from industrial growth.  Last year Cork experienced one of its strongest industrial development years in history with significant growth in IDA backed companies.  A total of 1,405 new jobs were filled in IDA backed companies and this was achieved in a balanced way through expansions of the existing base of companies and the arrival of some prestigious new names.  These new start-ups and expansions should lead to further strong growth for the region in the medium term.</P>
    <P>The strength of the overseas sector is indicated by the fact that there are now 109 IDA backed companies in Cork city and county directly employing a total of 12,600 people.  These jobs also provide, through their spin-off activities, at least the same number indirectly in the local economy, making the overseas sector a critical part of the regional economy.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is not considered that a task force is required in this situation, where a co-ordinated response between the various agencies in the area is ongoing to ensure that everything possible is done to further maximise job opportunities in the region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

If the Deputy wants to dispute any of the figures, he can let me have the information he has and I will have the figures confirmed for him.  The Government is cognisant of what the Deputies have said and is aware of the seriousness of the situation.  The two companies are downsizing in the Duhallow region.  We are aware of the importance of industry to this historic region.  Deputy Moynihan has been in constant touch with my office to try to get employment into the region.  I assure the House that we are instructing the IDA, Forbairt, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise board to take serious action to ensure that investment is made in this region as quickly as possible so that we create opportunities for the employees losing their jobs as a result of the downsizing of these two companies.</P>

      <P>Herdmans (Ireland) Ltd.  has <Col N="860" /> been in Ballybofey for 30 years and has provided industrial employment in an area where such opportunities are severely limited.  Because of recent difficulties, mainly due to the downturn in the linen industry caused by the strength of sterling and the virtual collapse of the Far East market for linen, Herdmans is obliged to introduce redundancies in its plants on both sides of the Border.  Forty-one employees out of a total workforce of 108 in Ballybofey are being made redundant within the next few weeks.  This is a severe blow, not only to those who are losing their jobs but to the economy of the Finn Valley where there are so few alternative employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Many of the workers concerned have given up to 30 years devoted and loyal service.  At this stage of their working lives the prospects of other employment are almost negligible.  Unless circumstances in the Finn Valley change for the better their future would seem to be among the ranks of the unemployed.  The workers accept that these steps must be taken by the company to protect the remaining jobs.  However, our priorities must be twofold.  In the first instance we must ensure that the remaining jobs in Ballybofey remain viable and permanent.  We appreciate the company's decision to maintain operations in Ballybofey and perhaps in the future when there is an upswing in the linen market it may be able to expand the workforce.</P>
      <P>The second priority is to treat those being made redundant as generously as possible.  They are being offered statutory redundancy plus 25 per cent.  The workers are not being unreasonable. In fact they are highly responsible and are only asking for a little more, namely statutory redundancy plus 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>I understand that there is an application with the IDA for assistance to purchase new winding machines for the plant.  Will the Minister use his good office to expedite this application and do anything which can be done to improve the redundancy package?</P>
      <P>The Finn Valley area is an unemployment blackspot.  The Minister should urgently request the Department and the job creation agencies to give the establishment of jobs in the region the highest priority.  The jobs lost in Herdmans need to be replaced immediately to restore spending power in the Finn Valley area and, in particular, in the Ballybofey-Stranorlar areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this matter.  The Finn Valley area is an unemployment blackspot.  It has been neglected for many years without real investment or the provision of new employment.  Therefore, the loss of 41 jobs in Herdmans is a body blow to the area and to those being made redundant.  Herdmans has a strong tradition in Ballybofey and the linen industry and I realise that the company has to rationalise, mainly as a result of the closure of the Japanese market and the reduction in sales in the Far East.  One of the company's greatest <Col N="861" /> concerns is that all its sales are in sterling and the difficulties it faces are due to the strength of sterling.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the commitment of the company and the family to the Ballybofey area.  It has tried to be as fair as possible in the rationalisation programme with losses occurring on both sides of the Border.  However, the employees have shown commitment over 30 years and should be treated fairly and equitably.  Their concerns about the redundancies should be listened to and a more acceptable offer should be made to them.  I am also concerned about the long-term viability of the textile industry.  The support services should be made available by the Department to assure the 65 people remaining in the company that their jobs will be safe and that every effort will be made to assist the company to market its products.</P>
      <P>There is a need to create new jobs in the Finn Valley area.  We have to deal with the Northern Ireland situation in competition with the Northern Ireland bodies to the detriment of many Border areas.  The Celtic tiger has developed in towns such as Letterkenny but Ballybofey, Stranorlar, Convoy and Killygordon have not developed. Every effort should be made to create new employment in the Finn valley area and to support the existing jobs in Herdmans.  I would appreciate the Minister's personal intervention in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am naturally disappointed at the announcement that Herdmans (Ireland) Ltd.  has decided to make 41 of its 108 strong workforce in Ballybofey redundant.  The loss of these jobs will be a great disappointment to the people of Ballybofey and the surrounding area.  I fully appreciate the concerns which the redundant employees and their families are experiencing.  The Deputies are aware that the company is in the process of an overall restructuring programme.  The process will not only affect the Ballybofey factory but also the company's operations across the Border where it plans to close two mills at Killyleagh Yarns, County Down and Henry Campbell Yarns, Mossley, County Antrim, resulting in a further 200 job losses.</P>
      <P>Herdmans, which was established in Ballybofey in 1964 to manufacture grey yarn for the linen industry, has been affected by difficult marketing problems.  These difficulties arose due to the high value of sterling and the financial crisis in Asia. The inability of the company to maintain its competitive edge in the world export market has forced it to radically restructure its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the decision to implement cutbacks in both Northern Ireland and Ballybofey is disappointing, I accept that it is important for the Herdmans Group to take the necessary remedial measures to ensure the long-term viability of its operation, thereby helping to safeguard the remaining 67 jobs in Ballybofey.  Herdmans recently advised the Department that it intends implementing the redundancy programme in <Col N="862" /> Ballybofey between 20 June and the end of August 1998.  On the question of redundancy terms, this is a matter in which I have no function. However, I am aware that discussions have been taking place between the relevant trade union and the company management.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the redundant workers should be well equipped to find new job opportunities. In this regard, FÁS and the industrial agencies have been asked to maximise the employment opportunities in the north-west. FÁS has advised me that personnel from its placement services office in Ballybofey will be inviting all of the redundant workers for interviews in order to determine their training needs and to advise them of the job opportunities currently available in the region.  The ex-Herdmans employees will be invited to apply for the various training schemes run by FÁS.  If sufficient numbers require a particular training skill, FÁS will consider running a special course to cater for these needs.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the direct action taken by FÁS, the development agencies are doing everything possible to maximise job opportunities in the Donegal region.  Donegal is a target location for inward investment by IDA Ireland.  The agency has put in place a number of new measures including higher grant levels and improved marketing material to assist in the marketing of County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the co-ordinated efforts of the various agencies will help the 41 redundant employees to obtain replacement jobs as quickly as possible.  I thank the Deputies for making the case for these unfortunate workers in such a sincere manner and for highlighting the need for investment and job creation in their region.  At their request, I will take a personal interest in the matter and indicate my desire and that of the Government that a special effort be made to ensure County Donegal and Ballybofey in particular receive the full support of the IDA, Forbairt-Enterprise Ireland and the County Donegal Enterprise Board to attract further investment to the area and assist existing companies to take on extra staff.  We will do our best to ensure a collective and co-ordinated effort is made to ensure the Deputies' wishes are fulfilled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this matter I have to recognise the history surrounding the treatment of fostered, adopted and institutionalised children which continues into their adult lives.  Decisions affecting their childhood are made on their behalf and continue to be made long after they cease to be children.  It is a case of the &ldquo;does he take sugar&rdquo; syndrome where decisions are made for people without asking them what they want.  It is symptomatic that the person with responsibility for studying post-adoption services legislation is the Minister of State with special responsibility for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> I am talking about the treatment of adopted people above the age of 18, their birth mothers and their adoptive families whenever any of these adults seek information from State records concerning their origins and family relationships.  We need to put a system in place which works for everyone involved.  Why, when adopted people seek this information, can they not receive it in a direct way?  A better way can surely be found to deal with post-adoption issues which recognises that adopted and fostered children and children raised in institutions have, as adults, the same rights as all other autonomous and responsible individuals in their dealings with the State.</P>
    <P>I am talking about the simple right of adopted and fostered children to information on their origins. It is argued that there are conflicting rights but this is a myth.  The organisations which represent adopted people, birth mothers and adoptive families have many interests in common. There are representatives of the birth mothers' association and the adopted people's association in the Gallery.  These associations want legislation to be implemented that will safeguard their right of access to the vital information they need. There is a shared desire to bury a shameful past. There has been much unnecessary pain and suffering in relation to these issues and it is time to deal with them directly in legislation.</P>
    <P>Adopted and fostered people as well as those who passed through the old industrial and reformatory schools have been left, in many cases, with no personal history or heritage and have been denied medical information vital to safeguard their families.  Birth mothers and adoptive parents have had great difficulty in obtaining the information they require.  We need a body constituted under legislation with the power and duty to inform those people directly concerned. We need a post-adoption services board which would safeguard the right to privacy of those few people, be they birth parents, adopted people, adopting parents or others, who have no wish to make contact.</P>
    <P>The needs of those personally affected by adoption and fostering go well beyond a contact register.  The new board would be responsible for maintaining a central register of all adoption, fostering and child institution files, including copies of all adoption agency files.  It would provide practical, non-judgmental advice on all relevant matters and ensure counselling is available to all those who need it.  Counselling should not be a precondition to obtaining information.  The board would also involve itself in ongoing research. Adequate funding and personnel resources should be provided.  This is essential.</P>
    <P>These proposals are modest and deserve consideration. People who have been affected by adoption should be treated properly in accordance with their basic human rights.  The Government should live up to its responsibilities as a signatory to the UN Charter on the Rights of the Child which states that a child should be registered <Col N="864" /> immediately after birth, should have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents.</P>
    <P>The issue is not as complex as some may suggest. It has been resolved successfully in many other jurisdictions.  The recent Supreme Court decision clears the way for legislation.  The people affected are in a legal quagmire.  They can attempt to conduct their own research, sometimes with the paid help of private detective agencies, but, at best, this is a hit and miss affair.  An adopted person may find a list of every parent who has given up a child for adoption on his or her own date of birth and may track down each potential parent but this can be a distressing activity and cannot be allowed to continue.  In effect, people are travelling around the country trying to make contact.  I am proposing that this accidental and chaotic system should be replaced by one which is integrated and planned by the State.  That is the way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Access to birth records by adopted persons is restricted under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952.  Under this section the registrar of the Adoption Board is obliged to maintain an adopted children register and an index to make traceable the connection between each entry and the corresponding entry in the register of births.  It is provided that the index shall not be open to public inspection and no information from it shall be given to any person except &ldquo;by order of the Court or of the Board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I appreciate Irish society has changed and become more open since many of the children adopted in the past have grown to adulthood.  I also appreciate that an increasing number of adoptive persons are seeking information about their birth parents to complete that aspect of their identity.  Equally, many birth mothers are now seeking information on children whom they gave up for adoption because keeping them was not a realistic option given the social and economic circumstances at the time.  There are also birth mothers who gave children up for adoption who have carried this secret for many years and who would not now want it divulged.</P>
      <P>As I stated previously in reply to parliamentary questions, there is a clear need for legislation to provide a structured, coherent and equitable post-adoption contact system.  I did not think it prudent to proceed in this regard prior to the clarification of a number of constitutional and other legal issues surrounding the question of access to birth records heard by the Supreme Court in July last year.  The issues heard by the Supreme Court go to the heart of post-adoption contact as they deal with the right of a child to know the identity of his or her birth mother and the right of the birth mother to confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the case on 13 March and the way is now clear to <Col N="865" /> legislate in this area.  I have had extra staff appointed to the child care policy unit to assist with the preparation of this legislation.  Apart from the fact that it was awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court, because of the shortage of staff in recent years &mdash; only 11 in total were available &mdash; the Department was unable to proceed with legislation in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>Before putting forward proposals I will have to consider the judgment of the Supreme Court carefully and consult the various interests involved and people with expertise in the field.  I am delighted that there are people with an interest in this subject in the Gallery.  It must be remembered that what is at issue is not only the rights of persons adopted under the Adoption Acts and their birth parents but also the rights of persons separated from their birth parents in other circumstances, including persons informally adopted prior to the enactment of the Adoption Act, 1952.  It was to persons in this category that the Supreme Court case to which I referred related.  This is obviously an extremely complex and difficult area of human relationships and it is essential to strike the right balance between the wishes of adopted children who wish to seek their birth records and, perhaps, trace their natural parents and the wishes of birth mothers who gave their children up for adoption in strict secrecy in a totally different social environment from that which now exists.  I have not yet made any decisions on how I will proceed.  I will listen carefully to all views before finalising my proposals so that this issue can be dealt with in a coherent, integrated and sensitive manner.  Obviously decisions regarding the specifics of what post-adoption services will be provided and the manner in which information may be released or withheld will have to await decisions on the overall legislative framework within which they will operate.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to move forward very quickly on this legislation.  With the new staff coming on stream this week, the first and immediate task of our legislative programme will be to start to prepare this legislation.  Apart from considering carefully the judgment of the Supreme Court, one of my first requirements will be to consult the groups on the two sides of the issue and to take on board their views.  I have listened to the views of quite a number of people in recent months. This is a complex issue.  I disagree with the Deputy in that coming forward with a quick and easy solution would not be the proper way to proceed on this matter.</P>
    <P>I am most anxious that birth records would be <Col N="866" /> made available to people in so far as that is possible. I am also most anxious that people who were adopted would be able to make contact with their birth mothers or their fathers in so far as that is possible.  I take the Deputy's point that the majority of birth mothers would welcome such contact, but there are a minority who would not. I have received heart-rending phone calls, many of them anonymous, and quite a number of letters, many of which were also anonymous, from birth mothers who under no circumstances want to be contacted.  I received some letters from people who threatened to commit suicide if their identities were to become known.  I must take cognisance of the views of those people even though, they are a minority.</P>
    <P>This is a complex issue and I must try to balance the rights of both sides.  I assure the House I am anxious to move forward this legislation and to accommodate people who were adopted and who want to trace their birth mothers, birth certificates and so on.  I accept the Deputy's point that this is a priority for the majority of those concerned.  I assure the Deputy and the House that I will move forward quickly to set up a contact register and to put in place the necessary structures to enable people to make progress and achieve their objectives.  However, there are a minority of birth parents whose rights we must protect and that complicates the issue for me. Anyone in my position would have to be cognisant of the views of that relatively small minority.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with such people I have tried to convince them they have nothing to fear and that in many cases it would be in their best interest to meet their children.  When I talked to them I got that message across, but a fairly significant number who made contact with me, the Department or the Adoption Board, are very concerned about this legislation.  I must be cognisant of their views, while my priority is to accommodate the majority of adoptees who want to know their birthright.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>I have directed the Central Fisheries Board to give immediate and top priority to implementation of my six point water quality action plan to protect fish stocks.  As we move into the critical summer months when fisheries and fish habitats are at their most vulnerable, the priority is to ensure that the resources of the central and regional boards and all relevant agencies are deployed and mobilised to best effect to prevent pollution, deal with the causes of pollution and act swiftly when pollution occurs.</P>
      <P>There has been demonstrable progress since I announced my action plan last August, notably in terms of improved liaison, dialogue and co-operation between the fisheries boards and other relevant agencies as well as the farming organisations, and the current development of water quality monitoring programmes between the fisheries boards and the EPA.  Dialogue and co-operation is also ongoing between the Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government reflective of the respective and complementary responsibilities of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey and myself.  The Central Fisheries Board has also invested in new equipment which will considerably enhance analysis of water samples, nutrient analysis and pollution investigations. Information dissemination and the publication of codes of practice by the IFA on silage effluent control and phosphate usage is heightening awareness generally of pollution risks and the need for constant vigilance and care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no room for complacency, however, and I have made it clear that I want to see all of the resources available to the central and regional fisheries boards mobilised and in a state of readiness, both in terms of pollution prevention and response over the coming months.  Close co-operation <Col N="868" /> on the ground will be essential between the boards, the local authorities and all relevant agencies as well as with farmers and other users of our inland fisheries resource.  I have accordingly tasked the Central Fisheries Board with progressing all components of the plan within a very short timeframe which will ensure the necessary state of readiness.</P>
    <P>I have asked the board to report back to me very quickly on its preparations and I will brief Deputies further in the coming weeks.  I have every confidence that the central and regional boards will deliver on this mandate to deploy all available resources at their disposal to maximum effect during the summer.</P>

      <P>There are on hand at present 451 applications for aquaculture licences.  I expect to have many of them dealt with before the end of this year under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997 when its licensing provisions are operational.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to Dáil Questions Nos. 52 and 53 on 31 March 1998.  I had already commenced certain provisions of that Act on 26 February 1998, primarily to enable me to prescribe organisations to nominate persons for appointment by me as the six ordinary members of the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board and to make necessary aquaculture licence application and fees regulations.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board is a key element of the new aquaculture licensing arrangements.  Nominations for the appointment of the six ordinary members closed on 15 May.  I am currently considering the nominations and will shortly be making my selection and asking the Government to decide as to who is to be the chairperson of the board.  The Act requires the Government to appoint the chairperson of the board.  My plan is, therefore, for the establishment of the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board and for the commencement of the licensing provisions of the Act at the same time before the end of next month.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, work is progressing well on the preparation of the necessary application and fees regulations and, subject to promised consultation with the industry on the fees proposed, my aim is to have those regulations in place within a few weeks.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I made my dissatisfaction abundantly clear at the December Council in relation to the decision establishing national quotas for horse mackerel.  Since that time I have been considering the options which exist in relation to appropriate follow-up actions on this issue.  In that context, I requested the Attorney General to advise on whether the Council decision on this matter was appropriately adopted and is legally valid.  I understand that the final advice will be available to me shortly.  Discussions to date with the Attorney General's Office do not suggest any clear basis on which the decision can be challenged.  Nevertheless, when the final advice is available I will be considering it, in the context of all other factors, in deciding how to best take the issue forward.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, I intend to draw on our experience on this issue in our analysis of the scope for improving quota entitlements available to Ireland in the context of preparing for the review of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002.  To strategically position ourselves for the review, I am establishing a national strategy review group to consult, develop and advise on the national approach to the Common Fisheries Policy review.  This group will be mandated to explore all opportunities to improve the position of the Irish fishing industry within the Common Fisheries Policy framework.  The experience of the establishment of national quotas for horse mackerel will be considered in this medium term context and in parallel with any other action in the short term which I may deem to be necessary in the Irish interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>We now have a high number of exploration licences in place.  At present, 28 licences are held and each carries a specific work programme involving a high level of exploration activity.  This is the result of the revised licensing terms introduced in 1992, the consequent licensing rounds in 1994 and 1995 and, most successful of all, the Rockall Trough licensing round last year which gave rise to 11 new licences.</P>
      <P>In addition, an area covering 156 blocks in the South Porcupine Basin is now the subject of a licensing round, the closing date for which is 15 December this year.  I expect to be in a position to announce the results and award the licences early in the second quarter next year.  This will give successful applicants the opportunity to acquire seismic data during the suitable weather window period of 1999.</P>
      <P>Apart from the licensing rounds held from time to time over specified areas, an open-door system is also in operation whereby applications may be made at any time to my Department for offshore acreage which is not closed or already held under any authorisation.</P>
      <P>The Deputies may be aware that I recently approved the issue of a petroleum lease to Providence Resources over the Helvick Oilfield in block 49/9 in the North Celtic Sea.  While this is a small field, a potential for commercial development has been established.</P>
      <P>In 1997, three exploration wells were drilled, two in the Porcupine Basin and one in the Kish Bank Basin, and hydrocarbon shows were encountered in one of the Porcupine wells.  In addition, two appraisal wells were drilled in the Connemara Oilfield, but the field was not declared commercial.</P>
      <P>In 1996, Enterprise Oil discovered gas in a well drilled in the Slyne Trough but despite their best efforts they were unable to test this discovery because of mechanical problems.  They have now made final plans to return to the location to appraise the discovery.  Their appraisal programme will consist of a further well and they are expected to commence their drilling operations next month.</P>
      <P>Other work aimed at identifying prospects for hydrocarbon discoveries is ongoing.  Last year 25,000 line kilometres of seismic was acquired and that was a record for seismic acquisition in Ireland.  Plans from seismic companies for 1998 indicate that it also will be a good year for seismic acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to be precise in regard to the potential for a new commercial development in our offshore as it would depend on specific aspects of the field such as, the amount of oil or gas recoverable, the duration of production, the distance to land, water depth at the location, costs and market price of the product. <Col N="871" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question relates to the catches of other member states in the Irish fisheries zone.  This zone is not currently used as a basis for fisheries statistics, catch data or stock assessments.  They are compiled by individual member states, including Ireland, for their own fleets by reference to the ICES fishery zones rather than national zones.</P>
      <P>The basis for firm estimates of total catches and the value of these catches in Irish waters by other member states is not therefore currently available. I am strongly of the view that achieving a better level of data on all catches in Irish waters is an essential objective.  The EU should develop a reliable common database on all aspects of EU fisheries including stocks, catches, landings and sales.  This is essential management information and is particularly critical for Ireland as a coastal state with a high level of fishing activity by other member states in our waters.</P>
      <P>Based on available data sources at our disposal, we have estimated that approximately one million metric tonnes of fish are caught annually in the Irish zone with a first sale value of some £700 million.  The value of the Irish fleet catch as a component of this is more than £150 million.</P>
      <P>This is an indicative estimate only for the reasons I have outlined.  I has asked the Department to work with the Marine Institute and BIM to review available data and develop methodologies which would further quantify existing estimates of catches in the Irish zone.  I will also be pressing at EU level for the development of the necessary data bases by the Commission with the co-operation of all member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last July I met Dr. Jack Cunningham MP, UK Secretary of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to discuss the dumping of radioactive waste in the Irish Sea.  This followed revelations by the UK authorities that previously unreported instances of dumping had taken place in the Beaufort Dyke between Northern Ireland and Scotland in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>I told Dr. Cunningham of my deep concern regarding the dumping of radioactive materials in the Irish Sea.  I pointed out that there was a high level of public disquiet in Ireland over the issue. While I welcomed the open approach he had adopted to the problem, I emphasised that the way in which the information emerged raised major questions about the credibility of previous public statements and information about the Irish Sea by the UK authorities.  I told him that the revelations added to the deeply felt concerns about Sellafield and munitions dumping in the north Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>At this meeting we agreed action to address concerns on both sides of the Irish Sea.  It was decided that intensive archival investigations would be undertaken by the UK as a matter of urgency and that officials from the two Governments would liaise closely on the progress of these investigations.  Dr. Cunningham undertook to make immediately available to me any information arising from these searches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Cunningham subsequently advised me that the archival investigations had revealed further instances of dumping in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  In addition to the Beaufort Dyke, dumping had taken place in the Holyhead Deep, the Firth of Forth, the North Sea, the Firth of Clyde and off the Isle of Arran.  The material dumped was solid packaged radioactive waste.  In addition, a number of instances were identified where liquid wastes containing small amounts of radioactivity were dumped at sea.  These instances occurred in the North Sea, the Firth of Forth, Liverpool Bay and, possibly, Morcambe Bay and the Humber <Col N="875" /> Estuary.  None of the material came from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Following these revelations I established a task force on the dumping of radioactive materials in the maritime area.  The task force was asked to review and assess the information becoming available on the dumping of radioactive materials in the maritime area and, based on this review, to advise on survey-monitoring and management measures so as to ensure maximum protection to our marine resources and restore public confidence in the quality of the marine environment. The task force is chaired by Nuala Butler, barrister, and includes representatives from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, University College Dublin, the Marine Institute, the Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  I understand that the work of the task force is at an advanced stage and I expect to receive its report shortly.</P>

      <P>The Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boat) Regulations, 1992 were introduced to enable local authorities, regional fisheries boards, harbour authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works to propose to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources that areas within or in the seas adjoining their jurisdiction be designated as unsuitable for the operation of these craft in the interests of the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants.</P>
      <P>The measures are available for the protection of pleasure craft and their occupants and do not extend to the protection of swimmers, bathers or the natural environment as these matters would be beyond the scope of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources' statutory powers.  As the Deputy may be aware, following a recent review of the 1992 regulations, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that they are now considered to be legally unsound, and do not provide the scope of what most local authorities proposals seek to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result, further processing of designation proposals has been suspended pending the outcome of a review currently being carried out by my Department in order to identify the most appropriate and effective means of regulating these craft with a view to providing for the improvement of safety for all water users.  In this regard, consultations have taken place with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, whose Local Government Act, 1994 allows local authorities to make by-laws to deal with any nuisance that should be controlled or <Col N="876" /> suppressed in the interests of the common good of the local community.  The suggestion that such by-laws could offer a more effective means of controlling power craft, since they could be tailored to suit the specific needs of individual localities, is being examined as part of my Department's review.</P>
    <P>In addition to this ongoing consultation, I have recently decided to establish a group to examine the question of regulation of the marine leisure area, including jet skis and fast power boats.  It is my intention that this group will give urgent consideration to dealing with such craft in the overall context of the expanding marine leisure area.  I will be supportive of any recommendations made which will lead to the improvement of safety for all water users and the general enjoyment of our unique coastal environment.</P>

      <P>Continuation of the longstanding rule restricting access within the 12 mile limit of member states will fall to be decided by Council before the end of 2002 under the review of the 1992 Common Fisheries Policy regulation.</P>
      <P>Under the existing CFP rules, access within the six mile limit is exclusive to Irish vessels right around the coast.  In certain parts of the Irish six to 12 miles limit, there is restricted access for certain member states &mdash; Belgium, UK, France, Netherlands and Germany &mdash; with traditional fishing rights.  The general assessment is that no member state will wish to see a change to the <i>status quo</i> on the six and 12 mile limits and the Commission has publicly confirmed this on a number of occasions.  It would be in Ireland's interest to secure the permanent embodiment in the CFP regulation of the six to 12 mile limit.</P>

      <P>As I previously advised the Deputy, I met with representatives of Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Commissioners on 10 February <Col N="877" /> 1998 to discuss their proposals for the development of the harbour at a cost of over £3 million.</P>
      <P>The revenues generated by port users of some £8,000 per annum would not be sufficient to sustain a development of the extent proposed in the development plan.  The relevant administrative and technical services of the Department have examined the proposal in the context of a national EU funded assessment of seaport capacity at all seaports, including Baltimore Harbour. This study's findings will inform policy decisions on the development and maintenance of adequate infrastructural capacity at strategic Irish ports to cope with increasing volumes of tourism and trade and to underpin future development plans to deliver that capacity.</P>
      <P>The final report of the consultants has been completed and its findings would rule out any development of Baltimore Harbour for commercial seaborne trade.  The consultants comment that &ldquo;.  ..very little cargo moves and the port is not considered to have any commercial capacity&rdquo;. Baltimore is not equipped to handle commercial cargoes and development plans suggest that this situation will not change materially in the next decade.</P>
      <P>The implication is that there is no prospect or benefit to be gained from developing Baltimore Harbour for commercial traffic in the future. Alternative development strategies as envisaged in the Action Programme for the Millennium and Partnership 2000 would, on the face of it, be more appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Government has committed in the Action Programme for the Millennium and in Partnership 2000 to review the strategic options for the future development and management of ports whose commercial activity has declined and to transferring small harbours to local control to develop marine leisure activities.  The review is being commissioned by my Department for completion by end 1998 and the proposed Development plan will be considered in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Ireland's involvement in the Loran C radio navigation system arises out of an international agreement approved by Dáil Éireann on 8 October, 1992.  He will also be aware that the project did not proceed due to protracted legal and planning issues.  Following a recent Supreme Court decision upholding planning permission to site a Loran C mast and ancillary facilities at Loop Head, County Clare, I announced that a comprehensive public consultation process would take place on this issue.</P>
      <P>I am aware that concerns have been expressed that the Loran C system poses a threat to health, represents a damaging environmental intrusion and that it may be obsolete.  People with these and any other concerns will have the opportunity to put their views forward during the consultation process.  This process will commence shortly and will facilitate a fundamental review of all aspects of the proposal.  It will allow me to hear, at first hand, the views of all interested parties, particularly those living in the Loop Head area.  I intend to visit the proposed site of the mast shortly and to speak directly with local people about the format of the consultation procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation process will consist of two open days, one will be held in Dublin and will deal with the generalities of the Loran C proposal, having regard to the future of radio navigation in north west Europe and globally and the position of the Loran C system within the plans for radio navigation structures internationally.  A second will be held in Clare and will deal with the local impact of the proposed mast, having regard to visual, environmental, health and other implications of siting the mast at Loop Head.  The proceedings <Col N="879" /> will be recorded and I intend to publish a consultative document following the communication process.  The process is designed to clarify all the issues involved.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights are acting on an agency basis on behalf of the Government in respect of the Loran C project.  However, prior to enactment of the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Act, 1997, I introduced on amendment which ensured that the commissioners will not proceed with the Loran C development without the agreement of both Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  Interested parties, such as the Deputy, can, therefore, contribute to the wide ranging consultation process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for safety of life at sea, I am committed to improving the safety of our fishermen.  To that end, I propose to implement the recommendations contained in the report of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group.  This is one of the key objectives in the Government's &ldquo;Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo;.  Considerable progress has already been made in this regard, most notably in the areas of safety training, on-shore marine radio communications, fleet development and safety awareness.</P>
      <P>My Department has been working closely with BIM concerning the establishment of new and more accessible training facilities.  BIM has, in this regard, launched two mobile coastal training units which are delivering vital instruction in the safe operation of fishing vessels directly to fishermen at strategic locations around the coast.  In addition, a new fisheries training facility is under construction at Castletownbere to service the south coast.  The new centre is scheduled for completion later this year.  These additional training resources strengthen BIM's overall programme to significantly improve the safety competence of fishing vessel crews.  The principal objective of BIM's Coastal Training Programme is to generate a health and safety culture within the small scale fishing sector in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding under the EU' s Small Scale Coastal Fisheries Programme has been secured towards a new training initiative, which has just commenced, aimed at the spouses and families of small scale coastal fishermen.  It is hoped that the relatives of fishermen can exert a positive influence in the promotion of good safety practices on board small fishing vessels.  This pilot initiative, which will be run by BIM in co-operation with Údarás na Gaeltachta, Comharcumann Inis Meain Teo and Meitheal Forbatha na Gaeltachta, <Col N="880" /> will target 12 venues over the course of 18 months.</P>
    <P>The review group identified the absence of mandatory social insurance cover for fishermen as the cause of many trained deckhands leaving the fishing fleet.  This situation has since been addressed and share fishermen now qualify for full PRSI cover.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group indicated that in the absence of incentives for the renewal of the fleet there would be little improvement in the age structure and safety status of the fleet.  I am committed to bringing about an improvement in this regard.  I am at present finalising a programme to support renewal of the whitefish fleet in order to maximise income and employment in coastal regions.  The programme is subject to EU Commission approval and negotiations with the Commission are well advanced.  The programme involves a grant aid support scheme and tax incentives for the whitefish fleet.  The tax incentives are provided for in the 1998 Finance Act. The grant aid element of the programme will be met from within the current allocations of Structural Funds for the fishing fleet.  The programme is designed to promote investment in the whitefish fleet with the introduction of a number of new and modern second-hand vessels into the fleet.  In addition, a targeted modernisation scheme and support for essential safety equipment for vessels will modernise the vessels in the fleet and contribute to improved safety.</P>
    <P>There have also been significant developments in the area of on-shore marine radio communications. The Department has installed new medium frequency transmitters at Belmullet and Rosslare which will enhance radio coverage and improve emergency response to fishing vessels operating off the north west coast and in the Irish Sea.  Furthermore, the Department is currently evaluating tenders received for VHF digital selective calling equipment which it is proposed to install at Irish marine emergency service coast radio stations, thereby significantly upgrading our radio communications network.</P>
    <P>I intend to introduce, as quickly as possible, comprehensive safety regulations which will cover fishing vessel construction and equipment, the carriage of specified radio equipment and increased training and manning requirements. The Department is currently putting in place the necessary technical and administrative resources to enable the drafting of this considerable volume of safety legislation.  Three additional marine surveyors have been appointed in this regard and the recruitment of an additional marine radio surveyor is under way.  As well as providing vital technical input in the drafting of the safety regulations, the surveyors will also be involved in a strict enforcement regime which will include regular structural surveys and equipment inspections for fishing vessels.</P>
    <P>It is of course vitally important that fishermen recognise that they have a responsibility for their own safety.  This responsibility involves adherence <Col N="881" /> to basic safety practices and procedures, including equipment maintenance.  In recognition of the clear need to substantially increase safety awareness among fishermen, the Department's Marine Safety Working Group has published practical, user-friendly information booklets dealing with fishing vessel machinery failure and man overboard procedures for fishing vessels and it is proposed to publish a further brochure, on emergency procedures for fishing vessels, in the near future.  The promulgation of these safety booklets to fishermen will help to foster an ethos of safety consciousness.  I am satisfied that the Department is, for its part, taking such steps at such pace as resources will allow to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, the safety of our fishermen.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the changes in seabed levels in Dublin Bay in the area at the causeway to Bull Island.  A build up of siltation, causing mud banks or mud flats, has allegedly been caused by the construction of the causeway. The findings of the consultant's study on siltation levels at the causeway at Bull Island commissioned by Dublin Corporation were published in June 1996.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishing opportunities available to the Irish fishing fleet are determined by the actual fish stocks present in EU fishing waters and, for the main economic stocks, by the quotas <Col N="882" /> allocated on a stock by stock basis to Ireland under the Total allowable catch and quota regimes of the Community's Common Fisheries Policy &mdash; CFP.  Total allowable catches are set each year on the basis of scientific advice on the optimum catch levels to ensure the long-term sustainable exploitation of the resource.</P>
      <P>There remains significant scope for continuing development of fishing opportunities by the Irish fleet.  Some quotas remain under utilised, in particular nephrops to the south and west of Ireland and cod off our northern and western coasts.  In addition, many stocks are not subject to quota including a number of valuable inshore stocks such as lobster, whelk, crabs and razor clams which are giving a high value return to Irish fishermen at present.  Deepwater species and blue whiting offer further opportunities.  Irish fishermen fished for blue whiting in Irish waters for the first time last year, landing around 30,000 tonnes. Excellent catches are being achieved this year as well.</P>
      <P>I have continued to take a very strong line on the need for a strong Europe wide, strictly enforced, fisheries control regime.  The viability of the resource and the interests of the Irish fishing fleet depends on compliance by all fishermen with the rules.  My Department's Sea Fisheries Inspectorate works closely with the Naval Service and the Air Corps to ensure rigorous control of fishing activity and landings in our fisheries control zone.  Ireland supports the ongoing development of the Community's monitoring and inspection system using the latest technology such as satellite communications.  A new satellite based vessel monitoring system will be introduced on a phased basis this year.  Also, in addition to the existing entry and exit reporting requirements, &ldquo;real time&rdquo; reporting of catches will be introduced from next month.</P>

    <P>The Irish fishing fleet is nearly the smallest in number and tonnage terms in the European Union.  Only the Belgian fishing fleet is smaller at 156 vessels and 23,000 tonnes &mdash; 1996 figures.  The most recent analysis of the age profile of the Irish fleet versus the EU fleet as a whole indicates that the Irish fleet has a smaller percentage than the overall EU fleet in the under ten years age category <Col N="883" /> and a higher percentage in the 20-30 year category.  The percentage of Irish vessels over 30 years of age is slightly lower than the EU average. Eight member states have a higher percentage of their fleet in the 30 to 40 year age category than Ireland.  I would refer the Deputy to the report of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group which includes a comparative profile of the Irish fishing fleet versus the fleets of other member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can report continued progress with regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group, to which the Government is committed. The report of the review group indicated that in the absence of incentives for the renewal of the fleet there would be little improvement in the age structure and safety status of the fleet.  I am committed to bringing about an improvement in this regard.  I am, at present, finalising a programme to support renewal of the whitefish fleet in order to maximise income and employment in coastal regions.  The programme is subject to EU Commission approval and negotiations with the Commission are well advanced.  The programme involves a grant aid support scheme and tax incentives for the whitefish fleet.  The tax incentives are provided for in the 1998 Finance Act. The grant aid element of the programme will be met from within the current allocations of Structural Funds for the fishing fleet.  The programme is designed to promote investment in the whitefish fleet with the introduction of a number of new and modern second-hand vessels into the fleet.  In addition, a targeted modernisation scheme and support for essential safety equipment for vessels will modernise the vessels in the fleet and contribute to improved safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern was expressed by the review group at the number of unregistered fishing vessels operating in Irish waters, many of which are small and in poor condition.  The group considered that these vessels constitute a serious threat to safety and recommended that this situation be addressed.  Applications for registration of fishing vessels under a special scheme approved by the European Commission, under which the position of previously unregistered vessels in the fishing fleet will be regularised and an additional 5,473 gross tonnes will be added to the Irish fishing vessel register, are being processed at present.  The criteria under this scheme for registration require, among other matters, that vessels undergo a condition survey report in order to ensure that the vessel is safe and seaworthy.  This represents a significant <Col N="884" /> improvement in our safety regulatory framework and in our safety standards for small fishing vessels in particular.</P>
    <P>Safety training, which is vital to protect the lives of fishing vessel crews in the event of an accident at sea, continues to be provided in an accessible manner through BIM's two mobile training units in response to demand at various locations around the coast.  In addition, a new fisheries training centre is under construction at Castletownbere which will deliver safety skills instruction to fishermen in the south coast region. The new centre is scheduled for completion later this year.  The principal objective of BIM's coastal training programme is to generate a health and safety culture within the small scale fishing sector in particular.</P>
    <P>Funding under the EU's small scale coastal fisheries programme has been secured towards a new training initiative, which has just commenced, aimed at the spouses and families of small scale coastal fishermen.  It is hoped that the relatives of fishermen can exert a positive influence in the promotion of good safety practices on board small fishing vessels.  This pilot initiative, which will be run by BIM in co-operation with Údarás na Gaeltachta, Cornharcumann Inis Meain Teo and Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, will target 12 venues over the course of 18 months.</P>
    <P>There have also been significant developments in the area of on-shore marine radio communications. Radio coverage and emergency response to fishing vessels off the north west coast and in the Irish Sea have been enhanced through the installation of new medium frequency transmitters at Belmullet and Rosslare.  Furthermore, the Department is currently evaluating tenders received for VHF digital selective calling equipment which it is proposed to install at Irish marine emergency service coast radio stations.  This modern equipment will significantly upgrade our radio communications network.</P>
    <P>The Department is continuing to put in place the necessary administrative and technical resources to facilitate the introduction of comprehensive safety regulations for fishing vessels and their crews, as recommended by the review group.  Three additional marine surveyors have been appointed and the recruitment of an additional marine radio surveyor is in train. These surveyors will provide the vital technical input required in the drafting of the safety regulations and they will also be involved in their subsequent enforcement through the carrying out of regular surveys.</P>
    <P>The review group saw a need for a substantial improvement in safety awareness among Irish fishermen.  In response to this need my Department's Marine Safety Working Group has produced safety booklets aimed at increasing safety consciousness in the fishing sector.  Publication of a booklet dealing with fishing vessel machinery failure was followed up, earlier this year, by a brochure on man overboard procedures for fishing <Col N="885" /> vessels.  This brochure details safety precautions designed to prevent man overboard incidents, which are one of the main reasons for the loss of fishermen's lives.  In addition, it is proposed to publish guidelines on emergency procedures for fishing vessels in the near future.  This series of booklets represents a practical and user-friendly means of disseminating the safety message, thereby helping to develop a safety culture among fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>As I have made clear to the House on numerous occasions, I am giving every priority to mounting, through strict enforcement, an effective ban on the illegal activities of flagships and of all fishing vessels irrespective of nationality in the Irish zone.</P>
      <P>Our fisheries protection services at sea and on land are co-operating closely to ensure that flagship activities in these waters are rigorously monitored and controlled.  As Deputies are aware there are particular enforcement difficulties associated with the activities of flagships.  I have been pressing my UK and Spanish colleagues, who have legal responsibilities in this regard, to fully co-operate with us in intensifying their inspection operations and in ongoing liaison and information exchange.  I am pleased to say that this approach is now paying dividends.  The recent cases taken in the UK courts which resulted in fines totalling £1 million were underpinned by evidence of illegal fishing by the flagships concerned provided by the Department's Sea Fisheries Inspectorate and the Naval Service to the UK authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This result sends a clear signal that illegal fishing will not be tolerated and that the member states concerned are increasingly prepared to work together to ensure compliance with the rules.  At EU level I am continuing to press for greater co-operation across the board and for the Commission itself to take all appropriate action to encourage and oversee this process.  The Commission has recently tabled new proposals <Col N="886" /> designed to enhance the fisheries control regime at all points in the chain.  In the forthcoming discussions on these proposals, I will be pressing my key objectives of better co-operation, transparency and a level playing field in control in the interests of the Irish fishing industry.  The introduction of realtime catch reporting next July for fishing vessels entering and leaving our zone will put the squeeze further on fishing activity by flagships. I have made it a top priority for our fisheries protection services to ensure that the necessary systems and operating arrangements are in place to maximise the effectiveness of the new catch reporting and satellite monitoring regimes.</P>

      <Quest>whether his Department is undertaking any review of the regulations and the procedures regarding the mining of lead and zinc concentrate and its storage and transport through and from this country in view of the recent ecological disaster in Southern Spain.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The various aspects of zinc and lead production, from mining for ore through to export of the concentrates, are subject to a web of legislation including the Minerals Development Acts, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, the Environmental Protection Agency Act, The Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Acts, road transport regulations and the Road Traffic Acts.  Carriage by sea is subject, as appropriate, to the international code for the carriage of dangerous goods by sea plus other International Maritime Organisation &mdash; IMO &mdash; and flag state requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> I understand that the incident in southern Spain to which the Deputy refers was due to a failure of a section of the mine tailings dam.  The design, construction and management of tailings facilities in this country are primarily matters for the local planning authority and, especially, the EPA.  Under the EPA Act, 1992, I am specifically precluded from attaching conditions which relate to prevention or control of environmental pollution to a permit under the Minerals Development Acts.  Nevertheless my Department examines each development proposal in all its aspects, physical, financial, environmental, etc., and I will not grant a State mining facility where I am not satisfied that it is for a responsible development.</P>
    <P>Before granting any State mining facility for production of lead and zinc I must satisfy myself that the management and environmental proposals are adequate and that planning permission and EPA licences are in place.  In that context I make it a condition of a State mining facility that it is only valid in the places and manner provided for in the planning permission and EPA licences. The proposer of each new mine development is required to submit a detailed environmental impact statement &mdash; EIS.  I am a statutory consultee in the planning process and a consultee of the EPA in its consideration of every EIS in relation to, among other things, the tailings impoundment dam.  In exercise of my functions in relation to applications for State mining facilities I supplement the expertise available in my Department as necessary with specialist consultants to ensure that I can be satisfied with respect to: the underlying geology of the site; the design, construction and management of the dam; and the structural and environmental monitoring proposals for using the dam.  This holistic approach ensures control of the construction, use and decommissioning of tailings dams and further ensures that any undesirable environmental effects are minimised and mitigated.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the mining industry considers Ireland's environmental standards to be among the most rigorous and comprehensive in the world.  I am satisfied that the EPA applies standards which will ensure that the best practice for the disposal of &ldquo;non-hazardous&rdquo; wastes is followed with regard to tailings facilities.</P>
    <P>While the regulatory and legislative provisions for mining described above are under regular review, I am satisfied that the high standards which already apply here mean that an incident similar to that which occurred in southern Spain would be most improbable in Irish mines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, I hold responsibility for safety on the water in so far as vessels, passengers and crew are concerned.  While my interest in water sports relates primarily to the safe operation of these sports where vessels or boats are used, I am nonetheless concerned about the safety of all who use the water for leisure purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time now, it has been my Department's policy that self-regulation by individuals engaged in water sports and their representative organisations, augmented by the Departments safety awareness campaign, is the most practical <Col N="890" /> and effective approach to the safety of such activities.</P>
    <P>This safety awareness campaign is co-ordinated by the Marine Safety Working Group which was set up by my Department and involves the RNLI, the Irish Sailing Association, the relevant Government Departments, the National Safety Council and the Health and Safety Authority. The aim of this working group is to use its collective expertise and experience to create and communicate marine safety information and messages to endeavour to reduce accidents and to prevent the loss of life in Irish waters.  The safety working group meets regularly and has produced a number of Safety on the Water booklets, leaflets and posters for widespread dissemination.  These booklets include titles such as Safe Canoeing and Safe Windsurfing.  A pamphlet on life jackets and buoyancy aids is expected to be published shortly and work is currently in hand regarding a proposed draft leaflet on canoeing, surfskiing and board safety as well as a proposed draft booklet on weather forecasting services.</P>
    <P>Following the tragic canoeing accident off Dunmore East in February 1995 which resulted in the death of two young men who were members of canoeing party from the local adventure centre, my Department, while recognising that self-regulation remains an important option, came to the conclusion that some form of regulation of adventure centres would be desirable to provide for an improvement in the safety of people availing of the activities at these centres.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I have recently taken up with my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation &mdash; who is responsible for sport in general &mdash; the possible introduction of a system of mandatory regulation of the safety of adventure centres.  While I accept that water sports constitute only some of a wide spectrum of activity sports conducted at such centres, I am nevertheless concerned that there should be a co-ordinated approach towards ensuring greater safety in all adventure sports with particular reference to the monitoring and control of adventure centres which provide facilities for young people.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is currently carrying out a review of the Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boats) Regulations, 1992 and all legislative options available are being considered in order to identify the most effective means of controlling such craft in the interests of other water users.  As a more long-term measure, I have recently decided to establish a group to examine the question of regulation of the marine leisure area, including jet skis and fast power boats.</P>
    <P>Finally, while I believe that it is essential that a strong sense of personal responsibility for one's own safety is developed among water sports enthusiasts and marine leisure users in general, I can assure the Deputy that both I and my Department will continue to promote marine safety awareness among the public and will be supportive of all measures designed to improve practices <Col N="891" /> and procedures which ensure the safety of all water users, not just those engaged in water sports.  I can also assure the Deputy that the resources of my Department will be fully available, within their remit, to work with other relevant agencies to ensure that there is no repetition of the tragic events in Sligo earlier in the month.</P>

      <P>At present 28 offshore petroleum exploration licences are held and these have been issued over the period 1992 to date.  Each licence carries a specific work programme involving a high level of exploration activity.</P>
      <P>In addition an area covering 156 blocks in the South Porcupine Basin is now the subject of a licensing round, the closing date for which is 15 December this year.  I expect to be in a position to announce the results and award the licences early in the second quarter next year.  This will give successful applicants the opportunity to acquire seismic data during the suitable weather window period of 1999.</P>
      <P>Apart from the licensing rounds held from time to time over specified areas, an open door system is also in operation whereby applications may be made at any time to my Department for offshore acreage which is not closed or already held under any authorisation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware I recently approved the issue of a petroleum lease to providence resources over the Helvick Oilfield in block 49/9 in the North Celtic Sea.  While this is a marginal field, a potential for commercial development has been established and it merits the granting of a petroleum lease.</P>
      <P>In 1996 enterprise oil discovered gas in a well drilled in the Slyne Trough, but despite their best efforts they were unable to test this discovery because of mechanical problems.  They have now made final plans to return to the location to appraise the discovery.  Their appraisal programme will consist of a further well and they propose to commence their drilling operations next month.  Even if the results of this programme are favourable it is expected that additional work will be required to fully appraise the discovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other work aimed at identifying prospects for hydrocarbon discoveries is ongoing.  Last year 25,000 line kilometres of seismic was acquired and that was a record for seismic acquisition in Ireland.  Plans from seismic companies for 1998 <Col N="892" /> indicate that it also will be a good year for seismic acquisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Mineral exploration in Ireland is carried out under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995.  The definition of minerals under these Acts does not include sand, stone, gravel, clay or peat. The Acts are designed to encourage and regulate minerals exploration and development.  In practice, exploration is carried out by the private sector; there is no direct State involvement in exploration.</P>
      <P>I report twice a year on the current state of mineral exploration, among other aspects of my responsibilities, under the Minerals Development Acts and lay that report before each House of the Oireachtas.  The most recent such report covering the period to 31 December 1997 showed some 400 prospecting licences were held by 56 companies. This corresponds to exploration activity in approximately 14,000 square kilometres.</P>
      <P>In all about two thirds of the country has been the subject of prospecting licences over the past 40 years, but this does not mean an exhaustive survey for all possible minerals.  Licences are issued for the particular minerals or groups of minerals of interest to the applicant and the reports they are obliged to submit are made available on &ldquo;open file&rdquo; after surrender or expiry of the licence.  The availability of information to later prospectors provides background information and avoids unnecessary duplication of work.</P>
      <P>Exploration companies will always carry out what they believe to be the most appropriate and cost-effective exploration programme for any given prospecting licence area at any given time. However, continuous improvements in exploration techniques and increased sophistication in the technologies available to the explorer mean that no area can ever be said to be conclusively surveyed.  Indeed two of Ireland's currently producing zinc mines, the Tara mine at Navan and the Arcon mine at Galmoy, are in areas which had been explored by other companies prior to their discovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, society's requirements in relation to <Col N="893" /> minerals are constantly changing, and a mineral that is not in demand at present might one day become valuable.  Also, advances in technology may allow the exploitation of deposits which, because of their low grade or because they present recovery problems, were earlier regarded as sub-economic.</P>
    <P>Some parts of Ireland are regarded as more prospective than others.  When prospecting licences in areas underlain by a favourable geology are surrendered, there are always competing applications from companies who believe the previous licensee did not explore the ground properly.  This demonstrates the belief of those in the industry that ground is never conclusively surveyed.</P>

      <P>I have taken up the Deputy's concerns with the Foyle Fisheries Commission about the 48 hour salmon netting suspension introduced for 24 and 25 July 1996.  The Commission has advised that the closure in question was introduced in consultation with the Drift Netsmen's Representatives themselves.  The 48 hour closure period of Wednesday and Thursday, 24 and 25 July was introduced at the fishermens request in preference to the alternative of Thursday, 25 July and Monday, 29 July, on the basis that Mondays are seen by the fishermen to be a prime fishing day following the normal weekend closure.  As a result of these discussions the advance notice of the closure issued on Tuesday, 23 July was 16 hours as opposed to the regulation 24 hours.</P>

      <P>Payments under the 1997 cattle headage and suckler cow schemes have already been made to the person concerned.</P>
      <P>Payments under the extensification premium scheme (area aid payments) do not normally start until late May or early June each year, with all eligible applicants being paid by end June. Because Ireland has exceeded its national quota under the 1997 special beef premium scheme, payments under the 1997 extensification scheme cannot commence until all 1997 special beef premium applications are fully processed and the definitive position in relation to usage of quota is determined.  Quota usage is determined by reference to the overall number of animals qualifying for the ten months premium.  It is expected that the position will become clear shortly following which extensification premium payments can commence.</P>

      <P>The position is that payments under the various 1997 livestock headage and premium schemes do not conclude at the end of the calendar year.  Therefore it is not possible, as yet, to give the number of applications refused payment under the 1997 schemes.  For example, under the suckler cow premium scheme and the special beef premium scheme the regulations provide for advance payments commencing on 1 November of the year of application with balancing payments being made in the following year.  Payments to applicants under the October 1997 suckler cow premium scheme could not commence until such time as the six month retention period expired in April 1998.  Payment of the final instalment of the 1997 ewe premium commenced on 17 February 1998 in line with EU regulations.  Payment of 1997 extensification premium will be made automatically to eligible producers.  These payments do not normally commence until end May-June each year.  EU regulations require that, except in duly justified exceptional circumstances, all eligible applicants be paid balancing payments and extensification premium, where appropriate, by 30 June 1998.</P>
      <P>In so far as the disadvantaged areas' headage schemes are concerned every effort is made to make payment in full in the year of application.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme of early retirement from farming the pension payable is comprised of two elements: a basic 4,000 ECUs, and a supplementary payment of 250 ECUs for each hectare released up to a maximum of 24 hectares. Accordingly, the maximum annual pension payable under the scheme for a farm of 24 hectares or greater is 10,000 ECUs.</P>
      <P>The rate for converting ECUs into Irish currency is the agricultural conversion rate in operation on 1 January each year.  In 1994 when the scheme was introduced the maximum pension in Irish currency was £9,764.26 per annum.  The current conversion rate applicable since 1 January 1996 results in a maximum pension of £10, 016 26 per annum.</P>

I have no funds to compensate potato growers whose crops have been damaged by the heavy frosts in April of this year.

Livestock units are calculated with reference to applications under the suckler cow premium scheme, ewe premium scheme and special beef premium scheme and from any milk quota held by the applicant. All the available quota has been utilised by eligible applicants with less than 5.8 livestock units.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme <Col N="901" /> for the Millennium, includes a commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland.  The detailed arrangements required to facilitate this new and complex service are being advanced as a priority by my Department.</P>
      <P>I recently announced as part of the launch of a national strategy on cardiovascular health that the Mater Hospital, Dublin has been designated as the surgical site for lung or heart and lung transplantation, in association with other key service providers and in particular St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin which is the national centre for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.</P>
      <P>Pending the establishment of an Irish based unit, the immediate requirement is to examine whether the existing service being provided in the UK to Irish patients can be improved in any way. This issue has been progressed in discussions held with a number of transplant centres in the UK with a view to contracting work to a selected and proven centre.  Proposals for service.  including the training of Irish surgical, medical, nursing and support staff in preparing for the establishment of an Irish programme were invited from four centres.</P>
      <P>These proposals for service have now been received by my Department and are currently being examined by a review group, comprising officials of my Department and key personnel from the Mater Hospital and St Vincent's Hospital as part of the transplant centre selection process.</P>
      <P>There are also a number of associated issues to be discussed with the UK Department of Health regarding site selection.  I anticipate that these discussions will be concluded in the near future.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a lung and heart and lung transplant programme is an extremely complex and difficult task.  A critical factor in the successful delivery of a quality transplant programme is whether the level of transplant activity in an established programme is sufficient to maintain the level of expertise required to achieve successful outcomes.  It is essential to have appropriately trained staff, suitable infrastructure and a multi-disciplinary approach to ensure successful outcomes. A phased approach is, therefore, being adopted, recognising the need to build expertise and to create a programme that is viable in terms of the outcomes for patients, whether it be at home or abroad.</P>
      <P>In summary, therefore, it is my view that a lung or heart and lung transplant programme should commence in Ireland when the necessary expertise has been developed, through a mentor relationship with the UK, to the point where we can guarantee results which are on a par with those achieved internationally.  In the interim, my Department is looking to improve the level of service by UK transplant centres to Irish patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new hospital at Tallaght was designed in accordance with the requirements of the planning brief prepared by the Tallaght Hospital Board and its planning group.  The planning group consisted of the Board members, which included eight hospital medical consultants, together with the Matrons and Secretary/Managers of the Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospitals with attendance as required of various medical and other Heads of Departments of the aforementioned hospitals and Dr. Steevens' Hospital.</P>
      <P>The planning brief which was completed in March 1984 is a comprehensive statement of the requirements of the hospital and how it would operate.  It contains detailed descriptions of the overall and departmental operational policies which apply to the hospital, a description of each department, including detailed schedules of accommodation.</P>
      <P>Planning of the hospital in accordance with the requirements of the planning brief was completed in September 1990 following an architectural competition for the project in 1984-85.</P>
      <P>Following a review in May 1992 of the function, scope and scale of the proposed Tallaght Hospital by the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group (Kennedy Group), planning revisions were made to the tender documentation completed in September 1990, to reflect the group's recommendations. These revisions were discussed and agreed with the users.  The plans were then approved to go to tender in June 1993.  Tenders for the revised project were received in September 1993 and construction commenced on site in October 1993 by the successful main contractor Laing/Paul.</P>
      <P>The planning of the hospital through its years of detailed development by the design team was overseen by a project team which reported to the Tallaght Hospital Board.  The project team included medical representation of all hospitals concerned.  Plans of departments were discussed and agreed with the users, through the Tallaght Hospital Board's nurse planning officer, who reported to the project team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> Planning of the hospital as originally designed reflected the requirements of the planning brief together with Irish and international developments in hospital design current at the time including Cork Regional and Beaumont Hospitals.</P>
    <P>Experience gained from the pre and post commissioning phases of these hospitals were taken into account and is part of the reason why every effort has been made to meet the changing needs which have been considered essential by the management of the hospital.</P>
    <P>The departments or portions of the hospital to which alterations have been made since completion of the Laing/Paul contract are as follows: day care; paediatric; pathology; psychiatric; nephrology and dialysis; accident and emergency; operating theatres; intensive care; pharmacy; health records; hospital sterile services department; out patients; waste management; radiology.</P>
    <P>Alterations to the majority of the departments are not significant construction works and in some instances are very minor.  These have been necessary due to changes in medical practices, procedures, technology, health and safety requirements and they reflect the need and the opportunity to commission the hospital on a basis which reflects current best practice and which will be very important to the future functioning of the hospital and the containment of its revenue and further capital costs.  The most significant change is the major expansion of the out patients department. This expansion will be completed by October next and is being provided within the planned expansion factor.</P>
    <P>The extent of discussion which took place with the doctors responsible for particular areas of speciality for which the hospital was being constructed has at all times been elaborate and comprehensive both prior to going to tender and indeed during the course of the project.

      <P>By re-instatement, I take it the Deputy means special re-admission <Col N="908" /> to employment outside of the normal recruitment route.  There was a practice of departures from the normal recruitment regulations being granted by the Minister to enable women to be reappointed in certain circumstances to their former positions on compassionate grounds. However, following a Labour Court determination on 23 July 1993 and legal advice that a similar re-admission scheme in the Civil Service was in conflict with the equal treatment directive, the practice of granting these departures ceased.</P>
      <P>All officer posts are filled by competition, open to everybody with the qualifications for the particular post.  I might mention that I am currently reviewing the upper age limits generally applicable to competitions for local authority positions, in the context of the Employment Equality Bill, 1997; changes in this respect would remove an obstacle which may exist for certain former women employees seeking to compete for a position within the service.</P>

      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years.  The allowances continue to be payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday, provided that the claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>The favourable treatment of people on long-term payments &mdash; such as pensions &mdash; is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty. These arrangements do not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.  I have no plans at present to extend these arrangements to people on short-term payments.  Any such extension would, of course, have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context in the light of other priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of child income support policy in recent years has been to target resources towards providing increases in child benefit, as part of a strategy aimed at ensuring that child income support is more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents.  Child benefit remains one of our more effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most <Col N="910" /> in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the child benefit scheme will be further enhanced with effect from September of this year.  The payment will be increased by £1.50 per child per month for the first two children and by £3 per child for the third and subsequent children, thus bringing the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.  In addition a special supplementary payment in respect of twins will be introduced.</P>

      <P>I consider it important that any person in receipt of a social welfare payment who is in a position to return to the active workforce is facilitated in doing so.  In the case of disability benefit and other schemes for incapacitated people there are arrangements in place under which, in certain circumstances, people can <Col N="911" /> be facilitated in taking up employment of a therapeutic or rehabilitative nature with a view to returning to the workforce.</P>
      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme is to provide a financial incentive to long-term unemployed people to return to work.  The scheme has a limited number of places and has been targeted primarily at people on unemployment payments and one-parent family payments. However, arrangements have been made for 1,000 places to be reserved for people with disabilities in receipt of disability allowance or blind pension.  To date only 97 people have availed of this.  In the light of experience with these arrangements I will be considering what additional measures may be required in this regard.</P>

      <P>There is a contractual agreement with Esat Digifone allowing them to install mobile telephony equipment at specified Garda stations subject to certain conditions.  These conditions include a requirement that Esat Digifone comply fully with planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, and all relevant guidelines which may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association.</P>
      <P>In return, Esat Digifone agreed to pay the full commercial rental value of each site; allow the Garda Síochána access to their other sites as required to install Garda radio equipment and to use Digifone masts; provide the Garda Síochána with capacity on the Digifone network for Garda communications use; replace or erect new Garda masts where necessary; and, finally, supply the force with a specified number of mobile phones free of charge to be distributed for operational purposes, together with use of Digifone's GSM network in respect of those phones, free of call charges, so long as they remain within the Digifone network.  In addition, a further 100 Garda mobile phones were connected to the Digifone network with the same conditions applying.  Calls made outside of the Digifone network attract charges at cost only.</P>
      <P>Masts used for mobile telephones at Garda stations are no different to some of those masts currently in use or planned for future usage by the Garda Síochána in the context of a proposed radio replacement programme.  Therefore, the benefit of such masts to Garda members has to be viewed from an operational perspective in that they form part of the infrastructure necessary to ensure that members on the beat or in patrol cars can keep in contact with their stations at all times.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the Criminal Assets Bureau, as part of its statutory functions pursuant to Section 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996, is obliged to ensure that the proceeds of criminal activity or suspected criminal activity, are subjected to tax and that the Revenue Acts, where appropriate, are fully applied in relation to such proceeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> The Criminal Assets Bureau makes assessments to tax, issues demands and applies appropriate collection remedies to a variety of taxes, including profits or gains charged under Case IV, Schedule D pursuant to section 58 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>In many cases the Criminal Assets Bureau has taken action in the High Court to enforce collection of tax demanded and in general these proceedings have been heard in public.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have assured me that the policy of the Criminal Assets Bureau is to comply strictly with the statutory confidentiality afforded to taxpayers.</P>

    <P>In February 1998 my Department contacted the EU Commission seeking an additional six months in which to transpose the directive.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present six locations have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing.  They are as follows: Bray, Cork, Dublin (South Central), Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick.</P>
      <P>The order in which the CCTV systems will be installed in the six locations in question has yet to be finalised.  Financial and resource considerations will be among the factors which will determine the order in which the systems will be installed.  While the Dublin (South Central) area is included in the six priority locations I am not in a position at this juncture to give an indication of when work on the system will commence. Officials from my Department and the Garda authorities are currently examining how best to progress matters.</P>
      <P>As far as the Garda Síochána is concerned the potential crime prevention capacity is the most important consideration when evaluating an application for a Garda CCTV system.  It should further be noted that CCTV systems are not in any way a replacement for Garda personnel but are an aid to existing Garda resources.  The extension of these systems to other areas must be viewed in the context of overall policing operations and carefully planned and integrated into Garda operational procedures.</P>
      <P>A CCTV advisory group, comprising higher Garda officers and a representative from my Department, has been set up by the Garda Commissioner to examine the future of CCTV as an aid to policing with a view to determining priority of the applications received for the installation of CCTV systems.  In considering any location for the installation of a Garda CCTV system it takes into account matters such as the present crime rate and public disorder offences in the particular area under consideration, together with crime trends and population growth.  It is also required to evaluate each application from a technical and telecommunications perspective while also taking into consideration the level of finance available from my Department and from local business-community sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the funding of CCTV projects, it has always been the policy of my Department to provide funding on a shared basis with local community-commercial interests and I intend to maintain this policy for the foreseeable future.  I <Col N="919" /> must point out that in the light of the limited finances available to me for the extension of Garda CCTV systems, the level of commitment and financial support from local interests for the installation of these systems will have a significant bearing on whether or not a CCTV system will be considered for a particular area.</P>

      <P>I have difficulty understanding what the Deputy is referring to.  I can only assume that he may be referring to the provisions of section 19 of the Refugee Act, 1996, which provide for the protection of the identity of an applicant for refugee status.  While the section has yet to be commenced, my Department and officials operate within the spirit of its intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An asylum seeker in the circumstances described by the Deputy would not be in breach <Col N="922" /> of the current procedures for processing asylum claims nor in breach of the terms and spirit of the Refugee Act, 1996, in reporting such incidents to the authorities.  In fact, it would be very important for the asylum seeker, just as it would for anybody else, to report such incidents to the authorities.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has a specific situation or case in mind which is a source of concern, I would be glad if he could write to me about it so that I can have it examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years and set for review this academic year.  In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year. Students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the charge payable by students for registration, exams and student services is a matter for the third level institution involved.  When I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge, from £150 to £250, for the current academic year, I was concerned about that portion of the charge which is intended to fund student services and in particular the lack of transparent procedures.  Accordingly, I requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The working group has completed its work and the Higher Education Authority has issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions.</P>
      <P>This framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the £250 charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution should provide information as to the allocation of the £250 charge towards exams-registration and student services on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident the framework will be adopted by the various institutions involved and I have asked the Higher Education Authority to co-ordinate <Col N="924" /> the review after six months, as recommended by the working party, of the consultative procedures and their outcome.</P>
    <P>I have not taken any decisions about the future arrangements in relation to this charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The educational needs of children with specific learning disability are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.  Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.</P>
      <P>Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools dedicated to this area.  Three of these schools are located in Dublin and one in Cork.  Three special classes have also been established in ordinary primary schools to cater for the needs of children with specific learning disability.  The establishment of such classes depends on the level of assessed need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability <Col N="925" /> are normally integrated into ordinary classes.  In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers. Depending on the severity of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>Funding is not generally made available for the provision of additional private tuition for pupils with specific learning disability.  However, in 1997 my Department allocated £24,971 to the Association of Children and Adults with Learning Disability, ACLD to assist in its administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas.  My Department is at present considering a request for an increased level of funding for the ACLD for 1998.  I hope to be in a position to respond to the ACLD shortly.</P>

      <P>In view of the delays which occur in certain areas before primary school children may be psychologically assessed, 15 psychologists who are also qualified primary teachers are being seconded to my Department's psychological service for a period of three years.

      <P>My Department is currently considering the question of bringing the rate of training allowance payable to VTOS participants into line with that paid for the back to education allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the very successful VTOS programme being operated by the County Laois Vocational Education Committee.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.</P>
      <P>The 16th teaching post at the school referred to by the Deputy will be lost at the end of the current school year because the enrolment at the school in September 1997 declined to 471 pupils, seven points below the figure set for the retention of this post.  Accordingly, the authorised staffing level for the school for the 1998-99 school year is a principal, 15 teachers and a further two remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>Schools which are unable to organise their classes in compliance with maximum class size guidelines may apply to my Department for additional staffing.  If the managerial authorities of this school project that the September, 1998 enrolment at the school is likely to be such that it cannot be managed within recommended maximum class size guidelines, details of the projected enrolment should be forwarded to my Department immediately.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case made by the association in question in relation to educational provision for children with special needs attending mainstream schools.  The Government's Action Programme for the Millennium attaches key importance to ensuring that people with special needs have equal opportunity to participate fully in all aspects of society.  It is my intention to honour this commitment through maximising the opportunities for special needs children to participate in the education system on a fully integrated basis.</P>
      <P>The Education (No. 2) Bill, as published, contains statutory safeguards for the rights of children with special needs.  In particular, on the enactment of the Bill, boards of management will have a statutory duty to ensure that the educational requirements of children with special needs are provided for.  Boards will be required to have, and to make publicly available, their admissions policies and there will be structures for appeal by parents.  In addition, I have now proposed a number of amendments to the Bill, with the aim of clarifying areas of concern, of addressing, as far as practicable, the concerns expressed and of further strengthening the rights of special needs children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A submission was received in my Department last year from Gaelscoileanna, the umbrella body for all-Irish primary schools, seeking commitments in relation to school recognition, accommodation, support structures, funding and teacher training.  My position is as follows: it is my policy to support the establishment of Gaelscoileanna in areas outside the Gaeltacht, where sufficient demand for such facility is demonstrated and where there exists no alternative within a reasonable distance.  Practical support for Gaelscoileanna is already demonstrated through the payment of increased capitation grants for pupils in these schools, allowing a more favourable pupil teacher ratio compared with ordinary schools and paying allowances to teachers who teach through Irish.  Furthermore, the Department provides increased refund of rental of accommodation costs and grants 100 per cent of the cost of site acquisition and the provision of new buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the need to solve the accommodation problems of Gaelscoileanna countrywide. The key considerations in that regard are the availability of capital funds and the competing needs of other schools.  In 1998, the level of funding allocated to primary school capital has been increased to £39.3 million.  This allocation covers <Col N="931" /> the building, equipping and furnishing of all primary schools and represents an increase of 42 per cent over the corresponding 1997 allocation. Increased funding has enabled the construction of four new school buildings for Gaelscoileanna and architectural planning is under way in respect of a number of other projects.  Overall, I am satisfied that significant progress is being made in this area.</P>
    <P>In relation to a planning and support structure for all-Irish schools, the Education (No.2) Bill, 1997 makes specific reference to the establishment of a body to plan and co-ordinate the provision of Irish-medium textbooks and learning aids, the advise the Minister on policy matters related to Irish-medium education, to provide support services to schools through the medium of Irish and to conduct research into any related matters.  As the Bill progresses through the legislative process, I will give consideration as to how this provision might best be implemented.  A scheme of annual grants was established by my Department in 1993 to assist management bodies <Col N="932" /> of primary schools in their work.  &lsquo;Foras Pátrúnachta na Scoileanna LánGhaeilge&rsquo;, the patron body for a number of Gaelscoileanna, receives financial assistance under this scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to teacher training, the position is that Irish primary school teachers are class teachers as distinct from individual subject teachers.  For this reason, all teachers seeking recognition must achieve a qualification which will enable them to teach all aspects of the curriculum, including Irish, and would therefore be regarded as suitable for employment in Gaelscoileanna.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the Commission on School Accommodation Needs is at present examining the most appropriate criteria for the recognition and resourcing of national schools, including all-Irish schools.  As part of its remit, the commission is carrying out a review of existing policies, structures and funding for this area in the course of preparing recommendations for submission to me.  Policy in relation to Gaelscoileanna will be reviewed in the light of the Commission's recommendations.</P>
