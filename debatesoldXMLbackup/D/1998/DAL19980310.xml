      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The new millennium will be celebrated in a variety of ways here and across the world.  In consultation with my colleagues, I am considering the most appropriate contribution the Government can make to the celebration of the millennium. The Government's approach will be announced as soon as these considerations have been finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The millennium is 21 months away and almost every country has finalised plans on how to mark it.  Will the Taoiseach agree it is extraordinary at this late stage that we have no plans yet to mark it?  Will he agree the millennium would be an appropriate time to have a significant event or some construction in each of the four provinces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Departments and agencies indicated the programmes they are following. I hope to ensure this work will be co-ordinated. A millennium commission and ministerial task force or group will be set up to co-ordinate national, regional and local projects.  The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation will announce his Department's extensive plans to mark the millennium on Sunday and a number of other Departments have announced plans, such as those involving the Academy of Performing Arts. I am anxious to ensure these plans will be properly co-ordinated through the use of whatever resources are available, as outlined by the Minister for Finance on budget day.  Such co-ordination will ensure the success of significant events and community events and projects that will continue into the 21st century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that since independence, hardly one memorable building has been constructed in Dublin or any other city in the country?  Will he agree the millennium would be an appropriate time to have the grand objective of leaving something memorable for the next millennium, for people who will be here in hundreds of years' time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that will happen.  I do not envisage a millennium dome being built but I believe significant events will occur and significant structures will be left in place for the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise proposals have been made for various commemorative projects.  Will the Taoiseach ask the millennium committee to consider the possibility of planting a national forest in which a tree would be planted for every citizen? I am aware some consideration was given to such a proposal by the previous Administration but I do not know how far it proceeded.  The idea certainly has some merit and would last well into <Col N="655" /> the next century.  If oak, beech and other native trees were planted, they would last for centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Hundreds of proposals have been made for millennium projects.  Some of these are well advanced and are being carried out independently by many bodies and organisations using their own resources.  The Deputy is correct in saying that a forestry project was considered in the past.  A proposal involving the signing over of scrubland for use as a forestry plantation is currently well under way.  The project will be carried out in the name of the trust which will plant the trees.  It is one to which I have already lent my support and is an excellent idea.  The idea is that scrubland throughout the country, in public or private ownership, should be donated to the trust and plantations grown on the sites.  This is a well thought out proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government, in its preparation for the commemoration of the millennium, taking account of the fact that it is first and foremost a Christian anniversary which will commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ?  Will there be any religious element in the Government's commemorations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there will.  The precise nature of the commemoration is something on which the various churches have not yet agreed. Churches, individually and collectively, are considering the best course of action.  Many proposals do not have anything to do with the Government and the churches hope these will get under way during the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach about the Government's commemorations, not the churches' commemorations.  Will the Government commemorations take account of the religious significance of the anniversary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is Question Time, it is not unreasonable to ask the Taoiseach to answer my question.  If I must, I will wait to see what happens but I would be grateful if the Taoiseach would answer the question now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has received several good ideas in respect of religious commemorative events and has consulted with the various churches on how best the Christian nature of our country could be commemorated. Some of those suggestions would entail cost proposals while others would not.  The Government will attempt to commemorate the millennium in <Col N="656" /> a long-term manner and as a Christian event in the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Will the Taoiseach put it to the Government that this country should not follow the lead of others, for example, Britain, in planning grandiose buildings to commemorate the millennium?  A social project for the millennium would be more appropriate to this country.  It could be directed towards eliminating serious social problems.  It is scandalous that this country will enter the year 2000 with continuing neglect of many working class housing estates.  A millennium project which would put major resources into transforming those estates and the lives of the communities in them and which would eliminate their social and other problems would be more fitting.  Would the Taoiseach agree that it would be even more appropriate and useful to eliminate the scandal of homelessness and the growing housing lists on the occasion of the millenium rather than grandiose building schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that enormous resources should not be spent on grandiose schemes that are of no lasting benefit.  I also agree about the importance of issues of social inclusion and that we should build on what is already being done in that regard.  The drugs initiative and the youth initiative to bring centres of activity and leisure to deprived communities are ongoing and useful and I support them fully.</P>
      <P>However, there should also be lasting projects which would have beneficial effects.  I and others have long spoken about the establishment of an academy for the performing arts and many groups have worked hard to achieve such an academy.  There is a project in Cork which deals with homelessness.  It is run by the Share organisation which is based in second level schools and is an excellent project for the millennium.  These and other such projects should be supported and developed.  There are also projects relating to sport, the arts and cultural events.</P>
      <P>There will be a limited amount of money for millennium projects.  The Government can participate by helping such projects but it should not build up huge expectations that cannot be fulfilled. It will assist in what ways it can and by being directly involved in certain projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with Deputy Higgins's comments, but if the project is confined to those subjects this will be a dreary city and country, like Albania, which appears to be the model advocated by the Deputy.  There would be nothing worthwhile in this city if previous generations had adopted the approach of this generation. We have left no memorable structures in this city or country since independence.  The millennium is an opportunity to correct that and to ensure this generation leaves something of lasting value, not just to look at but from the point of view of utility. <Col N="657" /></P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Higgins for that helpful intervention.  However, his vision is dreary and it is Albania, which is what he wants.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that we have a duty to enhance our country by leaving something for posterity that is beautiful as well as useful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, and I hope that will happen.  However, there are many committees throughout the country working on their own projects for the millennium and the Government hopes to give them all the encouragement it can.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of Partnership 2000, and as part of the monitoring procedures, I attend an annual meeting with all the parties to the agreement.  In respect of 1997, I fulfilled that undertaking at the July meeting.  I also regularly meet the individual social partners, both on a formal and informal basis.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the large number of organisations represented in Partnership 2000, it would not be practical to report on all such meetings, whether planned or having already taken place.  I propose, however, to report to the House on any meetings between myself and each of the four social partnership pillars as groupings.  I can confirm that I intend to meet the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the Chair does not have control over the Taoiseach's replies, will he guide me as to whether the Taoiseach may answer about some meetings and not <Col N="658" /> about others?  It seems the INOU should be treated as importantly as other bodies and any meetings with it should be reported in the same way as meetings with the ICTU, IBEC or any other such body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect to meet the INOU?  Does he recollect the agitation from these benches when his party was in Opposition for the recognition of the INOU as a social partner?  It was recognised as such for the first time by the Government I led.  Does he agree there is considerable dissatisfaction among the long-term unemployed because people are discriminated against on age grounds?  While there are employment opportunities for young people, it is difficult for the long-term unemployed aged over 25 or 30 years to get an interview, let alone a job, because of a record of unemployment. What steps does the Taoiseach propose to take to ensure that the long-term unemployed aged over 25 years are given an opportunity to take some of the work available, and that employers do not discriminate against them, either on grounds of their address or record of unemployment, which ought not to be held against them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I meet the social partners several times a week, in one form or another &mdash; either at partnership, co-ordinating or competitiveness meetings.  If I reported on each meeting, whether with IBEC or farmers, it would be endless. I have meetings and contact with presidents or general secretaries on their own or with their regional branches.  As partnership is based in the Department of the Taoiseach, I meet the partners on a continuous basis, both formally and informally. It is reasonable to report on meetings with the organisations in their role as pillars of the structure set down in Partnership 2000.  The social partners would not want me to give details on many of the casual meetings concerned with small matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will meet the INOU shortly.  I am not sure of the date &mdash; it is in my diary and is this side of Easter.  The Government will do what it can to help initiatives for the long-term unemployed. Long-term unemployment has fallen dramatically from 130,000 to 86,000 in recent times.  The budget included a number of measures designed to help the unemployed.  The main one is the special tax allowance of £3,000 for the long-term unemployed in the first year of employment.  This is a good proposal which has been widely welcomed and will be successful.  I hope the double tax reduction for wages for employers who employ a long-term unemployed person will also work well.  There was an increase of 5,000 places on the back-to-work allowance scheme which has been successful in reintegrating large numbers of long-term unemployed in employment.  These schemes and the community employment scheme <Col N="659" /> have given people a great opportunity to return to the workforce.</P>
    <P>An additional 1,000 places on the part-time jobs option scheme and 1,000 places on the job initiative scheme were also made available, as recommended by the social partners some time ago.  There have also been improvements to the family income supplement.  The Government will continue to give every assistance it can to the long-term unemployed, regardless of their age, through training and other schemes.  It is important that anyone who is unemployed is given an opportunity to gain employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I will visit Canada and the United States for St. Patrick's Day.  I will travel to Toronto on 13 March where I will attend and address a lunch hosted by the Ireland Fund of Canada.  I will subsequently attend a dinner hosted by the recently appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Mrs. Hilary Weston.  On Saturday, 14 March my engagements will include a breakfast meeting with the Apostles &mdash; a cross-tradition organisation of business people with strong Irish backgrounds and connections.  Later that day, recognising the significant contribution of the Irish to Ontario and the wider Canadian nation, I will attend the 10th Anniversary St. Patrick's Day parade.</P>
      <P>I will travel directly from Toronto to Washington, where I will participate in the now customary celebrations in the USA which highlight and celebrate the Irish in America.  These celebrations which highlight the Irish community and Ireland, present unrivalled opportunities to focus key individuals and the media on important issues of concern to Ireland &mdash; primarily the peace process and the search for a settlement on Northern Ireland and, of course, investment and tourism opportunities and other attractive aspects of Ireland for those concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will liaise with various key individuals and organisations which support Ireland, including key Senators and Congressmen.  I will participate in the Co-Operation North breakfast and attend <Col N="663" /> the American Ireland Fund dinner in Washington. On St. Patrick's Day itself, I look forward to meeting again with President Clinton at the White House for the now traditional presentation of shamrock.</P>
    <P>Among the other functions I will attend are a lunch hosted by Speaker Gingrich, to be attended by the President, at the Capitol; a reception hosted by President Clinton at the White House in the evening; and a breakfast meeting with the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>I will avail of my meetings with President Clinton to update him on recent developments in, and prospects for, the peace process; to thank him for the ongoing and invaluable assistance of his Administration; and to indicate to him how best they can assist in the peace process as we enter the crucial stages of the multi-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, I recently visited Northern Ireland and I subsequently reported comprehensively to the House on that visit.  I have no immediate plans for a further visit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach well on his visit to the United States and Canada.  I compliment him on including Canada in his visit to North America.  It was not always on the itinerary. It is important to recognise that there are three countries in North America.</P>
      <P>What are the implications for the Mitchell principles of the two punishment shootings reported to have occurred in republican areas in the last 24 hours?  What steps are being taken to investigate the responsibility for those punishment shootings, which are clearly in breach of the Mitchell principles?  What sanctions are contemplated in regard to any political associates of those who have been involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent days a number of incidents have occurred which are being examined by the security forces.  There is no particular information in regard to any of them and no group has claimed responsibility.  I am sure we will receive reports on these incidents from the security advisers.  It would be unhelpful of me to speculate further on any of the issues, including punishment beatings, the attacks on Armagh RUC station and a number of recent bomb attacks which seem to be associated with both sides of the divide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there are certain areas in the major cities of the North which are so strongly controlled by one paramilitary organisation that no punishment beating or shooting could take place there without being sanctioned by the paramilitary organisation in charge of the area?  Will he agree, therefore, that it is not difficult to attribute responsibility for a punishment shooting once one knows the organisation that is effectively controlling a given area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of whether that is the case I agree with Deputy Bruton that in the <Col N="664" /> normal communities that was not too difficult in the past.  Visiting Northern Ireland today, however, one can see how that is changing.  From the graffiti on the walls in these areas one can see who is claiming responsibility.  Unfortunately, one of the current difficulties is that there is almost competition in regard to who is controlling the walls to be used for graffiti, which is sad.  The problem is not a simple one and it is not easy to be sure about who is in what organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the &ldquo;no claim, no blame&rdquo; policy being adopted by a number of paramilitary organisations has the potential to gravely undermine the Mitchell principles in practice?  Will he agree also that there is a need for a unit to be established which does not simply comprise the RUC or the Garda Síochána but has other wider capacities to make judgment to ensure that the day to day application of the Mitchell principles takes place and so-called minor breaches, like punishment beatings and shootings, are also sanctioned, and that the Mitchell principles are not seen only to apply to major events but must be applied on a daily basis to protect people from mob law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the Mitchell principles have to be upheld and that they should apply to all these activities, including punishment beatings. That is a regular activity which does not seem to get as much attention.  Recent punishment beatings as well as the bomb attacks on police stations are the hallmarks of paramilitary groups but we do not have information on precisely who they are.  As far as monitoring the Mitchell principles is concerned, we have been examining that issue following recent events to see what we can do to keep abreast of the atrocities.  There are small groups in certain areas determined to find ways around this issue who are probably outside the formal structure of paramilitaries, although that may not be the case in regard to some of them. We have to find some mechanism whereby we can keep track of all these groups.  I agree the Mitchell principles are in favour of upholding democracy and are against violence.  It has not been said in this House but I do not like the interpretation that a particular activity was a minor breach.  Having one's knee blown off or getting hit with a hammer is as bad as any other offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I join others in deploring the recent punishment beatings and the savagery attached to them.  I fully agree with the Taoiseach that these are not minor events, they are particularly savage forms of attack.  Will he agree that those involved in the talks should not be diverted by the attempts being made by those opposed to the talks to derail them?  Will he further agree that <Col N="665" /> many such attempts will be made, as they come closer to what will I hope be a successful conclusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will do everything we can in that regard.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, is attending the talks today on behalf of the Government.  She has condemned these attacks at the talks and the normal agenda for the day is being followed.  That is how we must deal with all of these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that I strongly agree with remarks he made over the weekend to the effect that the crucial issues in the talks are the equality agenda, including policing? Will he agree also that the ultimate way of ending punishment beatings is to have an acceptable policing arrangement where police operating under the rule of law take over all responsibilities from groups currently acting outside the law?  In that context will the Taoiseach give the House information about progress currently being made between the Governments and the parties on issues of policing?  Are proposals being considered on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Many proposals are being considered. Some of the legislation the British Government has brought forward in the present session is useful in that it deals with policing issues.  It is not, however, substantial enough to deal with the great differences in the community on policing.  For a policing authority to command support in an area it must command respect, and that must be earned.  There are major difficulties in that regard.  There are outlines of improvements that could be made, but it would be wrong to give the impression that they are near agreement.</P>
      <P>I have had numerous meetings, as had Deputy Bruton and his predecessors in the past, with the British Prime Minister to highlight what needs to be done, but there is still no acceptance of the radical reform required before Nationalist and Unionist communities agree.  Much more needs to be done.  While I welcome the legislative changes made on policing in recent months in the House of Commons, they do not meet requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree there is considerable contrast between the shenanigans that took place three weeks ago at Dublin Castle and the Four Courts when Sinn Féin and associates complained about being suspended from the talks and the present position where Sinn Féin has not taken the opportunity to become reinvolved in the talks at the earliest possible moment?  Its chief negotiator intends to fly to the United States, apparently to raise funds, rather than become involved in discussions with the British Prime Minister on Thursday of this week. Will the Taoiseach agree that in both cases there is little indication of the engagement on which that party put emphasis up to now? <Col N="666" /></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>I had a full and constructive discussion with President Gil-Robles on current European issues, including developments in the European Parliament. On the subject of Agenda 2000 and the enlargement process, I raised with President Gil-Robles Ireland's concerns about Structural and Cohesion funding and the necessity for adequate transition arrangements for regions which may no longer qualify for objective 1 status.</P>
      <P>It is assumed the next EU summit the Deputy is referring to is the European conference on Thursday, 12 March.  As I indicated in reply to a similar question on 24 February, the European conference will bring together the member states of the Union and the European states aspiring to accede to it.  While arrangements for bilateral meetings have not yet been finalised, it is likely I will hold a short informal meeting with Prime Minister Buzek of Poland during the course of the conference.</P>

      <P>May I take it from the fact that it was omitted from the reply that the Taoiseach did not raise with President Gil-Robles the question of the abolition of duty free sales?  Does the Taoiseach propose to raise that matter at the forthcoming EU summit or at bilateral meetings with EU leaders in the context of that summit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised that matter briefly, as I do as a matter of course at all such meetings, and I will raise it with European leaders at every opportunity.  I am glad to note that, internationally, the campaign is somewhat successful, although not with ECOFIN.  There is increasing pressure on this matter.  Some UK papers had headlines this morning to the effect that pressure was growing for a U-turn on duty free.  It is well worth it for this country and others to take up the campaign.  Of course it has now become an election issue in Germany, with the leader of the opposition there bringing substantial pressure to bear to change the position on it.</P>

      <P>On the duty free issue, given that he was appointed Minister for Finance on 14 November <Col N="667" /> 1991 and the decision to abolish duty free was made at the Council of Ministers, at which no Irish Minister or official from the Department attended on 11 November 1991, two days before the Taoiseach became Minister for Finance, could he explain how he has repeatedly stated in the House that he fought the good fight on duty free, made the arguments and got a derogation until 1999 when, in fact, the decision was made before he was appointed?</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach regard the reports in this morning's newspapers of what occurred at ECOFIN as somewhat humiliating and almost a setback in terms of the fact that the Minister for Finance was not even able to get a proper audience for genuine concerns on this issue?  Might the Minister for Finance have laid the ground a little better before he raised the matter to avoid the sort of damaging newspaper reports which we saw this morning?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not write the newspaper headlines, but it is amazing how the headlines in the UK took a very different view this morning on these issues.  All of the articles stated that the signs of the first breakthrough regarding duty free shopping in Europe had begun to emerge.  The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, assisted in that and we should congratulate him on raising the matter yesterday.  We should congratulate the ongoing work of the Minister for Public Enterprise in her meetings over recent days with the UK, German and French Ministers.</P>

    <P>If we are serious about trying to address this issue, we should continue this campaign.

The leaders of other EU countries do not care who wins the by-elections because they are interested in the substance of the question.  The Minister for Finance might have been better off to have adopted a more conventional approach in raising this issue.</P>

None of our colleagues in Europe would know whether there was a by-election, and they could not care less.</P>
      <P>This has been raised in the context of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, outlining that the KPMG report which he commissioned is almost ready.

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Deputy Sargent on 28 January, a Working Group on Basic Income, operates under the aegis of my Department.  The group is finalising tendering procedures for appointing economic consultants to carry out a study on the viability and suitability of introducing a system of basic income in Ireland.  This independent study will assist the working group in producing as comprehensive and robust a consideration of the subject as possible. The working group operates under Partnership 2000 and will be reporting in due course through the relevant mechanisms under this agreement.</P>

    <P>It is too early at this stage to decide the arrangements in relation to the Green Paper on basic income, which has been committed to in An Action Programme for the Millennium.

Does he also agree that, if we wish to introduce a basic income, the best course to adopt is to take a gradual approach and ensure that all actions taken are consistent with our ultimate destination?  In that case, would the Government not be obliged to abandon the approach of reducing tax rates and opt for an approach of increasing allowances and widening bands?</P>

The public wants to see the introduction of lower tax rates and increases in bands and allowances.  However, that can only be done in an ordered way.  People who are not working and those on the margins want to see an examination of a basic income system and the Government is committed to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised refers to the position of self-employed people who were over 56 years of age on the extension of social insurance to the self-employed in April 1988. While it is difficult to obtain accurate statistics on this group, it is estimated that there were up to 20,000 self-employed people over age 56 when PRSI was extended in 1988 and who were registered for PRSI purposes.  As I indicated recently during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, the additional cost of paying an old age contributory pension to all this group would be of the order of £50 million per annum, equivalent to a capitalised cost of £475 million over the full period of the payments.  The figure of £756 million to which the Deputy referred was originally estimated to be the cost by the National Pensions Board and was based on 50,000 people qualifying for pension.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that I will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible.  I have asked my Department to examine the general issue relating to the self-employed group aged over 56 in April 1988.  The condition that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, before he or she is eligible to qualify for the old age contributory pension, has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961.  The purpose of this condition is to ensure that entitlement to the pension is limited to those who have made a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of their careers.  This ten year condition was supported by the National Pensions Board and it is considered to be reasonable.  The amendment in the Social Welfare Act, 1997, regarding the payment of refund of contributions to this group &mdash; which was agreed by the Deputy's party &mdash; effectively re-emphasised the position of the ten year test.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that any self-employed person who has contributed and does not qualify for either a contributory or a non-contributory pension receives a refund of the pension element &mdash; 53 per cent &mdash; of his or her PRSI contributions with interest, which is a fair arrangement.  I presume that a scheme could be devised for less than £20 million per annum depending, obviously, on the entitlement conditions applied and the level of pension paid.  However, I must stress that any proposals would, as I have indicated previously, have a major cost implication and would fall to be considered in a budgetary context.  I remind the Deputy that in such a context £20 million is a significant amount of money, equivalent to almost 9 per cent of the full year cost of the 1998 Social Welfare budget package.  I indicated previously, and it is important to repeat that a person is entitled to a non-contributory pension, subject to a means test.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that there are two aspects to be considered in respect of pensions for the self-employed, namely, the <Col N="672" /> justice of the case and the question of cost?  Does he accept that, to a large extent, money was taken under false pretences from those over 56 years of age when the scheme was introduced?  Does he also accept that these people did not ask to enter the scheme and as a consequence of their being forced into the system the State has a responsibility to find some formula to return the money taken from them?</P>

      <P>When efforts are made to bring people into the system and certain levels are set, discrimination or anomalies will result.  The same is true of the ten year rule.  If, as has been suggested, we were to reduce that in some way, anomalies would be created.  Deputies will be aware of cases in which people who were just inside the ten year period would have lost out.  It causes problems.</P>
      <P>As I said most recently in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1998, I am having the matter examined.  It is a daunting task which has faced successive Governments.  The Deputy's party was in Government recently and examined the issue, yet the best it felt it could do in the circumstances was to provide for a refund for those affected. That is a laudable compromise but it is not what is wanted by the vast majority of those affected. This issue will not go away and I have asked the Department to examine closely the possibilities for action.  However, the matter will have to be dealt with in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The refund arrangement was made by Deputy Woods, when the Bill to establish the scheme was introduced.  Does the Minister accept there is a degree of urgency to the matter given that the first pensions will become payable on and after 6 April this year?  Has there been a realistic assessment of the cost?  With regard to the cost, does the Minister accept that the problem only concerns those people who were over 56 years at the time of the introduction of the scheme and there will be no continuing cost?  Does he agree that a large proportion of those affected will qualify for a non-contributory pension?  Does he accept that in the context of <i>pro rata</i> pensions the costs discussed are over the top?  In some instances <i>pro rata</i> pensions will be quite small.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I discussed this matter during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  The figure of £50 million for the yearly cost is correct based on 20,000 people.  The estimate of 20,000 people may be conservative.  The original estimate was 50,000 but that has been revised downwards and the final figure may well lie between the two estimates, which would imply a greater cost.  My officials checked the point raised by the Deputy on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill about the numbers who would be in receipt of a non-contributory pension and I am assured that our figures take that into account. That is to say, the £50 million is a net figure based <Col N="673" /> on people who would be in receipt of a non-contributory pension.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that with regard to cost the astronomical estimate of £750 million has been thrown out?  Does he also accept that in this case there is a just claim to a pension in the context of the overall pension bill of more than £1 billion a year?  This is a relatively small element of the overall pension bill.  Will he agree that now is the time to get accurate figures for the payment of <i>pro rata</i> pensions to those who have made the contributions and so clear up this problem?</P>

      <P>I agree the issue should be cleared up.  This has been an issue for ten years and that it has not been cleared up indicates the difficulty faced by previous Governments in addressing it.  The Deputy suggests that we put in place a scheme costing £20 million but I do not think that would be the end of the matter because that would only give a flat rate payment which would not be the full pension and would not apply to the 20,000 or so people involved. However, taking £20 million as a factor of the budgetary package of £125 million, the largest for some time, the Deputy would be asking me not to accord the increase to child benefit payments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the provisions of Part IV, sections 14 and 15 of the Social Welfare Bill, 1998, which were considered by the Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs on 4 March last. These provisions provide a legislative framework for the development of a more integrated approach to the administration, delivery, management and control of publicly funded services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lack of integration between various State services has been a matter of concern for some time and there have been many calls from Members of the House and various commentators for better integration and streamlining of <Col N="674" /> services.  It is generally recognised that this can lead to greatly improved customer service and better control of schemes and services.  My Department's modernisation programme has been under way for a many years.  A key to this programme is the greater integration of services through the use of information technology and closer co-operation with various service organisations.</P>
    <P>The report of the interdepartmental group on the development of the ISSS in August 1996 made a number of recommendations following detailed consideration of the various issues involved including data protection issues.  The proposals in this year's Social Welfare Bill build on this and on the work that has been going on in my Department in recent years.  The Department has links with a number of other agencies and has developed a computerised system for recording means assessments and, along with the health boards, accounts for almost half of the means assessments carried out each year.  The Department is responsible for the allocation of the revenue and social insurance numbers and for the issue of the current social services card, of which there are more than 1.6 million in circulation. These cards, which are a convenient modern record of a person's RSI number, contain limited information and are used at local departmental offices and facilitate payments at post offices.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a public service card will, over time, replace the social services cards and will enable the public service number to be used as a single identifier for public administration purposes.  This is a reasonable extension of the system currently in place.  The public service card is not a general identity card and is not intended as such.  Indeed, the Bill provides that it will be an offence for an unauthorised person to use the card or to seek to have it produced.</P>
    <P>At this stage I am satisfied that the proposals in the Bill, including that in relation to the public service card, have been subject to a full and constructive debate of the issues involved.  For the reasons I have given, it is appropriate that these measures should form part of the Social Welfare Bill.  I am satisfied that appropriate safeguards have been incorporated and when the proposals are fully implemented, which will take time, there will be a better overall service to customers and better value to the taxpayers.</P>

He suggested means testing would be facilitated by the information stored on the strip.  Does this mean one's credit rating will be available to various agencies?

      <P>On 7 November 1993, a fine article in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> stated:</P>
      <P>Joan Burton, Minister for Social Welfare, plans to issue an encoded tax and social welfare card to everyone in the country as part of the Department's drive for efficiencies in the system. Civil liberties' groups need have no worries because the information accessible by the card will be covered by the Data Protection Act and its use will be for tax and social welfare purposes only.</P>
      <P>It is a lengthy article based on the same proposal I am bringing forward.  While the Labour Party objected to the article subsequent to it appearing in the newspaper, this issue has been progressed in my Department since 1993.  The Government, of which the Deputy was a Minister of State, approved an interdepartmental report on this issue in June 1996.  The Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan, was given responsibility &ldquo;to promote and progress this proposal.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that when this proposal was brought before the Labour Party by my former colleague it was solidly and firmly rejected and that is why it did not see the light of day after the article was published. Will he answer my question and stop politicking with this issue?  Will the credit rating of people effectively be stored on the magnetic strip on the cards even though they will not know what it is? How can he prevent such information getting from one computer system to another given computers <Col N="676" /> can now take one's telephone off the hook and listen to what one says when having dinner?</P>

      <P>After initial problems, the spokesperson for the Deputy's party issued a statement recently vehemently opposing this card.  However, when it was pointed out to her that articles, such as that from which I quoted, appeared in newspapers, she said she was not against the card <i>per se.</i></P>
      <P>The credit rating of a person will not be available on this card in any shape or form.  Basic information will be stored on it, such as the individual's name, address, gender, date of birth and marital status.  If additional information is to be put on the card, as I explained on Second and Committee Stages of the Social Welfare Bill, it will be subject to a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas in terms of regulations to extend the amount of information to be stored on the card.  At the end of the day, it is not an identity card and the information can only be accessed through computer systems which are not widely available.  There are strict restrictions in the legislation which will make unauthorised use of the card a criminal offence.</P>
      <P>Data sharing between Departments is subject to strict restrictions and it is widely accepted that, rather than this contravening the civil liberties of any person, there will be no problem in that area and people need not worry as Deputy Burton said in the November 1993 article because at the end of the day it is not designed to restrict a person's privacy but to help people who are not well off and must use State bodies.  For instance, an individual who applies through a community welfare officer for supplementary welfare allowance must provide certain information, but by law the officer is not obliged to take the information and transpose it into that person's application for a medical card.  The officer must sit down and take the same information from the individual again. The card is designed to ensure an individual will be required in those instances to tell his or her story once.  It will streamline people's applications. This move should be welcomed.</P>

      <P>No, because 1.6 million of them are in circulation among social welfare recipients. We are extending the availability of the cards to those who interact with public bodies specified in the legislation and ultimately it will streamline people's interaction with them.  It would not work if it were optional.  The card has been called for by successive Dála while the Committee for Public Accounts has called on this and previous Governments to bring it forward and the Select Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs called on me to get on with the job of introducing it.  They cannot all be wrong.  I do not accept that it should be optional because it would not work.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may not realise that currently when child benefit applications are received, an RSI number is assigned to the children involved. They do not get a card until they reach 16 years but they have an RSI number prior to that.  All their details are available.  The legislation provides that on demand people can get a copy of the information stored on the card if they are worried about it.  If there is an error in that information, there is a facility to correct it.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of last December 10,330 people were in receipt of a carer's allowance at a cost of more than £37 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1990, the allowance has been improved and expanded progressively over the years.  As announced in the budget, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance is being increased from next June by £5, from £70.50 to £75.50 for those over the age of 66, and £3 for carers under 66 from £70.50 to £73.50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the budget also provided for three additional improvements for carers.  The first two of these are of a more technical nature and benefit <Col N="678" /> a small number of people.  These improvements are a disregard of non-national disability pensions up to the maximum level of the old age contributory pension in assessing means and the payment of carer's allowance for six weeks after death to carers whose spouses were not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  The third improvement is the provision of a free travel pass to all those in receipt of carer's allowance in their own right.</P>
    <P>Last month I met representatives of the Carer's Association, the organisation which represents the interests of carers in the home.  I will meet the association again shortly, as will the working group carrying out the review of the carer's allowance scheme.  As part of my commitment to improve the supports for carers, I have recently reviewed the operation of the condition whereby the carer is required to provide the care recipient with full-time care and attention and have decided to adopt a more flexible approach.  Carers may now attend educational or training courses or participate in voluntary or community based activities for approximately ten hours per week provided the carer makes adequate provision for the care recipient in his or her absence. These new arrangements come into effect immediately.</P>
    <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit and to increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.  In line with these commitments, an overall review of the carer's allowance is being carried out in my Department.  This review is considering the purpose and development of the scheme, both in terms of its current operation and its future development.  It will also examine the potential for the development of provision for carers through the social insurance system and the role of the private sector.  The review is expected to be completed by the middle of this year and it will be published.  Further developments will be considered in the light of that review.</P>

      <P>At the beginning of this year I met representatives of the Carer's Association who voiced concerns about the budget.  I explained that I was in office for only a short time before the budget and that the review had not been completed.  The review is based on a scheme introduced by the Fianna Fáil led Government in <Col N="679" /> l990 under the then Minister, Deputy Woods.  The general view at that time was that this is a health rather than a social welfare issue.  I am not saying the review is trying to push the matter over to the Department of Health and Children, but, because of this general view, my predecessor, Deputy De Rossa, decided to carry out an interdepartmental review of the scheme to determine if the private sector should be involved, if the matter should be dealt with under a social insurance scheme or if the elderly and incapacitated should be cared for in nursing homes.  In the short time I had to examine the matter prior to the budget I decided that, rather than make major improvements to the carer's allowance, I would examine the matter in advance of the next budget and I have undertaken to do that.  I explained this to the representatives of the Carer's Association and told them I would meet them on a regular basis.  I also gave them the unusual opportunity of being part of the interdepartmental group involved in the review. Up to now their views were not part of the process because of its interdepartmental nature. They welcome the fact that they can participate in the review.</P>
      <P>I made a number of improvements in the budget.  The issue of full-time care and attention is a main bone of contention.  I decided to give the 10,330 people concerned free travel passes which they deeply appreciate.  We acknowledge that they cannot give 24 hour constant care and attention.  I also agreed to relax further the criteria for full-time care and attention and allow carers to take part in other work which will not be taken into account in the assessment.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept the alleged improvements in the budget are derisory? People who care for the sick, disabled or the elderly on a 24 hour basis will not make much use of a free travel pass.  Does he accept the Carer's Association is very disappointed that its concerns were not dealt with in the budget?  Does he accept that it is in our interest to encourage the 30,000 full-time carers to continue to provide that care rather than dump people in institutions?  Does he accept that carers need more than empty promises? They want a fair deal which would include a respite allowance for the 30,000 full-time carers and a relaxing of the means disregard.</P>

      <P>Members opposite do not have a monopoly on the view that those who are paid a carer's allowance do a tremendous job.  We all accept that the question of whether people should be put into institutions, paid for by the State, is a major one.  When the scheme was set up in 1990 it was considered that there was a need for a review but eight years on when the review started it was considered that rather than tinker with the carer's allowance, we should review all the broader issues and decide whether there should be an insurance based scheme for everybody, to which <Col N="680" /> they could contribute in their PRSI, to avail of a caring regime.  This is how the scheme operates in Germany and in some other European countries. Those issues are being examined as well as the involvement of the private sector and the Department of Health and Children in this departmental review which I expect will be available mid year. I have assured the Carer's Association I will look at all these issues in conjunction with the results of the interdepartmental review with a view to bringing forward changes in next year's budget.</P>

      <P>I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the review and that many officials in his Department consider this is a health issue.  Is the Minister aware that carers cannot receive any payment from his Department, even though they qualify on medical grounds, because the person being cared for is under 65 years of age and does not receive a payment from his Department?  Is it fair that the person being cared for must be in receipt of a payment from the Department for the carer to qualify?  That is unfair to many people who do Trojan work in looking after parents who are under 65 and not in receipt of a social welfare payment.</P>

      <P>Without going into the specifics of the case, over the years a number of anomalies have come to light.  In the beginning this was a restricted scheme.  I am not saying my Department officials said we should transfer this matter to the Department of Health and Children.  In 1990 my Department decided to take this issue on board when, strictly speaking, it was an issue that was to be dealt with in the health area.  This raises major issues.  It is clear from actuarial reviews undertaken in my Department that in a short period we will have a more aged population and a smaller working population to sustain that older population.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That is absolutely true.  I will endeavour to supply to the Deputy a copy of the actuarial review, conducted by independent consultants, which issued from my Department in regard to where we are going as a nation.  It is clear we are becoming older and that raises serious issues.  We have to plan for that because it is only a relatively short time away.  This is one of the reasons the review of the carer's allowance is important and we welcome it.  This was recognised by the rainbow Government and was the reason it set up the review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my previous replies to Questions No. 28 on 15 October 1997, No. 31 on 26 November 1997 and No. 58 on 4 February, 1998.  Unemployment assistance is a means-tested payment paid to unemployed people between the ages of 18 and 66 not entitled to insurance-based unemployment benefit.  Payments are means-tested to ensure the limited resources available are directed at those most in need.  In assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have together with the value of any capital or property.  In addition, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant, such as that of board and lodging in the family home, is assessed.</P>
      <P>Under current arrangements, any claimant, irrespective of age, whose sole means are derived from the assessment of board and lodging in the parental home and who is entitled to less than £25 per week, has their payment increased to £25. This means, for instance, that where the combined net parental income does not exceed £19,698 per annum, a claimant is entitled to at least the minimum £25 weekly payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal arguments for the abolition or relaxation of the benefit and privilege rule for young unemployed people is that the operation of this rule encourages them to leave the family home to qualify for higher unemployment assistance payments and rent supplements. However, as I have pointed out in previous replies on this topic, the limited evidence which is available does not suggest this is happening to <Col N="682" /> any significant degree.  In particular, a report published by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1993: Pathways to Adulthood in Ireland: Causes and Consequences of Success and Failure in Transitions Amongst Irish Youth, while not directly addressing this issue, presented evidence which did not lend great support to the argument outlined above.</P>
    <P>The report looked at the rate over time at which young people moved out of the family home.  It found that leaving home is a highly complex process with many different facets, including the pattern of full-time education participation and the nature of employment sought.  Most interestingly, in this context, the research found that unemployed people were the slowest group to move out of the family home.  While these results must be interpreted in the light of the complex factors which prevail in the decision to move out, they do not lend support to a view that unemployed young people are more likely to leave the family home because of the qualification conditions for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>More recently, in its report in 1995, the review group on the role of supplementary welfare allowance in relation to housing considered the issue of how the benefit and privilege provision might be contributing towards young people leaving the family home and claiming rent supplement. While the group found that the possible effect of the benefit and privilege rule was one of a range of factors which may have contributed to the growth in rent and mortgage supplementation since 1989, they were not able to establish the relative importance of any individual factor. However, the group concluded that key factors in the growth of numbers of people claiming rent and mortgage supplements, included the increased availability of information relating to welfare entitlements and increased public expectations regarding welfare support levels.</P>
    <P>While the available evidence does not support the notion that the benefit and privilege rule is a highly significant factor in the movement of young people out of the family home, my Department will, nevertheless, continue to evaluate this provision in the light of any new evidence which becomes available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that young people leave home for a variety of reasons.  Will the Minister agree that to be independent and to have a few pounds in their pockets a small number of young people move out of the family home to qualify for unemployment assistance?  If the Minister's child or my child was unemployed they would not receive unemployment assistance.  Is the Minister satisfied that they should remain in the family home?  The Minister should waive the benefit and privilege rule in cases where young persons will not receive unemployment assistance to encourage them to remain at home.  A small group is involved.  The Department should be pro family and encourage people to stay at home rather than give them an incentive to move out. <Col N="683" /></P>

      <P>I do not accept there is an incentive for people to move out.  Those who say that the rules applying to unemployment assistance are such that they make people leave home are not living in the real world.  There are a number of other factors which come into play.  In a changing society people like their independence and want to stand on their own feet.  Efforts should also be made to ensure so far as possible people stay at home.  The aim of the benefit and privilege rule is to ensure the available resources go to those most in need.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about one aspect.  Has the Minister thought about the possible constitutional implications of denying somebody over the age of majority assistance based on their parents' income, to which they may not have access?  Is this constitutionally suspect?  While a person may have a bed in the house, this hardly justifies wiping out the payment.  He or she may be left high and dry as a result.  Has this issue been tested?  Is the Minister of the view that a <i>prima facie</i> case could be made in the courts?</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the increasing pressure on young people to leave home, in view of the fact that, if unemployed, the means test which their parents undergo often leaves them with little benefit in comparison with the extra money available from the Eastern Health Board and Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs if in flat accommodation; and the action, if any, he will take to change this system which benefits private landlords and dissuades families from staying together, especially if young people are unemployed.</Quest>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 19 on this matter.</P>
      <P>The available research highlights that the reasons young people leave home are highly complex with many different facets, including the pattern of full-time education participation and the nature of employment sought.  Most interestingly, in this context, the research found that unemployed people were the slowest to move out of the family home.</P>
      <P>While these results must be interpreted in light of the complex factors which prevail in the decision to move out, they do not lend support to a view that unemployed young people are more likely to leave the family home because of the qualification conditions for unemployment assistance or rent supplements.  My Department will continue to review this area in light of new evidence which becomes available.</P>
      <P>The abolition or relaxation of the assessment of benefit and privilege would have significant cost implications.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister reconsider his statement that the regulations do not lead to the breakup of families?  An unemployed son or daughter living at home would not receive unemployment assistance but if they decided to move into a flat they would receive the full rate.  The regulations, therefore, do lead to the breakup of families because of the denial of unemployment assistance based on the parents' income.</P>

      <P>On my own behalf and that of Fianna Fáil, I take this opportunity to express our deepest sympathy to the widow and family of the late Mr. Jack McQuillan who died at the weekend after a long illness.  Mr. McQuillan first entered the Dáil 50 years ago in 1948 as the Roscommon representative of Clann na Poblachta which gained ten seats in that election.  His prime motivation for entering politics was to campaign for land and agricultural reform.</P>
      <P>Mr. McQuillan will be remembered as a radical politician.  He left Clann na Poblachta in support of his colleague and lifelong friend, Dr. Noel Browne, and stood as an Independent in the general elections of 1951 and 1957.  He was re-elected on both occasions.  In the 1961 election Mr. McQuillan topped the poll as a candidate for the newly formed National Progressive Democrats which he and Dr. Browne founded.  When the National Progressive Democrats were wound up in 1963 both men joined the Labour Party.  Mr. McQuillan was elected as a Labour Party Senator in 1965.  He also served as general secretary of the Post Office Officials Association.</P>
      <P>Jack McQuillan was an accomplished footballer at county level and won two All-Ireland medals for Roscommon in 1943 and 1944.  He is remembered fondly by those who knew him for his sporting achievements and his courageous campaigning for the west.  He is remembered as a sportsman, an accomplished member of the Army and a public representative with a strong radical view of how the people should be served.  Jack McQuillan was always a man of principle and integrity.  To his widow, Angela, and daughter, Helene, I extend our condolences on their loss. Ba cuimhne ag obair le Jack McQuillan go deo i measc an mhuintir.</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to the memory of Jack McQuillan.  Probably very few Members will remember him as a Member of this House.  Most of us who met him would have met him, as I did, after he ceased to be a Member.  On the occasion I met him I remember he was as interested in politics and in what was going on as he had always been and he had strong opinions about the issues of the time. He was a man of strong conviction. <Col N="686" /></P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said, he came into politics as a member of Clann na Poblachta.  In so doing, he epitomised the radicalism of Roscommon politics. It is a county that is impatient with its public representatives, with the pace of change and is anxious for improvement at all times.  It is a constituency that is far from one that could be described as placid and rural.  It is a constituency of great ambition.  Jack McQuillan epitomised in many ways the ambition and radicalism of his native county of Roscommon.</P>
      <P>Clann na Poblachta, of which he was an important founder member, is part of our history. The traditions of the clann are to be found in all parties in this House.  Some members of the clann became members of my party, others joined Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and other parties. The historical significance of the clann is as a party that very strongly expressed the ambition of people for a better life after the dreary years of the emergency and the Second World War.  All the repressed feelings that were beneath the surface and had to remain beneath it during the war because of the difficult and straitened circumstances of the country found expression in a radical ambition for a better future through the Clann na Poblachta Party.  It helped form the first inter-party Government in the history of this State.  It was a very successful, radical and reforming Government and the clann helped to shape the views of other parties and Governments subsequently.</P>
      <P>The name of Jack McQuillan is linked in the memory of most people with Dr. Noel Browne, but Jack was very much his own man.  He had his own views and while he allied himself with his friend, he was not in the shadow of his friend at any time.  I join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to his memory and expressing sympathy to his family and friends.  I also pay tribute to him for the way he bore his long illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The death of Jack McQuillan at the weekend, mere months after the death of his closest political colleague, Dr. Noel Browne, brings to an end a remarkable alliance in Irish politics. Jack McQuillan was a socialist and a democrat. His election from the Roscommon constituency in the 1948 general election is notable for that alone.  The north-west is not known for the vibrancy of the third party tradition on this island and Jack McQuillan's achievement must be seen in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He left the clann in 1951 in sympathy with Dr. Noel Browne and was expelled from the party over the mother and child scheme.  He was returned to the Dáil as an Independent in 1951, comfortably beating the official Clann na Poblachta candidate.  It is difficult at this distance to appreciate the impact those two politicians had on the Ireland of their time.  For obvious reasons the bulk of attention has focused on the mother and child scheme, but the most significant achievement McQuillan and Browne left the people of Ireland was the successful campaign <Col N="687" /> they waged against TB.  Many people who are alive today owe their lives to the campaigning politics of Browne and McQuillan.</P>
    <P>Unlike Dr. Noel Browne, Jack McQuillan never joined Fianna Fáil.  In 1957 both men co-operated in the establishment of the National Progressive Democrats.  In 1961 Jack McQuillan topped the poll in Roscommon representing his new party.  In 1963 both men joined the Labour Party, but unfortunately Jack McQuillan's association with the party ended in 1968.  Possibly as a result of his membership of the Labour Party and the playing of the red scare card against him &mdash; the traditional attack by social conservatives against the Irish radical &mdash; Jack lost his Dáil seat in 1965 but he became a Labour Senator.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of meeting Jack on a few occasions.  He was an independent-minded man, firm in his convictions and passionate in their pursuit. He became a skilled parliamentarian, so much so that the rules of this House were altered to prevent his and Dr Noel Browne's total domination of debates.  His politics were instructed by his rejection of the exploitation of working people and the unnecessary poverty that was the inevitable result.  His loss will be deeply felt, but I know he would have been pleased with the progress made in recent years to make this Republic a more tolerant and pluralist State.  Much of the inequity, poverty and intolerance Jack campaigned against remains with us and his request to us would be to eliminate them.  On behalf of the Labour Party, a party proud of its association with Jack, I extend our sympathy to his wife, Angela, and his daughter, Helene, on their loss</P>

      <P>I join the Taoiseach and Deputies Bruton and Stagg in offering my condolences to Jack McQuillan's widow, Angela, and daughter, Helene.  The term &ldquo;radical&rdquo; is often loosely used in Irish politics, but it is an appropriate term to describe the late Jack McQuillan.  In his autobiography <i>Against the Tide</i> Dr Noel Browne tells us that between 1957 and 1961 Sean Lemass described the two of them as the only real Opposition in the House.  When we recall the type of issues Jack McQuillan raised in the 1940s and 1950s, we can see he was a true radical.  He raised issues from gay rights to the public ownership of whiskey distilling and was among the first Deputies to advocate the boycott of South African goods.  During his years in politics he was not afraid to challenge the <i>status quo</i> and to raise controversial issues.  He made an enormous contribution to Irish politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said, he was also a great sportsman and won two All-Ireland medals for Roscommon in 1943 and 1944.  Irish politics is the poorer for the absence of people like Jack McQuillan.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I extend sympathy to his wife and daughter on their loss. <Col N="688" /></P>

      <P>On behalf of my party, I extend sympathy to Jack's wife, Angela, and his daughter Helene on their loss.  Jack McQuillan was one of the greats of this House.  The tributes paid to him an hour ago at Glasnevin were heartfelt on a personal level, but they also acknowledged his important historical role.  He was a rural radical, a west of Ireland socialist and a champion for ordinary Ireland, for the poor and the marginalised. When he was a Member of this House in the 1940s and 1950s Ireland was a very different place.  It was conservative and suspicious and did not tolerate difference easily.  Great courage was needed to be the champion he was and he never lacked that courage.</P>
      <P>With his great friend and comrade, Dr. Noel Browne, he helped to make Ireland a more compassionate and progressive place.  On behalf of Democratic Left, I record our sympathy, but personally I will miss him.  He was a neighbour of mine in his later years and every day he passed my house on his way to Bray promenade.  Up to the end he was great company.  He had a sharp intellect and an acute wit.  He had a passionate regard for justice.  His rage for justice, as it was described at Glasnevin, was unrelenting.</P>
      <P>I met him on the promenade recently and he recounted, with great gusto, that a heifer had broken free, had run down the promenade and jumped through a plate glass window of the Bray Head Hotel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>That episode of an iconoclastic heifer breaking out and gaining freedom despite all the odds struck a chord with him and epitomised what he believed in.  He was a republican who believed in the principle of republicanism, liberty, equality and solidarity.  He believed in peace on this island and always stood by the principle of republicanism when many others abused it.  Sadly, he has lost his last fight as we all will but he was very active until the end of his life. My life has been changed for the better by his living and we are all diminished somewhat by his leaving.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I join other Members in paying tribute to the late Jack McQuillan.  I am still young enough not to remember him as a political figure but, having read his obituaries in the newspapers, I know he was the kind of political figure with whom many people in the Green Party could identify and admire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jack McQuillan did not enter politics for personal advantage, improved status or prestige, nor did he aspire to the higher rungs of political office.  He entered politics because he believed in change and believed that change could be achieved through the political process.  He was a man of immense courage and tenacity, a man of <Col N="689" /> principle and idealism and a man who gave politics a good name.</P>
    <P>At a time when the differences between political parties have become somewhat blurred as they all rush towards the centre, it is important to remember a man like Jack McQuillan who embodied the spirit of political radicalism.  He was radical at a time when it was difficult to be radical, a time when being radical could mean being denounced from the pulpit or being ostracised by the political establishment.  As a result, Jack McQuillan's political career was a varied one but was always consistent with his beliefs.</P>
    <P>In the past year, we have been saddened by the passing of Dr. Noel Browne and Jim Kemmy.  I believe Jack McQuillan belonged to that tradition and the greatest compliment I can pay him is that contemporary Irish politics needs more people like him.  On behalf of the Green Party, I extend my sympathy to his wife, family and friends.</P>

This affects amendment No. 92, in the name of the Minister for Finance, which is properly addressed to line 38 and not line 26 due to incorrect numbering.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.  &mdash; Section 15(2) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;or</P>
      <P>(c) in a case where such individual is a widowed person who has not remarried before the commencement of the year and a qualifying child is resident with him or her for the whole or part of the year, at the rates specified in Part 2 of that Table.  A qualifying child shall have the same definition as in section 462(1)(a).'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to allow widowed persons with dependent children to benefit from the tax bands for married people. About 25 per cent of widows, most of whom have dependent children, pay tax at the top rate at present.  This amendment proposes that the married double tax bands be applied to widows and widowers.  The State should support rather than penalise widowed persons in the trying and often traumatic circumstances in which they find themselves.</P>
      <P>The State has handled income tax measures this year by launching an all-out drive to reduce tax rates.  However, a more balanced approach, which would incorporate measures such as this amendment, would be more beneficial.  It is interesting to note that 18,000 more people are now paying tax at the higher rate than was the case before the budget.  I urge the Minister to consider this small extension of relief to widowed persons with dependent children.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to grant the same income tax bands which apply to the taxable income of married couples to the taxable income of widowed persons with children attending full-time education.  I have a <Col N="693" /> degree of sympathy for the idea behind the proposed amendment.  I considered the option of married rate bands for widowed persons with dependent children when I prepared the last budget.  In the event I chose another option, to increase the special allowance for widowed parents following the death of their spouse from £1,500 to £5,000 and to taper the allowance over five years instead of three.  This would provide a more focused way of giving relief to widowed families at a time when financial pressures can be greatest.</P>
      <P>The amendment, if accepted, would cost £2 million in 1998 and £3.3 million in a full year. However, in equity it would be difficult not to extend it to other lone parents, thereby increasing the full year cost to £9.2 million.  If the married entitlement to reliefs such as mortgage interest relief were also extended to single parent families, as would seem to follow, costs would be even greater.  The Government appreciates that widowed and other lone parents might have particular difficulties but there are serious practical objections to giving them the double rate bands. Double rate bands would only be of value to lone parents taxed at the higher rate, that is, to about 40 per cent of such parents who are on the higher rate.  Any concessions, therefore, would apply only to better off lone parents.</P>
      <P>Double rate bands are given to married couples because there are two adults to support.  This is not the position with lone parents whose present tax treatment essentially falls between that of a single person and a married couple.  Such treatment is not unreasonable given that there is only one adult to support.  If a concession were made for lone parents because they have children, there would be immediate calls for concessions for such parents with lower incomes, who could not benefit from a doubling of the bands, and for married couples with children compared to married couples without children.  As a concession would have already been made for lone parents on the higher tax rate, such calls in equity would be difficult to resist.</P>
      <P>The pressure for extending the married rate bands to lone parents arises essentially from the level of the higher rate of tax and the income level at which the rate begins to apply.  Cutting tax rates and extending the standard rate band, as envisaged in the Government's programme, will help taxpayers generally, including widowed and other lone parents, and will avoid the difficulties to which I referred.  In these circumstances I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spent a great deal of time considering the tax position of widows and widowers before announcing the budget.  I am greatly influenced in this by my upbringing and I discussed what I could do about it in the budget with the Department's officials.  I would have liked to have taken the course proposed in this amendment if it could be confined to widows and widowers.  However, in equity I could not justify not extending it to lone parents.  By extending the provision to lone <Col N="694" /> parents the cost increases dramatically and such a concession would mean other concessions in the future.  With that in mind, I suggested the additional allowance of £5,000 for widowed people which would be tapered down over five years.  It is a significant concession.</P>
    <P>I respect the Deputy's motives in tabling this amendment.  I considered the option but due to the additional costs which would arise, because in equity the concession would have to be extended to lone parents and others, I regretfully concluded I could not adopt it.  My sympathies are with the Deputy in this matter.  I am greatly influenced by my upbringing as my mother was widowed and left to rear three young boys, of whom I, at four and a half years of age, was the eldest.  She was not in a position to pay tax as her income was too low.</P>
    <P>However, widows with children are not looked after in our social welfare system as well as they should be.  I considered allocating the married rate tax band to widowed people but due to the inevitable additional costs I could not so do. Hence, the proposal to increase substantially the bereavement allowance and to taper it down over five years instead of three.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given eloquent testimony of where his heart lies and I appreciate that.  There are similarities between widowed and lone parents but the amendment was to cater for widowed persons.  There are additional traumatic effects of widowhood &mdash; having one's life dashed, sometimes suddenly, and the fact that the surviving spouse might not have been the main breadwinner &mdash; a scenario which does not apply to lone parents.</P>
      <P>The advice to the Minister was not to dip his foot in that water because of the extended consequences, but I do not accept such consequences necessarily follow.  There would be wide sympathy in the community for treating widowed people in a more favourable manner than others, including lone parents.  For that reason I will try once again to tug at the Minister's heartstrings, which were evident when he spoke.</P>

      <P>While the Minister is sympathetic to widowed people, they are still getting a raw deal.  I wish to raise a matter which, if it cannot be discussed in conjunction with this amendment, could perhaps be discussed in the context of other amendments.  It relates to carers who become widows.  When a carer becomes a widow she is given the widow's pension for the loss of her husband but automatically loses the carer's allowance, despite the fact that she continues <Col N="695" /> to be a full-time carer.  Can that be discussed in the context of this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could be convinced this matter could be totally ring-fenced and apply only to widows, I would accept Deputy Coveney's amendment.  I gave this matter considerable consideration in the lead up to the budget because this is what I wanted to do.  I was not convinced I would be able to restrict the provision to widows or widowers.  Inevitably, in all equity, I also had to extend it to lone parents.  Even though in the tradition in which I, Deputy Coveney and Deputy McCormack were brought up, there is great sympathy for widows and widowers, after a period of time the provision would have to be extended to lone parents because it would be difficult to defend if it was not.  This brings additional cost.  If I am convinced between now and next year's budget I will go in that direction.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 200,000 widowed persons in the State, of whom around 66,000 are taxpayers. Of these taxpayers, 8,200 are widowed parents.  The beneficiaries of Deputy Coveney's amendment would be approximately 2,600 widowed parents who pay tax at a rate of 48 per cent.  His proposal would cost £3.3 million per year.  In contrast, the increase I made in the widowed parents' bereavement allowance will benefit approximately 3,500 families and will cost £2.5 million per year.  More families benefit from my provision at a lesser cost.</P>
      <P>My relief is more equitable and provides substantial relief to widowed families at home, where financial pressures are the greatest.  There is less than £1 million difference between my change and that proposed in Deputy Coveney's amendment and it is not something about which we should fight.  My difficulty is that I was not convinced I could apply the provision to widows and widowers only.  Extending it to other categories means a considerably higher cost.  If I am convinced, I will put forward the amendment at next year's budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">

      <P>What about carers who become widows?  If a carer is looking after her husband's bedridden father or mother and she becomes a widow, she qualifies for a widow's pension because she qualified for a carer's allowance. However, she immediately loses the carer's allowance.  She is much worse off without her husband and the carer's allowance, despite the fact that she must continue to care for her husband's relatives.</P>

      <P>I did not hear Deputy Coveney's opening remarks and perhaps he did not comment on the point I wish to raise.  One hundred pages has been added to the Bill since Committee Stage.

The budget has been brought forward to early December, as distinct from late January.  We finished Committee Stage of the Bill last week and have been propelled into Report Stage the succeeding week.  This is not a good practice.  In addition last week's debate is not on the system.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for that information but I do not think any Opposition spokesperson is aware of it.  This is critical annual legislation and the Minister put a lot of information on the record during Committee Stage.  Some of us would like to take advice on it and it takes a great deal of time to read through proceedings. We have not had that opportunity as they are not on the system.  If they were published in conventional form this morning, I, along with a great number of my colleagues, was elsewhere.  The <i>Limerick Leader</i> and <i>Limerick Echo</i> were pre-occupying me more than Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  The country must be on auto pilot, judging from the number of the Minister's colleagues I met.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 relates to the different architecture of how the parties on this side of the House would have spent the money available to the Minister.  The Minister took a great deal of time on Committee Stage telling us he did not give a damn what the Conference of Religious in Ireland, the Combat Poverty Agency, Fine Gael, Democratic Left or the Labour Party said and that he has his views.  I will not invite him down that road again because I accept that is the case. Like a predecessor of the Minister, I will not urge on him the views of what was formerly known as the Conference of Major Religious Superiors in Ireland.  His predecessor said he distrusted any organisation which had both &ldquo;major&rdquo; and &ldquo;superior&rdquo; in its title.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>He had a point.  The name has since been changed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken up an intensely ideological position on how to spend the money available to him in terms of tax reform.  I will not suggest he should have taken on board the views of the Opposition parties or the organisations to which I referred. However, he took up a consciously ideological position which went for reductions in rates rather than giving a nod in the direction of the unique consensus achieved before the budget and the publication of the Finance Bill which favoured concentrating such relief as was available in the area which would best assist people on low and middle incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a unique consensus and I am sure the Minister will not dismiss it.  He acknowledged on Committee Stage that it existed across the board. It was highly unusual to see employer organisations like ISME coming on board.  It was the view of the social partners, the trade union movement and Opposition parties that by concentrating on tax free allowances and widening the tax bands we had a unique opportunity to give some relief to those on low and middle incomes who have been hard pressed over the years, and to take out of the tax net those people who are taxed at a ridiculously low level of income.  My amendment is a piece in the jigsaw of widening <Col N="698" /> the tax bands.  Deputy McDowell tabled a similarly constructed amendment.  Our proposals, taken together with the tax free allowances, would mean a single worker on the average industrial wage would not have to pay tax at the marginal rate.  We propose that a single worker should be able to earn £14,600 before he or she has to pay the higher rate of tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to think he has given these people a major concession by providing that they now pay the element of their salary liable to the marginal rate at 46 per cent rather than 48 per cent.  However, this was not the point; rather it was how soon one becomes liable to pay at the rate of 46 per cent or 48 per cent.  The Minister had an opportunity to take people on the average industrial wage off this rate.  He also had an opportunity to encourage the trend initiated by the previous Government in assisting people from welfare to work.  There is a problem of low pay in the economy.  At the same time employers are looking for employees.  This has been articulated frequently in the media by way of various stunts.  There has also been genuine commentary about the difficulty of getting people to fill certain jobs.  In many cases the low rates of pay are an impediment to entry into the workforce. Depending on one's circumstances, there is a barrier to re-entry to the workforce.</P>
    <P>The idea behind concentrating on tax reform measures in the way I propose is to assist people from welfare to work, to make it worth their while to go from welfare to work.  The Minister, for his own ideological reasons, decided against this and instead went for the PD approach of slashing income tax rates.  The optics of this are good; everyone likes to hear they will pay less in terms of the rates.  However, people are able to calculate their take-home pay and they know that the other system was more fair, more equitable and more conducive to helping people re-enter the workforce.</P>
    <P>When I was in the community centre in Moyross this morning I saw a poster which said, &ldquo;The budget is an opportunity to create more or less equality in Ireland&rdquo;.  There is a consensus not only on this side of the House but also outside the House that the Minister has foregone the opportunity to create more equality and has effectively exacerbated inequalities.  This is regrettable as he had an opportunity no Minister for Finance in living memory had in terms of the propitious financial situation he inherited from his predecessor.  He could have used the money differently but regrettably he choose to use it in this way.  This has set back the path of tax reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already travelled this road and we are assembled here to see if the Minister had a Pauline conversion over the weekend. We will soon discover, as the Minister discovered in Brussels yesterday, that people's minds are not so easily changed.</P>
      <P>These amendments propose a different way of making income tax reductions.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the Minister has adopted an essentially ideological position.  We must ask ourselves what tax reductions are for and why we propose them in the first instance.  We must have coherent answers to these questions.  Inasmuch as I can determine it, the Minister's answer is that he wants to reward people at work and he got a mandate in last year's general election to do it in this way.  However, the Minister needs to go a good deal further.  The way of reducing tax proposed by this side of the House would do a number of things.  It would increase the incentive to work, particularly for people on low and middle income, by reducing the impact of poverty and unemployment traps.</P>
      <P>It would also contribute significantly to social partnership.  The Minister does not need me to tell him that when the current Partnership 2000 agreement was negotiated, the social partners were given to understand that tax reductions would be carried out in a particular way.  There is no doubt, and we know this directly from the mouths of the social partners, that the way in which the Minister has chosen to do it is not helping. It may indeed have exactly the opposite effect.</P>
      <P>In moving these amendments, Deputy Rabbitte and I do not really expect the Minister to have changed his mind in the course of last weekend since he has clearly taken this view for some time. We wish, however, to put down a serious marker for next year's budget and budgets in subsequent years.  It is correct to say that the Government has a mandate from the people to reduce income tax in a particular way.  It is also true to say, however, that the Government changed that proposal some days before the election to include a general proposition in relation to bands and allowances.  If we can do nothing more, perhaps we can get some indication from the Minister as to how he sees the balance next year and the year after in relation to the method of reducing tax as between rates, bands and allowances.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern made the point about people on average incomes.  It would be surprising if we were not all a good deal better off because the Minister actually granted half a billion pounds' worth of tax reductions.  It would be astonishing if he had not succeeded in substantially improving the position of nearly everybody in our economy. He should be seeking, however, to improve the position of particular people, including those on £8,000 to £10,000 a year and those who are just inside the marginal upper rate of tax, earning £13,500 to £15,000.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, those people should be paying tax at 24 or 26 per cent rather than at the higher rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> I hope the Minister will give serious consideration as to how he will go about reducing taxes and distributing the benefits of growth next year and the year after.</P>

      <P>I will deal also with the points that Deputy Ahern made.  I did not interrupt him.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a credibility problem.  We have just dealt with amendment No. 1 on Report Stage which deals with widows.  In replying to that the Minster talked the good fight but did not deliver.  I accept there may be problems in giving effect to that amendment, but I fail to see why it is not possible to deal with that matter and to include single parents.  I accept there would be a cost factor, but in a Finance Bill the Minister is presented with choices and the choices he has taken throughout this budget are working consistently against low earners, the marginalised and those dependent on social welfare.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Ahern raised the point about take home pay as a consequence of the budget. One of the more significant consequences of the budget is that it flies in the face of the commitment in the joint programme for Government about the numbers of taxpayers who will pay the higher rate of tax.  The Minister may argue that the top rate has been reduced, but the proof is &mdash; as the Minister said in reply to a parliamentary question &mdash; that 18,000 extra taxpayers will pay the higher rate.</P>
      <P>We also had the credit union debacle when, regrettably, the Minister's mask slipped somewhat on Committee Stage.  The Minister was offered the opportunity by Deputy Noonan to withdraw a derogatory analogy he had drawn between credit unions and mad dogs.  Over a period of time from budget day to Report Stage of the Finance Bill, the picture has developed of a Minister who is focused on the interests of those on high incomes rather than low ones.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister to correct the record and withdraw his regrettable comment about credit unions.  I was present when the remark was made and, while I accept it may have been delivered in a jocular fashion, it would be remiss of the Minister not to avail of the opportunity to withdraw it now, having had time to reflect.</P>

      <P>I support the view expressed by other Opposition Members.  We are not rerunning the general election, but it is clearly more difficult to get across to people that widening tax bands, as well as increasing personal allowances and exemption limits, is more beneficial than simply cutting rates.  In reply to a parliamentary question the Minister said 18,000 more people are now on the top rate.  Deputy Rabbitte is quite right &mdash; it is more important for somebody to remain longer on the lower rate of 24 or 26 per cent than to get a reduction in the top rate.  While my party is not opposed to reducing tax rates, we would give more priority to widening bands in order to keep out of the top rate longer, which is of greater benefit to taxpayers, as well as increasing exemption limits and personal allowances.</P>
      <P>The Minister's approach is excessively loaded in the direction of rates.  It does not deliver to lower and middle income groups in as focused a way as all the Opposition parties would want it to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill proposes to extend the standard rate band by £100 for single persons and £200 for married couples.  Coupled with this is a two point reduction in both the standard rate of income tax from 26 to 24 per cent and the higher rate from 48 to 46 per cent.  These changes are part of an overall personal tax and employees' PRSI package which would cost over £516 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte's amendments would increase the standard rate band by a further £300 for a single person and £600 for a married couple at an additional cost of £40 million in a full year. Deputy McDowell's amendments would go further by increasing the standard rate band by £400 for a single person and £800 for a married couple at a full year cost of £53 million.</P>
      <P>The cost of personal tax changes already provided for in the Bill, which represents a significant first step in meeting the commitments set out in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, is the most the budgetary situation will allow for this year.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to accept either Deputy Rabbitte's or Deputy McDowell's amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's An Action Plan for the Millennium envisages, among other things, a reduction in tax rates.  The standard rate will fall to 20 per cent and the higher rate to 42 per cent over five years.  If circumstances permit, the top <Col N="702" /> rate will drop further to 40 per cent.  In addition, personal allowances will be increased and the standard rate band will be widened over the five year period of the programme to ensure that 80 per cent of taxpayers do not pay tax at the higher rate.</P>
    <P>The budget proposals contained in the Finance Bill are a significant first step in giving effect to that programme.  It has been said by Opposition Deputies that this budget inappropriately focused on cutting rates rather than bands or allowances, and ultimately favoured the rich.  As I have already said in my reply on Second Stage, the 2 per cent in both the top and standard rate of tax cannot be characterised as a sop to the rich.  Single people on £14,000 per annum are on the top rate.  Married couples earning £27,000 and over are also on the top rate.  These people are not rich by any stretch of the imagination.  There is a genuine wish on all sides to seek a greater equity in the tax system and to ensure that all taxpayers pay a fair amount of tax based on their level of income.</P>
    <P>Tax policy is a matter for political choice.  The people ultimately decide through the ballot box how they will be taxed.  The Government has a mandate for tax proposals in the budget which it received from the electorate in June l997.  I can hardly be faulted for implementing what was promised in the election and for which the people voted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte made reference to CORI, the Conference of Religious of Ireland.  In reply to a recent Dáil question and again on Committee Stage, I quoted the comments of CORI on the budgets of 1995, 1996 and 1997 brought in by the Government of which Deputy Rabbitte was a member.  That did not receive much publicity but in the past few weeks a well known columnist who writes a weekly article for one of the national newspapers quoted CORI's view of the budgets of l995, l996 and l997.  Remarkably, the phraseology used by that columnist was more or less the same as that used about my l998 budget.</P>
    <P>Deputies, and particularly Deputy Rabbitte, were anxious to quote CORI when speaking about my budget, so it is a fair political point to quote CORI on the budgets of l995, l996 and l997.  It is the job of CORI or any other pressure group to make worthwhile suggestions about the taxation system, but it is obvious that the only time we will hear favourable comment from CORI is when a Government brings in a budget which includes its suggestions.</P>
    <P>I enjoyed Committee Stage of the Finance Bill not only this year but in previous years also.  For as long as I have been in this House I have contributed to Committee Stages of Finance Bills, whether in Government or Opposition or on the front or back benches, and have given my views on tax rates versus bands and allowances.  My argument in that regard relates to the intellectual dishonesty of some people participating in this debate.  Over a period of years they gave the impression to many people that there is only one <Col N="703" /> way of reducing taxation and that is by concentrating solely on allowances and bands.  There is not only one way and I object to the people who have succeeded in getting across that message.</P>
    <P>Four or five years ago that issue was not a major part of the debate.  This is a recent Irish argument and the opinion makers, if one wants to use that term, have come around to this particular view.  Many of them are simply following what other people say but this was not the consensus a number of years ago and it was not the imposed dogma.  All my life I objected to accepting dogma from anyone, particularly in my own party, and my record as a politician will bear that out.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dispute with Deputy Rabbitte, who may have a different intellectual viewpoint in this regard, or Deputy McDowell, who may have been one of the opinion makers who said there is only one way to reduce taxation, but the majority of people in this House do not agree with that view.  They are going along with it now because it is the political &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; to do and they will not attract unfavourable headlines and commentary if they do so.  I do not agree that the only way to reduce taxation is through bands and allowances.  It will have to be done through a combination of bands, allowances and rates.  I believe Deputy Coveney, who is not his party's spokesperson on finance, is of the same view.  It is not necessarily the view put forward by his party on this occasion but it was his party's view for many years.  That is no longer the position because everybody has fallen into this cosy consensus. It is incumbent on me to reduce taxation through a combination of allowances, bands and rates.</P>
    <P>As a Member of this House for the past 21 years I have seen at least 21 budgets as well as a number of mini-budgets and I know that a piecemeal approach to a particular problem does not solve anything.  Over the five year lifetime of this Government we will significantly reduce taxation by concentrating on all of those areas.</P>
    <P>High nominal tax rates are a clear disincentive to work and enterprise, to the people both at the lower and upper ends of the income scale and to employers.  High tax rates are a disincentive in all forms of activity, be they in the income or capital taxes spheres.  People may describe this as an ideological position but I believe it is better to give people incentives at all levels of the scale because that is where the greater good will be achieved.  Deputy McDowell said either on Second or Committee Stage that that may have been the position of the left in the 1960s and early 1970s but that the left has changed its position over the years.  I am glad that is the case but there is a lingering doubt in that regard among the left wing of Irish and European politics.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell gives me credit on occasion for predicting in the late l970s, before I became a Member of this House, that there would be 300,000 people unemployed in a certain number of years, which turned out to be correct. <Col N="704" /> In regard to the consensus in Ireland that there is only one way of reducing taxation, which is copied from our European partners, I predict that in the next five years the consensus in Germany, France and other EU states will change.  There is evidence to suggest there is a move away from that opinion in Germany and other countries and we should ask why that is the case.  The answer is that this approach to the taxation system did not work.  It did not offer incentives to people or lead to a growth in the economy.  It has been a constraining factor.  Hopefully some of us will be here in a few years' time to discover who was right on this particular matter and see what the other European countries did in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is not a coincidence that on the two occasions in the past 25 years when Labour and Fine Gael were in Government, nominal tax rates were enormously high.  In the period 1973-7 the top rate of tax was as high as 77 per cent.  There were rates of 35, 45, 55, 65 and 70 per cent.  The Minister for Finance then introduced a 10 per cent surcharge so that the 35 per cent rate became 38.5 per cent and the 70 per cent rate became 77 per cent.  When that Government left power the top rate was 62 per cent, or perhaps higher.  In the period 1982-7 the top rate of tax was reduced from 62 per cent to 58 per cent.  In the period post-1987 the rate was reduced to 48 per cent. The Opposition certainly favours high tax rates.</P>
    <P>People whom I regard as having the utmost common sense who wrote about this matter went off on a tangent about rates and bands while saying nothing about the nominal rates.  Some people put forward the view that nominal rates should have been maintained as high as possible, with the ultimate logic that the best rate would be 99 per cent.  That is what people advocate who do not speak about the nominal rates of tax.  Taxation should be reduced by a combination of bands, allowances and tax rates.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to what the social partners understood to be the Partnership 2000 arrangements.  He said it was put to them that we would proceed in one way only.  As I said on a radio programme, that was never the understanding. The Deputy is referring to option P, an illustrative document outlining for trade unions the possible position.  The leader of Deputy Rabbitte's party, then Minister for Social Welfare, said that the Government's hands would be tied in that regard.  Immediately after the option P document issued to trade unions, the document was incorporated in an illustrative package which one of the largest trade unions sent to its members.  The general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions issued a letter, which is available, stating that no commitment was given that we would proceed in a certain way.  In discourse with one of the leading trade unions in a radio studio shortly after the budget, that point was not contradicted, nor has it been referred to since.</P>
    <P>Like many commentators, Deputy Creed, when referring to my comments on Committee Stage, <Col N="705" /> gave the impression that the Minister is on the side of the rich.  As a result of the budget, the after tax position will be as follows.  In the case of a single person, the gains range from more than 2.5 per cent to almost 4 per cent.  For married couples the gains range from 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent, and up to 5.5 per cent in some cases.  In the case of a single person on £14,000 per year, the average tax take has been reduced from 28.2 per cent in the tax year 1996-7 to 22.4 per cent in 1998-9.  In the case of a married couple on the same level of income, the average tax take has been reduced from 21.3 per cent in 1996-7 to 16.9 per cent in 1998-9.  The 2 per cent reduction in both income tax rates will reduce the marginal tax rate of one million taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The increase in take home pay for most workers after the Partnership 2000 increases will be in the order of 4.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent, with increases close to 7 per cent in the case of some married couples.  Many workers on lower pay &mdash; for example, most single workers on incomes less than £13,000 per annum &mdash; will get more from this year's budget than they got from the 1997 budget.  In this budget I did more to change the rules about tax shelters than was done by any Minister in a long time &mdash; I cannot remember when a Minister brought in such significant changes relating to tax shelters.  That will widen the taxation base and ensure everybody pays a fair level of taxation.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy McDowell referred to minimum taxation.  That question was raised with me when in Opposition.  Interesting studies have been carried out in this regard and I am convinced the abolition of tax shelters would be more effective.  If we set a minimum tax rate for high income earners we would be encouraging them to reduce their tax to that figure to avail of the shelter.  A study carried out by the Revenue Commissioners of people with incomes in excess of £250,000 showed that a relatively high proportion of those earners pay tax at more than the average rate.  If a minimum rate was introduced, there would be a danger that people would aspire to that rate.  That is, however, a point that may be considered at a future date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed made political charges about my comments on Committee Stage regarding credit unions.  I did not make those remarks.  In fairness, the Deputy said that the statement was made in a jocular fashion.  From my experience of the credit union movement, my advice to future Ministers for Finance would be to beware of credit unions &mdash; I will leave that caption over the door.  It is advice which I will take to heart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in that option P is not explicitly written into the Partnership 2000 agreement.  Some people felt they could not bind future Ministers for Finance to specific proposals of the kind we have been talking about. I think I am right in saying &mdash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that options A to O include a variety of possibilities, all of which <Col N="706" /> involve changing bands and allowances in a particular way.  It is some time since I had the opportunity to read through those options but I am not clear the option the Minister took was discussed with the social partners as a serious possibility.  I would be surprised if it was discussed with them. Therefore, while it is not down in black and white and it is not explicitly part of the agreement, there is no doubt that the social partners, and in particular the trades unions, were under the impression that the major thrust of income tax reduction would be done in the way we have been arguing on this side of the House.  The reason they wanted assurances to that effect was that they wanted to be able to go to their members on low and medium incomes and say that they would receive benefits of this kind or that from likely budgetary changes in future years, and it is only right and fair that they should have been given information to that effect.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes the point that the left in previous years was in favour of very high marginal rates of taxation and he suggested the logic was that we should want 99 per cent taxation at one point.  I take it that was intended as a debating point.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, it is fair to say that the left now would speak about income tax less in terms of redistribution and more in terms of the incentive to work.  If the Minister has been listening to my argument and that of Deputy Rabbitte, he will have heard the argument about the incentive to work.  The imperative must be to remove the unemployment traps and the poverty traps.  This is all geared at the incentive to work because we accept that the best way in which one can redistribute wealth and opportunity is by giving people jobs and the wherewithal to earn more money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to colleagues who have tabled amendments on other matters, a Cheann Comhairle, take these as my concluding remarks.</P>
      <P>In terms of job satisfaction, I enjoy the Minister because he is one of the few ideological politicians left in the House and I respect his view.  I think he is wrong, but I respect his view.  He argues a very clear ideological position and he goes on to justify it with his memories of bogeymen of the left of the past when he was at university, etc.  The world has changed.  There is no point throwing up the 77 per cent top rate of income tax in the present debate.  We can all go back and state who was responsible for a 77 per cent rate having to be introduced in the first place, but it would take us nowhere.  When he refers to it being fashionable now to concentrate on personal tax allowances and the widening of the bands, does it ever occur to the Minister that that fashion has come into existence because we are no longer dealing with the astronomical high rates of tax of 20 years ago to which he referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to make the point himself when he predicted that the situation in Europe will turn around in the next five years. <Col N="707" /> Ireland's rates of tax are not out of line with those in almost any European country other than Britain, if that is a European country at present &mdash; I imagine it will become one soon.  In fact, some of our tax rates are better than those which are operable in other European countries, but the problem is that it bites too soon.  One reaches the marginal rate of tax in Ireland at an absurdly low level of income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Minister does not accept that because if he did he would accept the thrust of the argument from these benches, which is that the top rate of tax should not bite so early and that a person ought to be able to retain more of their income at the 24 per cent or 26 per cent rate before he or she becomes liable to the 46 per cent or 48 per cent rate.  That is the net point.  We are not comparing like with like.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House do not need the brilliant minds which are available to the Minister in the bull pen to be able to work out average figures which show that the typical worker benefits by 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent.  One can prove anything with such statistics but it does not change the equity argument, which is that there were two things which we were trying to do: one, encourage people to come off welfare and take up work; and, two, ensure a person would enjoy the standard rate of tax until he or she was on a decent level of income.  Essentially, those were the two points.  There is no manipulation of figures or presentation of averages.  We have all been down that road and nobody knows it better than the Minister.  He knows well that one can do a great deal with figures and make them look one way or another.  Deputy Creed can state that there are 1.2 per cent more people now paying tax at the marginal rate than there were before the Minister started, but that gets us nowhere.</P>
      <P>We did not really expect the Minister to do a <i>volte face.</i>  I do not know whether his tenure of office will be longer or shorter as a result of the by-elections.  Today his Cabinet colleagues say that we will all be ruined before the year is out if they lose these two by-elections.  In the past few days stability has become the issue and in the aftermath we will see how badly Government stability is affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue we were probing was whether he gave any credence to this argument in terms of forthcoming budgets and Finance Bills. From what the Minister has said about nominal rates of 20 per cent and 40 per cent, we are going to get more of the same.  We will, as Deputy Coveney stated, be able to sell that because we <Col N="708" /> believe it strikes a chord and is more resonant with the people.  Rates of 20 and 40 per cent look neat and good as distinct from people's take home pay.  I have more confidence than that in the people, notwithstanding the result of the general election.  I believe they can figure out their take home pay and what is equitable, because at the end of the day there are public services to be run and public servants doing essential jobs to be paid.</P>
      <P>I do not know anybody inside or outside this House who believes in a 77 per cent marginal rate of tax or who would go along with the Minister's argument that because we are saying he should focus the relief on middle income earners means 77 per cent is a tremendous argument.  What kind of logic is that?  As the Minister well knows, one of the reasons nobody with a tither of intelligence would believe that is that no super earner nominally liable at 77 per cent would pay 77 per cent. There have been a plethora of shelters in existence. If such a person had expert tax advice, he or she could avoid that.  It is to delude oneself to think that because there is a punitive marginal level of tax, super high earners will be caught and we can all feel they are making their proportionate contribution to running this economy.  That is not the case.</P>
      <P>The Minister is unfairly ascribing to people on this side of the House an argument or affliction of some years gone by which was produced originally in terms of the 1977 package which, if I am correct, probably brought the Minister into the House.</P>

      <P>4.  Section 46(7) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after &lsquo;spouse&rsquo; in both places where it occurs of &lsquo;or other relative prescribed in that behalf by regulations made by the Minister&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was not discussed on Committee Stage because we ran out of time.  The Minister will be aware of the genesis of the amendment and those in the names of Deputies Rabbitte and Coveney.</P>
      <P>The Carers' Association met with the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, in advance of the budget and its representatives were given reason to believe that a number of uncostly amendments would be included in it.  The Minister for Finance included one of those proposals in his budgetary statement on 3 December, namely, the calculation of FIS on the basis of net earnings. However, it must be stated that this commitment is contained in the Partnership 2000 agreement. The Carers' Association argued that a similar application should be made in respect of carer's allowance and that it should be assessed on the basis of net rather than gross pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the main debate, one part of those proposals relates to the Finance Bill, namely, the allowance paid to people employed to care for an incapacitated person.  At present, that relief is confined to care for oneself or expenditure incurred in employing someone to care for oneself or one's spouse.  I understand that a persuasive argument has been made by the Carers' Association and others that this relief should be extended to include costs incurred in employing <Col N="710" /> someone to care for parents, siblings or children. The amendment tabled in my name would allow the Minister to prescribe the relatives to whom this relief could be extended.  The amendments tabled by my colleagues are clearer and more prescriptive in stating exactly to which relatives the provision should relate.</P>
    <P>The case in favour of accepting the amendment is persuasive.  On Committee Stage, we had lengthy discussions and anecdotal conversations about people we met in Limerick and North Dublin. Everyone knows people with incapacitated children who have incurred considerable costs, either in employing someone to care for those children or in caring for them themselves. Amendment No. 6 proposes the provision of a relatively modest assistance to those people in respect of part of the costs incurred in caring for children.  The same argument applies equally to parents.  Everyone is familiar with people who care for elderly parents and whose social lives are severely restricted by having to spend a great deal of time caring for their loved ones.</P>
    <P>The amendment suggests the provision of a modest relief which would give people some recognition and assistance.  It would also provide employment and save money for the State in so far as some of the incapacitated people to whom I refer would otherwise have to be cared for in day care or residential care.  This would cost the State a great deal of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy McDowell's amendment.  On reflection it provides a better way of dealing with this matter than that suggested in amendment No. 11 tabled in my name. As Deputy McDowell stated, amendment No. 11 is more prescriptive and it defines the relative as &ldquo;a parent, sibling or child&rdquo;.  At present, tax relief is confined to care of oneself or one's spouse.  My amendment seeks to extend that in respect of the specific relationships to which it refers.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 ought to recommend itself to the Minister because it gives him the authority and discretion to decide by way of regulation what extension of the relief he believes fair and justifiable and which could be managed in a given year.  One would not survive in this business without a shell of cynicism but it is difficult to be cynical when one encounters people seeking to care for a relative or a member of their family who is incapacitated.  That is extremely onerous and it often falls to women to bear the burden.  The State gives minimal recognition in this regard, notwithstanding the fact that the alternative would be immensely costly to the State and the taxpayer.  On Committee Stage we discussed tax incentives to improve the infrastructure for nursing homes and acknowledged that the demographic portents for the future are such that we have made inadequate provision for that situation. Having regard to the alternative, amendment No. 6 would provide a fair, equitable and less costly way of dealing with this matter.</P>

    <P>I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to <Col N="711" /> say in respect of the calculations.  The amendments tabled by Deputy Coveney and I specify the categories of families to whom we would extend the tax relief.  Amendment No. 11 states that section 467 shall apply to a parent, sibling or child of an incapacitated individual.  Deputy McDowell's amendment leaves the Minister with the discretion of deciding to whom he would immediately choose to extend the tax relief.  I plead with the Minister to acknowledge the hurt in the community at a time when the economy is doing well. It is usually the mother in a family who bears the enormous burden of additional care imposed on her and there is no recognition of it other than the tax relief confined to care of oneself or one's spouse.  For example, mental handicap is not provided for sufficiently.</P>
    <P>Of what is the Minister fearful in accepting Deputy McDowell's amendment?  It puts him in charge because it provides that he will make the regulations as appropriate.  If they had to be dictated by available finance so be it but it gives the Minister of the day the discretion to make an important reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Three parties have come with a similar proposal without consultation.  Deputy McDowell's amendment would give discretion to the Minister and while I would not be unhappy with that, I would prefer to be more specific.  The Minister proposes to increase by £1,000 the income tax allowance in respect of the cost of employing a person to take care of an incapacitated spouse.  We propose to extend the relief to cover the taxpayer or his or her spouse's parents, brothers and sisters or children.  The present scheme is restrictive and the take up of it is relatively small.  I urge the Minister to take on board Deputy Rabbitte's or my amendment, although I see merit Deputy McDowell's amendment.  His amendment would commend itself to the Minister given that he would have more control if he were to adopt it.  However, the three amendments seek a significant extension of the present scheme and I hope the Minister will recognise the unanimity on the principle.</P>

      <P>These amendments propose that the allowance granted to an incapacitated person or to the spouse of an incapacitated person in respect of a person employed to take care of the incapacitated person be extended so as to be available to the incapacitated person's parents, siblings or children.  I have sympathy with the amendments and there is a commitment in the Government's programme to provide tax relief for those caring for the elderly and the incapacitated in the home.  Arising out of this commitment, I announced in my budget speech that I have set up an interdepartmental working group to examine for the next budget the question of tax reliefs for those caring for family members in the home.  I want to come up with a targeted relief <Col N="712" /> at a reasonable cost which will complement health and social policy measures in this area.  An amount of groundwork needs to be done before it can be decided what form of tax allowance for carers might be most appropriate.</P>
      <P>The current tax system has a number of personal income tax allowances which are related to the care of incapacitated or dependent individuals. These are the dependent relative allowance, medical expense relief, covenant relief and the carer's allowance under section 467.</P>
      <P>These provisions are varied and have developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> way at various times in order to meet different needs.  I want to examine fully these reliefs and their interaction and I hope to bring forward proposals relating to the question of care in the community for the next budget.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked the cost of the proposals put forward by Deputies.  It is difficult to cost these proposals and we can only do so on a tentative basis.  It is assumed that the proposal would permit some taxpayers currently claiming the smaller dependent relative allowance of £110 to opt for the incapacitated taxpayer allowance of £8,500.  Information from the Revenue files indicates that the number claiming the incapacitated taxpayer allowance is about 400 while the number claiming the dependent relative allowance is about 24,000.  If we assume that half the taxpayers already claiming the dependent relative allowance would be entitled to claim the incapacitated taxpayer allowance, the additional cost associated with the proposal is estimated to be £33.5 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The dependent relative allowance is a small relief which 24,000 people claim.  There is a good reason why some people should claim it which relates to claiming of medical expenses related to the person for whom the allowance is claimed.  Only 400 people opt for the incapacitated taxpayer allowance, which is £8,500 to be claimed against taxable income.  The purpose of the amendments is to extend this allowance to the siblings or children.  At present the allowance is given to the incapacitated taxpayer who pays a person to look after them.  The £33.5 million cost is calculated on the basis that half of the 24,000 claiming the dependent relative allowance will claim the incapacitated taxpayer allowance of £8,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the lead up to the great events of June 1997, a commitment was given in the Fianna Fáil policy document on taxation changes to give a tax free allowance at the standard rate to carers, women at home and people paying childminders.  In the 1998 budget I was not in a position to go ahead with this relief because I concentrated the tax changes on matters discussed many times in House.  However, I set up an interdepartmental working group to examine this proposal before the next budget.  I am convinced of the need for a change in this regard from my experience as a <Col N="713" /> Deputy and my time as Minister for Social Welfare. When the social welfare carer's allowance was introduced it was subject to a means test for Exchequer purposes and very few people qualified. Over the years the rules have been relaxed and more people qualify.  However, the number remains a very small percentage of the total number of carers, while an even smaller number again receive the full carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies that something needs to be done.  Many people care for incapacitated people in their own homes, without any contribution from the State, and the Exchequer would not be able to provide the cost of care in hospitals or homes.  Their contribution in society must be recognised and that is why I put forward the idea of a tax relief on the carer's allowance in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and carried it over in the programme for Government, but due to budgetary constraints I was not able to do so this year.  However, it is under examination for the next budget.</P>
    <P>It is possible to get over the non-availability of the carer's relief through taxation planning.  One covenants an amount of money to the incapacitated person which will allow the donor to obtain tax relief and the recipient to claim back tax.  I accept many taxpayers will not bother going down that road for one reason or another. However, it is a mechanism to get over the problem alluded to in the amendments.  It will be examined prior to next year's Finance Bill in conjunction with the other matters relating to the interdepartmental working group which hopefully will bring forward proposals to meet the concerns expressed by Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the specific amendment that would put him in a position to make regulations when he is ready to address the problem?  He did not deal with that in his reply.  Deputy Coveney's amendment and mine specify categories.  I am surprised the sum of money per annum is as low as the Minister suggested.  It is apparent no work has been done in terms of the other costs incurred as a result of our doing nothing.  This is a factor aside from the question of compassion and it ought to be taken into account.  It is not as punitive as I thought but it does address why the Minister will not take on the power to make regulation, if and when he is ready to make a concession in this direction.  It is difficult to explain to people in grave personal circumstances when the economy is doing well why some relief or assistance is not available to them in terms of bearing a family burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the reason given by the Minister as to why he did not act on this in the budget.  He said it was because of financial constraints and choices he had to make in terms of reducing taxes.  I am surprised he should put it so boldly.  It is extraordinary that he could not find the £20 million or £30 million necessary to make the proposed changes in the context of a <Col N="714" /> current budget surplus in excess of £1 billion and reductions in income tax of over £500 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister condemns himself out of his own mouth when he says this because he will then turn to us indignantly when we accuse of him of favouring the better off and claim with injured innocence that he is doing nothing of the kind.  He said he made choices and this is the wrong one. Even if he wanted to stick to his income tax reduction programme and spend more money &mdash; his spending targets daft, as they were, were shot long since despite all the creative accounting last October &mdash; it would not have damaged his budgetary targets excessively to have found the £20 million or £30 million to go down the route that has been suggested.</P>
      <P>I take his point that this is a complex area and that the dependant relative allowance and covenanting are other ways to deal with this.  However, those measures would be a good deal less generous to the people involved than the proposal that has been made, for which I do not claim credit as it came from the Carers' Association.  I tabled my amendment not because I believe giving the Minister power to make regulations is the way to go but because I thought it offered a better prospect of appealing to him by allowing him to take on the power whenever he would so choose and also give him a control over the costs that might be incurred in implementing it.  I hope in that context the Minister will consider it more favourably.</P>

      <P>The people involved are in need of greater support.  The present scheme is very restrictive and it is self-evident that the take up on it is small.  There is a strong desire among the public for the Government of the day to tackle this issue.  In that context I defer to Deputy McDowell's amendment because it is a more attractive option for the Minister as it would give him time to introduce it on a more gradual basis. Will the Minister accept Deputy McDowell's approach which is less specific than mine but is the same in principle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in recognition of the problem that exists that I made a commitment in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and the programme for Government in this regard.  Time spent in Opposition gives one time to reflect and come up with new ideas and one of ours was that a tax allowance would be provided in this area. We were so convinced it was included as part of the election campaign and it will be honoured during the lifetime of the Government.  I did not want to take a piecemeal approach similar to Deputy McDowell's and am not prepared to follow that route.  I announced in the budget speech that I would set up an interdepartmental group to come up with a targeted and focused way of providing relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not generally favour giving power to the Minister for Finance to make regulations on taxation matters but I take the Deputy's point in this <Col N="715" /> regard.  I do not mind giving powers to the Revenue Commissioners even though certain powers are given to me in the Finance Bill and the previous Minister gained some also.  I do not want to take on powers to prescribe what category of carer will get this relief because I will then be dealing with the matter in a piecemeal fashion. The interdepartmental group will produce a report and I will act on that.  The commitment in the programme for Government is to move in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell stated this was a case of my targeting the rich rather than the poor.  That is far from the reality.  I put forward the idea of a carer's relief in Fianna Fáil's election proposals and I will do something about it.  The other parties did not make such a proposal, but everyone now wants to make political capital of the issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell is wrong to suggest that extending the carer's allowance would benefit the less well off in society.  They are entitled to the carer's social welfare allowance.  This is a tax relief that would benefit only those who are paid substantial amounts of income.  The real benefits would accrue to those paying the top rate of tax. The Deputy's proposal does not stand up to logical scrutiny.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;5.  &mdash;For the purpose of income tax assessment, married persons shall mean-(a) a man and woman who are married to each other, or</P>
      <P>(b) a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabiting as man and wife.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We did not have an opportunity to hear the Minister's views on this amendment on Committee Stage.  Its purpose is to provide for a situation where cohabiting couples would be regarded, for the purposes of income tax assessment, as married. Deputy Michael Higgins remarked to me that he has heard it said that cohabiting is more stressful than marriage &mdash; a compelling reason to support the amendment.  I am willing to take that advice.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment I have tabled during the years.  I remember being advised by one of the Minister's predecessors that it would have to await the enactment of divorce legislation.  The social welfare and income tax codes treat this phenomenon in society differently.  Under the social welfare code where the State gives money away it regards cohabiting couples as married whereas in the collection of tax it regards them as single.  That is an anomaly.  We have had the divorce referendum and the legislation has been passed.  There is still extensive evidence of the phenomenon of cohabiting couples.  It was predicted that the divorce legislation would mark the end of civilisation as we know it but it has not turned out that way.  It is an inequity and unjust to those who find themselves in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear why the Minister was not ready to deal with this phenomenon in the Bill. It is difficult to understand how he can treat it differently under different codes.  Having regard to the fact that the divorce option is now part of the law, it is especially compelling that we dispose of and tidy up this anomaly.</P>

I expect there would be anomalies if the exact wording of the amendment is accepted where somebody married to a third party and living with somebody else could, theoretically, claim allowances on two levels.  This would create a difficulty.  The sentiment behind the amendment is clear.  I am sure the Minister appreciates where Deputy Rabbitte and I are coming from.  In the 1990s there are many forms <Col N="720" /> of family set-up.  We do not need to reflect on them from a moral point of view to accept people are making choices they might not have made a generation ago.  It is only fair that those legitimate choices should be reflected in a fair way in the tax code.</P>

      <P>This matter was the subject of a brief debate on Committee Stage when I declared a personal conflict of interest in the matter in that I am one half of a cohabiting couple. Changes in taxation law, therefore, would affect me directly.  Because of this I indicated that I would prefer to await the proposals of the inter-departmental group which is considering the matter. It would not be fair to allow my personal circumstances to influence taxation law.  If I was not so constrained, I might, possibly, have given the amendment some further thought.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes to treat cohabiting couples in the same way as a married couple for income tax purposes.  In support of the proposal, emphasis is often laid on the fact that cohabiting couples are treated the same as married couples for social welfare purposes.  What needs to be remembered in this argument is that the social welfare provision is designed to prevent cohabiting couples from getting better treatment than married couples.  Deputy Rabbitte may be aware that a similar provision also exists in the tax code whereby a cohabitee is debarred from the single parent allowance or the special bereavement allowance for widowed parents. These provisions arise from the cases of Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General and Hyland <i>v.</i> the Minister for Social Welfare where it was held that, in so far as families based on marriage may be comparable with other groups of society, the taxation laws should not place such families at a relative disadvantage because to do so would amount to a failure in relation to the constitutional requirement to protect the family and guard the institution of marriage.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, granting relief to cohabiting couples is a different matter and raises a number of legal and administrative issues which need to be addressed before a decision to grant relief in this area could be made.  I presume it would be common ground that relief should be confined to those instances where there is a genuine stable relationship.  There are definitional difficulties in this area.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General has been asked for his advice on this matter on a number of occasions and his most recent advice is that married treatment for tax purposes could be extended to cohabiting couples or a subgroup of cohabiting couples, for example, those with children, without necessarily offending articles in the Constitution dealing with the family and marriage.  However, care would have to be taken in defining cohabiting couples qualifying for relief so as to avoid introducing invidious discrimination as between one category of cohabiting couples and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> The Deputy is no doubt aware that the matter was considered by the Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems, known as the TWIG group.  While there was no general consensus within the group on the matter, it did recommend that consideration should be given to allowing married tax treatment to cohabiting couples with children.  However, the group also recognised there was a range of issues which would have to be addressed before any action could be taken in the matter.</P>
    <P>At present an interdepartmental working group, set up by the previous Administration, is examining the whole area of the tax and social welfare treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent households.  As part of its terms of reference the group has to take account of previous reports on the issue such as the TWIG report and the final report of the Commission on the Family.  The group is due to report to Government within the next few months.  Pending receipt and consideration by the Government of that report, I cannot at this stage accept Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Ahern asked a question about the treatment of cohabiting couples for capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax purposes.  I presume if we were to extend the definition, as suggested by Deputy Rabbitte, a similar amendment would be required for the purposes of the capital gains tax code and capital acquisitions tax code.  The present position is that if a husband disposes of an asset to his wife or <i>vice versa</i> no liability to capital gains tax arises, but in similar circumstances a cohabiting couple would be fully liable for capital gains tax.  There is an exemption under the capital acquisitions tax code in regard to the total value of assets transferred between spouses.  That is in place because of an amendment introduced by Deputy Dukes when Minister for Finance to, I believe, the 1986 Finance Act. Prior to that, depending on the value of the gift or inheritance transferred, liability to capital acquisitions tax may have arisen, but it no longer arises because of the introduction of Deputy Dukes's worthwhile amendment.  In the case of cohabiting couples full liability arises on the transfer of assets.  From my personal experience I know that gives rise to considerable distress between cohabiting couples who have long-standing relationships and children from those relationships.  This is something that will have to be addressed in changes that will be brought forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte will know from my comments on Committee Stage that during my time as Minister for Finance I would like to address this problem. From what Deputy Rabbitte said about the introduction of divorce and the figures available to date, it is clear that many people who have been in relationships have not availed of divorce. According to the Central Statistics Office there are approximately 34,000 cohabiting couples and about half of them have children.  We were told by others that introducing divorce would open <Col N="722" /> the moral floodgates.  When I was sitting where Deputy Coveney is and Deputy Noonan was Minister for Health, I remarked during the debate on the abortion information referendum that people always say the moral floodgates are about to open.  In the l970s it was said the moral floodgates would open with the change in the law on contraception, it was also said they would open with the introduction of legislation on abortion information and with the introduction of divorce, but we are always a little away from them opening on us.  They have never opened.  It does not surprise me that the number of those applying for divorce is nothing like the figures expounded by the anti-divorce lobby.  I am sure it had good reasons for using those figures, but there are many reasons people in long-standing relationships do not want to open what might be a Pandora's box in regard to matters that were settled some years ago.  We should have a debate on that matter on another occasion.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult area on which to legislate. Deputy Rabbitte has tried to introduce changes in this regard over many years.  I hope we can come up with a solution in the near future, but at present I am awaiting the group's final report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the Minister's reflections on divorce with which I agree. Since we on this side of the House are all moral reprobates, perhaps he should address some of his remarks to those behind him.  I accept the Minister's bona fides on this matter.  It has been an issue for some decades and I accept his bona fides when he says he wants to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I despair of all the interdepartmental groups dealing with such matters.  I accept the Minister has not used that excuse as a shield, but nonetheless he has expressed his view.  Will he indicate whether the interdepartmental group has met recently and when he expects to get its report so that we can ascertain if there is any reasonable prospect of progress on this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his remarks.  With the ultimate respect to the Minister, they do not advance this matter one whit from the time I tabled this amendment.  He has retraced the law that has given rise to this anomalous position.  The figure of 34,000 cohabiting couples is a large number, but there is no relief for them in sight.  One hears the argument that it is extremely difficult and complex to deal with this matter legally and the advice of successive Attorneys General is such and such, but it is extraordinary that matters can be dealt with when they have to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe any Member would suggest that the Minister's personal position would prevent him from dealing with this matter without allegation of conflict arising.  That is an outdated argument and no Member would view it as such if the Minister were to put his mind to addressing this matter.  I ask him to do that before we enact another Finance Bill.  How is it so difficult <Col N="723" /> to deal with this matter in terms of the income tax code when we can deal with it under the social welfare code and have done so for a long time?</P>

      <P>I put through a Bill that presents a way for the Minister to regularise the tax code. The argument up to that stage was that it could not be addressed until divorce legislation was enacted, although not with a great deal of assistance from Deputy Michael Ahern's party.  Now that divorce legislation has been enacted and is the law of the land, the way is clear to deal with this matter in the income tax code.</P>
      <P>The Minister confessed he has not turned his mind to this matter yet.  It is clear it will not be addressed in time for this Bill, but I ask him, if he is still Minister for Finance, to ensure this matter is dealt with before the introduction of another Finance Bill.  This matter is anomalous and punitive on a significant number of our citizens who are wage earners and entitled to tax relief when they are in stable relationships.</P>

      <P>I thank the Fine Gael Party for facilitating this debate.  It is unusual, indeed it may even be unprecedented, for one political party to provide Private Members' time to another.  We, in Democratic Left, acknowledge this act of generosity.  It is the kind of generosity that is badly needed in regard to the treatment of refugees in Ireland.  Such generosity is sorely lacking in this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.  I also thank the Labour Party for their co-operation and support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This evening we are debating the issue of asylum seekers in the run-up to our national holiday. This is the time of year when Ministers fly out to attend St. Patrick's Day celebrations in Canada, <Col N="724" /> the United States, Australia, South Africa and across the globe.  As a Government spokesperson explained last week: it is our national day throughout the world and it has huge value in promoting this country.  It puts Ireland into focus for inward investment and as a tourism destination.</P>
    <P>St. Patrick's Day as a marketing tool, this is today's pragmatism.  It fits well with our view of ourselves as a modern State and a capable, prosperous and outward looking people.  Conveniently, we choose to ignore a salient fact.  For this global celebration of Irishness, this focus for investment, this tourism opportunity, we have to thank the generations of Irish asylum-seekers who were driven out to seek refuge among strangers. They were often poor, hungry, sick and homeless people.  Sometimes they died in flight, sometimes they were political outcasts and convicted criminals.  They were the kind of undesirables that the Ireland of IDA promotions likes to disavow.  I refuse to accept that our past has no bearing on this debate.  Our history requires us to be generous and just.  This Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's approach to asylum-seekers has been hopelessly inadequate on both counts.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the facts as opposed to the modern myths that are prevalent and which have fuelled fear and friction.  Ninety per cent of all refugees do not move outside of the developing world.  Only a small percentage of the total number come to Europe and only a tiny fraction of those make it as far as Ireland.  In 1996 and 1997, Ireland came fifth from the bottom of the league among the EU countries in regard to asylum applications.  The myth of Ireland being swamped by refugees is just that, a myth.  However, it is one which has engendered revulsion and hatred and one which has been used in inflammatory terms by at least one Fianna Fáil Member of this House.</P>
    <P>I calculate that 4,548 people sought asylum from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform up to January 1 last.  Some of those asylum seekers may even have left Ireland since applying for asylum.  To put this figure into context, let us compare it to the scale of Irish emigration. It is estimated that, at present, 7O million people throughout the world can claim Irish descent.  There are so many people of Irish descent that former President Mary Robinson paid great attention to the many Irish abroad, both living and dead, during her term of office. On 2 January 1995, in her address to this House, she described her visit to Grosse Ile in Canada:</P>
    <P>I arrived in heavy rain and as I looked at the mounds which, together with small white crosses, are all that mark the mass graves of the 5,000 or more Irish people who died there, I was struck by the sheer power of commemoration. I was also aware that, even across time and distance, tragedy must be seen as human and not historic and that to think of it in national terms alone can obscure that fact.  As I stood looking at Irish graves I was also listening <Col N="725" /> to the story of the French-Canadian families who braved fever and shared their food, who took the Irish into their homes and into their heritage.</P>
    <P>There are more Irish emigrants buried in that little plot of land in eastern Canada than there are asylum seekers in the whole of Ireland today. We need to ask ourselves what stories the descendants of the displaced Africans and Eastern Europeans will be able to tell?  What will the record show about the children, women and men who, in desperation, sought refuge in Ireland? Will it be one of the kindness and acceptance of Irish people or will their story be one of rejection and of unjust deportation by the State?  The vast majority of these asylum-seekers have escaped persecution and repression.  They have come here not out of choice but out of necessity and they do not view Ireland as a &ldquo;soft option&rdquo;.  In most cases, they view Ireland as their only option for survival.</P>
    <P>In 1994, the UNHCR described what it was like to be a refugee: &ldquo;Often everything that was familiar is lost &mdash; home, livelihood, school, friends, cultural traditions, language&rdquo;.  Can we even begin to imagine how we might survive in those circumstances and then imagine what it is like to be fleeing from repression and, at times, from torture? Concern has been expressed by Dr. Philip O'Connell of the Refugee Medical Centre in St. James Hospital, Dublin in this regard.  He recommended the setting up of a specialised torture treatment centre for Ireland's refugees.  His research found that almost half of the refugees in the study he carried out at St. James Hospital had suffered psychological and physical abuse.  The trauma caused by torture was particularly evident among those from African countries such as Algeria, Zaire, Angola and Nigeria.</P>
    <P>According to the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture in Britain, the form of torture favoured by Algerian security officials is the &ldquo;chiffon&rdquo;, a practice inherited from the country's colonial past.  The stomach is filled to bursting point with contaminated water and then kicked until the victim vomits.  Excruciatingly painful, it has the advantage of leaving few marks and can be repeated until the victim passes out. More than half of Algerian refugees seeking asylum in Britain, who were examined by the foundation, have suffered variations of &ldquo;chiffon&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Of the 43 men who were examined, five said they were raped and ten were abused by a torture known as &ldquo;sitting on a bottle&rdquo; in which objects are forcibly pushed through the anus.  A further eight described having their genitals put in a desk drawer which was then repeatedly slammed shut. Last month, the consultant physician who examined these men told a British parliamentary group that he had no doubt that &ldquo;the systematic torture of detainees is commonplace in Algeria&rdquo;.  He also reported on psychological torture.  Many of those examined said that hearing the screams of others being tortured was worse than being tortured themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> This is not the first time the situation of refugees has been debated in the House.  In the 1990s, Deputy Alan Shatter introduced a Private Members' Bill which was followed by the Refugee Bill introduced by the Fianna Fáil-Labour coalition.  This was followed by the Refugee Bill &mdash; now the 1996 Refugee Act &mdash; introduced by the rainbow Government.</P>
    <P>However, in 1998, the Refugee Act remains largely unimplemented.  The estimated 4,000 asylum seekers are to have their fate determined by ill-conceived and crude fast-track procedures. Although the number of asylum seekers is relatively small, this Government has abjectly failed to meet the challenge they present.  The official response has been, opportunistically, to use a court case taken on a separate matter as an excuse not to implement the Refugee Act in full.</P>
    <P>Through their representatives the Irish people introduced the Refugee Act in 1996, yet the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; his title belies what he has done &mdash; has refused to implement it fully.  The Minister has a responsibility to explain by what authority he is thwarting the wishes of the people as expressed through the democratically elected Members of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>The court case being taken by Paddy Cooney is a red herring.  It could be dealt with, without difficulty, either through readvertisement or a short Bill.  Indeed, the Taoiseach in the Dáil last week condemned the practice of Government Departments using an age bar on appointments. The Minister would have no difficulty living up to the Taoiseach's desires but he refuses to do so because it suits him not to do so.</P>
    <P>Let us recall the genesis of the Refugee Act. In 1994 the interdepartmental committee on non-Irish nationals, which was chaired by Mr. S. Magner of the Department of Justice, published its report.  The report called for &ldquo;a major change in the existing system whereby all applications are effectively screened by the Department of Justice. The motive behind this recommendation is the essential need to ensure that the public perception of the system is one which is not only fair but which is seen to be impartial&rdquo;.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>It is believed that a Government Department which has overall responsibility for immigration matters and policy will inspire confidence via the maxim that &ldquo;justice is seen to be done&rdquo;.  The tribunal will be both independent and specialised and will be solely and exclusively responsible for considering applications for refugee status and the making of recommendations on these applications.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Act implemented the recommendations of this Government report and was passed with all-party consensus and the support of the media and public opinion.  However, on 10 December 1997, the Minister introduced new procedures that fly in the face of the provisions of the Act.  They are an affront to the principles <Col N="727" /> of fairness and justice and are so regressive that they constitute a reversion to the situation which gave rise to the need for this Act in the first place.</P>
    <P>The procedures have been the subject of trenchant criticism from a range of widely respected organisations dealing with asylum seekers. Amnesty International stated:</P>
    <P>The new procedures for dealing with asylum applications as outlined in the letter from Diarmuid Cole assistant secretary of the Dept of Justice, Equality and Law Reform seem to make it apparent that the Department has taken the Act passed by the Oireachtas, selected from it those parts which suit departmental procedures and abandoned the rest.  The purpose of this action is to set up &ldquo;fast-track&rdquo; procedures for dealing with asylum applications which will be entirely under the control of departmental officials without any independent scrutiny of the decisions they make.  In the future those people who are deemed by the Department officials to have &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; applications will no longer be entitled to appeal these decisions to an independent Appeal Board as laid down in the Refugee Act.  These appeals will be decided on by &ldquo;a person of more senior rank&rdquo; or in other words by somebody who is almost certain to be another department official.  Such appeals are likely to be swiftly dealt with, under criteria which are unclear and in which there is no onus on the relevant officials to properly explain the procedures.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the procedures about adequate training and experience in the application of international refugee law, no mention of the need of refugees for adequate legal assistance and no guarantee that asylum seekers will get adequate access to interpreters.  There is little mention of the role of the Minister, even though the Minister in the past always had the important function of protecting those fleeing from persecution in other countries.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, the most vociferous support Amnesty International received when the question of &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; applications was debated in the Dáil was from none other than Deputy O'Donoghue, now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  On 19 October 1995 he said:</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will be aware that Amnesty International published a document setting out its objections to certain aspects of the Bill while generally welcoming it.  It states that the category of manifestly unfounded applications is open to potential serious abuse and grave injustices.  It also states that experience abroad has shown that the use of fast-track procedures save neither time nor money.  I totally agree with the observations and criticisms of Amnesty International in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> In 1995, while agreeing that fast-track procedures saved neither time nor money and that there was potential for serious abuse and grave injustices in December 1997, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, caved into Department officials without a whimper.  As a result of fear, he introduced a fast-track procedure which has inherent in it, using his own terminology, &ldquo;the potential for serious abuse and grave injustices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to return to the principle he espoused such a short time ago.  I ask him not to travel the road his civil servants have mapped out for him.  There is another way &mdash; a better and fairer way &mdash; which is in line with the sentiments the Minister expressed such a short time ago when he said: &ldquo;The status of refugees is an issue which should strike a chord with every man, woman and child here who has any grasp of Irish history, our history books being littered with the names and deeds of those driven from our country out of fear of persecution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What will the historians write about the Minister's tenure?  Will the record show that a few short years after Ireland was able to secure a preferential deal from the US Government for its illegal emigrants that Ireland deported asylum seekers into danger and even possible death?</P>
    <P>Those who advocate a hard line on immigration should remember that up to 30,000 people still emigrate each year from this country and seek work abroad.  As recently as the beginning of this decade, there were an estimated 130,000 illegal Irish emigrants in the United States. Imagine the economic and social difficulties that would have been created for this country if the US Government had adopted the same policy that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform now appears intent on following, that of forcible deportation.  What will the record show about how we chose to meet our international obligations?  Will it show that we sought generosity for our own from others while we operated crude, secretive, reactionary procedures against those who sought help from us?  Will it show that the effect of these measures was to keep the number of refugees for whom we had to take responsibility to the minimum while still complying with the letter of international conventions? Will it show that we were, in effect, hypocrites?</P>
    <P>Democratic Left proposes an alternative route. We do not pretend that the Asylum Seekers (Regularisation of Status) (No. 2) Bill is a panacea. The full implementation of the Refugee Act is clearly the best way to deal with asylum seekers fairly.  However, the Government has resolutely refused to implement the Act and, in the absence of a fair, independent and transparent system, steps must be taken to ensure that asylum seekers currently in Ireland are not consigned to an open-ended legal limbo.  That is the aim of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under its provisions, those who had arrived in the State prior to 1 January 1998 and who applied for asylum prior to that date will be allowed to remain in the State as &ldquo;admitted asylum seekers&rdquo;<Col N="729" /> and would be entitled to all the rights and privileges of a refugee, as defined in the 1996 Act.  Persons who would not have been entitled to apply for refugee status under the 1996 Act are excluded from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In drafting the Bill, we adhered as closely as possible to the terms and intention of the Refugee Act, which should form the basis of any refugee related measure.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if implemented, will provide the Government with a clean slate in facilitating full implementation of the Act.  It will also enable asylum seekers to integrate fully into the communities in which they live, and have lived, some of them for years.  Contrary to the mythology that has developed around this issue, the vast majority of asylum seekers do not want to be beholden to the State.  They want to work and contribute. Many of them possess qualifications which would enable them to make a significant contribution to our economy.</P>
    <P>At present the 4,000 or so people whose cases are pending &mdash; and whose status would be regularised under this Bill &mdash; are denied certain basic civil rights.  They are denied the right to work, learn and travel, rights which the rest of us take for granted and which are fundamental in a civilised society.  Some of these people have lived here for years.  Ireland is home for them and their children and it is where their future lies.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of illegal Irish immigrants in the United States were allowed regularise their position.  Many settled in the US and others returned here when the economy improved. Could we not show to asylum seekers the same sort of humane approach that was urged on the United States by successive Irish Governments?</P>
    <P>Our Bill provides a simple procedure to wipe the slate clean and to regularise not just the status of our asylum seekers but also the status of our refugee legislation.  There is widespread political recognition that forced deportations are an intolerable option.  The Fine Gael and Labour Parties have already demonstrated support for an amnesty as set out in this Bill.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, said the Government is open to the idea.</P>
    <P>On 10 December 1997, her colleague Deputy O'Malley spoke about his anguish at seeing asylum seekers being forcibly put back on a plane at Shannon from which they had escaped.  He said:</P>
    <P>Some of those people unquestionably went to their deaths after they were put back on the plane.  That is something of which this country should be ashamed.  It is something that we should remember now when we look at the increased but still tiny number of people who want to come to this country and who are not welcome.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity for the Progressive Democrats to absolve Ireland of that shame.  The Tánaiste has said many times that she leads a separate party independent of Fianna Fáil.  Sometimes she may have thought she led the political <Col N="730" /> conscience of this House.  I ask her to use that independence to ensure the passage of this measure which is in line with her own party's thinking and, I believe, in line with her own personal thinking.  If the Progressive Democrats duck this issue the shame will not disappear for its Members sitting at Cabinet.</P>
    <P>This is a political issue which must be given political direction.  I note that today's <i>Irish Independent</i> stated that the interdepartmental committee has recommended against accepting this Bill.  Knowing the civil servant mindset, I would be amazed had the committee done anything else. However, the Cabinet response in capitulating to this mindset is a different matter.  It reveals a spinelessness and fearfulness that does no credit to either this Government or this country.</P>
    <P>If the newspaper reports are correct I challenge both the premise and the figures upon which this decision is made.  Attempts have been made to exaggerate the number of applicants for refugee status.  According to the Minister's figures given in reply to a Dáil question on 10 February, the total number of applications from the beginning of 1992 to the end of 1997 was 5,978.  However, in the same period, 1,430 applications were withdrawn, leaving a net figure of 4,548 people to whom the terms of this Bill would apply.</P>
    <P>Some of the inflated figures appear to have come from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  According to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 17 January, a senior official of the Department speaking at a conference organised by the Irish Centre for European Law said there were under 2,000 asylum seekers in 1996.  However, the Minister's reply of 10 February shows that the net figure was under 2,000 and was just 807.</P>
    <P>This Government has a choice.  It can choose the option I am presenting to them &mdash; to clear the backlog and implement the Refugee Act.  Backlogs of this type are not unusual in other European countries.  Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and the Netherlands have had similar experience. An amnesty was not granted in the Netherlands, but resources were expended to process claims fairly.  If an amnesty is not granted, considerable resources will be required.  The Cabinet cannot reject an amnesty without facing up to a serious obligation to invest those resources heavily in this area.</P>
    <P>I understand that even with the additional staff employed to operate the crude fast track system established by the Minister, resources are inadequate. The Minister cannot wriggle off the hook by pretending the system is either fair or effective and that resources are not an issue.  He argued against an amnesty on the grounds that families may seek asylum.  This is inconsistent for a Minister who is a great proponent of family values. Protection of the family in this context is clearly undesirable.</P>
    <P>Family reunification is not new to us.  In the Refugee Agency's annual report of 1996 it is clearly shown that family reunification for Vietnamese refugees was managed and is operating <Col N="731" /> well.  This shows the numbers are not necessarily five times greater than the number eligible for amnesty.  In fact, approximately one in five of the Vietnamese refugees emigrated out of Ireland.</P>
    <P>These are serious considerations which I am not belittling.  However, they should not cloud the issue.  Our system is not working and we need to deal with that and the injustice inherent in it.  In <i>The Irish Times</i>, I read with growing disbelief a statement made by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell last weekend.  She said Government policy required that visitors be treated with courtesy, efficiency and fairness.  She spoke about the promotion of a generous and positive welcome for the refugee community.  I have the highest regard for the Minister of State.  However, she has lost the run of herself if she thinks Government policy and practice is in anything other than a state of total shambles.</P>
    <P>Speaking at the same conference, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, told it as it is.  She argued trenchantly for a new approach to recognise that our new found posterity brought with it new obligations and responsibilities.  She asked that there be a speedy and fair resolution of the plight of asylum seekers stuck in a logjam which mirrors a logjam in their lives.  She sought administrative changes, but more importantly &ldquo;an attitude of mind that we are in enriched in Ireland by those who come from other countries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have a choice.  It can be based on fear, retrenchment and political cowardice or we can make a choice which reflects our strength, confidence and the desire of many, particularly our young people, to welcome diversity.  This is not a choice to be made on the recommendations of an interdepartmental committee.  It is a choice based on how we see ourselves as a modern people belonging in a European community with all the advantages and responsibilities that entails.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I wish to share my time with Deputy Gormley.  As a member of the Socialist Party, I commend Democratic Left on bringing forward this Bill which is a human response to the extreme difficulties and suffering being endured by thousands of refugees.  This suffering could be ended overnight by a simple <Col N="732" /> decision by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Those who have applied for refugee status have been subjected to the most shameful treatment by officials.  Responsibility for this shameful treatment lies with the political leadership and bureaucratic apparatus of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>What kind of justice can refugees expect when the Minister of State at the Department stated before Christmas and the Minister repeated that a decision had already been made on the 4,000-5,000 applicants, that 10 per cent were genuine refugees and 90 per cent were so-called illegal immigrants.  What justice can those people hope for when it seems the Minister has already made up his mind on the matter?  In the past two weeks eight applicants have been deported against their will.  They were kicked out by order of the Minister as so-called illegal immigrants.  This is a stain on our society and State and the Minister and his colleagues in Government should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus referred to the admission by Deputy O'Malley.  If, as he said, people were bundled on to planes while they begged for mercy and sent to their death then the matter should be investigated.  If this is found to be true then those responsible politically and bureaucratically should be called to account.</P>
      <P>The history of our nation cries out for a human response to the few thousand people seeking refugee status.  During times of catastrophe our people sought and found refuge abroad.  What extra suffering would they have been subjected to if they had not been given shelter abroad?  During the 1980s when tens of thousands of illegal young Irish people were on the streets of New York, Chicago and Boston, politicians, including members of Fianna Fáil, crossed the Atlantic every month and pleaded on bended knee with the US Administration to make them legal, to give them an amnesty.  They were correct to do so and thankfully an amnesty was given to many of these young people.  Yet this party in Government now denies the same human compassion to a few thousand people who ask of this State much less than our nation asked of many other nations.</P>
      <P>Politicians and sections of the media have lined up to abuse and castigate refugees.  Poverty and homelessness are being blamed on refugee applicants. Poverty existed before refugees came here and if 5,000 refugees were put on 747s tomorrow it would still be here as long as the system of capitalism and market remained.  Homelessness is the subject of obscene profiteering in the housing market by builders, developers, profiteers and rezoners, not refugee applicants.  The old faithful word &ldquo;sponger&rdquo; has been thrown out on a number of occasions.  Refugee applicants are not allowed to work.  It is like blaming someone for being hungry when we refuse to feed them.  Most refugees want to work and, regardless of whether they have tremendous or little talent, they should be allowed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> The number of refugee applicants is much less than the number of first generation Irish people living in many small cities in Britain.  Tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Irish people occupy local authority housing and draw the dole in Britain.  If a movement developed in Britain to deport these people what would the public say and the State do?</P>
    <P>I hope we will get a generous response from the Minister.  To do this he will have to break free from the bureaucratic stranglehold and conservative and right wing advice he is being given by his advisers, particularly those in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I hope he will do this.  I have direct experience of the bureaucratic apparatus in the Department.  When I was a councillor I made representations to the aliens office on behalf of people who sought my assistance. Even though I speak English, I was frustrated and confused by the number of offices to which I was sent.  How do refugees who are bewildered and do not know the language feel?</P>
    <P>I commend the excellent work done by the voluntary refugee agencies, particularly the Irish Refugee Council.  These agencies have shamefully been left to carry the can for Government inaction. Even at this stage they should be given a much greater injection of funds.  I beg the Minister to accept the Bill, to show generosity and to allow people under much duress to find a new life here and to end their suffering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for sharing his time with me.  I have outlined my party's position on this matter on many occasions.  Some weeks ago we had a debate on the matter following foolish, racist remarks by a Deputy on the other side of the House.  Recently in reply to a question raised by a Fine Gael Deputy, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, implied that homelessness was caused by the huge influx of refugees. This is the sort of foolish remark which incites hatred.  At our advice centres people ask why they cannot get accommodation when refugees get it.  We must be very careful about the language we use.</P>
      <P>I compliment Democratic Left on introducing the Bill which will be welcomed by many people. However, I have a quibble with the use of the word &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; which we associate with those who have committed a crime.  Most, if not all, refugees have not committed crimes, even if they have been accused of such in their own countries and we must immediately stop using this term.  I am worried that this will be regarded as a measure to deal with the entire problem. However, as Deputy McManus said this is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support the Bill.  The existing procedures are painfully inadequate and are putting people, almost all of whom have valid reasons for seeking asylum, under undue stress.  Even if the Bill is implemented, which seems unlikely given the Government's hamfisted attempt to deal with the issue, it must be regarded as a partial <Col N="734" /> response to the refugee problem.  The proper response can only be the full implementation of the Refugee Act.  However, the willingness of the Government to take the necessary action will always be in question.</P>
    <P>Some refugee applicants have been waiting for up to three years to have their status regularised. During this time they cannot work.  We must deal with this matter.  On the current backlog, we must put in place practices and procedures which will avoid prolonging this problem.  We must look at this matter in great detail.  The Green Party supports the right of asylum seekers to seek asylum in accordance with international law.</P>
    <P>I would like to finish by citing an anecdote.  I met recently with a delegation from Algeria.  One of the individuals whom I met was in genuine fear of his life and he could not sleep at night.  That was the situation this gentleman found himself in. When he departed I felt for him on a human level because he simply did not know what was going to happen.  The Minister should think about this issue on a human level.  Let us not think about bureaucracy, but about human beings.  If they are deported, some of these people could be sent to their death.  I am not exaggerating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy McManus on producing this Private Members' Bill.  I know from my own experience in Opposition how difficult this can be and how much work is involved.</P>
      <P>By now, I am well used to beguiling attempts to misrepresent my position.  I have no reason whatsoever to change even one iota of what I said in relation to refugees when in Opposition.  I stated then that the plight of refugees would strike a chord in the heart of every Irish person with a grasp of history because our own people had to flee persecution in this land.</P>
      <P>To suggest, however, that there is any inconsistency between the position which I am adopting now and that which I adopted then is to completely misrepresent the situation.  It is to try to blur the real distinction which exists in law and in practice between a refugee, on the one hand, and an illegal immigrant on the other.  There is a clear distinction between those two categories of individual. That is the unfortunate truth.</P>
      <P>It is also true that the debate on the Refugee Act, 1996, took place against a backdrop of far fewer applications for asylum.  For example, there were 424 applicants in 1995, while to date in 1998 some 1,000 applications have been lodged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as Deputy McManus's criticism in relation to manifestly unfounded procedures is concerned &mdash; set out in the letter of 10 December and referred to by her &mdash; I have listened to the comments made by Amnesty International, the Refugee Council, Trócaire and the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace.  Representatives of those organisations met with my officials last March and asked for an independent person to be appointed to deal with appeals, rather than a <Col N="735" /> departmental official.  I have already decided to accede to that request in order to ensure transparency.</P>
    <P>For reasons which I will put before the House in the course of my contribution, the Government has decided not to accept Deputy McManus's Bill.  Careful examination of it and the issues surrounding it has led the Government to this conclusion. I propose to outline fully what action has been taken, as well as the Government's position and what action the Government has decided on for the future.</P>
    <P>On my appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform one of the first issues to be brought to my attention was the surge in the numbers of asylum seekers which had been experienced in 1996 and in the first half of 1997. I noted the decision taken by the previous Government &mdash; of which Deputy McManus and her party colleagues were members &mdash; at its last meeting to introduce passport checks on those travelling from the United Kingdom.  I noted also the need for action to be taken to process applications as the system was not designed to deal, or capable of dealing, with the increasing numbers of asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries about the implementation of the Refugee Act, 1996.  I noted the High Court proceedings and the fact that implementation of the Act would have a negative impact.  Like most people, I knew there were emerging pressures, but until the facts were presented to me I did not appreciate the pressures were such as to make the implementation of the Act itself impractical. Even if we did not have the difficulties posed by the High Court action, the reality was that the structures provided for in the Act would have been totally overwhelmed from day one, had we gone ahead with its implementation.  In the circumstances, I decided not to interfere with the decision of the outgoing Government which, in clear recognition of the scale of the problem, decided to introduce passport checks on passengers between here and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I met with the then representative of the UNHCR for an overall discussion of the position and secured a commitment that UNHCR would assist in every possible way in dealing with the backlog of applications.  I also secured Government approval for additional staff to be appointed to my Department to process applications as there was no hope of clearing the backlog with existing resources.  I arranged for the resumption of the hearing of outstanding appeals. I pay tribute to Mr. Justice O'Malley for the time and effort he has put into dealing with appeals. Finally, I arranged for consultation to take place with UNHCR with a view to arriving at improved arrangements for dealing with applications to replace the arrangements made in 1985.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to detain the House for any great length on those matters, but the House is aware that in relation to the recruitment of additional staff, substantial industrial relations <Col N="736" /> difficulties arose.  These difficulties, regrettably, caused delay but I am glad to say they were resolved on 27 February.  An additional 19 staff have been deployed to this work.  Interviews for retired public servants who applied for positions start on 23 March and I intend that the majority of the additional staff will be in place by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>In relation to the new procedures agreed with UNHCR, it was not until 10 December 1997 that extensive consultations were completed and the new arrangements entered into force.  Those procedures, based on the philosophy of the 1996 Refugee Act, can now, with additional staff, be brought fully into effect.  Training for staff is being provided with the assistance and input of UNHCR and the first such course starts tomorrow. I hope that puts to rest the notion being peddled inside and outside the House that in some way the procedures put in place are unfair to applicants and that they do not reflect the fundamental philosophy of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>Provision of legal aid is not yet established on a fully satisfactory basis.  I am examining various options to ensure that legal advice is available to all asylum seekers.  I am satisfied that no person has been disadvantaged by the current arrangements. In all cases, those having their cases dealt with by Judge O'Malley had, if they wanted it, the advice of a solicitor or counsel.</P>
    <P>I took all the measures I have just outlined to deal with the immediate problems, but there are of course other issues.  First, there is the law itself. I undertook, in consultation with ministerial colleagues, a review of all the legislative measures affecting immigration &mdash; immigration law and refugee law &mdash; with a view to identifying what changes might be necessary.  Following preliminary examination of the position, the Government decided to ask an interdepartmental committee to prepare a report.  That committee produced a report in February which included a series of recommendations for change.  The Government has accepted these recommendations. The actions decided on by the Government are intended to deal with the related issues of asylum and immigration in a balanced way in the short, medium and longer term.</P>
    <P>Before I give details to the House of the Government decisions, it is worth taking a little time to sketch some of the background to the decisions.  Deputies will appreciate that in the limited time available it is not possible to give an exhaustive account of trends in migration and asylum throughout Europe, but some of the detail must be given to enable Members to have a sense of perspective on the question.</P>
    <P>Ireland has traditionally been regarded as a country of emigration rather than immigration. Over the years, however, and especially in recent years, there has been a steady and welcome inflow of migrants.  At any one time there are about 50,000 non-lrish persons legally resident in Ireland and I take this opportunity to acknowledge the contributions made to society by the <Col N="737" /> thousands who come to study or work here, many of whom subsequently became Irish citizens, in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>Ireland has traditionally accepted a number of refugees from conflict areas around the world, the most recent example being those from the conflict in Bosnia.  I am satisfied that Ireland's traditional welcome to those in such difficulty has not changed.  I am pleased to say that in so far as people make application and are deemed to be refugees, that policy will not change under this Administration.</P>
    <P>What we have experienced in recent times, however, is something quite new.  It is a source of puzzlement to many people that at a time when there are no conflicts taking place near our borders of the kind that usually generate refugee movement, when we have no colonial links with countries in which political turmoil is taking place and when the number of claims for refugee status is declining in other European states, the Irish rate shows a major increase.  The extent of the surge experienced is something the Government regards as an issue which requires priority Government attention.  Apart from the necessity to address, as humanely as we can, the reality of thousands of immigrants who have arrived on our shores, there are significant issues, such as cost considerations, which are rightly the concern of Government.  The estimated cost of dealing with asylum seekers this year is of the order of £45 million.</P>
    <P>While the trend is generally downward in other European countries, it is the case that migration pressure on European states is a source of major concern at EU level.  It is equally true that the fact that no European country actively seeks migratory workers from outside the EU has generated an increase in the number of persons who seek asylum as refugees when it is economic pressures which are the motivating factors rather than political persecution.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing European states in general, and currently facing Ireland, is to create structures which will enable those individuals who are refugees to be quickly identified and supported while, at the same time, to preserve the integrity of the refugee concept and public confidence in the system generally, identify quickly those who are not refugees and, where necessary, arrange for their repatriation.</P>

The committee recommended that processing of applications should be carried out as quickly as possible and that, as additional staff become available, a certain number should be assigned to deal with the backlog of cases while applicants from a current date should be dealt with quickly so that the backlog can be prevented from increasing.</P>

      <P>In the general context of international co-operation in this field the Government has also agreed the recommendation that Ireland should accept an invitation to join the Intergovernmental Consultations on Asylum, Refugee and Migration Policies in Europe, North America and Australia, which has experience and knowledge in this field.</P>
      <P>As a further aid to the orderly return of persons to their countries of origin, the committee recommended that formal readmission agreements between Ireland and those countries should be concluded.  While Ireland has not, up to now, concluded such agreements as they were not felt necessary, circumstances have altered radically over the past few years and such agreements, designed to facilitate the process of return, should prove beneficial.  Most of our European partners have such agreements in place and consider them to be of value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further recommendation is that all appropriate assistance should be given by the relevant public bodies to facilitate the integration of recognised refugees into Irish society.  On this aspect I am not satisfied that enough is currently being done.  Refugees have many concerns and needs.  As with the system of processing requests for recognition more can be done more quickly to help recognised refugees, and while I acknowledge the work done by bodies such as the Irish Refugee Council, I believe more needs to be <Col N="740" /> done.  I will be pursuing this matter with appropriate colleagues.</P>

      <P>The committee expressed the view that, given the experience of the last 18 months, it seems to be the case that a policy in this area, which is independent from and substantially different from that of our European neighbours, is not sustainable in the short or long-term as the number of asylum seekers affected by, for example, changes in policy regarding arrangements, etc., by other European countries could encourage large scale movement to Ireland of such persons.  As 98 per cent of asylum seekers evade immigration controls and claim to be unaware of how they arrived in Ireland, return to the appropriate EU country under the Dublin Convention may not be possible in many cases, and Ireland could be faced with the costs of processing claims and repatriation costs.</P>

The Government has accepted that recommendation and arrangements are being made to have this study carried out by an independent body.</P>
      <P>The committee has made other important recommendations &mdash; for example, in relation to aspects of immigration and citizenship &mdash; but I will return to these at another time.  One recommendation which must be addressed as a matter of priority, and is incidentally the final committee recommendation I shall refer to this evening, is the need to introduce into our law penalties for people involved in trafficking in illegal immigration to Ireland.  Currently our law is lacking in this regard and there is evidence of organised trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further area of concern, linked to trafficking, <Col N="741" /> is the exploitation of illegal immigrants by unscrupulous employers.  Current aliens legislation provides for a fine of £2 on the illegal worker.  Clearly this is wrong and legislation is needed so that the employer is liable for penalties in keeping with modern life.  Work has started on the preparation of draft legislation in these two areas and is being accorded priority.</P>
    <P>The increased number of asylum seekers arriving here has, unfortunately, given rise to expressions of racism that were not articulated in Irish society up to now.  This has to be a matter of considerable concern and regret to all responsible people.  The hostility which is sometimes directed at asylum seekers has, unfortunately, also spilled over into racist remarks and behaviour directed at other members of racial minorities in the State. This is something which has to be deplored.  Last December this House unanimously passed a motion which, among other things, condemned sentiments and manifestations of racism as inimical to respect for the dignity of all human beings and deplored hostile statements or acts directed against those from other countries seeking refuge in the State.  I reiterate that condemnation and I know Deputies join me in this.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, my Department had an allocation of £100,000 last year to spend on activities relating to European Year against Racism.  I am satisfied that much worthwhile activity to combat racism took place in 1997 and I am examining how the impetus created by this can be sustained in the longer term.</P>
    <P>I place special emphasis on four inter-related points.  The first is the need to ensure that debate on the subject of asylum seekers is balanced and is based on fact, not on confusion.  Some of the comments that have been made on the subject in recent times are neither balanced nor fact-based. One detects an underlying suggestion that it is somehow illegitimate for the State to insist that immigration flows must be regulated.  All countries seek to regulate immigration flows. Nobody's interests, least of all those of immigrants, would be served simply by allowing immigration to take place in a totally haphazard and unregulated manner.  It is less than balanced, therefore, to give the impression, as some have done, that it is fair game to regard those whose very difficult task it is to apply the regulatory regime provided for in laws enacted in this House as anti-immigrant simply because they do their jobs.  The slur is not warranted and those who have in the past held the position I hold now also know it is not warranted.</P>
    <P>Second, it is important that in debate we recognise the clear distinction between a genuine refugee and a person who has simply managed to evade immigration controls.</P>

      <P>I again refer to the attempts by some people to misrepresent my position on this issue by seeking to blur the distinction between a refugee and an illegal immigrant.  It serves nobody's interests, least of all those of refugees, to pretend that everybody who applies for refugee status is a person who is fleeing persecution. The reality, in line with the international experience, is that at most about 10 per cent of applicants will, following examination of their claims, be found to be refugees.  The UNHCR attaches great importance to the distinction I have just mentioned because it knows that the people who suffer most, if the distinction is blurred, are the very people who are most in need of protection.</P>
      <P>Third, it is important to understand that the absence of an amnesty does not mean that asylum applicants who do not qualify for refugee status automatically suffer injustice.  I will look very carefully at all the cases where applicants fail to qualify.  If there are special circumstances I will, naturally, take these considerations on board.  I am in no doubt that it is much better to proceed in this way than by way of amnesty, which not only rewards meritorious and unmeritorious cases alike, but would most certainly send the wrong signal in terms of addressing illegal immigration flows in the future.</P>
      <P>Those who wrongly claim refugee status and who simply evade immigration controls and those who ruthlessly traffic immigrants past our controls, like all law breakers, need to understand very clearly that it will not be tolerated.  The situation whereby those entering illegally could anticipate long delays while their cases are being processed is about to end and traffickers or any others who pretend to them that they will be allowed to remain here, when they have no grounds for doing so, are misleading them in a most serious and ruthless way.</P>
      <P>It is vital that debate on this very sensitive issue should not take on a character which could be described as racist or anti-immigrant.  For this to happen, it is not necessary for anybody to make remarks which could be characterised as anti-immigrant; it is sufficient to lay that accusation, unfairly, at someone else's doorstep.  We need fair, rational, evenly tempered discussion, not scaremongering.  The Government has decided, for the reasons I have given, not to accept this Bill.  Following careful review of the position, I believe it has arrived at the correct decision.</P>

      <P>This is a good Bill, well crafted, with definite parameters and safeguards.  It is short, clear, prescriptive and workable.  I ask the Minister between now and 8.30 p.m. tomorrow to rethink the matter because it is a good Bill, and I commend Deputy McManus and Democratic Left for introducing it.</P>
      <P>This Government inherited the Refugee Act, 1995, which was good legislation.

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: What seems to have slipped Minister O'Donoghue's mind is that Ireland is a signatory to the Geneva convention relating to the status of refugees, its protocols and other legal instruments.  Ireland has an obligation to provide asylum for refugees.</P>
      <P>Let us be quite clear about this; we are talking about genuine refugees, not economic migrants. Asylum seekers must not be sent back if there is any risk of persecution, torture or death because of race, religion, nationality or political or social actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are looking for an independent system of assessing applications and officials should be properly trained and sensitised to dealing with refugee applicants.  We are talking about a fair, open and objective independent appeals procedure and adequate legal and language resources to enable these people to process their applications.  Border officials should be properly trained and, last but not least, there should be speedy processing of applications.  That is it in a <Col N="744" /> nutshell.  There is nothing mysterious about it and it involves no great difficulties.  What is required is a simple set of seven or eight basic streamlined procedures and yet the Minister has turned down this Bill because it attempts to fill the vacuum left by ministerial inaction.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that one of the most glaring performances of negative opposition was that of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform between December 1994 and June 1997. Except for the rarest of rare exceptions, literally every difficulty in the Justice sphere was firmly labelled as the personal responsibility of the then Minister for Justice.  Blame for even the most trivial administrative mishaps was laid firmly at the feet of the Minister.</P>
    <P>One of these rare exceptions to this constant barrage of verbal bludgeoning was Deputy O'Donoghue's performance on the Refugee Bill, 1995.  On 19 October 1995 Deputy O'Donoghue told the Dáil about &ldquo;the hugely prohibitive red tape in the processing of applications for Refugee Status&rdquo;.  It was inexcusable.  He grieved for the plight of refugees as &ldquo;persons displaced from their country of origin becoming subjects of an even more obstructive and debilitating syndrome while waiting in a surreal haze of indecision as the powers that be decide whether or not to grant them refugee status&rdquo;.</P>

The Minister has stepped backwards by replacing the Refugee Act, 1995, of the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Government with a so-called fast track system shrouded in secrecy where the entire decision making process is vested within the corridors of his Department.  This so-called fast track system, to which Deputy McManus referred, was announced by the Minister on 10 December 1997. Tonight the Minister reminded us that there is no inconsistency.  As Deputy O'Donoghue seems to be suffering from amnesia, let me, again, remind him that he told the Dáil in 1995 that Amnesty International had demonstrated that &ldquo;experience abroad has shown that the fast track procedures <Col N="745" /> save neither time nor money.

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: There is no guarantee, for example, of an interpreter.  The Minister's document setting out the fast track procedure tells us &ldquo;where necessary and possible an interpreter shall be provided&rdquo;.  People coming from a foreign country with little or no knowledge of English, trying to wrestle with new complicated procedures and to explain the dilemma and political situation which led them to abandon their country, are not guaranteed the fundamental right or facility of making themselves understood.  Surely there should be the guaranteed right to an interpreter in all cases, yet the regulation in relation to this entitlement is unclear and ambiguous.</P>
      <P>The decision as to whether one is granted asylum is not taken by any independent person, agency or party but by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  If the application is turned down, the Minister tells us &ldquo;the appeal will be decided by a person of more senior rank, in consultation with the UNHCR where possible&rdquo;.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Even if it is possible for the UNHCR to make representations, the UN body gets a mere seven days within which to do so.  Here we have one official in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform deciding whether a decision taken by a colleague official in the same Department, possibly on the same floor or, indeed, in the same office, was in accordance with the Department's own criteria.</P>
      <P>The whole situation is ludicrous and indefensible. Surely any appeal procedure must be presided over by somebody at a considerable remove from the person who made the original decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's so-called fast track procedure is quite specific in setting down the range of situations which would undermine the basis of a valid application for asylum.  For example, the Minister tells us in clause (f) that an application is deemed not to be in order if &ldquo;the applicant, without reasonable cause and in bad faith, destroyed identity documents, withheld relevant information or otherwise obstructed investigation of the application&rdquo;.  Yet the Minister who on 6 February <Col N="746" /> 1996 told the Select Committee on Legislation and Security:</P>
    <P>A genuine applicant might actually destroy travel documents or identity papers without reasonable cause even on the advice of a third party.  In view of the fearful situation of an asylum seeker and the logistics of the situation, it appears to be unreasonable to penalise the individual.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue went even further and moved an amendment to give this legislative effect, and now he stands his amendment on its head.  So much for consistency, let alone compassion.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I do.  The stark reality is that our performance in dealing with asylum seekers is a disgrace.  Instead of, as Deputy O'Donoghue lectured the Dáil in 1995, seizing &ldquo;this opportunity to provide refuge for those in fear of persecution&rdquo; we have totally reneged on our international and humanitarian obligations.</P>
      <P>On one hand, we pretend to be passionate protagonists for human rights while, on the other, even Members of this House have shown a frightening antagonism towards refugees.  In spite of our economic boom the rights of this small and vulnerable group have not only not been upheld but have been flagrantly disregarded.  We vaunt ourselves as a modern, progressive democracy. However, Ireland alone of all EU member states has no laws governing the treatment of refugees. Our legislation is not refugee legislation, it is aliens legislation dating back to the 1930s which was designed to keep Nazi spies out of the country.</P>
      <P>Article 14 (1) of the UN Declaration of Human Rights states that &ldquo;everyone has the right to seek and enjoy other countries' asylum from persecution&rdquo;. However, in this country, we leave 4,000 of these people locked in a legal limbo between the two canals of our capital city.  Given the Government's foot dragging and a certain public hysteria, one would imagine that some sort of mass invasion or threat to our sovereignty was afoot when the reality is that the number of refugees coming to Ireland is a barely perceptible trickle compared to the numbers that have been hosted by other EU countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been unsubstantiated claims about each refugee bringing in an average of five family members with them.  Was this the experience when we allowed a few Vietnamese, Bosnians or Hungarians to enter the country?  There have been exaggerated and grossly irresponsible newspaper headlines such as &ldquo;5,000 Refugees Flooding into Ireland&rdquo; or &ldquo;Refugee Rapist on the Rampage&rdquo; when the reality is that only a minute number of refugees have committed crimes within the State.  However, there has been a typical blanket condemnation for the actions of a few. As Deputy McManus stated, on one hand, we will <Col N="747" /> not allow these people to work pending determination of their applications for asylum and, on the other, we brand them as spongers in newspaper headlines such as &ldquo;Crackdown on 2,000 Sponger Refugees&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The spectacle of the Department allowing 2,000 asylum seekers from central Africa and eastern Europe to queue for hours in pouring rain outside its offices on Saturday, 11 October last, to renew their identity cards spoke volumes for the Government's so-called concern for these people.  There seems to be a total absence of coherence in Government policy.  However, the Programme for Government contains a clear commitment to implement the Refugee Act, 1996.  There were no ifs, buts or maybes, no codicils or conditions; there was a clear commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to implement the provisions of the Act.  Distilling what the Minister stated earlier, I have no doubt that he is in the process of throwing the Act overboard. The raw reality is that the Government has made absolutely no attempt to seek to have the courts make an early determination on the challenge to the Act.  Repeated inquiries have been addressed to the Taoiseach on the Order of Business with regard to what is being done by way of approaches to the courts to ensure they prioritise this legislation.  However, we have received no indication that any approaches have been made to have it treated as a priority and determined once and for all.</P>

In its judgment in the Anisimova case in December the Supreme Court firmly laid down that the rules of natural justice and constitutional justice must apply.  This clearly means that each case must be heard individually.</P>
      <P>We live in &ldquo;Ireland of the welcomes&rdquo;, which is preparing for another boom tourist season.  As Deputy McManus stated, people from &ldquo;Ireland of the welcomes&rdquo; have been welcomed by countries across the globe.  However, we are on the brink of mass banishment of people who came here in the valid expectation that their dignity would be respected and they would be welcomed in their escape from repressive regimes in their own countries.

It is an extraordinary performance for a country whose people were offered safe haven in different corners of the globe and who were allowed to ply their wares and carve out new dignified existences for themselves and their descendants.  It is an extraordinary performance for a country which even in the past decade lobbied Irish-American political opinion in the US, as if it were our birthright, for Donnelly and Morrison visas in order to legitimise the status of the thousands of young Irish people who were economic refugees in that country.</P>

In this case a young man inherited his father's farm and decided to start farming at an early age.  He subsequently inherited and leased his uncle's property and the combination made a reasonably viable holding.  In accordance with advice readily available from the Government, he decided after a couple of years that he would be well served to improve his education to ensure he would be better equipped to deal with the world. When he decided to do so the farm retirement pension which had been awarded to his uncle was stopped.

      <P>. &ldquo;farming as a main occupation&rdquo; shall mean farming in accordance with Article 5 (1) (a) of the Council Regulation 2328/91 which prescribes that: &ldquo;The proportion of income he or she derives from the farm is 50 per cent or more of the farmer's total income and the working time devoted to work unconnected with the farm is less than half of the farmer's total working time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the crunch factor.  The question at issue is how much of the young man's time is devoted to farming.  Someone has arbitrarily decided that more than 50 per cent of his time is spent in education when it is not.  On reviewing the case I found that roughly 23 weeks, or 115 working days of 4.5 to five hours per day, are devoted to his education.  I do not know how much those who prescribe the scheme know about agriculture, but <Col N="750" /> a five hour day would not be considered the greater portion of a working day.  This young man spends roughly 115 out of 365 days devoted to his education.</P>
    <P>If a change in this scheme is required it should be made.  This is the year in which we are expected to approve the Amsterdam Treaty and seek the support of the people for it.  We encourage people to follow the advice we have given them over many years to improve their education to be better equipped for the future.  However, when they do so we penalise them because they do not conform to the bureaucratic regulations. It may be that the Commission decided this matter and, if so, it decided wrongly.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to change this policy because it is the greatest contradiction I have seen in bureaucracy.  This young man is attempting to do what he has been encouraged to do.</P>

      <P>The scheme of early retirement from farming is one of the accompanying measures operated under the CAP reform agreed in 1992.  The scheme was introduced in 1994.  The intention of the scheme is to encourage older farmers to retire and to transfer their holdings to younger farmers who would enlarge them and, in so doing, improve the viability of the holding.  The pension is payable for a maximum of ten years but, in any event, not beyond the retiring farmer's seventieth birthday. To be eligible to retire under the scheme the farmer must be aged between 55 and 66 years of age on the date he or she signs the documents releasing the farm and he or she must have practised farming as a main occupation in each of the previous ten years.  The farm must be passed on to a younger eligible trained farming transferee who must be under 50 years and have the appropriate skill and competence.</P>
      <P>The eligible farming transferee who takes over the farm must have land in his or her own right &mdash; at least five hectares of usable agricultural area &mdash; or if he or she does not have lands, then he or she must enlarge the holding they receive from the retiring farmer by either five hectares of usable agricultural area or 10 per cent of the farm being taken over, whichever is the greater.  The scheme has been very successful in this country with over 7,000 people participating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the nature of the scheme it is inevitable that specific conditions must be applied.  Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2079/92, under which the scheme is being implemented, specifies certain mandatory conditions which must be included in the scheme.  One of these conditions is that a person eligible to become a farming transferee must, on the date the transfer documents are signed, undertake to practise farming as a main occupation and work the expanded holding for a period of five years or for as long as the early retirement pension is granted to the transferor, whichever is the greater.  Furthermore, the young <Col N="751" /> farmer must farm in harmony with the requirements of EU and national legislation on environmental protection in default of which certain controls and penalties will apply.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme &ldquo;farming as a main occupation&rdquo; means farming in accordance with article 5 (1) (a) of Council Regulation 2328/91, the provisions of which are set out in the application form.  The particular definition is as follows.</P>
    <P>The proportion of income he or she derives from the farm is 50 per cent or more of the farmer's total income and the working time devoted to work unconnected with the farm is less than half of the farmer's total working time [or] . while not practising farming as their main occupation derive at least 50 per cent of their total income from farming, forestry, tourism, or craft activities carried out on the holding, provided that the proportion of income deriving directly from farming on the holding is not less than 25 per cent of the farmer's total income and that off-farm activities do not account for more than half of the farmer's total working time.</P>
    <P>This is set out in the general conditions of the scheme which are part of the application form. Accordingly, if either a prospective transferor or transferee is engaged in a full-time job or full-time education, then he or she cannot, by definition, be deemed eligible under the scheme.  In essence, a full-time job or full-time education are taken to be exclusive as it is not possible to have two full-time pursuits.</P>
    <P>With regard to full-time and part-time working, I would direct the Deputy to the working time directive and the provisions contained therein.  In light of this directive and the provisions of the regulations governing the scheme of early retirement from farming, I cannot see how it would be possible to admit a full-time student to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1998 allocation for the development of services in the mid west region for those with a mental handicap is totally inadequate. It does not meet the immediate and urgent needs of persons in the region with a mental handicap.  I call on the Minister to immediately increase the allocation as the funds available for the provision of residential services are pitiful.</P>
      <P>There is an immediate and urgent requirement for the provision of 31 residential places but the Minister's allocation will only provide nine places.  In 1997 the agencies suggested as a strategy that for an extra outlay it would provide for more clients than was indicated by the Department of Health.  The strategy was implemented by the agencies but the additional funding was not forthcoming.  The additional outlay of £110,000 has been transferred into the 1998 allocation giving a net allocation of a mere £390,000. It is most regrettable the agencies are unable to continue such initiatives given that the merits of any such actions will not be recognised.</P>
      <P>The provision of services to children in the region is totally inadequate, particularly in the area of assessment and advice in pre-school services. The services will remain inadequate, even to answer the basic needs of parents and children in the foreseeable future.  Last Friday, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children met the representatives of the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped.  The meeting was requested by the parents and friends to discuss the crisis in services in the mid-west where 31 people require residential care and 42 require day care services.  The Taoiseach was informed of the ongoing anger and frustration of the parents who await services.  Detailed discussion took place and the friends and parents outlined that approximately £2 million &mdash; revenue and capital &mdash; is required to provide the necessary services for the people involved.</P>
      <P>The friends and parents of the mentally handicapped received a letter from the Minister, Deputy Cowen, today.  Regrettably, his reply was most disappointing.  He restated a number of plans and expenditure items already in the pipeline and which are well known to the friends and parents.  Unfortunately for those in urgent need, he made it clear there will be no additional funding to address the immediate problem.  Yet again those unfortunate people and their families must wait.  Will the Minister re-examine his stance?  If the political will exists, the money will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in identifying needs, said that an additional £500,000 was provided.  I question this figure as £110,000 was taken from the agencies to provide services; therefore, the net figure is £390,000.  The Minister's letter confirmed the Mid-Western Health Board has identified that 73 people are in urgent need of care.  He outlined his capital programme of £30 million over four years but revenue must be included for staffing and services, <Col N="753" /> buildings are useless without services. There is an urgency to outline the revenue to service the capital programme.</P>
    <P>In his letter, the Minister confirmed the major building project at Lisnagry is at stage 3 of the planning and design process and will commence later this year.  However, I remind him that his predecessor, Deputy Noonan, announced this last year and it has been in the pipeline since.  This will facilitate the transfer of 36 people from St. Joseph's psychiatric hospital to the new centre at St. Vincent's in Lisnagry.  The Minister stated he was fully committed to the allocation of £30 million for the capital programme nationally, of which £2 million is required in the mid-west.</P>
    <P>There have been many announcements over the past number of weeks, all of which dealt with projects already in the pipeline.  The parents and friends of the mentally handicapped in the mid-west ask that the same be done for them.  They want the project and the money allocated to it brought forward so that they can get over the difficulty facing the 73 people with immediate needs. Will he treat these services similar to sport and community projects in the area, which are also welcome?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  My Department published &ldquo;Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001&rdquo; last year based on figures from the national intellectual disability database.  An analysis of the database shows a requirement for 1,439 new residential/respite places and 1,036 new day places over the period.  It is estimated the cost of providing these services will be approximately £63.5 million over that time.  The Mid-Western Health Board has identified a current requirement for 31 residential places and 42 day care places for the region.</P>
      <P>To continue the process of delivering the services identified in the assessment my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding of £16 million this year for services to persons with a mental handicap.  This funding includes £10.75 million revenue and £5.25 million capital.  The Mid-Western Health Board region received a total of £1.455 million from the additional revenue funding for the improvement of local services, of which £500,000 was allocated for the provision of new residential/respite and day care places in 1998 and £955,000 was provided to meet identified needs in their existing services, largely due to increased levels of challenging behaviour and the increasing age and dependency among patients in services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place in the Mid-Western Health Board region and the individuals who will benefit from these services are to be agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee in line with the priority needs identified for the region.  Proposals for the <Col N="754" /> expenditure of this additional funding, as agreed by the regional co-ordinating committee, will shortly be submitted to my Department.</P>
    <P>The capacity of existing facilities to absorb the additional places in the coming years and to provide the specialist services for disturbed patients is now limited.  A programme of building is essential to deliver the volume and quality of service required.  Late last year, the Minister also announced a new major capital programme of £30 million which he has put in place to run over four years beginning in 1998 in tandem with the service developments in the assessment of need and the Mid-Western Health Board region will benefit from it; the details are currently being discussed with the health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies.</P>
    <P>As well as the provision of new services, there is also need to improve the quality of life of people with a mental handicap who are inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals.  I confirm that the major building project at Lisnagry is currently at stage 3 of the planning and design process, and it is expected building will commence later this year.  This development will provide purpose built residential and day care facilities at St. Vincent's Centre, Lisnagry, for 36 persons with a mental handicap from St. Joseph's Hospital, Limerick.  These services, which are being developed by the Mid-Western Health Board in partnership with the Daughters of Charity, form a major part of the board's overall plan for the provision of services to persons with a mental handicap.  This capital project will cost over £2 million.</P>
    <P>As outlined in &ldquo;Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness&rdquo; and &ldquo;An Action Plan for the Millennium&rdquo;, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, met representatives of the Limerick Parents and Friends Association last week and explained to them that, in fulfilling the Government's commitment to meet the identified needs for the services over the period outlined in the assessment of need, there is a requirement to allocate capital money in the first instance to provide the basic infrastructure which can attract further continuing funding on an annual basis thereafter.  This capital funding, as I have already stated, is now in place.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for coming in to the House to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means test for nursing homes subvention is unfair.  All sons and daughters of an elderly person must be means tested before the subvention is decided.  If a member of a family does not co-operate with the health board, the subvention is not paid.  In such circumstances, health boards <Col N="755" /> usually state the subvention is refused on the grounds that insufficient information was submitted. The subvention is also refused if a member of the family is over the income limit.  If a means test must be carried out for the subvention, it should be done on the members of the family living with the elderly person concerned.  If all members of the family must be means tested, income limits and allowances should be increased.  With a maximum payment of £120 per week, it is obvious that extra funding must be provided by the family.  I understand the cost to the State of geriatric care in a health board hospital is in the region of £300 per week and health board hospitals are free of charge.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman commented on this issue on 7 November 1997.  He referred in particular to the regulations laid down under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act when it commenced in 1993.  He stated:</P>
    <P>The Minister's regulation defined the term &ldquo;circumstances&rdquo; as the &ldquo;.capacity of a son and/or daughter, aged twenty one years and over residing in the jurisdiction. to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care of his or her parent.&rdquo; On the basis of the interpretation of the regulation relied upon by most of the health boards, the practical consequence has been that subvention decisions take account of the capacity of a son or daughter to contribute to a parent's nursing home costs.  The subvention otherwise payable is reduced by the amount by which a son or a daughter is considered by a health board to be in a position to contribute.  And this line is generally taken irrespective of whether the son or daughter wishes to contribute, is actually contributing, or is contributing at a rate less than the health board's figure.  In effect, the regulation is being generally operated as if the adult children had an obligation to contribute to the parent's nursing home costs.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware there is no statutory obligation on children to support their elderly parents.  The Health (Nursing Homes) Act does not create any such an obligation.  Nor is there anything in that Act to suggest that the term &ldquo;circumstances&rdquo; should be defined in the way it has been defined by the regulation.</P>
    <P>I understand the Ombudsman is continuing to examine the matter and I hope he will make a recommendation in due course.</P>
    <P>Families are making financial contributions towards the cost of nursing home care because the maximum subvention is only £120 per week. What happens if people are not entitled to the subvention?  Is it possible to review an application after a number of months?  It is difficult for families to contribute to nursing home care for many years.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman went on to state that some injustices had become endemic in the public service and were alienating citizens from the State. <Col N="756" /> People are particularly alienated if, say, all ten members a family must be means tested under the nursing homes subvention regulations.  I know of many such cases in my constituency in east Galway.  I would like the regulations governing the means test changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this important issue on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives.  The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.  The subvention scheme provided for under the Act enables a contribution to be made towards the cost of nursing home care.  It is not intended to cover the full costs involved.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, set out the procedures to be followed by a health board when assessing the means of a person who has applied for a nursing home subvention. These regulations allow health boards to assess the ability of adult sons and daughters to contribute towards the cost of nursing home care for their parents.  One of the principal objectives of this legislation is to ensure that those most in need of nursing home care and without the resources to fund such care should receive assistance from the State.  It has long been accepted that adult sons and daughters of persons in nursing homes would contribute towards the costs of nursing home care for their parents if they could afford to do so.  The nursing home regulations were drafted with this in mind.  The State recognises the contribution made by sons and daughters towards their parents' maintenance costs by allowing income tax relief on such contributions.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office, this Government has provided additional resources to health boards to meet the increasing demand for nursing home subventions.  For example, an additional £6.9 million was made available in 1997 which brought annual expenditure in the scheme to approximately £24 million.  I am aware that difficulties have arisen with some aspects of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, particularly in relation to the assessment of circumstances of adult sons and daughters of applicants for subvention. My Department is in the process of carrying out a review of the regulations to determine whether any changes need to be made and</P>
      <P>I expect the review will be completed shortly.  I will also take on board the other observations made by the Deputy in regard to subventions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to raise the matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister for Justice, <Col N="757" /> Equality and Law reform for coming into the House to respond.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Bill, currently before the Seanad, will make it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees on grounds of age.  This legislation will include a legal ban on advertising jobs which contain an age bar.  The Amsterdam Treaty, which will shortly be put to the people in a referendum, will put a similar provision into the European treaties.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances one would expect agencies of the State to be particularly careful not to discriminate against employees on grounds of age and not to put an age bar into advertisements for jobs.  Yet State agencies continue to discriminate on grounds of age and to advertise jobs which contain an upper age limit and a lower age limit.  For example, Dublin Corporation recently advertised for a librarian with the proviso that the applicants be not less than 21 years and not more than 50 years on 1 March 1998.  An advertisement for a senior librarian, from the same employer, requires applicants to be not less than 23 years and not more than 50 years on 1 March 1998 while an advertisement for a senior librarian assistant requires candidates to be under 55 years of age.  The closing date for these competitions was 9 March.</P>
      <P>I understand applicants were told by Dublin Corporation that the inclusion of the age bar in the advertisement was required by instruction from the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  I asked the Taoiseach about this matter on the Order of Business last week and he acknowledged the practice of such age discrimination was wrong.  Yet it is continuing.  The Government is putting legislation through the Oireachtas to end discrimination on grounds of age and at the same time agencies of the State are continuing to discriminate on grounds of age by requiring an upper age limit for jobs they are advertising.</P>
      <P>Will the Government issue a directive to all State agencies to immediately discontinue age bars for open competitions?  I specifically ask that the Dublin Corporation competition, to which I have referred, and similar current competitions reopened with no age bar as there may be suitably qualified candidates who are deterred from applying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Age bars may have had some relevance in an era when jobs were for life and pension policy assumed 40 years continuous service in the one job but all that has changed.  The world of work is one where increasingly workers will change jobs, employers and even careers a number of times during their life.  In those circumstances it is a fundamental denial of a human right to tell somebody they cannot even apply for the job because they are over 50.  Every citizen who is suitably qualified for a job should be able to apply for it, irrespective of age.  Age discrimination is old fashioned and out of date and should be ended. This practice in which some State agencies are <Col N="758" /> engaging should be brought to an end.  It discriminates against people who are over 50, women who want to return to the workplace, people who have lost their jobs in one employment and are debarred from applying for employment in State agencies because they happen to be the wrong age.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government, given that it is introducing legislation to end discrimination on age grounds, to issue a directive to all State agencies. In the case of the Dublin Corporation job, I understand it intends to create a panel from this competition which will last for two years.  Even when the legislation is enacted, there will still be in existence panels which were based on recruitment practices which, by that time, will be against the law and, as it stands, are manifestly unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for raising this very important issue.  The Employment Equality Bill, 1997, outlaws discrimination on nine distinct grounds, including age, in relation to access to employment, conditions of employment, equal pay for work of equal value, training, work experience and promotion.  I regard the protections which the Bill provides against discrimination on grounds of age, as particularly important to our economic viability as we move into the next millennium.  Ireland has a younger demographic profile than many other EU member states.  Nonetheless, we, too, are moving towards an increasingly older population supported by a diminishing working age population.</P>
      <P>Despite emerging demographic trends, age barriers to employment are EU wide.  Some member states with population profiles older than ours have begun to rethink traditional policies that have tended to regard workers over 50, or even younger, as expendable.  As a result, there is a growing recognition that older workers often represent highly skilled labour and valuable knowhow. Research by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, among others, supports the view that these workers form a large pool of experienced, reliable and flexible employees.  The Employment Equality Bill, 1997, is an important policy intervention geared to change behaviour and attitudes in the workplace so that they are responsive to new demographic and market forces.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, age discrimination has been a feature of the labour market.  There may have been a sound underlying rationale for this preference in a society where skill lasted a lifetime and recruitment to a big commercial or public service institution offered a &ldquo;job for life&rdquo; but structural change in the labour market no longer supports such unthinking discrimination, either on grounds of economics or natural justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pace of change in the world of work is fast and can be expected to gather momentum.  The White Paper on Human Resource Development published by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment estimates that in ten <Col N="759" /> years' time, 80 per cent of today's technology will have been replaced but 80 per cent of today's employees will still be in the workforce.  The inescapable fact is that workers today are more likely to face redundancy and the task of reintegration into the workforce than would have been the case a generation ago.  The interests of natural justice dictate that older workers should not continue to suffer systematic disadvantage in the labour market as a result of the application of outmoded or discriminatory criteria for selection for employment or training.</P>
    <P>In applying age anti-discrimination legislation in the labour market, it is essential to have regard to existing labour market practices which facilitate a natural throughput of workers from school leaving age to retirement.  The Bill applies to discrimination between employees or prospective employees in the age range 18 to 65 years.  There is provision to allow an employer to set a maximum recruitment age for a particular job, providing that maximum age is economically and practically justifiable.  In setting such a maximum age, the Bill provides that the employer may take account of the cost and time involved in training a new recruit, to an effective level of work performance, and the need for a reasonable period prior to retirement age during which the recruit will be effective in that job, These exclusions are dictated by the need to ensure that the Bill does not upset economically sensitive recruitment decisions with consequential implications for the operation of the labour market.  Any maximum recruitment age set by an employer, in the context of an equality case under the Bill, can be examined by the Director of Equality Investigations to ensure that the age limit set meets the criteria established in the Bill.  The focus of this debate is on public service recruitment age limits. Upper recruitment ages for public service appointments are generally quite progressive. Policy in relation to limits for public service recruitment competitions has evolved in this decade in response to the changing work environment and emerging demographic considerations,</P>
    <P>Up until the 1980s, the public service, like some private sector organisations today, operated upper age limits for recruitment to most posts which ranged from 20 to 30 or 35 years of age. The Programme for Economic and Social Progress, which was agreed between the social partners in January 1991 gave a commitment to <Col N="760" /> review upper recruitment age limits in the public service.  As a result of that review, upper recruitment ages in the public service were raised substantially and, since then, an upper recruitment age limit of 50 has applied in relation to the vast majority of positions in the public service. Depending on the nature of the post and the recruitment needs, upper recruitment age limits of 55 years and even 60 years have applied in specific cases.</P>
    <P>The application of upper age limits for open competitions for posts in the Civil Service and other areas of the public service is under review, particularly in light of the provisions of the Employment Equality Bill, 1997, and the fact that, when enacted, the Bill will outlaw discrimination on grounds of age.  The Bill will apply to the broad spectrum of jobs in the public service. The variety, number and levels of employment that will be affected are vast, ranging from clerical and administrative workers, through engineers and barristers to Revenue officials and inspectors and field operatives in various Departments and agencies.  In the Civil Service, consultations are taking place with a view to bringing recruitment practice fully into line with the requirements of the legislation.</P>
    <P>It is likely that an upward shift in maximum recruitment ages for public service appointments will take place after employment equality legislation comes into operation.  The shift will not be of great magnitude, however, when regard is had to the present policy of an upper recruitment age of 50 years and the applicable maximum voluntary retirement age of 60 years and maximum compulsory retirement age of 65 years.  It is the clear intention, however, that recruitment policy for the Civil Service and other areas of the public service will fully respect the policy enunciated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The issue of discrimination on grounds of age is a major one.  That is why I thank the Deputy for raising it.  The policy changes that will ensue in the labour market in the area of recruitment and other age linked policies should not be underestimated.  In enacting age anti-discrimination legislation, we are setting a lead in Europe. I hope my response to this debate has been useful to the Deputy and others and given an insight into the innovative and far-reaching nature of the legislative proposals contained in the Employment Equality Bill, 1997.</P>

      <P>One of my main priorities since becoming Minister has been to further develop co-operation between my Department, the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Services and the Social Security Agency, which operates under the aegis of that Department. There has been ongoing co-operation between the respective Departments over the years and excellent relations have been developed between the officials involved.</P>
      <P>I considered that this needed to be given a new impetus and I felt this could best be achieved by a ministerial meeting to review all aspects of co-operation and the scope there is for further extension and development.</P>
      <P>To that end in January of this year I met the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. Tony Worthington MP, whose responsibilities include the Department of Health and Social Services.  We had a wide-ranging exchange of views on the common problems we face in the field of social security, not least the high levels of unemployment and social exclusion and the policies being pursued to our respective Governments to address these problems.  We also discussed implementation in both jurisdictions of the EU regulations on social security, cross-Border co-operation in countering social security fraud, support for the voluntary sector and cross-Border projects to combat poverty.</P>
      <P>The meeting set in train a review of our overall arrangements for liaison and co-operation, with a view to developing even more effective and closer co-operation on all social security matters in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I have also invited Mr. Worthington on a return visit here in the near future which has been accepted.</P>

      <P>Following the death of a <Col N="762" /> recipient of a social welfare payment or his or her spouse the payment is continued at the same rate for 6 weeks in circumstances where both spouses had a separate entitlement, provided one or both of the entitlements was a non-contributory old age pension, a blind pension or a carer's allowance, or where the payment includes a payment for a qualified adult.  The payment does not arise where each spouse had an independent entitlement to an insurance-based contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Allowing a surviving spouse to permanently receive a pension supplement after the death of the spouse, as suggested by the Deputy, would have cost implications and would also raise equity issues as a surviving spouse would then be in receipt, on an ongoing basis, of a greater payment than a pensioner on a personal rate only.</P>

      <P>A range of measures have been or are being put in place in my Department to ensure that members of the public and other interested parties are enabled to avail of their rights under the freedom of information legislation.  Because of the range of the Department's business and the extent of its interaction with the public there is potential for a high volume of requests for access to individual records held by the Department, when the Act comes into operation next month.  The Act also provides a statutory right of access to the reasons for decisions made by public bodies and to the guidelines used in making decisions on entitlement to payments and services.  The Department has considerably improved in recent years the level of access to this type of information and the implementation of the requirements of the Act in this respect will involve the completion of a process which was already in train.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for dealing with requests made to my Department for information under the Act are currently being put in place.  Under these arrangements, there will be a designated freedom of information officer in each local office and scheme area to decide on requests for personal information.  Requests for access under the Act to non-personal records will be processed by specially designated staff in headquarters.  Staff are also being designated to consider applictions for review of decisions made by the freedom of information officers.  These arrangements involved some reallocation of work within the offices but the question as to whether additional resources will need to be allocated will depend on experience with regard to the implementation of the legislation in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> All officers who will process requests under the Act are receiving specialised training on what is involved and specific resources have been allocated for this training within the Department's administration budget.  In addition, all other staff of my Department will be briefed on the provisions of the freedom of information legislation and the arrangements for dealing with requests for access to records.</P>
    <P>Implementation of freedom of information requires appropriate records management and request tracking systems to be put into place. Development of the Department's computer systems to cater for this requirement is under way.</P>
    <P>An information leaflet explaining the arrangements for obtaining access to social welfare records is being published and will be available to members of the public.  We are also publishing, as required by the Act, a guide to the functions and information held by my Department as well as information on the internal rules and practices used by my officials in making decisions on entitlements.</P>
    <P>The co-ordination of the arrangements for implementing the legislation was assigned to the decisions advisory unit in the Department.  This unit was set up in 1992 to monitor and advise on the quality of decisions and information on social welfare claims.  Within the last 9 months four additional staff were assigned to the decisions advisory office to work full-time on the freedom of information project.</P>

      <P>My Department delivers a wide range of services and supports aimed at enabling individuals, families and communities to participate in society in a positive way.  We have responded in the past to evidence that there have been instances of apparent lack of take up of particular schemes and have taken steps as appropriate to rectify the situation.  Due to the demandled nature of our schemes it is difficult at any moment in time to predict the expected take up levels with certainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department recognises that a proactive approach to the provision of timely, accurate and relevant information on its wide range of schemes and services is vital to ensure that those who have entitlements take them up.  The provision of information is a primary service of my Department and is being closely examined as part of my Department's ongoing development of customer service under the stategic management initiative <Col N="764" /> process.  It is a central element of my Department's customer action plan 1998-99.</P>
    <P>Consultation is the key to understanding the needs and expectations of customers.  This consultation includes carrying out customer surveys, creating customer panels and liaising with the voluntary and community sector.  In addition, co-operation between my Department and other organisations has greatly assisted in the identification and addressing of specific information needs.  This has led to the production of comprehensive information guides for lone parents, the unemployed, employers, pensioners and emigrants.</P>
    <P>Information on my Department's schemes and services is available from the network of 57 social welfare local offices.  Staff at these offices provide detailed information on the full range of services available.</P>
    <P>My Department takes a pro-active approach to targeting possible future beneficiaries of our schemes and services.  An example is that all persons receiving social welfare benefits are notified of their potential entitlement to retirement or old age (contributory) pension some three months before the pension becomes due at age 65 and 66 years respectively.</P>
    <P>Through its agency, the National Social Service Board, the Department promotes and supports the development of independent advice and advocacy services throughout the country.  These complement and enhance the information services provided at local and central level by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to examine further ways of addressing this issue so that the maximum takeup of my Department's schemes is achieved by; further developing the information service so that it is more pro-active, comprehensive and responsive, and participating in initiatives aimed at the Development of an integrated approach to the provision of services, particularly information, at a local level.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> In 1994 special arrangements were introduced designed to ensure that homemakers do not suffer a loss of pension entitlement because of time spent full time at home looking after a child, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
    <P>From 6 April 1994, time spent working in the home rearing young children up to 6 years of age or caring for incapacitated people is disregarded for the purpose of calculating the yearly average condition in determining entitlement to contributory old age pension.  The 1996 Social Welfare Act provided for an increase in the age of children being cared for from 6 to 12 years and this improvement was effective from the contribution year 1995-96.  A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded. It is estimated that up to 250,000 people could qualify for disregards under this arrangement.</P>
    <P>From November 1997 new <i>pro-rata</i> pensions were introduced so that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time qualify for an old age (contributory) pension.  A yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between 10 and 14 gives a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  To qualify a person also needs to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions.</P>
    <P>This measure will be of benefit to many women who have gaps in their PRSI records due to working in the home looking after a child, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.</P>
    <P>The general question of pension provision (both social welfare and occupational), arises for consideration in the context of the national pensions policy initiative.  A report from the Pensions Board, including recommendations, is expected in the next few months.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment in the action programme, I will keep the current arrangements under review.</P>

      <Quest>if he will amend the 24 hour care rule in regard to eligibility for a carer's allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention, and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of last December, 10,330 people were in receipt of a carer's allowance at a cost of over £36 million in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its introduction in 1990, the allowance has been improved and expanded progressively over the years.  As announced in the budget, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance is <Col N="766" /> being increased from next June by £5, from £70.50 to £75.50 for those over the age of 66, and £3 for carers under 66 from £70.50 to £73.50.</P>
    <P>I have recently reviewed the operation of the condition whereby the carer is required to provide the care recipient with full-time care and attention and have decided to adopt a more flexible approach.  Carers may now attend educational or training courses or participate in voluntary or community-based activities for around ten hours per week provided the carer makes adequate provision for the care recipient in his/her absence.  These new arrangements come into effect immediately.</P>
    <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit; and to increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.</P>
    <P>In line with these commitments, an overall review of the carer's allowance is being carried out within my Department.  This review is considering the purpose and development of the scheme, both in terms of its current operation and its future development.  It will also examine the potential for the development of provision for carers through the social insurance system and the role of the private sector.  The review is expected to be completed by the middle of this year and it will be published.</P>

      <P>Free travel is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, and also to certain people with disabilities under that age.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services. At end of last January, about 505,000 people qualified for free travel at an annual cost of £33 million.</P>
      <P>Free travel companion passes have been available since 1990 to persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone.  The free travel companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, the companion passes are available to the following main groups: recipients of blind person's pension and all blind people who are registered with the National Council/League of the Blind; recipients of disability allowance who are medically certified that they are unfit to travel alone; recipients of invalidity pension who are medically certified that they are permanently <Col N="767" /> wheelchair bound; and persons receiving care from a carer who is in receipt of a carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>As announced in the budget, a person aged 75 years, or over, who is medically certified as unfit to travel alone will qualify, for a companion free travel pass.  In addition, all carers in receipt of a carer's allowance will qualify for a free travel pass in their own right.  These measures will come into effect in September.</P>
    <P>Any further extension of the free travel companion pass to allow companions to travel alone would have control and cost implications which would have to be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In its first report the ministerial task force recommended that my Department examine ways in which the Community Development Programme administered by my Department might be used to assist communities in the priority areas cope with the drugs problem.</P>
      <P>The basis of the Community Development Programme is to develop personal and community capacity building measures by funding specific projects.  The programme is being used to assist communities in the local drugs task force areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> All but one of these areas now has a CDP project. The projects are designed to help communities cope with aspects of disadvantage, including the problems of drugs.</P>
    <P>In addition, the majority of the task force areas have a money advice and budgeting service project, which was set up by my Department in conjunction with the credit union movement to tackle the problems of moneylending and indebtedness. Funding is also provided in these areas for locally based self-help and personal development groups under my Department's scheme of grants for voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>The question of how the Community Development Programme might play a more direct role in the drugs area was looked at and arising from this a project was agreed with the Dublin citywide drugs crisis campaign.  Following on this a specialist support agency was set up to provide advice to the community development projects on how to respond to the drug problem in their areas, including co-operation with the statutory agencies.</P>
    <P>In recent years my Department has piloted ten projects aimed at providing supports to families dealing with disadvantage.  This year the programme has been established as the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme and up to 25 additional projects will be established in 1998.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention that the Combat Poverty Agency's current strategic plan commits the agency to contributing to and complementing current efforts at both local and national level to address the drugs problem.  As part of a broader programme of work in relation to drugs the agency has developed a grant scheme specifically aimed at enchancing the contribution of local groups to policy making in this area.</P>

      <P>Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years, or over, and also to certain people with disabilities under that age.  The other schemes of free electricity allowance, free colour television licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition.  In addition, widows and widowers between the age of 60 and 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> In 1996 the free schemes were extended to all low income pensioners, including retired public servants, who did not qualify because they were not in receipt of a social welfare pension.  The weekly income limit that is applied for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age (contributory) pension currently £78 per week, plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.</P>
    <P>Any further extension of the free schemes, to include public servants not qualified under current conditions, would have financial implications which could only be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

I understand that since May 1996, regulations oblige the local authorities to compile a register of landlords in their respective areas, with the aim of ensuring that the premises rented out by them comply with standards and criteria set down in regulations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government's programme identifies &ldquo;maximum co-ordination of housing policy under one Department&rdquo; as a key policy priority.  In this regard, an inter-departmental committee is examining the implications of transferring the administration of rent and mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to local authorities.  The committee operates under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, with representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Finance.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the committee will report shortly.  When the committee's report is received, consideration will undoubtedly arise in relation to the role of local authorities and health boards in the State's involvement in the private sector rental market.</P>
      <P>It would be my intention at that stage to consider the matter, including the need for any legislative changes that might be required, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>I would also refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 17 of today which addresses issues raised in my meeting with Mr. Tony Worthington MP, whose responsibilities include that of the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>One of the main outcomes of the further development of relations between my Department and its Northern Irish counterpart will be increased exchanges at official level on both policy and operational matters.  My Department has comprehensive information on the social security system in Northern Ireland and in the United Kingdom as a whole and this is taken into account in developing policy here.  I am keen however, that officials of both Departments discuss and evaluate how various policies and administrative priorities and procedures operate in practice, through direct exchanges between them.  This will be particularly beneficial and I am confident that as a result of the increased co-operation set in train following my meeting with the Minister Mr. Worthington, that this will take place to a much greater extent in the future.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent report from the National Rehabilitation Board which suggested that most people with disabilities had to rely on help from relatives and friends to get by and more than one third have to borrow to meet every day costs; the steps, if any, he will take to improve the level of disability benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent report published by the National Rehabilitation Board, &ldquo;Costs of Disability Study &mdash; 2&rdquo;, is a useful addition to the limited research available in relation to the income position of people with disabilities. Its findings reflect the main conclusions of the ESRI's study on poverty in the 1990s, which found that, even before their special needs are taken into account, people with disabilities face a high risk of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, caution should be taken in drawing generalised conclusions from the NRB study. This is the second report published by the NRB based on a study undertaken in 1993-4 on the living standards and lifestyles of a small number of people with disabilities &mdash; 59.  Those selected for participation in the study were identified by the NRB as having a below average financial position. In addition, the study only looks at the <Col N="771" /> income position of the individual with a disability and does not take account of the overall household income position.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to overhauling the means by which the State supports the incomes of people with disabilities.  In this regard, I am pleased to let the Deputy know that the Government has fulfilled one of the main recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in relation to income support, namely, that the rates of payment recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare (CSW) should be achieved as a matter of priority. As a result of the improvements provided for in this year's budget, all payments to people with disabilities will be above the rates recommended by the CSW, ranging between 101 per cent to 118 per cent.</P>
    <P>The NRB study highlights the fact that low employment rates lead to higher levels of poverty and social exclusion among people with disabilities. In this regard, significant progress has been made by my Department in recent years in relation to the employment and educational supports being provided for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>For example, the back to work allowance scheme, under which unemployed people can take up employment and continue to retain a portion of their social welfare payment and the related secondary benefits has been extended to people with disabilities.  This measure complements the existing employment supports which are available through the NRB and which are of particular importance to people with disabilities in gaining access to the open labour market.</P>
    <P>However, it is accepted that many people with disabilities are not in a position to engage in such employment.  Accordingly, additional measures have been taken to facilitate these people so that they can engage in other forms of employment and training, such as sheltered or rehabilitative employment.  In this regard, the 1998 budget provided for a significant increase, from £36.30 to £50, in the amount of earnings from rehabilitative employment which can be disregarded for means test purposes in the case of the disability allowance and blind person's pension schemes.</P>
    <P>The 1998 budget also provides for an extension of the back to education programme to people with disabilities.  Under this programme, people with disabilities will be entitled to an allowance of £150 towards the cost of books and related expenses from September.</P>
    <P>The study also found that many people with disabilities encountered additional costs which were specifically associated with their disabilities. The NRB has accordingly, called for the introduction of a £30 per week costs of disability payment.</P>
    <P>One of the principal recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is for the introduction of a costs of disability payment.  In this regard, the commission recommended that the Department of Health <Col N="772" /> and Children should introduce a variable costs of disability payment, which would meet the costs incurred where services are not or cannot be provided.  This recommendation is currently being examined by the interdepartmental task force, which is preparing the Government's plan of action in response to the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a £30 a week costs of disability payment on the lines porposed by the NRB would have substantial cost implications, costing, aproximately, £150 million in a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare argued that two people living together, especially couples, are financially interdependent as all of the main living costs such as housing, fuel and household goods are shared and there are economies of scale involved.  In this regard, the commission recommended that the rates of payment for adult dependants (now qualified adults) should be set at 60 per cent of the basic payment for a single person.</P>
      <P>The CSW's approach in relation to the payment rates for qualified adults has, in general, been adopted by successive Governments and it is also the one which I have followed in this year's budget.  The increased qualified adult allowance rates, which will be payable from the beginning of June, will range between 56 per cent to 69 per cent of the respective personal rates, with the majority of rates at 58.4 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the emphasis in relation to rates increases in recent years has been to concentrate resources on moving towards the minimum personal rate recommended by the CSW.  The increases being provided in this year's budget will mean that the personal rates of payment for 94 per cent of social welfare recipients will be above the CSW recommended rates.</P>
      <P>However, the appropriateness of the 1.6 equivalence scale, as recommended by the CSW, has been questioned by a number of commentators. The expert group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems, in examining this issue, recommended that further research should be carried out on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, the interdepartmental working group, which is currently examining the treatment of one and two-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, is looking at the existence of the concept of &ldquo;qualified adult&rdquo; in the social welfare payment system, with particular reference to individualisation of payments.  One of the group's <Col N="773" /> specific terms of reference is to carry out research on equivalence scales.  The ESRI has been commissioned by the group to undertake this research and it is expected that its findings will be available in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The working group will be reporting to me later in the year and I expect that their report will be of considerable assistance in formulating future policy in this difficult area.</P>

      <P>Providing a special pension supplement for certain categories of widows, and I presume widowers, as suggested by the Deputy, would have cost implications and therefore could only be considered in a budgetary context. The Deputy's proposal might also raise equity issues as, for example, certain widows or widowers who are not in employment could have other income sources, for example, an occupational pension while others would not.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that recipients of widow's and widower's pension may also receive half rate unemployment benefit or disability benefit in addition to widow's or widower's pension, for a maximum period of 390 days if they meet the conditions for these payments.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as an encouragement to long-term unemployed people to return to the active labour force.  Since then, over 33,600 people who were previously long-term unemployed, or lone parents, have availed of the allowance to, take up new jobs as either employees or self employed persons.  Of that number, approximately 3,350 people have completed the full three year cycle of support provided by the back to work allowance.</P>
      <P>A detailed consultant's evaluation of the back to work allowance was published by me late last year.  This report forecast a success rate of 60 per cent for self-employed participants and 39 per cent for employed participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The indications from experience of the scheme to date are that it is a very worthwhile scheme <Col N="774" /> in terms of enabling people who are long-term unemployed to make the break into employment or self-employment which is sustainable.  A preliminary survey conducted last year of those who had completed the three year cycle found that 85 per cent were still off the live register six months after the allowance ceased.  A further evaluation of the scheme with particular reference to those who did and did not complete the three year cycle is planned for later this year.</P>

      <P>I understand that due to the scope and nature of the issues involved the finalisation of the report of the Commission on the Family has taken longer than expected. However, I expect to receive the report shortly and I intend to submit it to Government with a view to publication as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the commission that the report contains a comprehensive analysis of issues affecting families.  The recommendations will provide the basis for the development of an integrated family policy to strengthen and assist families in coping with change and to put in place the supports to help prevent family breakdown. In addition, the commission has undertaken some original and significant research work which will be of benefit to analysts and policy makers, including a national survey of the child care arrangements which families make, sociological research on fathers and their role in family life and an overview of family policy in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The commission brought forward some aspects of the final report for consideration in the context of preparations for the 1998 budget.  In response to the commission's recommendations, the Government has provided significant allocations for the development of family services in my Department in 1998 including: &mdash; £700,000 for a network of family and community services resource centres (25 centres in 1998), an extra £600,000 for marriage counselling services bringing the total provision in 1998 to £1.5 million and an extra £600,000 for the family mediation service for the establishment of additional centres towards the development of a national service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a new family affairs unit is being established to co-ordinate family policy, pursue the findings in the commission's final report following their consideration by the Government, undertake research and promote awareness about family issues.  The unit will have responsibility for a number of family services including: support for <Col N="775" /> the marriage and child counselling services, the Family Mediation Service, a pilot programme in relation to the local offices of the Department building on the one-stop-shop concept with the aim of providing improved support at local level to families and an information programme on parenting issues.</P>

      <P>The social welfare appeals process is quasi-judicial and the procedures which are applied are designed to ensure that every appeal gets full and adequate consideration.  There is an inevitable time lag in such a process.  In some cases an additional delay may arise because of difficulty in obtaining all of the information required by the appeals officer.</P>
      <P>In some cases appeals can be dealt with on the basis of the information supplied by the appellant and by the deciding officer without recourse to an oral hearing.  Where an oral hearing is required, however, an additional delay is inevitable.</P>
      <P>The number of appeals received by the social welfare appeals office in 1997 amounted to approximately 14,000, an increase of over 1,800 on 1996.  The average time taken to process all of the appeals dealt with during 1997 was 22 weeks.</P>
      <P>Four additional appeals officers were appointed during the second half of 1997, bringing the total number of appeals officers to 14. This has brought about an improvement in the processing time for appeals so far this year.</P>
      <P>The provision of a prompt service is a major objective of the social welfare appeals office.  At all times it is necessary to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner that is consistent with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>

      <P>My Department places strong emphasis on recycling paper and the conservation of resources.  All of our paper waste is recycled.  Envelopes emanating from external sources are reused for internal circulation and there is also extensive use of standard circulation envelopes within the Department. In addition, we encourage the use of electronic communications and double-sided photocopying, all of which reduces paper usage.  It is my understanding that, although the bodies under the aegis of my Department make their own housekeeping arrangements, they take a similar approach to recycling.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 44 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The overseas tourism and travel statistics published by the Central Statistics Office historically cover (i) the number of visits to Ireland by persons who are usually resident overseas &mdash; Irish residents returning from visits abroad are excluded; and (ii) the number of visits abroad by Irish residents.  For visits abroad by Irish residents, no information is requested on the individual country of destination.</P>
      <P>For visitors to Ireland, the geographical area breakdown available includes Africa as a whole but not individual countries within Africa.  Thus, the requested statistics on Egypt are not available from the Central Statistics Office.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Employment Regulation Order (Catering Joint Labour Committee), 1997 made by the Labour Court on 19 August 1997 minimum rates of pay and other terms and conditions of employment are prescribed for workers employed in catering establishments anywhere throughout the State except in the areas known, until 1 January 1994, as the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>A catering establishment as defined in the ERO includes &ldquo;a premises primarily used for supplying for reward to any persons, not for the time being resident on the premises, food or food and drink for consumption on the premises.  .&rdquo; The ERO requires that a notice of it must be displayed in a prominent place &ldquo;so as to ensure that the details therein shall be brought to the knowledge of and can be conveniently read by all those workers affected by it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was established in the course of the last inspection of the premises in question by the labour inspectorate of my Department that the primary business of the premises was the supply of take-away food and food and drinks.  The premises was not, therefore, covered by the terms of the ERO and was not therefore required to display the notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inspections of premises covered by the ERO are carried out on an ongoing basis.  If it is determined in the course of a future inspection that the nature of the business carried out on the premises in question has changed to the extent that it is now covered by the ERO and that the <Col N="780" /> owner has failed to display the relevant notice, my Department will take such steps as may be necessary to ensure full compliance with the ERO.</P>

      <P>Requirements relating to tyres fitted to new motor vehicles and their trailers are set out in Council Directive 92/23/EEC of 31 March 1992 (O.  J. No. L 129 of 14.5.1992), which is implemented in Irish law by the European Communities (Motor Vehicles Type Approval) (No. 2) Regulations, 1997, [S.  I. No. 476 of 1997].  The EU Commission has recently submitted a proposal to Council which is aimed at limiting the noise generated by the contact between tyres in motion and road surfaces (O.  J. No. C 30 of 28/1/98).</P>
      <P>The Industrial Research and Standards (Section 44) (Retreaded Passenger Car and Commercial Vehicle Tyres) Order, 1989, (S.  I. No. 254 of 1989) prohibits the manufacture, assembly or sale of retreaded passenger car or commercial vehicle tyres unless they comply with the requirements of Irish Standard 412:1988.  Retreaded tyres which comply with the standard of other European Union member states are also acceptable provided that such standards guarantee a level of safety and reliability which is equivalent to IS 412:1988.</P>
      <P>These are the only legal requirements and proposed EU amendments relating to tyres of which my Department is aware and which fall under its aegis.  I understand that there are other requirements relating to tyres for which my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is responsible and on which I understand he will be providing a separate response to a similar Dáil question tabled by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In sourcing its overall paper needs for printing and general use, my Department ensures that a proportion of this requirement is fulfilled by the purchase and use of recycled paper.  Staff are encouraged to reuse and recycle paper where possible.  In addition, my <Col N="781" /> Department sends a considerable quantity of waste paper for recycling by specialist firms.  In relation to envelopes, all general purpose envelopes purchased have a very high recycled content. Envelopes used for internal distribution throughout the Department are specifically designed for long-term reuse.</P>
      <P>As regards the agencies under the aegis of my Department, this would be a day to day matter for those bodies and one in which I have no function.</P>

      <P>I wish to acknowledge the major contribution of county enterprise boards to the development of micro-enterprise and job creation since their establishment in 1993.  During the period 1993-97, some 8,000 projects have been assisted and over 11,000 jobs have been created.</P>
      <P>Our Department is now engaged in consultations with enterprise boards to elicit their views on how the momentum of micro-project development and job creation can be sustained beyond the year 1999, when the EU Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development will come to an end.  We are absolutely satisfied that the county and city enterprise boards have a very positive role to play in continuous job creation at local level.</P>

      <P>Under European Union fleet policy, member states' fishing fleets are constrained by decisions taken in the context of fleet Multi Annual Guidance Programmes.  Against this background, sea fishing boat licensing policy is designed to maintain strict control on proposed introductions of vessels into the fleet.</P>
      <P>Under current licensing policy, a licence may only be approved where an applicant removes capacity from the sea fishing boat register equal to that of the proposed new vessel.  Only vessels entered on the current sea fishing boat register are acceptable as replacement capacity.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has proposed a vessel as replacement capacity which was never entered on the current sea fishing boat register and, consequently, it is not acceptable as replacement capacity.  The position was explained to him by letter dated 19 September 1996 and the position was subsequently also explained in a written reply on 4 March 1997.  To date, however, the person concerned has not been in contact again with the Department.</P>
      <P>A licence may not be granted to the individual until there is compliance with licensing policy requirements in relation to the withdrawal of replacement capacity.</P>

      <P>I have recently announced proposals for a package of new measures to develop the white fish fleet.  These proposals include a plan for a capital grant aid scheme for new white fish vessels.  Specific details of the terms of the scheme are under consideration.  I have also secured in the recent Finance Bill special tax based reliefs to encourage capital into the white fish fleet.</P>
      <P>These proposals which are designed to be consistent with State aid parameters will be submitted to the EU Commission in the near future.  I am confident that the proposed reliefs and Capital Grant Programme will enable the industry to set about the challenge of renewal with the aim of securing the safety, competitiveness and long-term future of the fleet.  I expect to be in a position to announce details of the new grant scheme, which I am proposing, at an early date.</P>

      <P>At a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference held in Dublin on 5 March 1998, I availed of the opportunity to discuss the forthcoming marching season and the recent appointments to the Parades Commission with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Parades Commission has now been established on a statutory basis.  I raised the negative reaction in the nationalist community to the recent appointments to the commission.  I believe, however, that the commission can still play a useful and constructive role if it succeeds in securing the confidence and support of both communities.  It must, in particular, approach its task in an even-handed way and be seen to be fair and impartial in its decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government continues to believe that local agreement is the best way of resolving the problems surrounding contentious parades.  I hope this year the people of Northern Ireland will be spared the trauma which has accompanied the marching season in recent years.  I will closely monitor developments on the parades issue in the weeks and months ahead. <Col N="789" /></P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs makes reusable internal circulation envelopes available and encourages all officials to use these for distributing internal mail.  The vast majority of envelopes used by the Department contain between 70 and 85 per cent recycled pulp depending on the particular envelope.  A substantial quantity of the Department's waste paper is converted to pulp and recycled.</P>
      <P>The bodies under the aegis of the Department are the Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO), the Refugee Agency, the National Committee for Development Education (NCDE) and the Irish Aid Advisory Committee (IAAC). These bodies actively encourage staff to recycle paper products where possible and to be economical in the use of stationery.</P>
      <P>The Department is committed, wherever practicable, to increasing the use of recycled paper and is currently testing the latter on its range of office equipment.</P>

      <P>The UK, in its capacity as President of the Council of the European Union, had a meeting of EU <Col N="790" /> member states in London on 25 and 26 February 1998.  The meeting discussed issues relating to the forthcoming Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries scheduled to be held in Rome from 15 June to 17 July 1998.  The diplomatic conference is being convened to finalise and adopt a convention on the establishment of an international criminal court and to discuss aspects of the current draft convention.  Representatives of all EU member states attended the meeting.  Ireland was represented by two officials.</P>
      <P>While all member states have individual national policies in relation to the proposed court, EU co-ordination meetings are held in order to allow member states to exchange views and information and, where it is possible and useful, to co-ordinate their approach to the process leading to the establishment of a court.</P>
      <P>The meeting in London proved useful as it afforded EU member states an opportunity to exchange views on a number of issues, in particular in relation to organisational aspects of the diplomatic conference and the advancement of negotiations at the next meeting of the preparatory committee on the establishment of the court, which will be held in New York from 16 March to 3 April 1998.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, she has to bring about the reduction in the price of natural gas in order that Bord Gáis is able to compete when the gas service structures are deregulated.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann already operates in a highly competitive market and sells natural gas in competition with other fuels.  The price of gas moves in line with world energy prices.  Gas is and will have to remain competitive with other fuels if it is to retain its market share.  BGE has been very successful in coping with this competition and natural gas now accounts for some 20 per cent of our total primary energy requirement.</P>
      <P>The key driver of change in the Irish gas industry in future will be the liberalisation of the natural gas market with the introduction of third party access to the gas network.  The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995, provides for the introduction of this new form of competition. Firms consuming more than a specified volume of gas will have the option of purchasing their gas supplies from sources other than BGE and to have the gas transmitted through the BGE network on commercial terms.  This form of competition is foreshadowed in a draft EU directive concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas.</P>
      <P>The 1995 Act empowers me to give general directives to BGE on standard service transmission and on standard service pricing.  In exercise of those powers, I am drafting directives designed to ensure that BGE's charges for third party access to the gas network are fair and reasonable, while at the same time providing BGE with an adequate return on its investment. I will publish the draft directives for comments shortly.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the new competition, BGE is engaged in an efficiency and cost reduction programme and is in negotiation with staff and unions on systems and work practices.</P>
      <P>The increased competition arising from these measures should lead to a reduction in gas prices. Low energy costs and high end use efficiency are essential ingredients for the competitiveness of the economy.</P>

      <P>Section 9 of the Radiological Protection <Col N="797" /> Act, 1991 allows for the extension, by way of ministerial order, of the role of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to cover issues relating to non-ionising radiation.  At present, however, responsibility for issues relating to emissions of non-ionising radiation from communications masts rests with the director of Telecommunications Regulation and I see no reason to amend this position.</P>
      <P>The director, I understand, is putting in place, at present, a comprehensive system audit of such emissions, which will include measurements at a number of sites in order to ensure that licence conditions are being complied with by operators. A copy of the statement issued by the director last week has been sent for the Deputy's information.</P>
      <P>On the question of the safety guidelines operating in Ireland, much work is being carried out internationally on this issue and I propose to await the outcome of this work.  The facts in this research are as follows:</P>
      <P>In 1996 a major review of the health issues raised by non-ionising electromagenetic radiation was carried out by the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection &mdash; who are advisers to the World Health Organisation on such matters.  The report concluded that there is no substantive evidence of adverse health effects from exposure to levels of non-ionising radiation at levels at or below those set in 1988 by the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA).</P>
      <P>The IRPA guidelines are applied in Ireland through the licences held by mobile telephony and MMDS operators.  It is a matter for the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to ensure compliance with these requirements.</P>
      <P>Further research in this area has been proposed recently in a report commissioned by the European Commission and my Department will be monitoring international developments and, as necessary, participating in the comprehensive programmes of research being undertaken to ensure that the most up-to-date standards are applied to emissions in this country.</P>

      <P>The introduction of a radon remediation grant scheme to assist householders in undertaking radon remediation works on their dwellings has, for some time now, been under consideration in my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and other interested Departments.  However, in the light of Exchequer commitments and overall budgetary constraints, it is not possible to make provision for such a scheme this year.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the need to promote awareness of the health risks associated with long-term exposure to high levels of radon in dwellings and action is being taken on a number of fronts to tackle this problem.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) is continuing to concentrate resources on a national radon survey which is aimed at identifying areas at greatest risk of high indoor radon levels.  The institute's survey, which has been carried out in respect of 19 counties to date, is due for completion this year.  Independent of this survey, the institute provides, for a small fee, a radon measurement service to householders who wish to determine radon levels in their homes.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government also recently published revised technical guidance documents relating to the consolidated national building regulations 1997.  The guidance calls for radon protection measures to be taken in the building of all new houses commencing on or after 1 July 1998.  More elaborate radon protection is specified for new houses situated in high radon areas i.e., where the RPII surveys indicate that more than 10 per cent of houses exceed the national reference level of 200 becquerals per cubic metre.</P>
      <P>Householders can also avail of a booklet published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government entitled &ldquo;Radon in Buildings&rdquo; which provides advice to householders and builders on preventative and remedial measures &mdash; which can be undertaken in new and existing buildings to reduce high radon concentrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that while the Government is not in a position to provide direct financial assistance to householders in the current year, every effort is being made in the <Col N="799" /> form of the practical measures which I have referred to above to address the problem of high radon concentrations.</P>

      <P>While prices over the past two years in the sheep sector generally have been at record levels, it is the case that in recent months prices for hoggets and cull ewes have been relatively low.  This is due to a large extent on the overhang of lamb in the market and, in particular, the UK.</P>
      <P>In response to representations which I made to the EU Commission, a scheme of aid for private storage has been agreed by the Sheepmeat Management Committee on 6 March.  The objective of this scheme is to take up to 150,000 1997 season lambs off the market in Ireland and the UK over the next six weeks.  This should allow the market to regain equilibrium before the 1998 season spring lambs become available.  I am confident that this measure, if fully availed of by the factories, will play a significant part in restoring market confidence to the sector.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of 1997 I sanctioned an additional £2.5 million in extra headage payments to assist sheep producers in disadvantaged areas.  These supplementary payments should help to compensate hill sheep farmers for the lower prices they received from the market in 1997.</P>
      <P>I have also established a forum representative of the industry as a whole to examine the wider challenges facing the sector, including the production and marketing patterns best suited to our conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>A computerised database entitled CMMS (Cattle Movement Monitoring System) is being established as part of the national beef assurance scheme (NBAS).  This is a major computer system development which, when implemented, will involve the notification to the Department of all bovine animal events, such as birth, intra-herd transfer, movement through a mart, slaughter, export, for entry on to the database.</P>
      <P>A birth notification and registration system is already operational.  Work is continuing on creating and putting into operation the other parts of CMMS.  The aim is to maximise the use of electronic means of data transfer particularly in relation to marts, meat factories, abattoirs and live export points.  Over the coming months the intention is to have communication links and PCs installed at those locations and piloting, training and implementation will be tackled.</P>
      <P>As regards inter-farm movements of animals, it is the intention to require both of the herdowners involved to report the movement details.  The Department is in the process of assessing tenders with a view to appointing a commercial agency to operate the farm movement notification arrangements, including the recording of the data ready for entry to the CMMS.</P>
      <P>Side by side with these arrangements the CMMS computer system itself has to be developed and implemented.  The system will be delivered on a mainframe computer located at the Department's headquarters.  The principal development task is the creation of the necessary computer programmes.  In that regard the Department is about to commence an EU request for tenders procedure for the delivery of the computer programmes.  It is estimated that the computer programmes will be delivered to the Department by late 1998.  Implementation will commence as and when the computer programmes are available and the aim is to have CMMS operational by year's end.</P>
      <P>The throughput of the system will be determined by the rate of animal births, slaughtering and exports, and the many millions of annual movements between herds and via marts.  In addition, the system will include animal location information at time of premium or headage application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The precise staffing needs for overall operational control within the Department have yet to be determined.  The costs of setting up the CMMS under NBAS will be met by the Exchequer.  A sum of £6.5 million is provided in my Department's <Col N="804" /> 1998 Vote for NBAS.  Other parties will be required to bear part of the running costs of the system when it is operational.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 128 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>The number of reactors which have been removed from herds under the bovine TB eradication scheme from 1960 to the end of 1997 is 1,657,353.  Statistics for the period prior to 1960 are not available.  The visible lesion rate varies from year to year but on average is about 33 per cent.</P>
      <P>The tuberculin test is the standard test prescribed in EU legislation for TB and the one accepted by all our trading partners.  The fact that visible lesions are not evident in reactor animals on post mortem does not mean that the disease is not present.  Instead the presence of visible lesions would indicate that the disease progressed to a slightly more advanced stage.  The results of post mortem examinations are forwarded to nominated veterinary practitioners of the herd owners.</P>

      <P>Under the Livestock Marts Regulations, 1968 (S.  I. No. 251 of 1968), it is the responsibility of the marts to ensure that livestock required by or under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, to be accompanied at the time of sale by a specified document are not accepted for sale at the mart unless the required document is produced by the owner of the livestock to the licensee of the mart at the time of such acceptance.  Officials of my Department are routinely present at livestock marts to monitor the implementation of animal health and livestock mart regulations.</P>

      <P>There was no commitment given by my Department that officials would attend an IFA public meeting on sheepmeat in Portlaoise on 25 February.  The position is that the IFA did not invite my officials to attend this meeting until Monday 23 February.  Because of other commitments it was not possible at that late stage to provide a speaker to attend the meeting.  I should point out that there were comprehensive discussions on the problems of the sheepmeat sector on Wednesday 25 February at the first meeting of the Sheepmeat Forum which, of course, included representatives of my Department and the farming organisations.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the current market difficulties in the sheepmeat sector which are due to a large extent on the overhang of lamb on the market, particularly in the UK.  In response to representations which I made to the EU Commission, a scheme of aid for private storage was agreed by the Sheepmeat Management Committee on 6 March.  The objective of this scheme is to take up to 150,000 1997 season lambs off the market in Ireland and the UK over the next six weeks.  This should allow the market to regain equilibrium before the 1998 season spring lambs become available.  I am confident that this measure, if fully availed of by the factories, will play a significant part in restoring market confidence to the sector.</P>

      <P>Apart from the plants referred to in my reply to Question No. 178 of 17 December 1997 the following plants were also used for the slaughter of herds where BSE cases were confirmed in counties Roscommon, Leitrim, Donegal and Sligo: UMP Ballyhaunis; UMP Ballaghadereen; Western Meats, Dromond; Glynn Meats, Limerick.</P>
      <P>My reply of 17 December also gave details of the dates of confirmation of BSE cases and the number of animals slaughtered in the herds involved, in the counties referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that meat from suspect or confirmed BSE animals has never been allowed into the human food or animal feed chains.  Prior to March 1996, and in the light of the scientific knowledge then available, it was not considered necessary to exclude the product from the other animals in a herd where a BSE case was confirmed, from the human food or animal feed chains.  However, from April 1996, all product from the entire herd in which a case of BSE is <Col N="814" /> confirmed is taken out of both the human food and animal feed chains and is dealt with on the basis already covered in replies to various parliamentary questions to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Meat from animals slaughtered up to March 1996 would have been sold on the home market. I do not have details of the type of animal feed produced.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 117, 118, 119 and 120 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two cases of BSE were confirmed in cattle on the Moorepark farm on 7 August 1997 and 1 September 1997 respectively.  Both were Friesian cows which were born in 1992 and 1993 on the farm.  The birth cohorts of these animals were either still in the herd at time of depopulation or as in accordance with my Department's policy, the birth cohorts and progeny of BSE affected animals, are identified, traced, slaughtered and destroyed.  Ten such cohorts relating to the herd have been identified and disposed of.  There is no evidence or suspicion of BSE in the herds to which cattle were sent from the Moorepark herd. The precise cause of the outbreak has not been definitely established but is believed that cross <Col N="817" /> contaminated feed may have been fed to the animals in the early years of their lives.</P>
    <P>Some 578 animals were slaughtered from the Moorepark herd, the valuation of which was £650,205.  The herd was slaughtered and the resultant product was dealt with on the basis outlined in my reply to Question No. 136 on 18 February 1998.</P>
    <P>The restocking of the Moorepark herd is a matter for the day-to-day management of Teagasc.</P>
    <P>Where a case of BSE is confirmed, it is the policy to slaughter all those cattle farmed under the herd number assigned to the farmer in question as well as any other cattle in the ownership of the farmer which are famed together or which may have been in direct contact with the infected animal. The cattle on the Ballyderown farm were farmed under a separate herd number from those on the Moorepark farm and were not in contact with the confirmed cases.</P>

      <P>Under EU legislation herds which are restricted and have their status suspended or withdrawn are scheduled for a check test for tuberculosis six months after their clearance test. In 1997 the six month check test revealed three times the rate of infection as the annual round test and should, therefore, be regarded as an important element of the eradication programme. Brucellosis testing at this six month interval is not normally carried out but may be undertaken in some of the southern counties where this disease is problematic and the timing of the tuberculin test is appropriate.</P>
      <P>The tuberculin test is the legal EU test for determination of infection.  The subsequent non-detection of infection at post mortem does not denote that an animal is clear of infection.</P>

    <P>Sums of £7 million and £4.05 million were allocated to the sector in the 1994-99 round of structural funding under, respectively, the Food Sub-Programme of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development and the Operation Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry.  Grant aided expenditure under these programmes enables producers to improve efficiency, reduce losses, market quality products, and extend the marketing season for the potato crop thereby reducing seasonal dependence on imports and improving competitiveness of Irish products.</P>

      <P>No applications were received in 1997 from the person named under the 1997 cattle headage or suckler cow schemes.  However, my Department, on foot of a certificate of posting, accepted a 1997 cattle headage application on 13 January 1998.  The person named listed an invalid tag number under this application and my Department wrote to him on 3 March 1998 and asked him to furnish the correct tag number.  The tag number supplied by him on 5 March in response to this request was also incorrect and <Col N="821" /> my Department has again been in contact with the person named on this matter.  Payment will issue when the matter is clarified.</P>

      <P>A submission to establish a new category of extremely disadvantaged areas in Ireland was formally presented to the EU Commission on 9 October 1996.  Subsequent to the submission, the Commission raised the issues of conservation and over-grazing in connection with the REPS and special areas of conservation.  They are concerned to ensure that proposals affecting the extent and classification of land in the disadvantaged areas do not have an adverse affect on areas which are being targeted by the REPS and SACs as requiring special attention.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Commission has made it clear that discussions relating to over-grazing and conservation must be concluded before proposals affecting disadvantaged areas can be finalised.  I will endeavour to ensure that the third tier proposal is dealt with as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The position is that payments under the various 1997 livestock headage and premium <Col N="824" /> schemes, which account for the majority of applications, do not conclude at the end of the calendar year.  Therefore it is not possible, as yet, to give the number of applications refused payment under the 1997 schemes.  For example, under the suckler cow premium scheme and the special beef premium scheme the regulations provide for advance payments commencing on 1 November of the year of application with balancing payments commencing in the following year.  Payment to applicants under the October 1997 suckler cow premium scheme cannot commence until such time as the six month retention period expires in April 1998.  Payment of the final instalment of the 1997 ewe premium commenced on 17 February 1998 in line with EU regulations.  Payment of 1997 extensification premium will be made automatically to eligible farmers in the period April-June 1998.  In so far as the disadvantaged areas' headage schemes are concerned every effort is made to make payment in full in the year of application.  The following table gives the percentage of applicants paid in County Galway under the various 1997 livestock headage and premia schemes:</P>

      <P>Despite the introduction of a series of measures in late summer 1997 to deal with the deteriorating brucellosis situation the number of brucellosis breakdowns continued to increase and by November 1997, it became clear that the number of herds restricted in accordance with EU rules would exceed 0.2 per cent of herds.  The relevant EU legislation requires that for herds to retain &ldquo;officially brucellosis free&rdquo; status, <i>inter alia,</i> all bought-in eligible cattle must have passed a pre-movement test within 30 days of movement if the percentage of herds infected is greater than 0.2 per cent.  Non-compliance with the directive would be detrimental to Ireland's ability to trade both in beef and dairy products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following extended discussions in the Animal Health Forum and separately with representatives of bodies on the forum in the course of which broad agreement was reached on the range of measures required, I announced the introduction of further measures on 6 February 1998.  The main elements are as follows: with effect from 23 February 1998, all female cattle and bulls being moved into or out of holdings, other than direct to a slaughter premises, must have passed a blood test within 30 days preceding the date of movement; in addition to the foregoing and from the same date, (i) bulls over 12 months and female cattle over 18 months of age may not be sold more than once, whether by public or private sale on foot of a brucellosis test and (ii) such cattle <Col N="826" /> being sold must be moved from the holding where tests are undertaken direct to either the purchaser's holding or direct to a mart and from their direct to the purchaser's holding; a full round of blood testing for all eligible cattle in 1998 to augment and complement existing arrangements including monthly milk ring testing; further enhancement of the eradication measures applying in certain areas, in particular the completion of a full round of blood testing of all eligible animals in these areas over the next two months; revamped administrative procedures in the Department's local offices to deal more effectively with herds with brucellosis reactors and those contiguous to such herds; arrangements to speed up the completion of blood tests and the improved notification of results; early removal of reactors and steps to improve detection of irregularities; increased epidemiological investigation by Department veterinary staff and a review of the epidemiology of brucellosis over recent years by the research investigation unit; an on-going and intensive awareness/advisory campaign to update farmers and others on farm husbandry and management practices to curtail the spread of brucellosis; the early introduction of further legislation on aspects relating to trading and tracing of cattle movements and on registration of all those engaged in trading cattle and a restructured and revamped compensation regime.</P>
    <P>I accept that the new requirements, particularly those relating to testing and the &lsquo;one-sale&rsquo; regime, will impose additional constraints on farmers and others.  At the same time, all parties involved in the negotiations accept the veterinary advice that these arrangements are essential at this time and have to be judged in the context of the potential threat to our beef and dairy trade if the threat of brucellosis is not curtailed.  These measures together with full use of current technology and good herd management practices if strictly observed and adhered to should redress the deteriorating brucellosis problem in cattle and thereby safeguard animal and public health and protect our trading position for livestock and livestock products.</P>

      <P>The calf processing scheme was introduced in 1993 on a voluntary basis.  However, in the context of the mini-reform of the beef regime in 1996, member states were required to implement either the calf processing scheme or an early marketing premium scheme for veal calves for the two years commencing in December 1996.  Four member states &mdash; Ireland, <Col N="827" /> France, the United Kingdom and Portugal &mdash; opted to implement the calf processing scheme. In view of the fact that there is no veal production in this country Ireland did not have any option but to implement the calf processing scheme.</P>
      <P>The objective of the two schemes was to divert approximately two million calves away from beef production during the two years when measures are in place.  The position is that approximately 1.125 million calves have been slaughtered under the calf processing scheme since 1 December 1996.  While some 1.8 million calves have been processed under the early marketing premium scheme for veal calves, the number of additional calves diverted away from the beef production is far lower because of the nature of the scheme. Nevertheless, there is good reason to believe that the overall objective of diverting two million calves away from beef production is on target.</P>
      <P>As I indicated earlier, the calf processing scheme and the early marketing scheme remain in place until next December.  After that date, unless they are extended by the Agriculture Council in the meantime, the calf processing scheme will revert to a voluntary scheme while the early marketing scheme will cease to operate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>The person named holds a ewe premium quota of 383 premium rights.  This quota was not withdrawn and provided he continues to use at least 70 per cent of that quota every year, as required under EU regulations, the question of forfeiting quota will not arise.  The person named holds a suckler cow quota of 30 premium rights.  Under EU regulations he is required to use at least 90 per cent of that quota every year, otherwise the part not used will be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.  The person named applied for the suckler cow premium scheme on 30 cows in May 1997 but payment was reduced to 19.1 cows because he exceeded the stocking density level of two livestock units per hectare.  As less than 90 per cent of his quota was used, he stood to forfeit 11.9 premium rights to the national reserve.</P>
      <P>I have, however, allowed him to retain his full quota of 30 premium rights on condition that he uses at least 90 per cent of the quota himself in 1998.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, over 134,000 farmers forwarded applications for area aid in 1997.  Of these, less than 15,000 have outstanding difficulties.  However, I would like to point out that under the terms of a rescheduling arrangement agreed with the European Commission, these farmers were paid their premium advances and their disadvantaged area grants.</P>
      <P>My Department is querying the farmers with these remaining difficulties and, where required, maps are being issued to those farmers to assist with these queries.  I expect that only a very small percentage of cases will remain to be resolved before the 1998 pre-printed applications are issued.  It is my Department's intention to priorities this small percentage of cases early in the processing of the 1998 area aid applications received from farmers.</P>

It is appreciated that herdowners in some areas may have some difficulties with the system because of the distance from the district veterinary office but there is provision in place for obtaining permits by post and at the marts in respect of cattle sold through the mart on the day or going for slaughter or export that evening.  The implementation of a computerised movement monitoring system which is currently being developed will obviate the need for the continuation of the female movement permit system. <Col N="831" /></P>

      <P>The milk quota restructuring scheme gives total priority to small scale producers, under 35,000 gallons.  Within this category, special provision is made for new entrants.  The new entrant category recognises not only those young farmers who wish to get into dairying but also young farmers already committed to dairying but whose quotas are below 20,000 gallons.  In the recently announced 1998 national milk restructuring scheme I increased the eligibility ceiling for the new entrant's category from 15,000 gallons to 20,000 gallons.  Special consideration is also given to young farmers with smaller milk quotas who apply to the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal for additional milk quota.</P>

      <P>The total of the combined individual suckler cow quotas established in 1992 is 1,100,834.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A table showing the number of applications paid, the amount paid and number of animals <Col N="832" /> paid under the suckler cow premium scheme for the years 1992 to 1997 follows.  It should be noted that 40 per cent balancing payments are currently issuing to May 1997 suckler cow applicants and that full payments to the October 1997 suckler cow premium applicants cannot commence until the end of April when the six month retention period has elapsed.</P>
    <P>A table showing the size and distribution of the national reserves from 1993 to 1997 also follows. There was no national reserve in 1992.  The EU regulations provide for the establishment of a national reserve from which quota rights are allocated free to priority categories of producers.  The priority categories to whom such rights are distributed are decided by me annually based on recommendations from the Quota Review Group made up of representatives of the main farming organisations, Teagasc, and my Department.  The reserve is made up of a percentage of premium rights transferred without the transfer of the holding and serves a repository for rights surrendered by producers who fail to use the required percentage of their quota in a given year.</P>

      <P>The special beef premium quota was established at 1.540 million head for Ireland in 1992.  This quota was reduced to 1.287 million rights in the context of the 1994-95 price fixing proposals.  Similar reductions were applied to all member states in order to eliminate excess quota rights and thereby reduce the incentive to increase beef production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the aftermath of the BSE scare in 1996, the Agriculture Council adopted a package of proposals to curb beef production and to provide compensation for income losses to beef producers arising from the scare.  Part of the package was to reduce the special beef premium quotas for 1997 and 1998 for all member states, with the exception of those where applications were already below the level of their existing quotas.  The quota for Ireland was fixed at 1.002 million <Col N="834" /> rights.  In the context of this year's annual price's proposals, the Commission has proposed that these quotas should be retained for 1999.  These proposals have not yet been adopted by Council.</P>

      <P>Ireland's national quota for special beef premium has, as stated by the Deputy, been reduced twice since it was first set at 1.540 million head in 1992.  The first reduction occurred in the 1994-95 price fixing proposals and saw a removal of some 250,000 surplus quota rights.  This reduction would not have affected Ireland's 1997 special beef premium payments as the total number of eligible animals was within the 1.286 million quota rights available. However, the second reduction, which arose from a decision by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in October 1996 cut Irelands, quota by approximately 285,000 rights to some 1,002,000 which will result in a reduced payment under the 1997 special beef premium and extensification premium. While definitive figures regarding the extent by which the October 1996 decision will reduce total 1997 payments will not be available before April 1998 at the earliest, indications at present are that the new, reduced, quota has been exceeded by some 6.5 per cent.  The level of payment of both ten and 22 month special beef premium, and extensification premium where relevant, will be reduced accordingly.</P>

      <P>The national ceiling for the special beef premium for 1997 and 1998 was fixed at 1,002 million premium rights in the context of the mini-reform of the beef regime agreed in 1996.  Unless this measure is extended, the ceiling will revert to 1.286 million premium rights from 1999 onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national ceiling for the special beef premium is based on applications for the ten month premium.  It is difficult to indicate precisely what level of national quota would be required in order to avoid a reduction in premium payments because this will depend on the volume of applications for the premium in future years. However, for a clawback to be avoided in the future, it would appear that the ceiling would need to be somewhat higher than the volume of applications submitted for the ten month premium in 1997, 1.089 million, in order to accommodate the higher number of breeding cows currently in the national herd. <Col N="835" /></P>

      <P>The package of measures to which the Deputy refers was announced in April 1997 prior to obtaining EU Commission approval.  The package which was finalised in November 1997 included a top-up of £2 per animal in respect of 22 month animals on which 1996 special beef premium was paid.  A total of 65,477 producers were paid £1.914 million in respect of 957,073 animals; a payment of £41.04 per animal in respect of male animals slaughtered in the period 1 April 1997 and 10 June 1997.  This was paid by way of a top-up on the 1997 slaughter premium and a total of 16,363 producers were paid £6.821 million in respect of 166,211 animals and a scheme for producers of finished heifers and finished male animals disposed of in the period 1 April 1997 to 10 June 1997.  A payment of £41.04 per male animal and £41.12 per female animal applied.  A total of 13,848 producers applied in respect of 102,982 animals of which 80,123 have been paid.  The reduction was due mainly to the fact that animals had to be in the ownership and possession of the applicant prior to 1 April 1997.  Almost 92 per cent of applicants were paid £3.294 million by 31 December 1997.  The relatively small number of producers who were not paid by that date had outstanding queries relating to their applications.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that £1.6 million will be sufficient to make payment in respect of those cases which had not established eligibility by 31 December 1997.  My Department has made arrangements for the funding of the amounts due and payment will issue in outstanding eligible cases as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As I announced yesterday, I have decided, in view of the delay in making 40 per cent balancing payments, to make a further advance payment of £27.05 per eligible animal or 30 per cent of the original rate for 1997.  The need for a further advance arises from a decision taken <Col N="836" /> by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in October 1996 to cut Ireland's national quota by approximately 285,000 head to some 1,002,000.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he proposes to take to address the 40 per cent cut in the 1997 ewe premium and its impact on sheep farmers' incomes; and the proposals, if any, he intends to implement to address the income problem on the country's 15,000 hill sheep farms.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ewe premium is designed to compensate producers for the difference between the EU basic price and the average EU market price for sheepmeat.  In view of this, it in inevitable that the rate of ewe premium will be low in a year, such as 1997, when average market prices are high.  In effect when the ewe premium and average market prices are taken together, overall returns to sheep producers were roughly the same in 1997 and 1996.  I accept, however, that in the latter months of 1997 prices for hoggets and cull ewes were relatively low and that the ewe premium did not fully compensate for this.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I should point out that the EU sheepmeat regime recognises the position of the hill sheep farmer through the payment of a supplementary rural world premium of £5.51 on eligible ewes to producers in disadvantaged areas, where all hill sheep farmers are located.  In addition, these producers also receive a headage payment of £10 per head on the first 200 ewes/hoggets under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Towards the end of 1997, I sanctioned an additional £2.5 million in extra headage payments to assist sheep producers in disadvantaged areas. These supplementary payments should help to compensate hill sheep farmers for the lower prices they received from the market in 1997.</P>
      <P>As far as the income position of sheep producers is concerned, I am aware of the current difficulties arising from the overhang of 1997 season lamb on the market.  In response to representations which I made to the EU Commission, a scheme of aid for private storage has been agreed by the Sheepmeat Management Committee 6 March.  I am confident that this measure, if fully availed of by the factories, will play a significant part in restoring market confidence to the sector.</P>
      <P>I have also established a forum, representative of the industry as a whole, to examine the wider challenges facing the sector, including the production and marketing patterns best suited to our conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 177, 178, 179, 188, 189, 191 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.  The dental health action plan provides for the development of orthodontic services through the implementation of a consultant led strategy and my Department has provided additional funding to the boards to assist them in developing their consultant led services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely <Col N="842" /> affected/handicapped.  Patients are, therefore, assessed for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity/ handicap.  These guidelines are currently under review by the Orthodontic Review Group, a group set up by the health boards at the suggestion of my Department to review the guidelines and other issues in relation to the orthodontic services. This group, which includes health board consultant orthodontists, is due to report to the chief executive officers in the near future.</P>
    <P>Under the consultant led strategy for the provision of orthodontic services health board dentists providing orthodontic treatment at secondary care level do so under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant orthodontist and receive training, as necessary, from the consultant. It is not necessary that in each case the dentist undergoing training should be in a formal training programme with a dental school leading to a post-graduate qualification.  However, I am concerned to ensure that post-graduate training programmes of both dental schools in orthodontics and other disciplines adequately reflect current and future needs of the public dental service under the health strategy and the dental health action plan.</P>
    <P>My Department has commenced discussions with the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board concerning the role of the Dublin Dental Hospital and School in the provision of training in orthodontics for the health board staff and has also met with representatives of the Irish Consultant Orthodontists' Group to hear their views on post-graduate training requirements in orthodontics.  My Department has also made arrangements to meet the Dublin Dental Hospital and School on the issue.  The Orthodontic Review Group has also examined issues in relation to training in orthodontics and will include recommendations in its report.</P>
    <P>Following the developments which I have outlined I will, as necessary, consult my colleague Deputy Martin, Minister for Education and Science, to ensure that adequate post-graduate training programmes are provided by both dental schools.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12, who paid £180 hospital charges for hospitalisation in November and December 1997, has been asked to pay £75 for three days treatment in February 1998; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, as amended by the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1997, a person is liable for statutory charge unless otherwise exempt, in respect of in-patient public hospital services.  From 1 January 1998 this charge is set at £25 per night, subject to a maximum of £250 in any 12 month period.  The charge had previously been set at £20 per night, subject to a maximum of £200 in any 12 month period.</P>
      <P>Public hospital statutory charges are based on the principle that those who can afford to do so are required to make a contribution towards the cost of providing hospital services.  There are a number of exemptions to the charge, including medical card holders.  While the regulations do not explicitly state so, the effect of the maximum payment is that a person would be liable to be charged for a maximum period of ten nights in any 12 month period.  It would, therefore, be fair and reasonable to expect that a person would not be liable for the charge once he-she had paid for ten nights in hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had inquiries made of the hospital concerned and have been advised that the individual has paid the charge in respect of nine nights at £20 already.  Therefore, he is now liable for a charge for one night at £25.  The hospital will advise the individual accordingly. <Col N="845" /></P>

      <P>The identification of priorities and the appointment of additional staff is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.  An application has recently been received from the board in respect of the post referred to by the Deputy. My Department has been in contact with the board indicating that additional resources for such a service can only be considered in the context of proposed service developments for 1999 and requesting that the priority accorded to this post be specified, having regard to the other priority consultant posts for the Southern Health Board area already identified to the Department.</P>
      <P>The improvement of obstetric services generally is currently being dealt with by a project team for the amalgamation of maternity and neonatology services in Cork, on the Cork University Hospital site.  I understand from the Southern Health Board that the brief for an Amalgamated Obstetric Unit on the site of the Cork University Hospital is almost complete and I look forward to receiving the brief from the board in due course.</P>

      <P>Following the transfer of the Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospital to Tallaght on 21 June next, acute hospital services, including accident and emergency services, will continue to be provided from St. James's Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, the Children's Hospital, Temple Street and the Mater Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board's working group on the south inner city primary care needs assessment identified the problems likely to arise following the relocation of existing services to Tallaght and it recommended the establishment of a primary care centre and the enhancement of general practice and community services in the south inner city, with the primary care centre acting as a central focus for the organisation and delivery of services encompassing the full range of health care and administrative needs for primary care services in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> The Eastern Health Board is also involved in a major exercise mapping the geographical patterns of patient flows into existing accident and emergency departments, the purpose of which is to provide information and make recommendations on the requirements of the south inner city area for accident and emergency ambulance purposes.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the factors which determine levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict and it is likely that clearer patterns will emerge in the six to nine months following the new hospital's opening.  The shift in the patterns of accident and emergency attendances, including paediatric attendances, following the opening of the new hospital at Tallaght will be carefully monitored by the Eastern Health Board and any subsequent recommendations will be fully considered in my Department.</P>

      <P>A range of addiction services are provided at the following locations in Dublin 2, 6, and 8: Trinity Court, Pearse Street, Dolphin's House, Fatima Mansions, Rialto, and Merchants Quay.

Accordingly, the North Kilkenny Branch of the Irish Wheelchair Association should approach the South-Eastern Health Board in relation to the matter of the provision of a minibus.</P>
      <P>In 1997 grants totalling £4.325 million were given to a number of voluntary agencies working with people with a physical or sensory disability for the provision of aids, appliances and other equipment, including adapted buses.  The Irish Wheelchair Association received a grant of £475,000 for dispersal through its branches throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The majority of persons with autism avail of the generic mental handicap services, including assessment of diagnostic services, day, residential, respite and home support services, which have been substantially enhanced in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A minority of persons with autism do require specialised facilities.  Additional specific services for persons with autism have been provided in the Eastern, North-Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards which now provide between 128 and 130 residential places overall.  Planning for the development of further specialist facilities as outlined in my Department's Policy Document on Services to Persons with Autism, which was published in 1994, is being included by the health boards in their overall consideration of the needs <Col N="848" /> of persons with a mental handicap and autism in their regions.  Since 1994 additional funding amounting to £1.025 million was made available for the development of services specifically for persons with autism in line with my Department's policy document.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding of £16 million in 1998 for servcies to persons with a mental handicap to continue the process of delivering the services identified in the &ldquo;Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001&rdquo;.  This includes capital funding of £5.25 million to start the major £30 million capital programme which I have put in place to run over four years in tandem with the assessment of need.</P>
    <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place in each health board region are agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees in line with the priority needs which have been identified for each region.</P>

      <P>The report of the Environmental Protection Agency for the year 1996 on the quality of drinking water in Ireland welcomes the fact that nationally there has been a drop of nearly 30 per cent as compared with 1995, in the number of samples which exceeded the maximum admissible concentration for fluoride as specified in regulations of one part per million.</P>
      <P>The report also notes that the maximum admissible concentration specified in regulations is one-third less than the value specified in the EU Directive on the Quality of Water for Human Consumption and the guideline value quoted by the World Health Organisation.  In all but a tiny minority of cases the exceedances are at, or below, a limit currently considered acceptable by the World Health Organisation and the European Union.</P>
      <P>In the case of Cork Corporation there has been a greatly increased monitoring programme in 1996.  The report notes that there has been an increase in fluoride exceedances although, when sample numbers are taken into account, the relative increase is much less marked.  Of a total of 41 exceedances in 177 samples only one exceedance was at a level of 1.2 parts per million or greater as compared with the EU limit of 1.5 parts per million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the on-going monitoring of the fluoridation programme health boards are required <Col N="849" /> to submit performance indicators under their service plans.  Health boards are reminded on a regular basis of the need to keep fluoride levels within the statutory limit.</P>

      <P>The statistical information requested is at present being collated and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible. The policy of the health services is that older people should be maintained in dignity and independence at home with the support of the community care services where necessary and where this is no longer possible, to ensure they have access to the best possible medical or long-term care.  Various supports are available to older people to assist them with day to day living in their own communities for as long as possible, i.e. home help services, day centres, day hospitals, community nursing and periods of respite care. Older people may also choose to reside in sheltered accommodation, which may provide ancillary services.</P>
      <P>Where a person has been assessed as requiring nursing home care a health board may offer that person accommodation in a health board institution providing nursing care or assist them with the cost of private home care.

Details of the precise services to be put in place in each health board region are currently being agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the procedure under which the mother of a pre-marital child who subsequently marries a man who is not the father of the child, then applies to adopt her own child jointly with her husband so that he can gain parental rights over the child.  It is necessary for the mother to adopt her own child in these circumstances as under our adoption law all parental rights are transferred from the birth parent(s) to the adoptive parent(s).</P>
      <P>I am aware that many mothers resent having to adopt their children in such circumstances.  I would point out, however, that it was not originally envisaged that adoption orders would be made in such circumstances and the procedure has been utilised because there is no other legal mechanism available by which a husband can gain parental rights over his wife's child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of examining this issue to ascertain whether alternative mechanisms could be provided to enable a husband in such cases to apply for parential rights over his wife's child.  I would stress however that there are a number of priorities in the adoption area which must be dealt with before this issue can be considered in detail.  These are: the enactment of the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996; the introduction of legislation to address the issue of post-adoption contact and <Col N="852" /> the introduction of legislation to enable ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, 1993.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons and the maintenance of waiting lists in the Eastern Health Board is the statutory responsibility of the board.  The Eastern Health Board's orthodontic services are currently being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan.  Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severly affected-handicapped.  Patients, are therefore, assessed for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity-handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the board that there are currently 5,745 patients on the board's category II assessment waiting list.  The estimated waiting time for an assessment appointment is currently 31 to 36 months.  Following assessment patients who are assessed as category II cases are referred to the treatment list and called for treatment at <Col N="853" /> an early date.  All patients who are assessed as category II cases will receive treatment by the board.  Since the opening of the board's regional orthodontic department in September 1996, 3,156 patients have commenced a treatment programme and considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting times for assessment and for treatment.  Varying degrees of treatment needs are recommended in respect of each individual patient.  It is, therefore, not possible to predict with certainty the exact number of patients who will be undergoing treatment at the end of each year 1998 and 1999.  My Department is in regular contact with the board in relation to the development of its orthodontic services.  The board is also required to submit performance indicators under its service plans.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205, 206 and 207 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of reports of a recent study in the United Kingdom suggesting possible linkages between the MMR vaccine and autism.  However, I have been advised that the Irish Medicines Board, along with other European regulatory authorities, and on the basis of the scientific data available, is of the view that no change in the regulatory status of the vaccine is warranted at this time.  Nonetheless, the board has assured me that it will continue to monitor the situation and will take any appropriate action that may be considered necessary in the light of any information or evidence that might become available which would alter the risk-benefit ratio of the vaccine.</P>
      <P>The vaccine in question has been licensed in Ireland for many year and is the subject of a current product authorisation issued by the Irish Medicines Board in accordance with the requirements of the Medical Preparations (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1996.  The vaccine was first authorised following assessment by the former National Drugs Advisory Board, including assessment of the relative safety of the product.  I am also advised that no clinical trials on this vaccine took place in Ireland before its introduction here. The clinical studies necessary to support the application for the licensing of the vaccine were conducted outside the country.</P>
      <P>At present there is no scientific evidence to support the separate administration of these vaccines. The Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland, published in 1996 are currently being reviewed by the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  All relevant scientific information relating to the safety and efficacy of the vaccines in use in the national immunisation programme is being considered by the committee, to ensure that the guidelines continue to reflect best international practice in his most important aspect of our preventive medical service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey) Noel Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 231 together.</P>
      <P>A county development plan has to be based on an integrated strategy for the development of the territory of the county as a whole so that the plan, together with any town-village-district plans for areas within the county, fulfils the essential strategic land use function of the plan as intended by the Planning Acts.  Such a strategic assessment would identify anticipated population growth and would take a planned approach to meeting the development needs of the county including the provision of necessary infrastructure.  In the absence of such an overall strategy the planning of each town is bound to be considered in isolation, leading to lack of coherence and balance when looked at in the wider context.</P>
      <P>The current Wicklow County Development Plan was adopted in 1989.  On 8 October 1997 the council wrote to my Department seeking my sanction to an extension of time for completion of the review of the county development plan. The letter outlined the comprehensive review being undertaken to address issues such as settlement strategies, the influence of the Dublin metropolitan area and the necessity to prioritise the growth of towns.  It was indicated in this correspondence that the preparation of a growth centre strategy enabled the council to adopt a logical priority for the preparation of town and village plans in the context of the strategic needs of the county.  In relation to the Greystones-Delgany Plan, the letter indicated that the population was to be accommodated in accordance with the growth centre strategy.  Later in the year, media reports indicated that the draft plan for Greystones-Delgany had been rejected by councillors, and subsequent discussions with the council were unable to establish that the council were proceeding with a coherent strategy as referred to in the preceding paragraph.</P>
      <P>My Department wrote to Wicklow County Council on 27 February 1998, conveying my decision to defer further consideration of their application for an extension of time for the completion of the review of the Wicklow county development plan until the council review the matter in the light of the foregoing considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 5 March, I wrote to the chairman of the council, indicating that I am prepared to grant an extension of time as soon as the elected members of Wicklow County Council satisfy me that they intend to proceed with the adoption of a development plan or development plans on the basis of an integrated strategy for the development of the county as a whole, and which will in turn provide a wider strategic framework for separate town-area plans in the county.  In that letter I also stated that I have no preconcived ideas as to the development objectives for any <Col N="863" /> parts of County Wicklow or for individual towns within the county.  These are matters for the elected council to determine in the context of planning the strategy for the development of the county which is to be incorporated in the new development plan.</P>

      <P>My Department is anxious to ensure that, as far as possible, good environmental practice is integrated into all aspects of its operations, including the use of paper products and disposal of waste.  In this context, it is committed to using recycled paper where quality, suitability and cost considerations allow.</P>
      <P>For example, in 1997, the Department ordered some 17 million envelopes made from recycled paper.  Arrangements are also in place in the Department to enable staff to reuse envelopes for internal use although the Deputy will appreciate that almost all envelopes used by the Department are issued to members of the public in connection with claims for payments and other business.  The three agencies under the aegis of the Department &mdash; the Combat Poverty Agency, the Pensions Board and the National Social Services Board &mdash; generally use envelopes made from shredded or environmentally friendly paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large proportion of the Department's waste <Col N="868" /> paper goes for shredding and recycling.  Some 380 tonnes were disposed of in this manner last year. Some waste paper produced by bodies under the aegis of the Department is also sent for shredding and recycling.</P>
    <P>My Department is involved with the Department of the Environment and Local Government in promoting good environmental practice in the management of the Department and is concerned that this practice continues.</P>

      <Quest>the entitlements covered under the national health and unemployment insurance stamps in the years prior to 1953 and, in particular, the entitlement to widow's, widower's or old age pension.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable &mdash; national health insurance, widow's and orphan's pension and unemployment insurance contributions. These gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
      <P>The Widow's and Orphan's Act 1935 provided for a widow's contributory pension from 1936 onwards.  Contributions prior to 1953 can be used both to satisfy the 156 paid contributions and the yearly average condition which apply to that scheme.  Widower's contributory pension was introduced in 1994 and the qualification conditions are identical to those pertaining to widow's contributory pension.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions or 24 in the case of a retirement pension registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.  The yearly average condition was reduced to ten contributions for the new <i>pro-rata</i> old age contributory pension which came into force with effect from 21 November last.  To qualify for a rate of pension equivalent to 50 per cent to 75 per cent of the maximum rate, a person with a yearly average of between ten and 19 must have 260 rather than 156 paid contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of this pension.  However, as a concession and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1953 were taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer <Col N="869" /> counted for the purposes of satisfying the yearly average test.</P>
    <P>However, social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account for old age contributory pension purposes in satisfying the first two conditions, set out above, but cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of unemployment assistance and this has continued in payment without interruption with the exception of a number of weeks in January of this year when some payments were delayed due to the late submission by her of the relevant weekly claim documents.  The person concerned is a casual worker and payment issues on a weekly basis for days not worked following submission by her of appropriate evidence of employment.</P>
      <P>In December 1997 she made a claim to child benefit and also sought an increase in her unemployment assistance in respect of a new child. These claims were duly processed and put into payment.</P>
      <P>In January 1998 she claimed one parent family payment and this has now been awarded. Arrangements are being made for the issue of an order book as soon as possible.  The claimant seems to believe that she applied for the one parent family payment in December 1997 whereas the Department's records only indicate the child benefit and unemployment assistance claims.  It is registered if there was any misunderstanding in regard to the claimants wishes in December.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, whose husband died in November 1990, first applied for a widow's contributory pension in June 1994.  She was awarded payment from 24 December 1993, giving her the maximum six month period of backdating permitted under the legislation then in force.  The legislation was amended in 1997 to provide backdating of payment for up to one year in respect of late claims made on or after 1 January 1997.  The regulations, which were recently made pursuant to these powers, apply to claims made on or after 1 January 1997.  They do not, therefore, affect the entitlement of the person concerned which is limited to six months arrears prior to the date of her claim. Payment could only be made outside of these statutory limits in exceptional cases of hardship, departmental error or where the person could not claim in time due to illness of a severe nature. <Col N="872" /> None of these grounds are applicable in this case and, consequently, no further arrears can be paid.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to answer Questions Nos. 250 and 254 together.</P>
      <P>According to the April 1996 Census of Population, 277 people out of a total population of 3,626,087 were aged 100 or over &mdash; 68 males and 209 females.  At present, social welfare pensioners who are aged 80 or over receive an extra age related allowance of £5 per week.  At the end of 1997, there were over 82,000 pensioners in receipt of this allowance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government Action Programme for the Millennium includes a commitment to increase old age contributory pension rates to £100 per week over a five year period.  Significant progress in this direction was made in the 1998 budget which provided for an increase of £5 per week to pensioners who are in receipt of maximum rates of payment.  I am satisfied that the needs of pensioners are being addressed by this Government commitment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 252 together.</P>
      <P>An estimate of the number of recipients currently in receipt of rent and mortgage interest supplements, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, is given in the following tabular statement.  Expenditure on rent supplements has increased substantially over the past few years.  This was mainly due to increases in rent levels.  In July 1994, following concern caused by the escalating costs in relation to rent and mortgage interest supplements a review group was established by Government to report on the role of SWA in relation to housing.  The group was comprised of representatives of the Departments of Social Welfare, Health, Environment, Finance, health boards and local authorities.  The group presented its findings in December 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> Following the publication of the housing review group report, an inter-departmental committee was established under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, with representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, and Finance, to examine the implications of transferring the administration of rent and mortgage interest supplements to local authorities.  It is expected that the committee will report shortly.</P>

      <P>From 21 November last new <i>pro-rata</i> pensions were introduced so that people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age contributory pension.  A yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 gives a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  To qualify a person also needs to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions. This measure will be of benefit to many self-employed contributors and to those, mainly women, who took time out of the paid workforce for family reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have no specific plans for the further extention of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions, I will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have asked my Department to examine the general issue relating to the self-employed group aged over 56 in April 1988 who do not currently qualify for an old age contributory pension.  As any proposals in this regard, or indeed in extending the new <i>pro-rata</i> pensions to persons with a yearly average of less than ten contributions, would have cost implications they fall to be considered in a budgetary context. <Col N="874" /></P>

      <P>When a new site is opened, it can attract an initial high level of interest.  In the case of the Céide Fields, numbers appear to be stabilising at around 40,000 per annum.  This figure places Céide Fields as the second busiest heritage site managed by my Department in the West.</P>

      <P>The medieval abbey, at Abbeytown, Ballisodare is situated within an area of industrial activity which has been ongoing for a number of years.  A preservation order was placed on the abbey in 1994 to ensure that no actual interference with the abbey could take place and Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has been monitoring the effects of the industrial activity on the monument.  As the abbey is not in State ownership, public access is at the discretion of the landowners concerned. Officials of my Department will continue to monitor the situation to ensure compliance with the provisions of the preservation order.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the issue of mandatory reporting arises usually in the context of cases of child abuse where the victim could not be expected to have either an understanding of the crime being perpetrated or an understanding of how to go about reporting it.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the Deputy has the best of intentions in raising this matter.  I am not clear as to how such a procedure would apply in the case of someone who suspects that a crime, such as domestic violence, has been committed against an adult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force report on violence against women pointed out that a woman faces a variety of psychological and physical barriers in trying to deal with violence in a relationship which affects how, and to whom, a woman may disclose violence. The task force identified a range of supports which a woman in such circumstances needs, in particular the need for readily accessible information and advice.  It called for a focused delivery of such a service.  The task force was of the view that this would help to ensure that women will know the options open to them and make informed choices about disclosure taking <Col N="877" /> full account of their own future and that of their children.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a national steering committee on violence against women, chaired by Ms Mary Wallace, TD, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was established recently to develop a national strategy on violence against women. The key elements of that strategy, as identified in the task force report, will include the development of a comprehensive range of services for women and children which offer a safe and friendly environment in which abuse can be disclosed and tackled.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation in question is active and ongoing.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that one specific search has been carried out to date in 1998 but that, at present, no further specific searches are contemplated by the Garda.  However, any further information which comes to light will be evaluated and searches will be undertaken where appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána have considered fully the family's request to search a specific area.  They have informed me, however, that on the basis of the information available to them to date the searching of this area is not warranted at present.</P>
      <P>The local investigation team is drawn from the Waterford-Kilkenny division, augmented by members from other divisions, as appropriate, and by members from Garda Headquarters.  The Garda authorities inform me that all matters pertaining to this investigation remain under constant review and appropriate action will be taken in the event of developments.</P>
      <P>With regard to the setting up a special unit to search for missing persons, the detailed deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner. Present arrangements are that the Garda divisional officer-district officer takes direct responsibility for searches-investigations of persons who are reported missing.  Special investigation teams are appointed as necessary.</P>
      <P>The question of the value of a centralised Garda national missing persons unit is being kept under review.</P>
      <P>The matter is one which merits being kept under review.  In this regard, officials of my Department have already had a preliminary meeting with representatives of the national crime faculty from the UK.  Later this month, they will be travelling to the UK, with a member of An Garda Síochána, to assess the potential value of a new investigative initiative there, involving analysis of data using sophisticated computer software, as an aid to investigations.  If the initiative shows sufficient promise, I will consider its adoption in this country.</P>

    <P>Male offenders aged 16 to 17 (and up to the age of 21) may be committed on remand or to serve a period of detention at St. Patrick's Institution. Male offenders aged 17 years and over may be committed on remand or sentenced to imprisonment to the four adult committal prisons (Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick and Portlaoise).  Sentenced male offenders aged 16 and 17 may be transferred from any of the four committal prisons and from St. Patrick's Institution to Wheatfield Place of Detention, Fort Mitchel and Shanganagh Castle to serve their sentences.  The age structure of the population in these institutions is relatively young and the regimes there place greater emphasis on education and work training for young offenders than the regimes in the committal prisons.  Shanganagh Castle is an open centre reserved exclusively for male offenders aged 16-21 years.</P>
    <P>Female offenders aged 17 years (and over) may be committed on remand or sentenced to imprisonment to Mountjoy and Limerick women's prisons.  Female offenders aged 16 years and male offenders aged 15 years can be committed to prison only in exceptional circumstances.  This can occur only in cases where the court certifies, under the provisions of section 97 and 102 of the Children's Act, 1908, that the young person is so unruly or depraved of character that she or he cannot be detained in a place of detention provided under Part V of the Act, i.e. a special school which comes under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda personnel and they inform me that there are in total 93 members of the force allocated to the juvenile liaison scheme.  There are 36 juvenile liaison officers (JLOs) attached to various stations in the Dublin metropolitan area region and 46 JLOs allocated to stations outside the DMA region.  In addition, the national juvenile office, located at Harcourt Square, is staffed by one superintendent, one inspector, two sergeants and four clerical officers.  There are also seven supervising sergeants who supervise JLOs in the DMA region and in the Limerick and Cork divisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities report that it is not possible to indicate or set a number of cases which will be allocated to a juvenile liaison officer as there are various factors which affect the workload. These factors include different forms of caution (informal and formal), different levels of supervision (intensive and regular), involvement <Col N="884" /> with schools, clubs, talks to parents groups etc., and the amount of time involved in travelling depending on the geographical responsibility allocated to the particular officer.</P>
    <P>Dealing with an offender by way of formal caution will involve a much greater involvement on the part of the JLO than would an informal caution. Likewise, intensive supervision puts greater demands on the JLO than would regular supervision.</P>
    <P>Because of the varied factors outlined above, the Garda authorities are not in a position to give a cost per offender of referral to a juvenile liaison officer as the amount of work hours for each case will vary on the category of referral.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I understand that there are some 13,000 referrals a year under the juvenile liaison officer scheme.</P>

However, the Deputy may be interested to know that an expert study on the Mountjoy Prison population &ldquo;A Sociological and Criminological Profile&rdquo; which was published by my Department in June 1997 found that the rate of recidivism among our prisoners is high.  The study showed, for example, that about 89 per cent of the prisoner sample profiled could be classified as persistent or repeat offenders, while 77 per cent of the sample group had previously spent some time in St. Patrick's Institution for juvenile offenders.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 278, 279, 280, 281 and 287 together.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Convention provides a basis for determining the state responsible for examining applications for asylum lodged in one of the member states of the European Communities.  It does no more than this.  The Dublin Convention (Implementation) Order, 1997, came into operation on 1 September 1997.  All applications for refugee status made in the State since that date have been or are being examined to establish if the Dublin Convention criteria apply.  In the period 1 September 1997 to 28 February 1998 a total of 1,963 applications for refugee status have been lodged in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the evidence available in individual cases formal requests have been made to <Col N="887" /> other member states party to the Dublin Convention to take charge of 74 applicants.  Full details are set out in Table I which follows.  In addition, requests have been made of this country to take charge of applicants who have also sought refugee status in other EU member states &mdash; details are set out in Table II.</P>

    <P>Ninety-five per cent of applications for refugee status are made directly to my Department with the remainder being made at points of entry to the State.  The very large number of applications has meant that all applicants have not been interviewed for Dublin Convention purposes.  Where interviews have taken place and the applicant has not been proficient in the English language interpretation facilities have been provided.  I am not in a position to provide statistics as to the number of cases where this has been necessary.  I have no information available to me as to the number of applicants who may have sought legal advice in any matters relating to the Dublin Convention.</P>
    <P>Following consideration of the 39 acceptances received from other convention countries, the appointed officer has made 32 determinations in the period 1 September 1997 to 28 February 1998. Consideration of the cases of the remaining seven persons was outstanding on 28 February and 27 of the 32 determinations have been appealed to the appeals officer.  The appeals officer has upheld the appointed officer's decisions in respect of 19 persons and decisions in respect of a further eight persons are pending.  Of the 19 cases finalised, eight person have been returned to the relevant convention country.</P>
    <P>In addition, since 1 September 1997, 75 instructions to leave the State were served on persons for various reasons not associated with the Dublin <Col N="888" /> Convention: six of these persons have been deported.</P>
    <P>None of the persons whose applications have been considered under the Dublin Convention has had substantive asylum claims considered yet: this applies to persons whose cases fall to be considered substantively in the State following consideration of the Dublin Convention aspects of their cases and those who have been returned to this State by other states under the Dublin Convention provisions.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 103 of 26 February 1998 in relation to this matter.  Riverstown and Blarney District Courts currently sit at the recently refurbished courthouse at Midleton, which is the closest court venue to these areas within the District Court District.  The District Court areas and the court venues within those areas which comprise District Court districts are kept under review to ensure the delivery of an effective service in the context of available court accommodation and other resources.  I have no proposals at present to alter the District Court districts in the Cork region but the Deputy's proposal will be borne in mind in the continuing review of this matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 286 together.</P>
      <P>Section 15 (1)(b) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986 provides that applicants for naturalisation must be &ldquo;of good character&rdquo;.  I assume this is what the Deputy is referring to in his questions, when he asks about the suitability of persons naturalised under the scheme linked to investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference for the interdepartmental committee, set up in 1994 to assess and make recommendations on investment proposals of individual applicants, formalised the procedures for assessing applications for naturalisation linked to investment.  Included in these procedures was a requirement for the submission of a police certificate of character from the applicant's country of origin.  Prior to the introduction of the terms of reference, it had been one practice to accept references from banks or companies, as well as the certificates mentioned above, in support of an application.  In the period mentioned by the Deputy, 24 persons supplied a character reference <Col N="890" /> in support of their application.  A further 19 applications were received on behalf of minor children of naturalised investors who would not be required to supply references.</P>

    <P>My Department's capacity to allocate child care assistant posts in any year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand across the special needs area.

In recent years, available posts have generally been allocated <Col N="893" /> to special classes which cater for children with a severe or profound learning difficulty.</P>
    <P>I am at present reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure that all available resources, including child care support, are deployed as effectively as possible.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of this child will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 306 and 322 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the newspaper reports regarding the Killashee private primary school, Naas, County Kildare, referred to by Deputy Durkan. This is a fee-paying school with both day and boarding pupils.</P>
      <P>The position is that the owners have indicated their intention to withdraw from involvement in the school from the end of the current school year.  They made an approach with a view to my Department purchasing the school and continuing it as a recognised primary school.  My Department took account of this possibility in a major review of the immediate and longer-term primary school accommodation needs of the Naas area.</P>
      <P>It has been decided that the acquisition of the Killashee school premises and its development as a primary school would not solve the accommodation difficulties arising in Naas.  However, the need to ensure continuity of educational provision for existing pupils is being considered at present.  Senior officials from my Department are due to meet with the parents of pupils in Killashee school tonight to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> A short-term strategy to cater for immediate requirements of the Naas area has been agreed and temporary accommodation will be provided by my Department as a matter of urgency.  It has also been decided that an additional primary school will be required to meet the longer-term needs of the area.  A suitable location for a new school building has been identified and this matter is being pursued locally with the owners and the local authority.</P>
    <P>Meetings were held with the Naas inter-schools primary representative group on 4 November and 2 December 1997 and on 3 and 19 February 1998. Details of attendance at the meetings are being forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1977-98 school year with the Irish <Col N="901" /> National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-1998 school year.</P>
    <P>A total of 54 remedial teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools, with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for access to a remedial teaching service.  I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the remedial teacher area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be fully considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>At present Our Lady's secondary school does not have a vacancy into which a permanent appointment can be made.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of this school will be kept under review and that the continued provision of a teacher for the hearing impaired will be considered in the context of available resources and the needs of the pupils concerned.</P>
      <P>Training in the use of sign language for teaching is given every consideration within my Department.

      <P>The eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative which I launched recently is concerned with identifying models of good practice which serve to support a range of children from those who are at risk of early school leaving to those who are outside the formal school system. Suitable projects for funding will be identified by inviting applications for supports from consortia of youth and community organisations in area based partnerships working in collaboration with schools, where such schools are (a) designated as serving areas of disadvantage or (b) are located in areas which are designated as disadvantaged under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-99.</P>
      <P>As regards school attendance issues generally, my Department is currently engaged in the preparation of draft legislation to deal with the complex issues involved in non-school attendance.  My objective is to bring heads of proposed legislation to Government in the autumn.  I hope to be in a position to publish draft legislation before the end of the year.</P>

I will be examining the submission carefully as the Bill progresses through the various legislative stages in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that the Bill was produced following an extensive process of consultation with the partners in education.  As a result, the Bill has received a generally warm welcome. I intend to continue this consultation process as the Bill proceeds through the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>As part of the PCW agreement, teachers were asked to accept that ongoing change and non-teaching activities form part of the professional duties of a teacher and, in addition, that in so far as is practicable, these duties, will not serve to reduce the normal arrangements for class teaching time at present applying.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the involvement of the school staff in the performance of the non-teaching professional duties are best made through provision in the overall programme of the school. The incorporation of the arrangements in an overall school programme will provide the opportunity for fairness and equity both for the school and the individual teacher.</P>
      <P>In the course of the PCW discussions, management and union representatives stressed that the development of an effective in-school management system requires, as an essential element, the allocation of time for the performance of duties.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science accepted that the development of an effective in-school management system could require the allocation of time for duties.  On that basis it was proposed that in regard to assistant principals, where possible, schools may allocate time for the performance of duties from existing resources.</P>
      <P>The situation will be reviewed one year after its implementation and difficulties identified will be addressed.</P>
      <P>The pupil teacher ratio at second level has improved significantly in recent years due to the allocation of additional ex-quota and concessionary posts and the application of a reduced ratio in respect of a range of new programmes which have been introduced in second level schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A substantial increase was made, from the commencement of the current school year, in the <Col N="907" /> level of secretarial support provided to voluntary secondary schools.</P>
    <P>The question of reducing the pupil teacher ratio still further and providing additional financial support to schools will be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>The matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second level is currently being examined by a technical working group on funding which comprises a number of technical experts.  Under its terms of reference, the group will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second level sector while taking account of the needs of these different schools.</P>
      <P>The report of the technical working group, which will be published, will be submitted to a steering group, the members of which have been nominated by relevant second level interests.  This steering group, having considered the report, will then submit final recommendations to me.  These recommendations will also be published.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to an equitable and fair funding regime for schools and will endeavour to prioritise expenditure so as to eliminate any anomalies identified in the present funding system.  The reports of the funding groups will be central to my consideration of the issues involved.</P>
