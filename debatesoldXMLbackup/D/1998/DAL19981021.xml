      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 13, Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) (Amendment) Bill, 1997 &mdash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 14, Western Development Commission Bill, 1998 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed) and No. 15, Statements on Agriculture.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 15: the opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; Members may share time; and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 49, motion re.  Committee of Public Accounts (resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware the Committee of Public Accounts has published its interim report and that it has suspended hearings into the controversy that surrounds bogus non-resident accounts and the possible evasion of DIRT?  In its report the committee recommended a number of legal changes, such as additional powers for the Comptroller and Auditor General and changes to the compellability of witnesses Act.  What arrangements does the Taoiseach intend putting in place to allocate Department responsibility to bring forward the changes in the law?  What priority will he give to these changes in the draftsman's office?  Will the necessary legal changes be made before Christmas to ensure the Committee of Public Accounts can recommence its hearings on this important matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>To arrive at a consensus on the way forward, it would be helpful if the chairperson of the committee and his legal adviser met the Whips of all parties to progress the matter to the point where we can agree on how to proceed. There is general consensus on the need to proceed and the committee has recommended a particular course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Taoiseach is precise on this matter.  There is a view that the important Private Members' motion, on which we will vote tonight, will dispose of the issue of conferring additional powers.  That is not the case, as the report from the Committee of Public Accounts makes clear.  It is important that the Taoiseach gives us a timeframe for the necessary legislative changes to give additional powers to the committee and confer powers on the Comptroller and Auditor General that are analogous to those of a High Court inspector under the companies Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their questions.  I have not seen the report.  I was in my office until late last night.  I understood I would receive a copy of the report, but it did not arrive. I understand it was sent to me last night.  I was in my office early this morning but I still have not got the report.  The Attorney General received it just as I got into the House at 10.25 a.m. I understand the Minister for Finance received it late last night and I spoke to him on the telephone about the matter this morning.  I have read some of the newspaper briefings on it which I assume are correct. Deputy Rabbitte is correct is saying that the Private Members' motion tonight does not deal with the matter.  The two central issues which the chairman and the committee are asking us to address are amendments to the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act, 1923, and the 1997 compellability of witnesses legislation, both of which are <Col N="983" /> central to the committee undertaking its work.  As I have said here over the past fortnight, I support what the committee is trying to do.  The committee's request will be considered carefully today by the Attorney General and by the Department of Finance.  I have no difficulty with the Whips and the chairman having a meeting.  It might also be advisable if the chairman of the committee and his legal adviser were to speak directly with the Attorney General.  This would save time in terms of finding out precisely what is required and how that can best be done.  In reply to Deputy Noonan, we will give it priority and hope we can move it forward speedily.</P>

      <P>For the information of Members, the report was laid before the House last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Taoiseach will agree the Government has a legislative priority.  To replace that with other priorities will require Cabinet sanction.  Will the Taoiseach consider calling a special Cabinet meeting either today or tomorrow to give absolute priority to the legislative changes required to allow the committee to recommence its hearings.  The changes are not minor.  They will require precise legal examination and priority in the parent Departments and in the draftsman's office.  The Taoiseach should take the initiative now, hold a special Cabinet meeting and set the priority in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee made every attempt last night to supply a copy of the report to the Government Chief Whip and the Opposition Chief Whip.  We sent one to the Minister for Finance but the offices were closed when they were delivered at 9 p.m. last night.  No discourtesy was intended.  The Minister for Finance and the Secretary General of the Department of the Finance were supplied with copies, as was your office, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>It would be useful if the legal adviser to the Committee of Public Accounts and I had the meeting suggested by Deputy Stagg and supported by the Taoiseach, and we would also be happy to have discussions with the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that.  As Deputy Noonan will appreciate, it is hard for me to respond until the Department of Finance and the Attorney General examine the matter, but every priority will be given to it.  The Government will look at their submission as soon as it is ready, which is unlikely to be today or tomorrow.</P>

      <P>Legislation has been promised to abolish ground rents.  The Taoiseach has indicated on a number of occasions that there are constitutional problems with this proposal. What progress is being made in overcoming those <Col N="984" /> problems?  Have there been any recent reports from the Attorney General on the matter?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has promised a debate in the House the week after next on structural funding, which I welcome although it is a bit late.  Will he ensure the documentation published by <i>Business and Finance</i> magazine on the question of the relative financial advantages and disadvantages of having one or two regions is made available by the Government to Members either today or tomorrow?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not see the article but one of my colleagues mentioned to me this morning that the document seemed to be leaked from Brussels.  I will check it and if there is anything in the public domain Members are welcome to have it.  However, I am not too sure I have seen that document either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be extraordinary but it is not unusual.</P>
      <P>The constitutional doubts about the ground rents Bill relate to the central purpose of the Bill. The Registrar of Titles indicated the Bill would give rise to substantial practical difficulties.  That central purpose of the proposed legislation is still under examination and a way has not yet been found around it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Government decided at yesterday's Cabinet meeting to legislate to establish an independent statutory authority to supervise the financial services industry. Subsequently, a press statement was issued saying the Government was setting up a committee to decide the authority's role and function.  The normal practice would be to decide the role and function before deciding what kind of body would carry it out.  Will the Taoiseach explain exactly what was decided in respect of this new legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been anxious about this for some considerable time and the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have been examining how best to set up a separate regulatory authority for the wider remit of the financial services industry.  Considerable work was done on that throughout the summer, but it is clear to the Government that not enough preparatory work has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee which was set up yesterday &mdash; the membership will be announced today &mdash; will look precisely at how this should be done, which the Department of Finance reckons will take three or four months.  We will then legislate.  The broad thrust is that we should have a separate regulatory authority for the financial services industry.  How that is to function, what its relationship with the Central Bank should be and <Col N="985" /> so on will be examined over the next few months. Separate legislation will then be brought forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government decided in principle that it will be an authority separate from the Central Bank, or does it still envisage widening the role of the Central Bank to incorporate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>The Equal Status Bill is listed on the Order Paper in the name of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  However, will the concerns of the Minister for Education and Science be taken into account, given that it relates to the prohibition of discrimination in education?  Can the date for this Bill be brought forward as quickly as possible?  It seems a Steiner school in Clare will end up in court if this legislation is not passed because it is not recognised as a school as a result of discrimination in education.</P>
      <P>Are there any legislative proposals to avoid a repeat of the situation in which the Revenue Commissioners do not seem to have audited AIB for 12 years?  Will that be part of the legislative review, pending the outcome of the investigations?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Plant breeders' rights shall not apply to a variety containing a terminator system, where the inclusion of such a system inhibits the use of seed defined under the &lsquo;farm saved seed exemption&rsquo; referred to in section 19(1)(d) of the Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) (Amendment) Act, 1998.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The seed industry worldwide accounts for about $40 billion in sales annually.  The commercial value of seed used by farmers globally has been estimated at between $60 billion and $75 billion. The difference in these values is due to the widespread farm practice known as plant back or farmers' privilege.  Farmers often plant seed saved from a previous year's harvest for next year's production instead of purchasing certified seed from a seed company.</P>
      <P>This practice is particularly common in the major field crops of high commercial value such as wheat and soya bean.  To a lesser extent, it is common in some production regions for cotton and for potatoes in this country.  Because these crops are over-pollinated parent plants transfer traits uniformly through seed to the progeny plants.  Thus, for these crops, as long as the farmer is satisfied at the performance of the previous year's crop, there is a limited incentive to purchase seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, the price of over-pollinated seed is a small premium over the commodity value of this seed.  The premium is based on the cost of cleaning and conditioning the seed plus a charge to offset breeding of improved varieties.  Only the hybrid crops, where progeny segregate into nonuniform populations with varying traits relative to their parent plants, is a practice of plant back selection found.  The yield loss associated with these dissimilar field populations eliminates any economic incentive to plant with saved seed. <Col N="989" /> However, with the onset of the new terminator gene technology, companies can prevent second generation progeny from the non-hybrid seed germinating.  The economic climate of this new technology must also be noted.  It comes at a time when many of the larger seed companies are being acquired by major multi-national agrochemical companies.  The recent multi-million pound takeover by Monsanto of Delta and Pine Land See Company, producing an agribusiness giant which wholly controls the new seed sterilising technology is worrying.  Again, it is not the science but the economic appliance of the science which caused major concern.</P>
    <P>We have a unique opportunity to strengthen our farmer privilege as outlined in section 19 and to include this proposed amendment so as to legislate for this terminator technology, which was commercially announced on 11 May this year.  The many areas and sections of gene technology must be legislated for in a case by case fashion.  In this case, the amendment outlined will, in a forward thinking manner, allow for such effective legislation.</P>
    <P>Recently, the director general of CIMMYT in Mexico, an international maize and wheat improved centre which develops sustainable maize and wheat systems for the poor countries, announced in Ottawa that this centre would refuse to use terminator technology.  Since this organisation is the world's premier maize and wheat developer, it must at least raise questions over this technology's effect on farmers' privilege.</P>
    <P>This newly patented technique that genetically alters seed so that it will not germinate if replanted a second time could jeopardise the food security of 1.4 billion people as these resource poor farmers in the southern hemisphere depend on farm saved seed.  These farmers are responsible for feeding between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the world's population.</P>
    <P>Unlike hybrid seeds introduced earlier this century, the terminator technology brings to date relatively little agroeconomic benefits to the farmer.  It is simply a mechanism to physically reduce the frequency of plant back practices and hence tighten up loss making in the market.  This amendment will ensure farmers are guaranteed their rights to farm saved seed under section 19 of the Bill.  Section 19 allows farmers to use for prorogation on their own holdings seed obtained from crops harvested on that farm.  Without the protection of this amendment which copperfastens this right in relation to terminator gene technology, section 19 will be defunct because the use of terminator technology in plants, exempted under ministerial order, will stop the seed from producing a second crop.</P>
    <P>Terminator technology is a powerful tool to control the propagation and reproduction of any crop.  The principle of the Bill is to balance the rights of the breeder with that of the farmer to use farm saved seed.  I remind the Minister of the historical background to the farm saved seed section.  The right of the farmer to save seed to <Col N="990" /> grow a second crop is historically based in threat of famine.  It allowed the farmer to grow this subsequent crop to stave off starvation and ensure the survival of his family.  Today, we do not have that risk in Ireland; but there is such a risk in other parts of the world and while this legislation will not impact outside this country, it will set down a principle in the Statute Book and leave the door open for less developed countries to follow suit.  For a country which has prided itself on helping others facing famine, it would strengthen that position.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the goal of genetic engineering in food production, which is to ensure food is produced cheaply and in large quantities to avoid the recurrence of famine. Genetic engineering claims to feed the world, but terminator technology in this situation may end up controlling food production.</P>
    <P>Another aspect to this matter is nearer to home.  Companies with this technology can hold farmers to ransom in relation to what they can charge for this seed.  A copperfastened farm seed guarantee gives the farmer a bargaining chip to negotiate a more realistic price for his seed.  At present in the US, one of the biggest seed producers in the world, Monsanto, is negotiating with the US Government for sole rights to the terminator gene technology patent.  If this happens, we can be sure that this company will introduce this technology in all its seed products.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the need for the introduction of terminator genes in genetically engineered plants as this prevents their proliferation in the environment. However, without the amendment section 19, which allows farmers to use farm safe seed, will be obsolete in the future.  From speaking to officials in the Department, I have been informed that, following legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, the Government does not intend to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight a number of points in that regard.  First, the UPOV Convention was signed in 1991.  At that stage terminator gene technology was not an issue because people did not know about it.  Second, the amendment does not conflict with the UPOV Convention or Council regulations as neither of them prohibit the inclusion of such an amendment and both allow for the inclusion of a farm safe seed exemption.  This exemption is worthless without the amendment. Will the Minister clarify the legal advice he received?  Did it state that the breeder has an overriding right over that of the farmer or do both have equal rights?  The amendment would only secure farmers' rights to farm safe seed and has no additional implications.</P>
    <P>Under Article 6 of the EU Directive on Biotechnology, genetic engineering inventions can be considered unpatentable where their commercial exploitation would be contrary to <i>ordre public</i> or morality.  This Article gives the Minister scope to accept the amendment on the grounds of morality.  Nobody would believe that it is morally <Col N="991" /> right to have control of seed production in the hands of a small number of multinational companies.</P>
    <P>Many countries and humanitarian organisations in the EU and elsewhere are now realising the full implications of this technology.  The Dutch Parliament recently moved to oppose the European patent directive by appealing it to the European Court of Justice.  The terminator patent was one of the key issues that prompted it to renew its objections to the patent directive.  Rural Advancement Foundation International has launched an international campaign to stop negotiations between the US Government and a subsidiary of Monsanto regarding the rights to the terminator gene patent.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept the amendment and leave power in the hands of farmers, not solely in the hands of a small number of multi-national companies.  The amendment guarantees farm safe seed for farmers.  This legislation which has been debated on a number of occasions will be obsolete in the future because multinational companies will not need it to protect their rights. They will have terminator technology which will inhibit the reproduction of plants for a second and subsequent generations.  Without the amendment the Bill will be completely obsolete in a number of years because of terminator gene technology.</P>
    <P>It is crucial to set a precedent and to state that we are not willing to let multinational companies dictate to farmers what they can or cannot do. Genetic engineering is supposed to be of benefit to farmers and consumers.  However, the way this technology is used in the future will create the opposite effect and control seed production worldwide.  This is of immense concern to many countries which have poorly developed economies. I ask the Minister to reconsider the amendment and accept it because it is a crucial issue. The amendment foresees the problems which will arise in the future in relation to the legislation.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the advice given by the Attorney General?  Given the detailed discussion on this matter, I do not understand why the amendment would not be accepted. As Deputy Naughten said, it will not affect the current position, but it will be necessary in the future.  I have learned much about terminator technology recently and the more I hear about it, the more afraid of it I become.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I initially understood that terminator technology was not a blunt instrument.  However, a crop of barley, corn, wheat or oats is only given one year to grow and dies after that.  It cannot be used the second year.  This is a frightening concept and we as legislators must take a close look at it.  I do not understand why the amendment cannot be accepted.  It gives a clear signal regarding developments in plant technology.  It is likely that similar debates will take place in parliaments <Col N="992" /> around the world over the next few years.  I do not understand why the Minister cannot accept the amendment given the circumstances.</P>
    <P>It would be a good provision, unless I am missing something.  I understand Deputy Naughten has discussed it at great length with departmental officials and we are grateful for their co-operation. However, given the circumstances, I do not understand why the amendment cannot be accepted.  It is a fundamental aspect of the legislation. The Bill initially appeared to be innocent, but anything relating to plant breeding technology is far from straightforward.  There is no valid reason for not accepting the amendment in its current format.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by my colleagues.  If the amendment is not accepted, multinational companies will be in a position to interfere with the usual reproduction of seeds the following year.  Companies will attempt to tie up the market for certain seeds.  For generations, farmers and those involved in husbandry have resown seeds and future developments will be a total interference with the natural cycle of nature for commercial reasons.  If there is a good variety of seeds and a company can tie them up and ensure that they cannot regenerate the next year, only that company can supply more seed the following year.  This is contrary to natural justice and the law of nature.  Why is this possible?</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, farmers and gardeners should have the option of regenerating from safe seed. If it starts with one variety and continues with others, there is a great danger that certain crops would be exclusively controlled by the company using the terminator gene technology.  It has more far reaching consequences than suggested by the Bill and I am glad our spokespersons have highlighted this serious possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Naughten is correct to argue that terminator gene technology will make farmers more dependent on multinationals. However, gene technology in general will make farmers more dependent on these companies. This was the argument I put forward when we last discussed this issue in the House.  Perhaps there would be more common ground between Fine Gael and the Green Party if Deputy Naughten also made this argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cost reduction is the perceived benefit of genetically engineered crops, either as a result of higher yield or the reduced use of herbicides and pesticides.  However, this theory is flawed for a number of reasons.  In a number of countries, revenue for farmers using genetically engineered crops fell when compared to conventional crops. US farmers using genetically engineered soya beans are obliged to pay a technology fee and a premium seed price to Monsanto, the controversial company conducting sugar beet trials in Ireland.  Contracts in the US stipulate that farmers use Monsanto's brand of weedkiller.  This illustrates that, in general, gene technology makes <Col N="993" /> farmers more dependent on multinationals.  I urge Deputy Naughten to extend his argument.  He is correct when he speaks about terminator genes, but we must examine the entire issue of gene technology and recognise the dangers it entails.</P>
    <P>Deputies Naughten and Connaughton have pointed out that debates are taking place worldwide. People in Britain are rightly seeking a three year moratorium.  The British Government has reneged on a pre-election promise to introduce such a measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

      <P>Instead, it has published a document which outlines the benefits of gene technology. The British Government has now embraced companies such as Monsanto and other multinationals who have been given <i>carte blanche</i> to do what they like in Ireland.  The net effect will be to ruin our image abroad.  We are still seen as a green country with a clean environment.  I do not know if this is true but that is our international image.  We are in danger of losing a unique opportunity to promote organic agriculture. If this amendment is not accepted we are getting nearer to the point where our image will be gone forever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Naughten and Connaughton for their comments about the officials who met them and discussed this matter.  However, having given serious consideration to this amendment and sought the advice of the Attorney General's office, the amendment cannot be incorporated into the Bill. Plant breeders enjoy comprehensive rights under the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, UPOV, agreed on 19 March 1991.  Under Council Regulation 2100/94, which came into operation in April 1995, those rights constitute a Community plant variety right. The use of farm saved seed is not a right but a limited derogation from the Community plant variety right.  Ireland has an international obligation to implement plant breeders' rights but this amendment would abrogate that right in order to protect the derogation.  The State has not authority to do so.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the UPOV Convention is the protection of the rights of the plant breeders, thereby establishing the identity of a variety's inventor and the protection of the plant breeder's exclusive right to reproduce and sell reproductive material of the variety, and to authorise others to do so.  Article 5 of the UPOV convention is clear. There shall apply to the plant breeder's rights no conditions for protection other than those specified. No provision is made for the exclusion of a variety with a terminator gene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use by farmers of farm saved seed is an optional exception under the convention from the plant breeder's right.  The option is exercised in Ireland under the authority of Article 14 of <Col N="994" /> Council Regulation 2100/94 on Community plant variety rights, which prescribes the conditions on which the derogation may be given effect.  It does not include the exclusion of varieties containing terminator genes as among the conditions to give rise to the derogation on the use of farm saved seed.  The derogation finds expression in section 19 of the Bill, which includes the use by a farmer of farm saved seed among the acts exempted from the requirement of an authorisation from the plant breeder.</P>
    <P>This amendment would authorise taking away the rights of the plant breeder in order to protect farmers from having to purchase new seed each year.  This conflicts with international obligations and Ireland is not permitted to legislate in this manner.  The UPOV and EU agreements must be implemented as they stand.</P>
    <P>Article 5 of the UPOV Convention does not reach decisions on whether a variety is good or bad, but only on whether it is distinct from other varieties and is sufficiently uniform and stable. Other legal regulations decide whether a variety may or may not be marketed.  Varieties of agricultural crops cannot be marketed in the EU unless it can be shown that they have value in cultivation and use, VCU.  I have no doubt that the emerging issues relating to new technology in the plant world will be fully examined and debated at political and technical level within international and EU fora.</P>
    <P>Deputies Naughten and Connaughton asked for the comments of the Attorney General.  In summary, he said that the amendment is antiUPOV and EU legislation.  The right is accorded to the breeder and the use of farm saved seed is a limited derogation from that right.  EU marketing directives may be the venue to prevent the sale of varieties which include the terminator gene.  That would seem the way forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten also referred to the rights of the breeder and the farmer being equal.  They are not equal.  The breeder is accorded the right; the farmer's privilege is a derogation from that right. The conditions of the derogation are detailed in Article 14 of the EU legislation on breeders' rights.  They cover up to about 37 acres of land from derogation.  Otherwise farmers have to pay. That is the case with all rights, such as music rights.  We have to respect the rights of other countries and inventors.  I was surprised that Deputy Naughten used the word &ldquo;morality&rdquo;.  I acknowledge his expertise but he knows that we will get nowhere if research and development, and the cost of such work, are not protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  He is correct to state that we have to examine the issue of the funding of research and development which is vitally important for the development of agriculture.  However, we must ensure that farmers also have rights.  I accept that Minister's assertion that farmers only have derogations in this legislation and that the overwhelming right belongs to breeders.  However, breeders <Col N="995" /> should not have all of the rights while farmers are only given a small derogation.</P>
      <P>This amendment will not affect breeders' rights but will underline the rights of farmers to this derogation.  I am sure the officials will agree this is the only implication of this amendment.  I am not trying to deny the rights of breeders.  We are only discussing one aspect of this issue &mdash; terminator technology.  This legislation does not define a new plant or species by including a terminator gene.  We are not affecting the rights of breeders but trying to protect the farmers' derogation.</P>
      <P>I accept we have missed the boat on this matter but I urge the Department to go back to the European Commission on it.  We must address this serious issue now, not when it is too late.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that research and development is necessary, which of course it is.  I point again to the nuclear industry analogy as I have often compared that industry to the gene technology one.  If one compares the levels of research and development carried out in the nuclear industry, one will note that the advertising budget of Sellafield alone is far greater than the research and development budget into alternative energy sources.  The research and development budgets of Monsanto and the multinational, Novatis, are absolutely gigantic compared to the research and development budget into organic agriculture.  I agree that research and development is necessary but let us carry out research and development into organic agriculture rather than pouring vast amounts of money into gene technology.

      <P>We are talking about issues of morality here.  The terminator gene technology is immoral in my view.  When we talk about patenting the bio-wealth of the Third World, we are talking about total suppression of farmers there, not to mention farmers in Ireland.  Agriculture is now being sucked into huge conglomerates and farming has become a huge agri-business.  More <Col N="996" /> and more farmers are finding it difficult to make ends meet as they are becoming more and more dependent on huge multinationals.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the UPOV Convention and spoke about Ireland's international obligations. We are entering a post-political and postdemocratic age because we find that the multilateral agreement on investment, GATT and so on supercede our best efforts in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the right to impose a termination gene only attach to a completely new variety of seed or can this multinational company eventually take over other varieties and attach the same rights to them?  That would be an extremely serious development.  How did this multinational company get the right to apply a termination gene in this variety which means that farmers cannot save seed and re-sow again?</P>
      <P>This certainly is a moral issue.  Our Lord told the parable of the farmer sowing seed, some of which fell among the rocks and briars and failed to germinate.  In the light of modern technology a new line could be added, namely, that some seed fell into the hands of the multinationals and was not allowed to germinate.  It is very serious if one company can tie up the right to insert a termination gene into a plant variety and prevent anyone else from repropagating it.  Is the right confined to one new plant variety or are the powers more widespread?</P>

      <P>This issue is something which Ireland has signed up to and must pass legislation on.  The rights conferred will apply equally to Irish people who bring seed outside the country. The seed potato industry has great potential in Ireland; the Deputy will be aware that farmers in north Connacht are moving into that area.  The terminator system can be inserted into any variety which meets the criteria of being distinct, uniform and stable.</P>

Huge research and development is being carried out in this area and we must respect the right of the breeder to continue to recover the cost of such research and continue carrying it out.  I welcome the Deputy's biblical reference but we must consider the other types of research and development which are ongoing throughout the country. The Deputy will be aware that a huge amount of research and development is carried out in the computer industry in Galway.

The Dutch Parliament has opposed the European Patent Directive because of the implications of terminator gene technology.  We must take a stand on <Col N="998" /> this issue in Ireland too and the Minister has the opportunity to do that.</P>
      <P>This measure will have serious implications for many small farmers.  At present potato and grain producers can sow up to 40 hectares of land and re-use the seed the following year.  That gives small producers the opportunity to make some money.  With the new terminator technology, their right to do that will be prohibited.  We must look at the issues involved and seek to achieve a balance between the rights of the breeder and those of the farmer.  The farmer has only one derogation in this regard and it should be cemented into the legislation.  The only way that can be done is through acceptance of this amendment. I urge the Minister to reconsider his decision on this crucial issue which will arise again and again.</P>

    <Title>Western Development Commission Bill, 1998: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are serious about western development, the Government should apply for Objective One status for the western region because that is the best way to promote western development.  Since the previous debate on the Bill the Taoiseach has moved some way in that direction.  He indicated the Government might be prepared to apply for Objective One status for the region, but it has not yet done that.  What is the cause of the delay?  I was heartened by the Taoiseach's reply to a number of questions on 14 October.  He stressed that if a part of the country were to qualify for Objective One status as a result of the proposed reclassification, this would not mean that the rest of the country would be treated any less favourably in EU transfer terms than it would have been under the transition regime currently proposed for Ireland as a single region.  He went on to say that the Government will insist that the non-Objective One part of the country would qualify fully for the transition regime.  He said that if one region in Ireland qualifies for full Objective One assistance, the other region benefiting from the transition regime will be no worse off and that any extra benefits for a region qualifying for full Objective One status cannot and would not be at the expense of the region in transition under Objective One.  That was the very point I made in the earlier debate and some media commentators and Deputies who do not come from the west or an Objective One qualifying area found it hard to accept that.  I am delighted the Taoiseach made that point.  He also said that regionalisation should help to mitigate to a degree the imbalance in spending, but that will not be at the expense of the region in transition.  The Taoiseach could not have spelt out the position more clearly.  Other regions need not fear if the west, Border and midland counties qualify for Objective One status, and they are entitled to qualify because they meet the qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Government because the Government parties stated in the run up to the last general election that it was part of its policy to apply for Objective One status.  An Action Programme for the Millennium states that &ldquo;Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government will introduce a comprehensive programme of rural development by providing State services at local level by decentralisation, by ensuring, as far as practical, equality of infrastructure throughout the regions,.&rdquo; It also states that a key priority will be that &ldquo;Objective I status will be sought for the West of Ireland, the Border regions and all other rural areas that are suffering from population decline for the post-1999 period.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Census population figures confirm that the region is suffering from population decline.  Population trends in the 12 western, Border and midland counties which qualify for Objective One status reveal that the region suffered from population decline.  Census figures reveal that the population fell from 977,221 in 1986 to 944,865 in 1991, a decrease of 32,356.  While the l996 census reveals a slight increase in population when it increased to 965,190, it is still less than it was in 1986.  In the other 13 eastern and southern region counties there was an increase in population from 2.563 million in 1986 to 2.57854 million in 1991, an increase of 15,432.  The 1996 census reveals that the population of the eastern and southern region increased to 2,660,895.  The population increase in the eastern counties is accelerating, increasing by 15,432 from 1986 to 1991 and 97,473 or 3.2 per cent between the 1986 and 1996 censuses, which are the latest figures available.  This contrasts with a decrease in the west, Border and midland counties of 12,000 people or 1.25 per cent during the same period.  Of course, the most relevant figure for Objective One status in this region is that it has an average of 68 per cent of European GDP compared to a national average of 92 per cent, with Dublin and the mid-east stand at 111 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many schemes in the west await major funding which if Objective One status were attained it would be easier to obtain because the extra money allocated to that area would have to be <Col N="1001" /> spent there, which has not happened in the past. There has been a bias against the west.  During the current phase of Structural Funds £3.6 billion has been spent in the 13 eastern and southern counties while £1.6 billion has been spent in the west, Border and midland counties.  More than twice the amount was spent in the eastern and southern counties and I want that imbalance redressed.</P>
    <P>Many projects await the go-ahead.  For example, in 1995 Galway County Council submitted a proposal for the Connemara environmental scheme to the Department of the Environment. The proposal was then sent to Brussels and the scheme was estimated to cost more than £72 million. Connemara is unique, not alone in Ireland but also in Europe.  It is an ideal case to present for European funding, yet sanction has only been received for two schemes since 1995 &mdash; SpiddalRossaveal and the Aran Islands.  It is essential that Connemara receives sanction as it contains the largest unpolluted free fishing lake in Europe &mdash; the Corrib.  It provides the water supply to a vast area of east Galway from Headford to Tuam to Clarinbridge, Maree, Oranmore, Annaghdown and Galway city and on the west to Moycullen and Oughterard.  It will eventually supply all of Connemara, according to the Connemara environmental scheme proposal.  The terrain is unsuitable for septic tanks and there are plans for town sewerage schemes in Ballyconneely, Carna, Carraroe, Claddaghduff, Cleggan, Clifden, Clonbur, Cornamona, Costelloe, Leenane, Letterfrack, Rossaveal, Roundstone, Tully, Tullycross and Kilronan.  It is essential that those schemes get off the mark but that cannot happen until funding is received.</P>
    <P>Water supply schemes are planned for the Clifden area, Letterfrack, Carna and Kilkieran, including the Cashel; the Rosmuc area; Costelloe, including Carraroe and Rossaveal; Lettermore; the Gorumna area; Ballyconneely, Roundstone and Spiddal.  If Objective One status is obtained for the west, I am sure those schemes can be sanctioned as part of the overall proposal.  There is no doubt if we continue developing Connemara as we are, these towns and villages along the Corrib will eventually pollute it and the jewel in the crown worldwide will have been destroyed.  The waters of the Corrib must be protected as we cannot afford to pollute them.  We must get Objective One status so that at least the scheme will get off the ground for the benefit not alone of Connemara and Ireland but also of Europe because it is a unique area that must be preserved for posterity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain" hpid="Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin">
      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this Bill, I welcome it and urge that its underlying principle be applied more widely in the development of all the disadvantaged regions of this island, North and South.  The current debate on Objective One status has shone a light on the continuing disparities between the regions in Ireland.  Unfortunately, a false debate is being conducted in some <Col N="1002" /> quarters.  An effort is being made to discount inequalities between regions as if to recognise and address them is somehow to ignore the existence of wealth and poverty within regions.  This is a short-sighted and politically opportunistic approach and is, ultimately, a disservice to disadvantaged communities in all the regions.</P>
      <P>The facts and statistics speak for themselves. The Northern Ireland Economic Council, NIEC, and the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, met in November 1996 to discuss common interest with regard to the future of Structural Funds after 1999.  NESC produced a comprehensive demographic and economic regional analysis of the 26 counties in December 1997, which identified rural disadvantage concentrated across the west and Border region and particularly focused on the constituencies of Donegal, Sligo-Leitrim and Cavan-Monaghan.  Using 1991 census data in regard to the North, deprivation and disadvantage is found to be concentrated to the west of the Bann, south Armagh and north Antrim.</P>
      <P>Recently, the Department of Finance pinpointed 12 western counties which collectively have a regional income of just 75 per cent of the EU average at a time when Dublin enjoys, on a <i>per capita</i> basis, a regional income of 131 per cent. Not only that but the NESC report showed western region income to have dropped from 76 per cent to 72 per cent of the EU average between 1991 and 1993.  The recently released report of the constituency commission allocates 42 seats across the constituencies of Galway East and West, Mayo, Laoighis-Offaly, Westmeath, Longford-Roscommon, Cavan-Monaghan, Sligo-Leitrim and Donegal.  This represents 25 per cent of Dáil seats.</P>
      <P>In the North, just 36 of the new Assembly seats or 33 per cent of total representation comes from the constituencies west of the Bann, including Newry and Armagh.  These 16 constituencies represent more than half of the land mass of the island, a portion of the country which has practically been left to its own devices where development is concerned.  We are rapidly arriving at an east-west division rather than a north-south division on this island, one in which counties such as Donegal have shown unemployment rates as much as 7 per cent more than the national average. This is not a statistical fallacy.  Rural areas in the west and Border counties suffer from a sense of social despondency and economic and political alienation directly comparable to urban unemployment blackspots.</P>
      <P>The proposal to designate the west as a disadvantaged rural area is an entirely appropriate policy response.  It is the most remote region in Europe.  It has poorer soils, is rugged and uninhabitable in many parts, has a more severe climatic regime and the most underdeveloped infrastructure on the island.  This Bill is the product of an attempt to spatially target rural disadvantage. I support that attempt but does it go far enough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of co-operation between the NIEC and the NESC, the clear focus of rural disadvantage <Col N="1003" /> across the western and Border counties, the all-Ireland, cross-party and ecumenical nature of the Western Bishops Campaign which began the process that has resulted in this Bill, the establishment of a cross-Border development commission should be considered aimed at addressing the spread of rural disadvantage across the most remote of all major EU regions.  Even though a review of the legislation is not envisaged, how the proposal might be made into a positive working aspect of the British-Irish Agreement should be considered.</P>
    <P>There is another vital matter which is likely to be of grave concern to the newly established Western Development Commission and the people &mdash; the ownership and use of our natural resources.  The British based firm, Enterprise Oil, recently announced the discovery, off the west coast, of the highest levels of gas ever recorded in Irish waters.  The discovery in the Slyne Trough, off Achill Island, is many times greater than the Kinsale gasfield.  What benefit will this discovery be to the development of the west, other disadvantaged regions and the economy as a whole?  The State has offered the oil and gas industry the lowest corporation tax rates in the world, with all drilling, labour, research, production and goods costs deductible against tax.  The oil companies do not have to pay royalties to the State.  Many of the benefits of this discovery to the economy are denied because of the failure of Enterprise Oil to employ Irish labour.  The skills of 900 Irish based offshore workers lie idle while Enterprise Oil employs cheaper, non-unionised labour.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous that successive Governments have sold off our natural resources.  This huge find, which can be of such benefit to disadvantaged regions and the economy as a whole, has been placed in the hands of a multinational and the people are being asked to buy back their own property.  This is the road Thatcher took in Britain, squandering the huge resource of North Sea oil.  We should follow the lead of countries such as Norway where Norwegian labour and Government capital have combined to reap maximum benefit for the economy.  This is an issue of major national importance which we will have to revisit time and again.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the special needs of western counties.  There should be clear recognition by the Government of the equal and related needs of Border counties and the midlands.  It follows that the Government should make a positive decision with regard to regionalisation and the retention of Objective One status.  There is much disinformation and confusion surrounding this issue.  It should be made clear that the proposal for regionalisation is not intended and will not have the effect of awarding one region at the expense of another.  It should be made clear &mdash; as an all-Ireland party, Sinn Féin is conscious of this &mdash; that there is poverty and disadvantage in every region, north, south, east and west, in urban and <Col N="1004" /> rural areas.  Government and EU policy should be geared to combat poverty and disadvantage and to redistribute wealth within and between regions.</P>
    <P>The issue of regionalisation relates solely to EU Structural Funds.  Those funds are based on regions and do not take account of disparities within regions.  The west, the Border counties and the midlands still lag behind the rest of the State in terms of economy and infrastructure. Regionalisation for the purpose of retention of Objective One status is a vital component of a strategy to end poverty and disadvantage throughout the island.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with his colleagues, the Minister of State should examine the elements I have addressed, including the potential to review and develop the heart of the proposition before the House and how important it could be in the context of the hopes and expectations raised by the British-Irish Agreement.  The Minister of State should address the concerns I have raised in relation to the extraction, utilisation and marketing of the find, off Achill Island, by Enterprise Oil and the resultant benefits to those other than the people of the disadvantaged areas and those dependent on the success of the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Bill has finally made it into the House after a long gestation period about which my colleague, Deputy Carey, spoke on 1 October.  Matters are more complex now than when the Bill was first mooted.  There is a problem in defining how a gas or oil find off our coast or on land can be utilised to the direct benefit of the region in which the find is made. Deputy Ó Caoláin drew attention to this but in few places has an immediate answer been found. All the oil and gas finds exploited by Norway lie off its western and south-western coasts where the greatest development problems are to be found.</P>
      <P>In the Marxist system defended by Deputy Ó Caoláin oil and gas finds in Siberia have not proved to be of enormous benefit to the people living there and they did not have a choice until recently about whether they were unionised. There has not been massive economic development in Siberia on the basis of oil or gas money. While we may regret that the capitalist system has not found a way to make a direct link, the Marxist system has signally failed to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that one of those systems has failed utterly I hope we can leave it out of the equation entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin made a relevant point on which he is wrong.  On regionalisation, he drew a distinction between EU funds and other sources of funding.  It is not correct to say that the regionalisation proposal the Government is apparently considering deals only with EU funds. <Col N="1005" /> Even in areas where the maximum level of EU funding is made available it is necessary to provide matching funds.  Where EU funding is provided at any level there is also a requirement for national funding to be made available, usually from the Exchequer, sometimes from another public agency and in many cases from the private sector.  European Union funds never provide 100 per cent of the funding required for a project.  It is not helpful to distinguish between regionalisation for EU funding purposes and a regional designation for any other reason.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the difficulty I have with the Bill.  It identifies seven counties but the Government is currently discussing proposals which apply to 13 counties, the seven included in the Bill and six others.  How will these fit together? How will the work of the proposed Western Development Commission fit in with the work of whatever bodies are set up if the Government proceeds with its regionalisation proposals?  How does this fit with other regional structures currently in place?  It is difficult to envisage how they will all mesh together.</P>
    <P>I carefully examined the Minister of State's Second Stage speech on this Bill.  In the Official Report, 1 October 1998, vol.  494, col.  754 he said:</P>
    <P>The function of the commission essentially is to promote the economic and social development of the western region by collaborating with and promoting strategic linkages between the existing agencies operating in the region.  &mdash; The commission's role in working closely with the other economic and social actors in the region will facilitate the elaboration of a specific regional response to specific regional problems. In addition, the western investment fund, which will be operated by the commission, will provide financial support for social and economic projects being implemented in the region. &mdash; The commission is being established to further enhance, not undermine or dilute, the development efforts of other agencies operating in the region.</P>
    <P>Does that mean these other agencies will continue to work as they do now?  Does it mean, for example, that the county enterprise boards in the counties concerned will continue to have their current remit?</P>
    <P>The establishment of the commission means that another level of activity will be superimposed on what already exists.  However, the commission may have other functions also.  The Minister of State referred to a forum of western Ministers. He said: &ldquo;The co-ordinating fora will permit the elaboration of a coherent regional strategy with appropriate consultation and contact between the various State agencies.  ..&rdquo;. What will happen under the other proposals the Government is currently considering?</P>
    <P>I assume there will be some type of regional body or authority.  I have heard suggestions that the functions or attributes of existing regional authorities in those areas will be changed to <Col N="1006" /> accommodate the regionalisation proposals the Government is considering with regard to the Objective One definition.  They would operate in the areas covered by the Western Development Commission and in areas not covered by the commission. How will these fit together?  There is a danger of having too many agencies doing the same thing but each with different concerns, thus producing a less than optimal result.</P>
    <P>I can offer the House an example.  County enterprise boards have a mandate to assist the development of small scale enterprises in their areas.  There is a limit on the amount of aid or the size of project with which the boards can get involved.  The proposed Western Development Commission will be able to fund projects to a maximum of £250,000.  To go beyond that figure the commission must get the agreement of the Minister for Finance.  However, in the counties where the Western Development Commission will operate there will be another body or source of funding, the EU Structural Funds, which have no lower or upper limits.  They can operate across the spectrum.</P>
    <P>I hope the Agenda 2000 proposals will provide for block grants to local authorities which could be used by county enterprise boards to assist development in each county and give autonomy to decision making in those counties.  However, has anybody worked out how all these elements will mesh to the maximum advantage of the counties concerned?  There is nothing in the Bill to provide for such co-ordination.  The Minister of State said the commission will have certain co-ordinating functions but these are not made clear in the Bill.  It is difficult to see who or what will be co-ordinated and what the effect of that will be.</P>
    <P>When speaking about the functions of the commission the Minister of State seemed to touch on some of the difficulties.  He spoke of the provision in section 8 for financial assistance:</P>
    <P>Section 8 also provides that financial assistance will be in the form of the purchase of shares and the provision of loans in suitable investments.  Grant aid is already being provided under various programmes operating on a national basis.  Where strategic sustainable projects, of an economic or social nature, are being developed the commission will be able to provide a further complementary means of financial support by taking out equity or providing loans.  This intervention will result in development projects being undertaken which otherwise might not have been launched.</P>
    <P>That raises a series of questions.  The commission will purchase shares or provide loans for suitable investments.  That will be in addition to grants. Will the commission take the place of the private promoter in economic projects?  I am not referring to social projects because there is a different frame of judgment for those.  It appears it will, although the Bill provides that where the commission takes out shares the enterprise may not <Col N="1007" /> become a subsidiary of the commission.  That is a sensible provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State expects that this type of intervention will result in development projects being undertaken which otherwise might not have been launched.  Why might they not have been launched otherwise?  Is it because they would not be bankable and nobody else would provide the type of loan the commission will provide? Is it because nobody else will make the equity investment the commission will make?  If that is the case, there will be a great deal of argument and the commission will be obliged to be hard headed in its judgments.  This provision is an invitation &mdash; there is plenty of experience in this regard throughout this country and the world &mdash; for the Western Development Commission to bail out projects that are basically uneconomic. Otherwise, as the Minister of State said, this intervention would not result in development projects being undertaken which would otherwise not have been launched.  In other words, where people cannot raise the money commercially or cannot get equity partners in the market in the normal way, the commission will step in.  The commission will be in great danger of making loans and taking shares in projects of doubtful viability.  That will be the source of much contention and argument and probably, as the Minister of State knows, much ill founded political slanging. Inevitably people will attribute commission decisions to influence of one kind or another, and since the conspiracy theory of life is always more interesting than the reality, these stories will gain currency very quickly.  That provision will cause the commission a great deal of difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State proposes an amendment to section 8(2) which deals with infrastructure. That is probably very wise.  He proposes to limit the commission to infrastructural investment that is necessary and required by the nature of a project itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State stated:</P>
    <P>to identify business and social enterprises and projects, and infrastructural projects related to those projects that . should be accelerated . to promote foster and encourage the provision, maintenance, and if appropriate, the enlargement of, and procure the provision of assistance for such infrastructural projects, both local and regional, as it considers necessary or expedient for the purposes of economic and social development in the Western Region.</P>
    <P>This part of the commission's job will involve being a lobby group for the counties in its remit. I see nothing wrong with that, but the commission is being invited to make proposals which it cannot bring to fruition.  The commission will be very limited when it comes to infrastructure, but it is being invited to promote and foster local and regional projects as it considers necessary and expedient for the purposes of economic and social development in the region.  It is being <Col N="1008" /> invited to promote infrastructural projects that it cannot carry out by itself.  There is nothing wrong with it being a lobby group, but we should understand that will be its function.</P>
    <P>It seems the commission will have a function in shaping Government or regional policy on major infrastructural projects.  Does the Minister of State believe there is any point in doing that? Will the commission be doing something no other body is doing?  That does not seem to be the case. There has been much debate on the provision of infrastructure, and there is a good deal of dissatisfaction with what we now perceive as some of the plans.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donal Carey's contribution on 1 October mentioned one of the central problems. The National Roads Authority recently produced its executive summary &mdash; a wonderful phrase &mdash; in which map 6.3 is called, &ldquo;Network of National Roads: Indicative Baskets of Future Needs&rdquo;.  It sets out in glorious technicolour the improvement needs identified by the National Roads Authority up to 2019.  One of the major infrastructural projects any self-respecting western development commission would come up with would be major road improvements at least from Donegal to Sligo, Tuam, Ennis, Limerick and on to Rosslare, the western crescent route, as some call it.</P>

      <P>If the Minister of State wishes. That route has been the subject of ill founded, unfavourable comment from those who live south of it.  The south has as much to gain from that route as any other part of the country.  However, there are no proposals in the National Roads Authority plans for that route.  There is every possible type of classification along that route. Some parts are identified as backlog and others as phase one, two, three or four, with phase four relating to 2015 to 2019.  If the Western Development Commission is to make an impact, it should accelerate the urgency attached to the development of the western crescent route and, if possible, that should also be done for the railways.  If the commission does not succeed and does not have that function in relation to whoever draws up the policy on the Objective One region &mdash; if that is what we have &mdash; it will not meet our expectations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not specify the type of skills necessary for members of the commission. Section 9 deals with membership but does not state anything about the types of skills those members should have.  Section 19 allows the commission to set up various committees and to advise them, but there is no indication of what types of people will be involved.  I invite the Minister of State to consider, between now and Committee Stage, taking a leaf out of the book of previous legislation and give us some indication of <Col N="1009" /> the kinds of skills and contributions he is seeking from the commission's members.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Bille seo, An Bille um Choimisiún Forbartha an Iarthair.  Ta sé thar am go ndéanfaimis rud éigin mar seo mar tuigimid uilig go bhfuil géarghá le cás speisialta a dhéanamh d'iarthar na hÉireann maidir le forbairt eacnamaíochta agus sóisialta de.  Tuigeann gach duine againn anois nach bhfuil forbairt eacnamaíochta agus forbairt sóisialta iarthar na hÉireann ag dul ar aghaidh chomh gasta is atá sé i gcodanna eile den tír, anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath, mar shampla, i gcúige Laighean agus i gcúige Mumhan.  Tá sé sin léirithe go maith sna staitisticí uilig atá curtha ar fáil.  Ó thaobh infheistíochta, dífhostaíochta, aois agus seirbhísí eile de níl an t-iarthar chomh forbartha le h-oirthear na tíre nó indeed deisceart na tíre.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom an tAire Stáit Noel Davern a mholadh as an Bille seo a thabhairt os comhair na Dála ag an am seo.  Tá ullmhúcháin go leor déanta le deich mbliana anuas.  Is dócha gurb é an chéad ullmhúchán mór nó an chéad chéim a tugadh chun an Bille seo a thabhairt isteach ná ag tús na nócaidí nuair a tháinig buíon feirmeoirí ó Bhaile Locha Riach &mdash; an baile as a dtagann mo chomhleacaí Ulick Burke &mdash; le chéile mar go raibh imní iontach mór orthu faoi cad a bhí chun tarlú dóibh féin agus dá gclann ins na blianta amach romhainn.  Sílim gurb é an chéad rud eile ná gur dhein siad teangbháil leis na hEaspaig san iarthar.  Is cuimhin liom féin mar ionadaí poiblí gur chuamar go dtí cruinniú mór roinnt blianta ó shin i Sligeach agus bhí cruinniú mór eile i gCnoc Mhuire i gContae Mhaigheo agus ceann eile i nGaillimh.</P>
      <P>Bhí siad seo eagraithe ag na hEaspaig.  Léirigh siad cé chomh hainnis, chomh holc agus chomh dona is a bhí cúrsaí in iarthar na hÉireann agus an géar-ghá a bhí ann le rud éigin cinnte a dhéanamh chomh tapaidh agus a thiocfadh linn.  Ghlac an Taoiseach a bhí ann ag an am Albert Reynolds suim ann, mar a bheadh tú ag súil leis mar ba dhuine ó iarthar na hÉireann é féin.  Mar thoradh ar an suim sin ag an iar-Thaoiseach sílim gur bunaíodh Bord Forbartha Páirtnéirecht an Iarthair. Bhí sé sin ag gníomhú ar feadh tamaill agus nuair a d'imigh an Teachta Reynolds as oifig agus tháinig an Teachta Bruton isteach in oifig in a dhiaidh sin lean seisean ar aghaidh leis an obair. Ansin sa deireadh tháinig an tuairisc amach &mdash;&ldquo;The Challenge &mdash; A Positive Future to Action.&rdquo; Ceann de na rudaí a moladh ansin ná go gcuirfí Coimisiún Forbartha an Iarthair ar bun.  Cé go bhfuil cúpla bliain imithe ó tháinig an tuairisc sin amach ar a laghad tá an Bille ag dul tríd an Oireachtais anois agus sílim gur céim mhór ar aghaidh é sin.  Sílim nuair a bheidh an coimisiún ar bun agus ag gníomhú go reachtúil go dtabharfaidh sé buntáistí móra don iarthar chun cur ar a gcumas teacht aníos go dtí an caighdeán atá sa chuid eile den tír.  Tá go leor le déanamh ón taobh sin de.  Tá bord sealadach ar an choimisiún faoi láthair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> I welcome the fact that the board, which is currently acting in a temporary capacity, has two members from Donegal.  Our efficient county manager, Michael McLoone, is a pioneer in development and has done excellent work in Donegal since he took up that position some years ago.  He went ahead with decentralisation throughout the county and services are now available to people living in the west, north and south of the county.  I understand contracts were signed yesterday to build new offices.  I have no doubt Mr. McLoone will be a tremendous asset to the board with his experience.</P>
    <P>North of the county, Seán Tighe, the current chairman, knows the difficulties facing industries in Donegal.  He has made a success of the shirt industry in Buncrana which employs several hundred people.  The west is lagging behind the rest of the country in development but when the board is operational and given the necessary powers and resources, it will go a long way towards improving the economic and social development of the west and the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Commission is one aspect of what is required to develop the west and the other is granting Objective One status to the west, the Border counties and the midlands. Other Members have spoken on this issue before but, coming from Donegal, I must highlight the importance of this application being made by the Government and of it being granted.  Donegal has twice the national average level of unemployment, at 20 per cent, as against less than 10 per cent in the rest of the country.  That is a frightening statistic.  One of the reasons Donegal has such high unemployment levels is that we do not have the infrastructure to underpin the necessary economic development to sustain employment in the county.  Unless we qualify for Objective One status for the coming five or six years, that will be much more difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>I was in Brussels last Thursday week with a number of my Fine Gael colleagues.  We were surprised to hear that no indication has yet been given that the Government intends to apply for Objective One status, although listening to the Taoiseach in the House yesterday and also last week it appears there may be a rethink in Government circles in that regard and that the application will be made.</P>
    <P>There are many projects in Donegal which will not be completed unless we continue to avail of regional and Cohesion Funds.  For example, the Donegal Bay sewerage project and approximately six other sewerage schemes have not gone ahead because of unavailability of funding.  Unless we are granted Objective One status for the coming five years, those schemes will not be completed. I refer to major towns like Killybegs, Donegal Town, Ballyshannon, Bundoran and Glencolumbkille where nothing is happening and that will remain the position unless this funding is made available.</P>
    <P>Another group of sewerage schemes, the Gaeltacht group, comprising Gweedore, Burtonport <Col N="1011" /> and Ardara are in the same position.  These schemes have little chance of being completed over the next five to ten years unless we continue to avail of Objective One funding for the west and for Donegal.</P>
    <P>The unemployment problem is critical in these areas.  Members will be aware of the difficulties facing the county in the immediate future in that hundreds of jobs in Fruit of the Loom might be in danger.  If those jobs are lost, it will exacerbate an already serious problem.  The IDA produced an excellent report in 1997 in which it stated that 15,000 new jobs were created throughout the eight regions of the country, but only 279 of those jobs were created in the north west region which includes Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.  That is 279 out of 15,000 nationally &mdash; less than 1 per cent or 2 per cent &mdash; and the figure tells its own story. Overall, there was a net reduction in IDAassisted job creation in the north west.</P>
    <P>I know of areas in my constituency where very few jobs were created by the IDA over the past ten to 15 years.  In one area in particular, which comprises the Finn Valley, Ballybofey, Stranorlar, Castlefinn and Killygorden, very few jobs have been created and many people are obliged to travel to Northern Ireland to find employment. In my own area, the Gaeltacht, we are dependent on Udurás na Gaeltachta.  Action is being taken and more jobs are being created than lost.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Western Development Commission is in operation as soon as possible in conjunction with granting Objective One status for the west.  I have a map which has been supplied by those who have been promoting this status for the west.  It shows that in the past four or five years the regional and Cohesion Funds to 13 counties in the west, along the Border and in the midlands amounted to £1.683 billion whereas the funds for the rest of the country amounted to almost £4 billion.  This is an indication that we are lagging behind the rest of the country when it comes to investment.  If we get Objective One status at least moneys will be targeted in areas that qualify.  When Deputy Belton and I were in Brussels our eyes opened on learning that regions in the United Kingdom, such as Devon, Cornwall, Wales, Merseyside, the Highlands and the islands of Scotland, had already submitted their applications. They have permanent offices in Brussels promoting their case.  We were dejected that nothing had happened so far as the regionalisation of the west, the North and Border counties were concerned.  I hope there will be a change of mind and that the Government will indicate its intention to follow this route.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Western Development Commission Bill which is long overdue.  Given the resources being made available it will go a long way.  We will not catch up on years of neglect in five or ten years but at least there is a recognition that work has to be done.  When the resources are provided, I have no doubt the situation will improve in the west and in the Border counties <Col N="1012" /> which have suffered from lack of investment in the past 30 years because of the difficulties in Northern Ireland.  I hope the Western Development Commission, Objective One status and the peace process can change the economic and social climate in these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, wish the Minister well and assure him of support for every initiative he and the commission take in the interests of the development of the west.  The purpose of the Western Development Commission is to promote economic and social development in the western counties.  It has its origins in a neighbouring parish where four people came together in the early 1990s, as a result of a series of setbacks mainly in the farming activities which they had carried on down through the years.  Fintan Muldoon, the oldest of the group, had witnessed hardship and change over many years which resulted in apathy among the younger generation. The result was a declining population, low marriage rates, ageing agricultural population and outward migration from east Galway, all of which indicated a bleak future.</P>
      <P>He and the other founder members, namely, John Mahony, Michael Kelly and Pat Gohery met with Bishop John Kirby &mdash; after a confirmation ceremony in the parish &mdash; and outlined the serious situation in rural parishes in the west. Bishop Kirby had witnessed this during his parish visitation programme.  This led to the Developing the West Together initiative, pioneered through the western bishops.  After a series of meetings in parish halls and in urban areas it produced a report entitled A Crusade for Survival in the 1990s.  This was one of many reports.  There had been many academic reports prior to this but unfortunately they are on the shelves gathering dust.  Unlike other reports, this report identified solutions and sought a Government response.  A task force was set up which recommended the establishment of a Western Development Partnership Board with a direction to produce an action plan for economic and social development. Its action plan, The Challenge: a Positive Future Through Action, was published in 1995 and forms the basis of the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The journey from the four farmers' initiative to the introduction of the Bill was a long one.  Sadly these four individuals have only minimal involvement in the group and its workings today.  I am concerned that the function of the commission which is to promote economic and social development in the western region may be lost by collaborating with and promoting strategic links between the existing agencies.  Will the Government give a positive financial commitment, much greater than the £25 million designated?  How can any worthwhile response be made to specific regional problems without additional finance?  If the investment fund is not increased we will end up with just another talking shop.  This would be disastrous for all concerned.  It is important to <Col N="1013" /> avoid duplication or competition with the activities of other agencies.</P>
    <P>The great potential of this commission will be lost in further red tape if the functions outlined in section 8 are not put into practice without duplication.  Inevitably there will be tensions in the regions between existing agencies.  What co-ordination will be involved in allowing the IDA, the new IRDs, the county development agencies and all the existing agencies, all of which are grappling for crumbs from Government, to help or initiate work to develop the west?  Unless the Western Development Commission is properly nurtured and guided it will fall flat on its face. Existing agencies have failed over the years to make an impact &mdash; I am not criticising them for their endeavours &mdash; on the real problems in many parts of the west, particularly the peripheral and marginal areas outside the major urban areas of Galway, such as Castlebar, where there has been a total lack of development.  What pushed the four people involved into action was the absence of local agencies.  Existing agencies were outside their reach and they could not get to those people to seek help.  They were demanding help and yet nobody responded.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a difficult task in reacting positively to the demands.  It is important that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food is to the forefront in this initiative given that we are talking about rural communities. I wholeheartedly welcome the fact that the Department of Agriculture and Food was given responsibility for this commission.  I know the Minister of State will have a great input and will divert all his energies to focusing on the work of the commission to improve the lot of the rural population, the area of greatest need.  The other agencies cater adequately for the needs of urban areas.</P>
    <P>A vicious debate is developing about the granting of Objective One status to the western, Border and midland counties and unless it is quenched it will wreck our country.  If it is not quenched the urban/rural and east/west divides will continue to fester.  It is unfortunate that even the unions have got involved in this to the detriment of the west.  We want to hear union members in the west speaking to those who have voiced very strong opposition to the west and the other regions getting Objective One status.  For too long we in the west have gone without and suffered because of the honeypot attitude of various Governments to Dublin and its immediate environs.</P>
    <P>The Government now has an opportunity to put forward a plan.  As Deputy McGinley said, I was horrified to be told the Government has not made a formal or informal application.  We have only one last bite at the cherry and time is running out for the Government to demand and put the case for Objective One status for the west and the other areas.</P>
    <P>If we do not get that status it will be impossible for this commission to function without resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> The initial funding of £25 million which has been outlined for it is far short of the £100 million designated by the previous Government.  I know there will be two provisions in the current year and five in the following years, and that it will be reviewed in the current year, which is very welcome. However, I hope the Minister will provide substantial funding so that the commission will have a positive start.  A lack of funding and initiative will cause it to fall flat on its face.</P>
    <P>Organisations such as the National Roads Authority are strangled when they pass the pale. They do not understand the need to improve infrastructure outside Dublin and its immediate environs.  We have been waiting for the best part of 15 years for Loughrea to be by-passed.  How many other regional water and sewerage schemes are at the design stage and waiting for the final allocation of funding?  We need these projects but they will never take place if the west does not have Objective One status.</P>
    <P>Almost all of us stand together on this matter. We must educate the other people who are making demands and indicate to them that giving Objective One status to the west will not deny them one penny of what they are entitled to in the future.  People conveniently overlook that fact and the onus is on the Government to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>A very welcome aspect of the Bill is the commitment to partnership between Departments, the private sector and business organisations to create employment in the areas which are currently unable to generate or attract basic employment. The recently established IRDs would have received funding from a different Department from the Department of Agriculture and Food in the past.  Now that they are coming within the remit of the Department of Agriculture and Food, where will they get the funding to allow them to do the positive work which they have planned, initiated and reported on?  The people who supported them by private investment, through shares and so on, are wondering if it is another example of establishing a talking shop. They want to see results.  The Minister should take on board an initiative to fund these organisations because they have put in place many wonderful programmes which are important to the local populations.</P>
    <P>There is also a tourism Bill going through the Houses.  Unless this Western Development Commission Bill provides for tourism in certain parts of the remoter areas in the west, we will be forgotten again by Bord Fáilte, which is more interested in projects in Connemara and Galway city than in the eastern and other areas in the county.  I am sure the position is the same in every other county.  Bord Fáilte focuses all its capital investment and other promotions on certain areas of counties, to the detriment of the other areas. Funding must be provided under this Bill for areas such as the Shannon basin and Lough Derg because it will not be forthcoming from Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> This is not just about jobs and factories but social and economic development in the broadest sense.  This whole initiative started in east County Galway.  We have been reaching out over the years to Bord Fáilte, looking for recognition of our existence and for funding for east Galway. Will the Minister ensure that money is directed into that area for the development of tourism, which will provide new opportunities for people to remain in rural Ireland, particularly east Galway?</P>
    <P>Everyone can see the frightening statistics on population decline and the withdrawal of services. The link railway line from Loughrea to the Dublin-Galway line was closed years ago.  The &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo; in Garda stations is tangible evidence of the response to declining populations but it has not stopped the growth of crime in the area and it must be looked at again.  National schools have closed and bus services have been discontinued. These matters must be addressed.  This western initiative must respond quickly and positively to the needs of the people in these areas because otherwise they will leave.  Migration is one of the biggest problems in the west and unless we can stabilise rural populations the ideas of the founding fathers of this movement will be lost and the initiative will be taken over by some of the existing powerful agencies.  I wish the Minister every success with his initiative and hope this House will support the positive actions he will take in the future.</P>

      <P>I am not that lucky. I welcome this initiative.  It is important from the point of view of the west and rural Ireland and is one which a number of people have advocated for some time.  Because of the initiative of the people and the commitment of the last three Government which helped this along at various stages, we are speaking on this Bill.  I agree that the approach being taken will lead to cohesion, co-operation and partnership about which we hear so much.  It is very much in keeping with EU policy.  I am confident it will improve the quality of life in the west, will lead to enterprise and will certainly give hope to those areas.  That is one of the reasons I am addressing this matter today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1981 there was a western development fund for 12 counties, of which County Kerry was one. Looking at the map of Ireland and the west coast, the only county which is left out is County Kerry. Counties Clare, Galway, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal are included.  In light of what is happening <Col N="1016" /> with Objective One status and given that it would appear the country will be regionalised, it is important County Kerry is within the remit of the Western Development Commission.  It is critical for Kerry and I will table an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.  I will implore my colleagues from Kerry on all sides of the House, especially Deputy Healy-Rae, to support me.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of where one goes, County Kerry is regarded as part of the western seaboard.  The fact that it is lumped in with County Cork has resulted in serious disadvantage for Kerry.  We all know the economy, especially that contiguous to Cork city, which has a thriving port and airport, the most vibrant pharmaceutical industry in Europe and an advanced technology industry, is pushing up the GDP in that area.  People in west and north Cork are suffering as a result.  I, however, am looking at it from the viewpoint of County Kerry which is on the western seaboard. I used to teach geography and Kerry is not in the south-west but on the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>Because of the approach taken in this Bill, the infrastructure which will be set up and the structures involved, it is critical for County Kerry to be part of this commission.  I compliment the Minister and his civil servants on the way they drew up this Bill.  Knowing some of the civil servants involved, I am not surprised it is a good document.  I am glad to see some of the people with whom I worked in the past here today.  The outcome of the task force report was very positive, culminating in this Bill of which I want Kerry to be part.</P>
    <P>This is the type of structure which will be funded by Europe in the future.  I liken the western seaboard to the Algarve in Portugal.  Those who have visited Portugal will know what I mean. The Algarve is seen as one district and the west should be treated in the same way, especially from a tourism and agricultural point of view. The west should be promoted as one area from Kenmare to Donegal.  There would be great advantage in promoting the area as one, with Shannon Airport and Kerry County Airport supplying visitors to it.</P>
    <P>We in Kerry are worried that because we are lumped in with Cork, we will be left out and will not be categorised for Objective One status and the Structural Funds which will accrue from 2000-6. There are no income estimates available per county.  The GDP for County Kerry is lumped in with Cork.  The Minister told me in a written reply to a parliamentary question yesterday that household income estimates at county level are not available.  We are getting a wrong impression of the GDP of the Kerry area.  The Minister went on to say that the methodology for compiling county income estimates has been undertaken for the Central Statistics Office by the Economic and Social Research Institute and is currently being analysed.  It is expected that county income estimates for a number of years will be published in mid-1999.  That will be too late for County Kerry. <Col N="1017" /> Last week the Minister told us in the Dáil that a decision on Structural Funds, Objective One areas and regionalisation is not expected until next March.  He confirmed there would be no immediate decision.  Today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> states that last week the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, submitted a memo to Cabinet in support of the Department of Finance's proposal to select 13 counties for Objective One status, that Deputy Harney said there would be increases in the level of State industrial aid for western regions along with higher EU investment if they were allowed to retain Objective One EU grant status for the period 2000-6 and that according to a Government spokesperson last night, a Cabinet decision on the issue is not expected this week.  It is decision time and I am afraid my colleague and friend, Deputy Healy-Rae, and those of us in Kerry will be left at the starting rails and we will become totally isolated.  The recent census report clearly shows a major loss of population from several district electoral divisions in Kerry.  One little village, Tarbert, has lost 120 people since the last census report.</P>
    <P>I will expand on my argument that Kerry should be included within the remit of this Western Development Commission and that the case for Objective One status will have to be made more strongly by Government representatives. On Committee Stage I will push the matter to a vote.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, is no doubt very familiar with Kerry as he has been there on a number of occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is long overdue.  Members have been lobbied on many occasions in recent months by the Council for the West and various bishops who were anxious that the Bill be introduced.  I am glad it has finally come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with my colleagues that there is an undoubted decline in the population of rural Ireland and in village life.  I was born in a village. The lifestyle has changed and people have left <Col N="1018" /> such areas.  The Minister has visited parts of the country since he took office and is aware of the position.  There are townlands on electoral registers where nobody lives, although up to 20 years ago houses there were occupied.  In other areas there may be only one person remaining in a house.  In another ten years, many of those people will be gone and the houses will be closed up.</P>
    <P>This problem also affects County Longford.  I am disappointed that it has not been included in the measures because it has also suffered depopulation. We are anxious to ensure that some industry is brought to the county in the near future.  I am tired calling on the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that an industry locates in Longford.  She appears to announce jobs for the east coast every Sunday evening and I presume an announcement will be made for Cork shortly.  It is very frustrating and disappointing for me as a public representative from Longford that there have been no announcements on the job front for the constituency of Longford-Roscommon.  Local representatives are being castigated by the local media, and rightly so.  People want to know why Longford and Roscommon are left out of the jobs equation.</P>
    <P>County Longford has not been included in the plans for the Western Development Commission and I ask the Minister to reconsider that position. The constituency of Longford-Roscommon has the same problems as western counties.  Undoubtedly, setting up the commission is a step in the right direction.  It is a recognition of the decline in the west.  The previous Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and his predecessor, Deputy Albert Reynolds, recognised that problem.  I commend Deputy John Bruton for starting the work on the commission when he was Taoiseach.  Before that there had been nothing but talk, but it took the then Taoiseach to make proposals and suggestions for the way forward and, at last, the Bill is before the House.</P>
    <P>I am a member of an enterprise board in County Longford.  If people are given an incentive, they will respond.  There must be a recognition that certain areas must get specific treatment. It is vital that the commission is effective, and is seen to be so.  It must get results.  For example, the railway network to the west is a scandal.  The Minister has promised that work will be done on the Mullingar to Longford and Carrick-on-Shannon section of the line.  It is about time this work was done.  Every weekend, as my colleague, Deputy Naughten is aware, the trains are packed. There is not even standing room.  Other areas have a good service and good rolling stock, including the line to the Minister of State's county, and that is fine.  However, again, Longford and Roscommon are on the hind tit in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Government does not know whether it is coming or going with regard to Objective One status.  Conflicting statements have been made by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment as to when a <Col N="1019" /> decision will be reached.  The Government should make up its mind.  We were in Brussels and were told that no word had been received from the Government.  A game plan is involved and the Taoiseach is making it up as he goes along.  He is biding his time and will waffle at the last moment. That is not the way to do business.</P>
    <P>Thirteen counties meet the criteria for qualification so I urge the Minister to ensure that a decision is made at the Cabinet table and passed on to Europe.  This is the only way to deal with the matter.  There is no point waffling or fudging the issue or stating that certain things will be secured and everybody will be happy.  That is not the way the Europeans do business.  I call on the Taoiseach and the Government to make a decision, pass it on to Europe immediately and ensure that Objective One status is secured for those 13 counties.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the bishops on the tremendous work they and the Council for the West did in promoting the Western Development Commission in Government circles.  A commitment was given by this and the previous Government to establish the commission and I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  It is long overdue.</P>
      <P>The commission was established in January 1997, yet it has taken until now to introduce the Bill.  Much valuable time has been lost in terms of the promotion and development of the western counties.  Why did it take so long to publish the legislation given that the heads of the Bill had been approved prior to the previous general election? Much finance and resources could have been invested in the west over the period of the delay.</P>
      <P>I received a letter from a developer who has three foreign investors lined up for a nursery project, subject to the approval of the Western Development Commission which has been provisionally promised.  However, because of the delay in setting up the commission's fund, 25 jobs have not yet been advertised or filled.  Such priorities exist.  The delay in the introduction of the Bill has suppressed development in the region.  If the fund had been established when the heads of the Bill were approved, it is possible that it would not have been necessary to argue for Objective One status at this stage because the west would have had a viable economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the membership of the commission will be expanded to include a representative of the farming community and a representative from County Roscommon.  The commission is based in the county, yet it does not have a representative from the area.  Unless it includes representatives <Col N="1020" /> from all the communities in the western region, we cannot claim the commission is representative.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Belton's point that County Longford should be included.  It has the same statistics as County Roscommon and elsewhere in the west.  The constituency of Longford-Roscommon has been under resourced in the past and I urge the Minister to include County Longford in the commission.  Deputy Belton and I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage to secure the inclusion of County Longford.</P>
    <P>Without Objective One status, the Bill and this debate is futile.  I will not deal with the details of Objective One; I am sure the Minister is aware of them.  However, the Taoiseach made it clear in the House yesterday in reply to a parliamentary question that without Objective One status, there is a restriction on the amount of funds which can be given to parts of the country, particularly the west.  It is crucial that Objective One status is secured.  We will be on a hiding to nothing with the Bill if it is not secured.</P>
    <P>Infrastructure in the western region must be developed.</P>
    <P>Our tourism industry is completely underdeveloped, especially in County Roscommon, which is not even included on Bord Fáilte maps.  We do not have a county town or a road going through the county.  That is how bad tourism promotion is in the county and I hope the Western Development Commission will examine such issues.</P>
    <P>Roads infrastructure has been mentioned by previous speakers.  The Dublin-Westport road is probably the most atrocious national primary route in the country.  It is hugely under-resourced and the National Roads Authority has no plans to develop it in the medium to long term.  There is no point in establishing a commission unless we are willing to commit funds to infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The planning process in the west is a disgrace. It is virtually impossible to get planning permission in County Roscommon and other counties and this problem must be addressed.  The rail network, including the Westport and Sligo lines, is hugely under-resourced.  If we are to get cars off the roads and transport goods to ports in Dublin and Rosslare, we need an adequate, safe rail network, not the dangerous network which currently exists.  The establishment of this commission will be futile without Government support and commitment to infrastructure.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach between the relevant bodies.  We have county enterprise boards, partnership boards, county councils, UDCs and borough councils, Leader boards, semi-State bodies, Bord Fáilte, Forbairt, IDA, Teagasc, Bord Glas &mdash; I could go on.  The Bill does not include a commitment to co-ordinate these agencies.  I hope the Minister of State can clarify the position on Committee Stage and tell us what type of co-ordinating role will be played by the Western Development Commission. Our efforts will be futile unless there is such co-ordination All of these organisations have their own application forms.  People are running <Col N="1021" /> around like headless chickens trying to fill out these forms.  The Minister of State should examine the possibility of a common application form for many of these grants.</P>
    <P>There is much concern about rural housing. Ireland is in the midst of a housing construction boom, yet the number of derelict houses in rural areas is fast increasing.  The first time buyer's grant of £3,000, available to purchasers of newly built houses, has biased the market in favour of building rather than renovating.  This helps to accelerate the flight from rural Ireland to towns and cities.  We need to consider the reintroduction of some form of the reconstruction grant.  To qualify for that grant, recipients would have to show that the house would be their primary dwelling and would undertake to be resident in the house for a guaranteed period after the completion of the work.  If we are to maintain rural communities, initiatives must be introduced to encourage residents to live in rural townlands rather than towns.  The commission must examine this issue.</P>
    <P>We must also look at how to create jobs in rural Ireland.  The IDA and other State agencies try to influence companies to locate in rural areas, and promote the decentralisation of industry. However, the IDA has admitted that investors, not the IDA, decide where to locate the company.  We must provide incentives for people and companies to invest in rural areas.  The best way of doing so is through changes in the tax code.  We have seen the impact of urban renewal schemes.  We need a similar scheme aimed at attracting investors to rural areas.  I hope the Minister of State is pushing the case for the Shannon corridor and for urban renewal in towns throughout the country.  The EU is seeking to halt these initiatives and I urge the Minister of State to press his colleagues to ensure that both schemes are approved.  They are crucial to the development of rural communities.</P>
    <P>We also need to examine grant aid for farmers involved in alternative enterprises.  The Leader programme is unable to accomplish this because of restrictions.  We need to examine what alternative enterprises should be funded.  We have serious problems in agriculture.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at the telecommunications infrastructure.  The Minister of State should ask the Western Development Commission to establish a skills register for every town in the west.  Many people in urban centres, particularly Dublin, would be willing to live in the west where there is cheap accommodation and where they would be returning to their communities, if jobs were available.  If we are to attract industry we must show that we have qualified people available. A company which initially located in Castlerea, County Roscommon, moved to Galway because it could not get people with the requisite technical skills.  If we are to encourage technical industries to set up in the west, we must ensure that we have people who are willing to leave Dublin and take up these jobs in their home <Col N="1022" /> communities.  I urge the Minister of State to examine these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind on this Bill. It will add to the confusion about commissions and agencies of which we have an abundance. People are confused about whom to apply to and where to go if they wish to get something done. Many people in rural areas are anxious to get up and going.  Opportunities exist but they have not filtered down to the Border region and the west.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about these proposals as there is no co-ordinated approach.  This proposal will lead to further fragmentation.  The western region includes Sligo and Leitrim.  However, these counties are also included in the Border region.  Sligo and Leitrim have a choice of two regions. However, if they are taken out of the Border region we will have Donegal on the north, Cavan and Monaghan in the centre and Louth to the extreme east.  County Louth can benefit from the major developments taking place in the east and south east as a result of the peace process.  This leaves Cavan-Monaghan in no man's land and without representation.  Where do we belong?  We do not belong to the west.  The Border region will be fragmented.</P>
      <P>There is an opportunity for the Government to put all these apples into the one barrel so that people will know where they stand and what is available to them.  This will be achieved by obtaining Objective One status for the 13 counties of the Border, west and midlands regions. Objective One status will create a co-ordinated region and provide funding so that these counties can develop in the same way as the rest of the country.  The position is totally imbalanced.  I am delighted to see the Minister of State nodding in agreement.  However, not all of his colleagues agree.  There seems to be a major split in the Government.  The Tánaiste has stated that an application has been made, yet the Taoiseach told the House that no application has been made.  On this occasion the Taoiseach is telling the truth &mdash; an application has not been made.</P>
      <P>I recently visited Brussels with Fine Gael colleagues as we were concerned about what was happening.  I was amazed and annoyed when told by Commissioner Wulf-Mathies that no formal or informal application had been made on Objective One status for the Border or western regions.  The EU has had no contact from the Government, yet Objective One status is available.  We qualify for that status as we are at 68 per cent of GNP &mdash; the cut off point is 75 per cent.  We do not welcome this statistic but it is the reality.  What is the Government doing about this issue which is vital if the rest of the country is to catch up on the developments in Dublin?  One can see the gridlock in Dublin caused by the imbalance of development over many years.  There is ample space and opportunity in the west, the midlands and the Border regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Objective One status is vital.  As Minister of State with responsibility for rural development, <Col N="1023" /> Deputy Davern should indicate where he stands on this issue.  The Minister of State's brief also includes the issue of milk quotas.  This could involve a peace initiative for farmers in the Border region who were handicapped by the difficulties which I do not have time to mention.  These are two vital issues along with infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>If funding is made available there are no better people to grasp the opportunities.  However, without the opportunities we are going nowhere.  This is not acceptable.  It is time that those who have been left behind are given the opportunity to catch up.  We are not taking bread from anyone's plate when it comes to Objective One status.  No one will be penalised.  The rest of the country can continue its development if the Government goes for Objective One status.  I hope the Minister of State will give a positive answer to these issues at a later stage.</P>

Does he agree this proposal is a very bizarre one arising from an air of uncertainty in relation to the funding and development of tourism post 1999?  Will he outline his views on the proposal to introduce a room tax?  There is no point in saying it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or the Minister for Finance.  If they were to agree to the introduction of such a tax, surely the Minister would agree it would do untold damage to the development and marketing of Irish tourism.  It has already done severe damage in that many of the international media have picked up on the proposal.  For the sake of tourism, will the Minister issue a clear condemnation of the proposal?</P>

The Deputy is aware that the last tranche of Structural Funds did not become available until late 1994. He is also aware that my Department needs advance knowledge of the Structural Funds which will become available as marketing has to be done a year beforehand.  The Deputy's question is relevant but the documents are being discussed with ITIC.  A number of proposals have been brought forward by us and the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware of my deep personal concern with regard to the use of performance enhancing drugs in sport and my initiative in launching Ireland's first ever national sports anti-doping programme.  All recognised national governing bodies of sport have been circularised with the details and will be involved over the coming months in consultations with the Irish Sports Council which will oversee delivery of the programme.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the programme go beyond testing to incorporate assisting in the education of our young athletes to the dangers inherent in drug taking.  While the programme will be voluntary in nature, public funding will be withheld from any national governing body of sport or any individual athlete who opts out of participation, or if participating breaches any element of rules governing its operation.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the IRFU has been very much to the fore in its support of my proposals for a national sports anti-doping programme. However, I have not been in direct contact specifically with regard to recent allegations against some Irish rugby players because these cases are being investigated under the relevant national and international governing body's own rules and regulations and are not, therefore, a matter for discussion or communication between the union and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the publication of his Bill today, a section of which deals with anti-doping.  Does the Minister agree the allegations &mdash; some may be unfounded and unwarranted, but some have given rise to concern for all of us &mdash; are doing irreparable damage to the image of sport in the country and that it is imperative that he hold meetings with the various sporting federations in Ireland to ensure the code, which is voluntary, is used to make every effort to rid all sport of this extraordinary phenomenon of performance enhancing drugs?  I know the Minister shares the concern of the House in this regard.  While action is being taken elsewhere by international and other governing bodies, does he think it would be appropriate for him to initiate these discussions?  The Minister has responsibility for assisting some of these groups through funding and must report to the Oireachtas in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been dramatic changes in sport over the past 20 years.  Commercialism and professionalism have resulted in a dramatic change and have changed the sporting environment, probably forever.  Where once the honour of participation was the main theme, there are now huge financial rewards available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> Consequently, one result can mean the difference between obscurity and huge financial reward. People would have been naive to believe that drugs would not enter the sporting arena.</P>
    <P>The Bill referred to by the Deputy is attempting to return to the ideal of participation being more important than winning.  I am a realist, particularly in the context of the huge sums of money involved.  Winning at any cost is totally unacceptable.  The Bill deals with doping in sport and there is no reason I should meet the rugby union, the specific federation involved. This might be a matter for the select committee of which the Deputy is a member.</P>
    <P>The anti-doping Bill includes a paragraph concerning an independent body which will deal with the whole area of doping in sport.  I do not believe sportsmen should investigate themselves, just as I believe doctors should not investigate doctors, etc.  Investigative bodies must be fully independent; setting up independent bodies within federations is not the proper way of going forward. Therefore, I have established an independent body which will be chaired by a high profile medical person and which will take control of the area. The body will be totally independent of the sports council and the Minister.</P>
    <P>My role is not one of telling the federations what to do.  I do not believe the Minister should tell federations and national governing bodies how to act.  The bodies should see this themselves in the light of the events which have occurred.</P>
    <P>All bodies have already been circularised with the intention that they should change their constitutions immediately by introducing anti-doping measures and severe penalties for those caught taking performance enhancing drugs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed the Minister said he should not meet the national federations, etc.  and that the select committee of which Deputy Ferris is a member could meet them if it wished.  The Minister should provide political leadership in this issue which is vital to sport.  Does he agree the vacuum which has existed for many years has made Irish sports men and women vulnerable to allegations and that the failure to introduce a national drug testing and education programme has brought about this vulnerability?  Why has there been such a long delay?  The Minister has been in office for a year and a half and everything was almost ready when the Government changed. He made an announcement some months ago but the programme will not be introduced until next year.  Is there a problem with resources?</P>
      <P>I am amazed the Minister has not met the IRFU in the midst of the controversy.  I thought he would provide the political leadership and urge the IRFU to name and shame those guilty of staining the name of Irish sport across the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister use his political influence to address the allegations that schools are urging some of their top sports students to use creatine, a muscle building substance?  It is not an illegal <Col N="1028" /> substance, but its use creates an air of acceptance of performance enhancing substances which will encourage young people to use stronger drug enhancing substances.  The Minister should show political leadership by ensuring schools do not encourage students to use such substances.</P>
    <P>All the national federations were urged to include a scheme of penalties in their respective constitutions at a seminar held in north Dublin in 1996.  How many of them have done that?  Have the top four associations, the FAI, the IRFU, the GAA and the BLE, included it in their constitutions and, if not, why not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The future credibility of sport will depend on the success and efforts that will be made by Governments to develop and implement the new methods that have been brought forward. The select committee has proved to be an exceptional way of getting results on particular issues of importance, many of which have been raised by the Deputy in the House.  The select committee has the necessary powers to call in the IRFU and that matter can be addressed at that level. There is little to be gained by my meeting members of the IRFU.  It should be called before the select committee on which all parties are represented and the Deputy can voice his opinion at that time.</P>
      <P>The IRFU, the GAA, the BLE and the FAI indicated their willingness to co-operate with the new scheme.  I am not aware if a scheme of penalties has been included in their constitutions, but I told them it is compulsory to include that facet.</P>
      <P>There has been a delay in introducing the proposed Bill because the heads of the Bill have to be approved by Government and it then has to be drafted and published, and the publication of a Bill can take two to three weeks.  The Deputy is aware of the process involved in bringing forward a Bill.  There were no resources available for this purpose until the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, allocated resources for it in last year's budget.  A Bill can be brought forward only when sufficient resources have been allocated for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised questions about the use of creatine and that is the subject of another question. I would be wary of its use.  It is an amino acid found in muscle and it has been used to strengthen the heart muscle.  There have been recent newspaper reports on its varied uses.  I would rule against the taking of that substance, particularly by students, and I would be loathe to tell them to use it.  I am pleased the Deputy raised that question.  I would not favour the use of any drugs in sport.  The use of creatine has not been banned by the International Olympic Council and there was some controversy about its use in the summer.  I urge people to be very careful about using all drugs, including creatine.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation</askee>
      <Quest>if he has met Bord Fáilte to discuss its failure to implement key recommendations related to the marketing of tourism as contained in a report (details supplied).</Quest>
      <QRef>[20646/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Government's decision in November 1994 to accept the recommendations contained in the A. D. Little review of Bord Fáilte, the board proceeded with their implementation.  Central to the ADL recommendations is the proposal that Bord Fáilte should concentrate and devote its resources to the core roles of promoting and marketing Ireland overseas as a tourist destination, helping the less mature elements of the industry develop and providing information to industry decision makers.  To this end, a new mission statement and list of functions was drawn up and a new management structure put in place.  A new international marketing director and new general manager Europe were appointed along with 20 new marketing staff in order to fill skill gaps.  Furthermore, several non-core activities were outsourced, such as the registration and grading functions in respect of certain types of accommodation, tourism product approvals, publication of the Discover Ireland series, majority ownership and operation of the Gulliver information and reservation service, and responsibility for the Tidy Towns Competition.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, I have had a number of opportunities to meet the board, the chairman and chief executive of Bord Fáilte to discuss a range of issues, including follow up to certain ADL recommendations.  The board of Bord Fáilte recently endorsed a revised senior management structure for the organisation, introduced by its new chief executive, which, I understand, is intended to optimise the position and resources of the board so that it can best serve the needs of the industry in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Arthur D. Little report recommends that 20 marketing executives at graduate level should be appointed to market our tourism industry throughout Europe and the United States.  How many of those 20 marketing executives are still employed by Bord Fáilte?  I understand it has not retained that number and that the <Col N="1030" /> number may have fallen to eight, which contravenes the report's recommendation.  As Bord Fáilte approaches the next tourist season, why has a head of marketing not been appointed, given that it is nine or ten months since the previous post holder resigned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The A. D. Little report is concise, it extends to 30 pages and it should be available to all those involved in the industry.  It recommends the hiring of a new international marketing manager and the introduction of new blood. That has been taking place since the report was published.  The report states that the industry should play a greater role in tourism promotion. The State should also be involved, but the State is highly placed on a graph in this regard when the industry should occupy that position.  We are gradually handing over more responsibility for this area to the industry.  Twenty marketing executives were taken on, but I do not know the number that have been retained.  There has not been a dramatic change in the number employed in the marketing sphere.  New blood has been introduced into Bord Fáilte and a new chief executive has been appointed.  As I stated in the reply, a new structure has been introduced in Bord Fáilte.  It recently endorsed a revised senior management structure for the organisation.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that marketing represents the future for Bord Fáilte.  That is indicated in the A. D. Little report and marketing should be its forte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are just words.  The Arthur D. Little report is clear in its recommendation that 20 marketing executives should be appointed to Bord Fáilte.  It may have appointed 20 when the report was published, but how many of those are still employed? The Minister should know that information. The Minister did not answer the other question I asked.  Why has the position of head of marketing in Bord Fáilte not been filled, given that it is nearly 12 months since the previous post holder resigned?  As Bord Fáilte approaches the next tourist season, why has the position of head of marketing not been filled?  If the Minister were to check the position, I am sure he would find that not even half the number of marketing executives recommended in the report are employed in marketing.  The report's key recommendation for the marketing section has been ignored.  The words used by the Minister in regard to marketing Ireland ring hollow because they have not been translated into action.  Will he be more precise?</P>

      <P>While I did not meet the representatives of the leading sporting organisations in regard to their development plans immediately prior to the Taoiseach's announcement, I confirm that the executive chairman of the Sports Council has been in regular contact with these bodies in the context of their overall development and their five year strategic plans for their respective sports.  Certain organisations have indicated that the provision of stadia is under active consideration.</P>
      <P>I have, of course, over recent months had opportunities to meet leading figures of major sporting bodies on an individual basis and, inevitably, the need for appropriate stadia was discussed informally.  These conversations were informative and were most helpful in my discussions with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  As the Deputy is aware, the outcome of all these considerations was the Government decision to set up the steering committee to explore thoroughly all aspects of a stadium for the new century, particularly in light of the prospect of generous support for the project from individuals in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representatives of the national governing bodies were appointed to the steering committee which will oversee the feasibility study for the stadium and through that process will have the opportunity to bring their own perspectives to bear on the subject.  As Minister for Sport, I am immensely pleased to be associated with this initiative.  I am also certain that the approach we are taking is right.  The steering committee includes people of the very highest calibre and I <Col N="1032" /> am confident that its work over the next eight months or so will equip the Government with advice of the highest quality in order to help it decide on the best way forward in pursuit of the overall objective.</P>

      <P>I am a great believer in the saying, &ldquo;there is no such thing as a free lunch&rdquo; and I am always very suspicious of people who offer £50 million for a project through their own generosity. Did the Taoiseach have any discussions or meetings with the FAI, IRFU, BLE and Cumann Lúthchleas Gael before this announcement?  I tabled these questions for answer by the Taoiseach but they were transferred to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  Did the Taoiseach talk to the FAI and the IRFU, for example, before he sidelined their projects which were at an advanced stage?  What discussions took place with so-called business people before the announcement and what motives are behind the national stadium?  Everyone is in favour of a national stadium, but this concept is sidelining others.  The Minister told the FAI that it would not receive any funding until the steering committee issued its findings.  I am concerned that we should not have a golden circle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has approached the issue with a degree of cynicism and considering he was formerly Minister of State with responsibility for sport I would not have expected him to hop on that bandwagon, which is more appropriate to certain sections of the media.  The Deputy asked about a golden circle and was probably referring to Mr. J. P. McManus who has made it known that he is willing to support such a project. Culture and tradition are too slow to change in Ireland at times but I hope that the sporting culture of people such as J. P. McManus will long continue.  I am sure I speak on behalf of the majority of the people, such is our sporting culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country is lucky that it has a Taoiseach and Minister for Finance who have such an exceptional interest in sport.  I am sure it is inevitable from time to time, given the Taoiseach's position, that meetings are requested with him.  The FAI met him on one occasion at least and it may have met the Minister for Finance but I did not ask him.  The Taoiseach explained to the FAI his belief that the idea of a national stadium for the new century should be examined first before individual stadia were embarked upon.  I met representatives <Col N="1033" /> of various federations and organisations such as Sam Hamman and Wimbledon.  All of us met representatives of the different federations with stadia proposals formally and informally and the Taoiseach informed them why we went in this direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 16, 27, 44 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of my deep concern with regard to the use of performance enhancing drugs within sport and my commitment to oversee the introduction of a national sports anti-doping programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All recognised national governing bodies of sport have been circularised with the details and <Col N="1034" /> will be involved over the coming months in consultation with the Sports Council, which will oversee delivery of the programme.  Its provisions go beyond testing to incorporate assistance in the education of our young athletes about the dangers inherent in drug taking.  While the programme will be voluntary in nature, public funding will be withheld from any national governing body of sport or individual athlete which opts out of the programme or, if participating, is found to be in breach of any element of the rules governing its operation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the IRFU has been very much to the fore in support of my proposals for such a programme.  However, I have not been in direct contact specifically in regard to recent allegations against some rugby players because these cases are being investigated under the relevant national and international governing bodies' rules and regulations and would not, therefore, be a matter for discussion or communication between the union and myself.</P>
    <P>With regard to remarks earlier this year, allegedly attributed to the President of the International Olympic Council, I believe that sporting performance, ideally, should be based exclusively on natural ability and sound training techniques application and that the rules of sporting bodies should reflect this approach.</P>
    <P>Reports on the use of creatine and possible side effects have been varied.  The substance is not, as far as I am aware, precluded by the International Olympic Committee or international federations of sport.  I reiterate my belief that sporting performance should ideally be based on natural ability, sound training techniques and application.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister confirmed that he has not met the IRFU and does not know whether it has provided for a system of sanctions under its constitution.  Have our other sporting organisations, including the FAI, the GAA and the BLE, provided for such a system, as requested in 1996, and, if not, why?  Will the Minister ensure the use of creatine to improve the performance of school athletes is banned? He should not wait for the Olympic Council of Ireland to do so.  The use of creatine opens the door to other drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed them that by early in the new year there will be a testing system in place.  There will be mobile units which will have the power to test at random at every venue, be it GAA, rugby, soccer or swimming.  There will be 600 tests next year.  The governing bodies have indicated their willingness to co-operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>What about a system of penalties?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been informed that unless they change their constitutions to provide for adequate penalties, we will have to give serious consideration to the question of funding. As the Deputy is aware, annual general meetings are normally held at this time of year or early in the new year.  It is only appropriate that they should be given the opportunity to make the necessary changes.  There should be uniformity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I am not an expert, I have grave reservations about the use in schools of creatine which is an amino acid found in the heart, liver and kidney and used synthetically to strengthen heart muscle.  Parents should be fully aware of its effects.  It should be added to the International Olympic Committee's list of banned substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That message should be communicated loud and clear to every school and everybody involved in sport.  Question No. 27 relates to the provision of adequate drug testing facilities. The Minister outlined the procedures which are to be put in place.  I am glad he has written to the sporting federations informing them of the penalties if they fail to provide for adequate penalties under their constitutions.  It should be made clear that the Oireachtas, which supports them generously financially, takes the matter of drug taking in sport very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  The necessary resources to implement the programme are available.  To date we have received the co-operation of the various federations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 44 relates to the use of creatine among schoolboys.  I am encouraged by the Minister's response but what legislative steps will the Government take?  Creatine is being used by rugby players at all levels.  It is being advertised as a wonder drug and was the drug used by Arsenal in doing the double under Arsene Wenger last season.  If one looks at the Internet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that creatine poses a health threat, particularly to young adults who are still developing?  Three people have died in the United States.  The Minister should take the matter seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  The message being sent is that parents should be aware of the adverse effects of creatine.  I admire the way the French handled the doping controversy during the Tour de France, which was an overwhelming success in terms of marketing this country.  As the Deputy is aware, I have referred the matter to an independent subcommittee of <Col N="1036" /> the Sports Council.  Sports people should not be allowed to investigate other sports people. Governments will have to take the initiative. There are a number of substances, of which we are well aware, to which creatine has been added arising from its use during the World Cup and by teams such as Arsenal.  It should be included on the list of banned substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister make his views and those of the House known to schools through the Minister for Education and Science?  To encourage young people to use creatine is a form of child abuse.  Will the Minister ensure this issue is included in the review of codes of practice governing the participation of young people in sport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised by the Deputy are worth noting.  I will discuss the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. The Deputy's version of the report has been updated.  I hope the full code of practice will be published in February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister happy that people engaged in sports training and coaching have an adequate understanding of the long-term damage some of these products can cause?  According to Neil Francis, some of them can turn blood into a type of sludge and one can imagine the consequences of that.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to take the initiative in raising public awareness of the dangers attached to these products, not to mention the unacceptable aspect of cheating?  Is he happy that 600 tests per year is sufficient?  That represents two random tests per day and, given the amount of sporting activity taking place, is anything but adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 600 is twice the average number of tests being carried out in the UK on a <i>per capita</i> basis.  There will be 600 tests per year initially to get the scheme started.  On the basis of those tests we will have a fair indication of the level of usage of performance enhancing drugs in sport.  We will also use them as a basis for research.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's first question, coaches and players, particularly in the elite or high performance sports, are fully aware of performance enhancing drugs.  Articles such as that by Neil Francis highlight an issue which otherwise would lie dormant.  Mr. Francis dealt with the rugby area but there are probably other sporting organisations which have stories to tell in this regard and we will probably hear them in the future.</P>
      <P>The National Coaching Training Centre in Limerick holds meetings on various aspects of sports throughout the year.  The next meeting is due to be held on 26 November.  These issues, particularly doping in sports, will be taken on board by the Sports Council, with an independent body to deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, like all Deputies, has probably heard the rumours about the use of creatine by some schools.  Has he undertaken any inquiries to find out what schools, if any, are arranging to have this drug administered? Does he know if parents' permission is required before schools can administer such drugs?  Is creatine a prescription drug or can it be bought over the counter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, creatine can be bought over the counter.  With regard to the Deputy's first question, there have been second and third hand rumours about its use in schools. However, I am unaware of any specific schools although I heard the rumours.</P>
      <P>Creatine is a muscle enhancing drug.  Parents have little knowledge about it despite the publicity it received during the summer.  Before the summer the fact that it had been used was widely advertised and parents were even advocating to coaches that they should use it.  Awareness of the potential adverse effects of the drug is the issue we must tackle first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>For Deputy De Rossa's information, one can buy 100 per cent creatine in the Hibernian mall.  I checked this yesterday and it is widely available.</P>
      <P>The Minister says the substance is not banned by the Olympic Council.  What steps can be taken to put this drug on the banned list?  What steps can legislators take?  If the Minister has not spoken to the IRFU, how can he ensure that adequate testing will take place at schoolboy level to prevent the use of banned substances?  I include creatine among those substances although it has not yet been banned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope schools will co-operate with the testing programme for 1999.  The Deputy asked what can be done to include creatine on the list of banned substances.  That is a matter for the international federations and the International Olympic Committee.  It is up to them to put substances on the banned substances list. Unfortunately, however, earlier this summer the president of the International Olympic Committee advocated the reverse when he said there were too many substances on the banned substances list.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said the substance is made synthetically by different companies and can be bought across the counter.  If the Deputy said that outside the Dáil it would probably be libelous. He would be asked to prove it.  As a medical practitioner, I believe creatine is harmful and that it should be included on the banned substances list. I will examine what methods are available to me, as Minister, to try to have it added to that list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, unless legislation is introduced to empower the State and the Government to intervene in the area of doping in sport.  It will probably come to that because we cannot allow different federations to investigate themselves. That is the way this process is heading.  Substances should probably be included on the banned substances lists on foot of legislation on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the technical difficulties attached to outlawing this drug?  Creatine is formed in the body and a certain level is always present in the body.  The difficulty arises when the material is added artificially through the use of pharmacological preparations. How will the Minister overcome the technical difficulty of making a distinction between a substance which occurs naturally and the same substance being present as a result of using pharmacological preparations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a naturally occurring substance in the body and that causes problems with blood testing.  It is necessary to find the standard levels of each of these substances in an athlete who does the 100 metres as opposed to one who does the 5,000 metres.  This is the problem and blood testing is the way forward.  However, it is necessary to establish the normal standards.  That is what we are trying to do with the tests.  Through testing and feeding into different research we hope to be able to establish the standards in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Allen's point, I will raise the matter when the opportunity arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 28, 30, 47, 58 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>Within the framework of the URBAN initiative, EU funding was made available for integrated development programmes for a limited number of geographically defined deprived urban areas throughout the European Union &mdash; three of them in Ireland.  The three selected areas in Ireland negotiated between the Government and the European Commission in 1996 are Ballymun/Finglas/Darndale in north Dublin, west Tallaght/Clondalkin in southwest Dublin and the northside of Cork city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Operational Programme URBAN &mdash; Ireland 1996 to 1999 is designed to tackle urban issues in an integrated way by supporting business creation, improving infrastructure, social amenities and the physical environment and by providing customised training and actions for equality of opportunity in line with the strategic action plans drawn up and completed by locally established steering groups in each of the three areas.  The <Col N="1040" /> steering group in each area implements its action plan.</P>
    <P>The total funding of URBAN, including 25 per cent Exchequer co-financing, is approximately £21 million.  The funding available to the North Dublin URBAN Steering Group is approximately £10 million and approximately £5 million is available to both the South Dublin and Cork groups.  The balance is provided for the Technical Assistance Sub-Programme, which covers such aspects as monitoring, financial management and evaluation, information and publicity programmes and transnational links.</P>
    <P>As the programme moved from the detailed planning stage to the implementation phase, the steering groups in each of the three areas had to consult widely with local communities to ensure that the end result of their plans would make a lasting improvement in the lives of the people living there.  In addition, large-scale capital projects had to be fully costed and, in order for them to proceed, necessary planning permission and sufficient capital funding to complete the project had to be in place together with an appropriate and inclusive management structure to run them after 1999.  As a result, expenditure to the end of 1997 was quite slow.</P>
    <P>However, since then the rate of spend has increased considerably and to date funding of £8.3 million has been drawn down by the steering group as follows: £4 million by north Dublin, £1.4 million by south Dublin and £2.9 million by the northside of Cork.  By the end of June 1998, the three steering groups had collectively committed a total of £13.8 million or 67 per cent of the URBAN budget as follows: £4.6 million or 45 per cent of the north Dublin budget; £4.7 million or 93 per cent of the south Dublin budget; and £4.5 million or 89 per cent of the Cork budget.</P>
    <P>In the case of north Dublin a further £4.11 million has also been earmarked for a number of significant flagship projects which the steering group consider integral to the success of the URBAN plan.  It is anticipated that legally binding commitments in relation to these projects can be entered into by early 1999 at the latest, when the National Monitoring Committee for URBAN will again review progress on all key projects.</P>
    <P>The mid-term evaluation of the programme has been completed and was adopted by the monitoring committee at its meeting on 17 September 1998.  I have arranged for a copy of the evaluation, together with copies of the 1997 annual report and the six month progress report to the end of June 1998, to be forwarded to Deputies Allen, Bradford, Burke, Creed, Rabbitte and Sheehan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that between consultation, planning and the setting up of structures there have been significant delays in introducing projects that have been fatal in some instances?  Some delays have been unavoidable but there has also been a certain amount of footdragging. Some projects that I would consider <Col N="1041" /> flagship projects are now seriously underfunded because of cost escalation.  Will the Minister deal sympathetically with areas where cost overruns have occurred because of delays?  The expectations and aspirations of communities have been raised by the promise of these flagship projects, but they have now been told that specifications must be downgraded and the projects will have to be scaled back.  Will the Minister look at this problem?</P>

      <P>I will bring this to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, who has a huge interest in this area.  I am informed that this project is working very well.  From the figures I have given Deputies can see that there has been a better drawdown of funding.  Deputy Allen will understand that at the beginning of every initiative things move slowly.  I found this out in relation to funding for Border projects when, while in Opposition, I asked about the drawdown of particular funding.  The problem in that case probably related to inexperience in drawing down those funds, but I am informed that this project is a very good one, that it is gathering pace and that all of these projects should come to fruition. I will bring the matter of flagship projects mentioned by the Deputy to the attention of the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>The Minister is responsible for local development and thus has specific responsibility for ensuring that this programme works effectively and is continued.  In that regard is he concerned by the Government's proposals to create two regions in this country which will have the effect of ensuring that URBAN will never be applied to Ballymun, Darndale, Finglas, Tallaght and the northside of Cork?  The loss of such significant funding to these areas will be a catastrophe and, rather than taking the road it appears to favour, the Government should look for an extension of time for the URBAN programme.</P>

      <P>He is, and of all Deputies, he is aware that this is a Community initiative and has nothing to do with the debate on regionalisation. Whether regionalisation goes ahead or not, the URBAN initiative is totally separate from it. Deputy De Rossa knows that URBAN is a special Community initiative for these specific areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has also stated in the House on several occasions that he is fully aware &mdash; as are other Deputies on all sides, not just Deputy De Rossa &mdash; of large urban areas of disadvantage. The Government has no intention of depriving those areas of funding.  The Exchequer provides 98 per cent of all the social funding that comes to <Col N="1042" /> deprived areas, as the Taoiseach has also said, and only 2 per cent is EU co-funding.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Government is fully aware of the deprived areas; Government Deputies raise the issue with the Taoiseach on different occasions.  However, this matter has nothing to do with the regionalisation debate. The Government is fully aware of and committed to looking after these deprived areas as it has done in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 18, 38, 60, 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The greater proportion of the funding for the overseas tourism marketing initiative is provided under the marketing sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, my Department has developed an outline strategy for the continued development of tourism in the context of EU Structural Funds, 2000-2006, and is currently engaged in a process of consultation with the tourism industry and the relevant agencies with the objective of developing a shared vision for the continued development of Irish tourism.  A series of meetings with senior ITIC members, representing the industry at large, is taking place to move the process forward.</P>
      <P>While I am not yet in a position to indicate the shape that vision might take or to anticipate the outcome of negotiations on the next round of Structural Funds, it is my intention that the future promotion of Ireland as a tourism destination will continue to be pursued in partnership with the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister has stated that marketing is important to the tourism industry, I am amazed that a high level of uncertainty still exists in relation to the overseas tourism marketing initiative after 1999.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say he is having discussions.  What are his views on the continuation of the initiative after 1999?  Will he explain the reason for the long delay in replacing the marketing director of Bord Fáilte who resigned almost 12 months ago?  If marketing is so high on the Minister's agenda, why has he not ensured a new director is appointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the Deputy that a new structure has been set up in Bord Fáilte since the appointment of the new chief executive.  I understand the reason for the <Col N="1046" /> Deputy's question, namely, that the marketing director left Bord Fáilte to take up a position elsewhere.  That matter has been cleared up. There is a new structure in place in Bord Fáilte for the marketing initiative and the board continues to produce figures on a yearly basis as a result.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, my discussions with ITIC have to remain confidential.  I am concerned about this area of marketing, as is the industry, and we are having these ongoing discussions to see if we can bring forward marketing proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Minister to give us details of his discussions with ITIC; I want to know his views on how this issue should be approached post-1999.  The Minister does not know if the Arthur D. Little recommendation of 20 marketing executives is being adhered to by Bord Fáilte.  Both he and Bord Fáilte are ignoring one of the core recommendations of the Arthur D. Little report, the absence of a marketing director for Bord Fáilte at a time when we should be effectively and vigorously marketing Ireland abroad.</P>

      <P>Given the British-Irish Agreement, has the Minister plans for a joint promotion with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board?  Has the Minister any plans to promote tourism for the millennium, by which time the peace process will be well in place?  Given that the tourism industry in Northern Ireland and in the Border counties will benefit most from the British-Irish Agreement, has he any plans to promote tourism in the areas of greatest loss, the six southern counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement gives us a golden opportunity to promote tourism.  Certain areas of the west and north-west have not been as successful as other parts of the country. In the east revenue is up 80 per cent while in certain other areas it has increased by only 15 per cent to 20 per cent.  Due to our geographical position and the political situation of the past 30 years, we were at a natural disadvantage.  It is timely for us to co-operate in the tourism area and take advantage of the British-Irish Agreement. The Deputy's county of Sligo has shown great initiative.  Every day on the radio we hear about the marketing of Sligo.  It is no longer feasible to put up B&amp;B signs in one's garden and expect people to call; one has to get into the marketing area.  In conjunction with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board I hope we will able to improve on those figures and that people in all parts of the country will benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have set up the millennium festivals committee. It is our intention to celebrate the millennium <Col N="1047" /> by providing funding to establish festivals, beginning with the St. Patrick's Day festival, and to provide funding throughout the year for festivals in various parts of the country.  By providing funding it is intended to give the festivals a profile they did not have previously and to build on them for the future.  Our plans are already in place.  I have appointed Derek Keogh as the chairman of the millennium festivals committee.</P>

      <P>Special Olympics International has yet to make a decision on the allocation of the 2003 Special Olympics Summer Games.  In November 1997 the Government approved grant assistance, up to a maximum of £5 million, towards the cost of holding the Special Olympics World Summer Games 2003 in Ireland, should the bid to secure them be successful.  However, Special Olympics International has now asked that Special Olympics Ireland also obtain a written statement from the Irish Government that half of the £5 million grant be converted into an unconditional guarantee of £2.5 million against potential financial loss by the 2003 games organising committee.  The proposal is that prior to 2000, the guarantee would be replaced by a full guarantee of £5 million from a source acceptable to <Col N="1048" /> Special Olympics International and the £2.5 million restored to the grant to bring it back up to £5 million.</P>
      <P>Because of the obvious change in the nature and scope of the Exchequer's exposure implied in this proposal, the potential impact of this requirement, particularly on the total funding package for the £16 million project, demands close consideration in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  I hope to be able to confirm the Government's position on Special Olympics International's latest request before the end of the month.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree this is an important sporting occasion and that it is imperative that any steps the Government can take to meet the required guarantees by Special Olympics International should be taken if at all possible? After the Tour de France this is the most significant sporting organisation to come to Ireland and the spin-off would be of tremendous benefit to us.  Will the Minister agree we should leave no stone unturned in ensuring this event is held here?  I would like to be kept informed of developments.  This project was initiated by the former Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and it would serve a useful purpose.  I hope the Minister will do everything possible to ensure it comes to Ireland.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it will be the biggest sporting event anywhere in the world in 2003.  The Government has been generous in allocating the £5 million sought. However, the request from Special Olympics International concerning the unconditional guarantee of £2.5 million was an afterthought. The Government will try to overcome this hiccup. While we have a good profile and have great exposure as a wonderful country and a wonderful people, we also want to be known as a people who care for those with a disability.  This is an opportunity for us to show what they are capable of doing.</P>
      <P>We will do everything possible to ensure the 2003 Special Olympics come to Ireland.  There are a couple of legal complications that may have to come before the House which were not previously made known to us.  We are doing everything in our power to ensure that the 2003 Special Olympics come to Ireland.  I will keep the Deputy informed of developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 25, 32 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>Last year, as part of a refocusing of the domestic tourism marketing initiative to have greater emphasis on the regional spread of tourism and continuing emphasis on extending the season, I renamed the initiative, the Regional Tourism Marketing Initiative.  The recent management reorganisation of Bord Fáilte by the new chief executive has recognised the importance of the Irish market.  Domestic tourism which is inextricably linked with regional tourism has been highlighted for special attention and focus.</P>
      <P>The autumn campaign of the 1998 regional tourism marketing initiative is under way.  When the autumn campaign has been completed, I will consult with Bord Fáilte and the industry to assess the effectiveness of the spring and autumn campaigns.  Following these discussions I will make a decision on whether to provide funding for a 1999 regional tourism marketing initiative in light of the 1999 Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned the Minister is raising an uncertainty about the continuation of what he is now terming the regional tourism marketing initiative rather than the domestic tourism marketing initiative.  Surely, at a time when the figures indicate a serious regional imbalance in tourism <Col N="1050" /> growth, priority should be given to the development of the regional tourism marketing initiative.</P>
      <P>Are the resources allocated by the Department ringfenced to ensure the moneys allocated to Bord Fáilte are spent directly on the programme for which they are intended?  What marketing personnel are directly allocated by Bord Fáilte to this initiative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The domestic tourism market is very important, particularly to specific areas of the country.  Deputies are aware that most Irish people can afford to take a foreign holiday and, given the adverse weather conditions we experienced over the past two years, many people have done that.</P>
      <P>However, I am delighted to see other initiatives being taken by the regional tourism authorities, particularly in certain counties, such as my county of Donegal and Deputy Perry's county of Sligo and also in Galway and Cavan.  When one is travelling by car or listening to the radio one is aware of the marketing by these counties.</P>
      <P>The domestic tourism market is the life blood of many areas and I intend to do all I can to ensure we get as much as we can in the next budget so that we can continue with the regional tourism marketing initiative.  This initiative was very successful last year and was the first time the regional tourism authorities received any funding for marketing.  We will assess how they spent that money and that assessment will determine whether we implement a similar initiative next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have any specific plans to target the market of 1.5 million people living in Northern Ireland?  Inviting private hoteliers into a joint marketing venture to promote domestic tourism could help the budget.  It will be very important after 1999 to market domestic tourism.</P>
      <P>Many people now take second holidays or spend weekends in hotels in the off season.  Does the Minister have any plans to promote these new tourism market areas?  The recognised areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have any plans to promote new tourism destinations in this country which have come to light in the past two to three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what we would have done in Deputy Perry's and my part of the country without the people of Northern Ireland in recent years.  They got an excellent reception in the Republic and tended to be repeat visitors. We must continue to focus on the market in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is correct in saying we should tap into the weekend market, which I am sure his <Col N="1051" /> initiative in Sligo intends to do.  Dublin benefited tremendously from the weekend short break market and I do not see any reason other areas could not target that market, either in the domestic framework or in countries such as the UK and France.  Some hotels are already marketing themselves in this area and are doing so very successfully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already commended the Minister on his initiative to develop tourism in the regions.

I welcome his assurance that he will repeat that initiative and perhaps improve on the figure in this year's budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Ferris, I have had feedback from the regional tourism committees, which I can make available to the Deputy if he wishes.  They have done an exceptional job with their portion of the £5 million I made available for marketing.  I have also asked for feedback on how the rest of that money was spent in the European markets, but have not had the same response.</P>
      <P>In regard to the funding of the county tourism committees, this is the first year I have funded the regional tourism authorities.  I had hoped we could do that specific type of marketing within the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to whether one should fund county tourism committees, I would prefer to see being developed the initiatives which have been adopted by counties such as Donegal, Sligo, Galway, Cavan and Tipperary in conjunction with the local authorities, local community groups and Leader groups.  The private and public sectors should come together in this because everyone &mdash; the traveller, the tailor, the soldier, the sailor, the baker, the candlestick maker, the doctor, the sergeant <Col N="1052" /> and the clergyman &mdash; benefits from tourism. Unfortunately, however, very few are doing this.  These initiatives, which began at county level, have been extremely welcome and will pay off for those who are engaging in marketing.  It has been shown that those who are marketing their product are winning.  I applaud those counties which have moved in that direction.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My response to this question is similar to a previous one with the exception of the following paragraph.  The Government's preference for the stadium in terms of location, its facilities, etc. , are matters which will be addressed by the committee and the feasibility study.  A tender procedure is already in progress for proposals to develop a 50 metre swimming pool capable primarily of meeting <Col N="1053" /> the training needs of our élite swimmers, with an outcome expected early in the new year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

I join with the Minister in his comments on Mr. McManus, in particular.  It is important we put on the record our appreciation of what this man has done for sport in general, for voluntary and sporting organisations and charitable institutions.  If he wishes to contribute towards this project, the Government should make itself available to consult with him and others.  It is necessary to bring this major capital project forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>In May 1998 I launched an international carding scheme specifically designed to meet the needs of Ireland's high performance players and athletes.  This scheme represents an innovative system of State support for Ireland's top sportspersons, replacing the outstanding sportspersons grant scheme previously operated by the Department of Education and Science between 1986 and 1997.  The first awards under the new scheme totalling £925,000 for 170 athletes were announced on 4 August last.</P>
      <P>As part of the new scheme, a sports science and medical support network has been established under the auspices of the National Coaching and Training Centre in Limerick.  This network provides a range of essential services to carded athletes under the following headings: sports biomechanics, sports medicine, including chartered physiotherapists, sports nutrition, sports physiology and sports psychology.  A specific range of services, depending on the categorisation of the athlete and subject to certain limits, is available to carded athletes free of charge under the scheme.  A list of authorised services providers in respect of which agreements are in place with the NCTC has recently been provided to the carded athletes.  The booklet contains information on all the medical services available to them.</P>
      <P>I am glad to confirm that, contrary to the media reports referred to by the Deputy, the new medical support network is fully operational and includes a comprehensive range of services providers to meet the needs of our carded athletes in accordance with the provisions of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the response because it is important our top athletes get the top medical and scientific services at the expense of the Government.  The media report was worrying. Was there a problem in the provision of the services after the athletes had been given their grants?  Is there a problem now?  Does the Minister have assurances from all those listed in his <Col N="1055" /> document that services and the programme are up and running?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that contrary to media reports everything was and is in order. It was somewhat mischievous of certain people to try to undermine the scheme.  For example, on 27 July I received a letter from the Olympic Council advocating its drugs programme.  It was stated that I responded a week later, namely on 4 August, to the letter sent by it.  A mischievous letter was also sent to it stating that the Blackrock Clinic would have nothing to do with the Sports Council.  We wrote to the Blackrock Clinic and received a reply which stated:</P>
      <P>Thank you very much for your letter of the 28th ult.  to Dr Liam Hennessy.</P>
      <P>Regrettably I have been unable to deal with the matter in the intervening period until the matter was brought to my attention by Liam Hennessy.</P>
      <P>May I state categorically for the Blackrock Clinic that Dr Joe Cummiskey, while practising as a consultant at the Blackrock Clinic, does not in any way represent or have any authority to represent the Blackrock Clinic in any business matters.</P>
      <P>I wish to state therefore that on behalf of the Blackrock Clinic we would most sincerely wish to be a part of the new carding system for elite athletes.</P>
      <P>I wish also to confirm that myself or our Chief Accountant, Mr Brian Scollard, Superintendent Physiotherapist, Ms Noreen O'Shea and Dr Liam Hennessy would be more than willing to meet with you either in Limerick or at Blackrock Clinic to view our facilities and discuss as to how we can proceed further with testing elite athletes.</P>
      <P>Thus to summarise, the Blackrock Clinic wish to state:</P>
      <P>1.  Dr. Cummiskey is not in a position to issue faxes purporting to be for or on behalf of the Blackrock Clinic.</P>
      <P>2.  The Blackrock Clinic wishes most definitely to participate in the new carding scheme subject to organisation arrangements being agreed on a satisfactory basis between both parties.</P>
      <P>I look forward to meeting you in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>The articles appearing with some regularity in <i>Phoenix</i> appear to be trying to undermine all we have done previously.  Deputy Allen will have been aware of this in the past.  An article appeared in <i>Phoenix</i> on 17 July, but the letter was not written to me until 27 July.  This indicates that ongoings were printed in <i>Phoenix</i> before I received the letter.  To clarify the position, the Blackrock Clinic is currently totally behind us.</P>

    <Title>Western Development Commission Bill, 1998: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the many Members who contributed to the debate.  I also welcome the strong support for the Bill evidenced on all sides.  In the time available, I will deal with as many as possible of the points raised.</P>
      <P>I wish to respond to the concerns expressed by a number of Deputies about the transfer of responsibility for the Western Development Commission from the Department of the Taoiseach to the Department of Agriculture and Food and their comments in relation to the Taoiseach's interest in the commission and western development generally.  The transfer of responsibility for the Western Development Commission is eminently sensible and logical given mine and the Department's wide role in rural development. The transfer does not in any way dilute the Taoiseach's commitment or that of the Government to the establishment of the commission on a statutory basis as quickly as possible or to ensuring its effectiveness in promoting economic and social development in the west.  I assure the House of the Taoiseach's ongoing interest in the affairs of the commission and the support I receive from him and the Government on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise, as I pointed out in my introductory speech, that the commission is being established to enhance, not to undermine, duplicate or compete with the developmental activities of other agencies operating in the western region.  In this regard the emphasis is on co-operating closely with other agencies in complementing their activities in promoting the economic and social development of the region.  Close collaboration and co-operation with Departments and agencies operating under them is, therefore, <Col N="1058" /> essential if the commission is to successfully implement its mandate.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that such co-operation and support will be forthcoming from my ministerial colleagues. Structures have been established to ensure close co-operation and collaboration. These include the national liaison network, comprising representatives of Departments and agencies, and the forum of western Ministers which will facilitate contact between ministerial colleagues on matters of concern to the commission.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the co-ordination of and close association with the activities of the county strategy groups and local development groups, such as Leader, by the commission. Such activities should be part of the ongoing daily functions of the commission and I am aware that such activity has been taking place for some time. The Bill provides for this in a general rather than a detailed, specific way.  Before dealing with other points, I wish to acknowledge Deputy Donal Carey's contribution to the establishment of the commission during his period in office when he was attached to the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies, while welcoming the establishment of the sectoral advisory committees which are provided for in section 19, sought further clarification on them.  They will play an important role in informing the elaboration of the commission's strategy and policies.  In all so far, five such committees have been established.  The nomination of people to them is the sole responsibility of the commission.  Representation is invited on a broad partnership basis with representatives from the public, private, voluntary and community sectors contributing to the work of the committees from the point of view of their expertise and experience.  So far 20 committee meetings have been held.  With the establishment of the commission on a statutory basis and the recruitment of additional staff, as I outlined in my opening speech, the commission will be able to devote additional resources to servicing the committees in order to allow their further development.</P>
    <P>A call was made during the debate to allow the commission, via the Western Investment Fund, to become involved in supporting strategic infrastructural projects.  As I stated, it is not the intention that the commission will duplicate or compete with the efforts of existing agencies and for that reason the Government has decided that the commission should not engage in funding major strategic infrastructural works.  The commission, however, will have an important role in identifying needs and priorities in terms of infrastructure in the region, proposing strategic responses and facilitating and promoting development in liaison with existing agencies.</P>
    <P>Under section 8, the commission is empowered to consult with State agencies and Departments on the identification of regional priorities within their area of operation.  This allows an input into the appropriate agency and departmental policy formulation procedures.  In addition, as I <Col N="1059" /> announced at the outset of the debate, I intend to propose an amendment to section 8(2).  This will clarify that the commission may support minor infrastructural works, such as access or services, where such works are an inherent part of a project being supported.</P>
    <P>The question of social development and social projects was also raised by a number of Deputies. The commission under its terms of reference is charged with the economic and social development of the region.  Financial support under the Western Investment Fund will primarily involve supporting economic projects with a financial return and a social dividend.  The social dividend or social impact will be taken into account when evaluating a project for funding.  In addition, social projects likely to give an economic return in the longer rather than shorter term will also be eligible for financial support.</P>
    <P>I foresee no difficulty in the commission becoming involved in cultural and heritage activities. Regarding the Irish language, the commission and I are very conscious of its importance in the region.  The commission will work closely with Udarás na Gaeltachta and the voluntary and community sectors in identifying, promoting and supporting projects in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the rural development pilot projects currently in progress in a number of parts of the country.  I am delighted by the impact these have had in their regions of operation.  As pilot projects they are important in identifying appropriate models for rural development. They are currently being evaluated and I intend that the experience gained and conclusions emerging will inform the preparation of the White Paper on Rural Development, which is currently under way in my Department.</P>
    <P>I express my own and the Government's appreciation for the contribution to the commission of the chairman and current board members.  I intend to expand board membership up to the limit of 12 provided for in the Bill.  The additional appointments will be made to provide a broad geographic and sectoral representation so that all interests in the west will be represented and can contribute to the work of the commission. I have been conscious of the need to avoid appointing a large, unwieldy board structure. A representative board comprising a chairman and 11 members will provide an effective and dynamic direction to the work of the commission.</P>
    <P>I have taken careful note of the number of references made to the issue of Objective One status for the region in the context of the negotiations for the next round of Structural Funds. This issue has been the subject of much debate and is currently under close examination by the Government.  I understand an early decision will be made and I do not intend to pre-empt that.  However, I support the proposal that the west and northern counties should be included.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> The establishment of the Western Development Commission on a statutory basis clearly demonstrates the Government's ongoing commitment to the development of the west.  Through co-operating with other State and non-State agencies, the commission will be in a position to contribute to the elaboration of a coherent strategy for the west, as well as ensuring the strategic focus of available resources.  This is unique legislation to help a unique region with problems that are different from other parts of the country.  I wish the commission and its staff every success.  I hope they will be an example of what can be achieved in the region with a little self-help.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past two weeks I have outlined in this House and in the Seanad the current position in relation to agriculture and the difficulties being experienced in recent times.  I also believe I have outlined the background to these difficulties. Various actions have been taken by myself and the Government to alleviate these difficulties. I will set out a list of the measures taken.</P>
      <P>Beef export refunds have been substantially increased.  Over the past three weeks the refund on male beef has been increased by over 21 per cent or about 9p per pound.  This refund is provided to meat exporters to allow them trade in markets outside the EU and brings the total export refund on male carcass beef to 51p per pound.  One must consider the price being paid for cattle and the price per pound at 70p, 76p or 80p.  A 51p subsidy is included in that price and one must consider that beef is being sold to third countries for 27p or 30p per pound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also negotiated increased access to intervention for heavier cattle, with the carcass weight limit being increased from 340kg to 360kg.  The steer 04 category will now be eligible.  Both these measures will allow for close to 50 per cent of our steer production being eligible for intervention, whereas the previous figure was 15 per cent. There is something radically wrong with our breeding policy when only 15 per cent of our national kill qualifies for intervention. <Col N="1061" /> The processors' margin has been increased by 40 per cent.  Direct payments to farmers have been speeded up.  Already this year, £659 million has been paid under the headage and premium schemes, of which £353 million relates to payments made under the 1998 schemes.</P>
    <P>The advance in suckler cow and special beef premium payments has been increased from 60 per cent to 80 per cent.  This will release an additional £45 million to farmers in November and December.  An outstanding BSE compensation top-up of more than £6 million has been paid to certain beef producers.  These payments were issued on 15 October.</P>
    <P>Additional facilities for live exports to EU markets have been approved, with 6,000 weanlings being exported each week and more than 100,000 calves and weanlings exported to the Continent. Last week there was a record number of 6,700 weanlings exported to the Continent.  I have also negotiated the re-opening of the Iranian market for our beef exports.</P>
    <P>As regards the sheep sector, I have ensured the continuation of the sheep headage top-up for 1998 worth £2.75 million.  Earlier payment will be made of the second instalment of the ewe premium worth £26 million.  These payments commence today, a month earlier than usual.  An EU funded private storage scheme for sheepmeat has also been introduced.</P>
    <P>We have negotiated a substantial increase in export refunds for pigmeat.  The latest increase of 33 per cent will be of immediate benefit to pigmeat producers, combined with the putting in place of a 70,000 tonne private storage scheme.  I ask the industry to avail of that 70,000 tonnes of storage for pigmeat as the pig industry is going through a difficult time.  Other EU states are using this facility but we have not done so to date. I call on the industry to do so, particularly when it is combined with an increase of 33 per cent in export refunds which we succeeded in obtaining last week.  By any standards, the above is an impressive list of achievements which represents tangible and real assistance for the sectors involved.</P>
    <P>As well as low prices, we also had unusually wet weather this summer.  Combined with below normal sunshine levels, this resulted in reduced grass growth in many parts of the country.  In the peaty and heavy clay soil areas of certain counties, the capability of farmers to make silage and hay for winter fodder was greatly reduced.  The Government has made £10 million available to deal with fodder difficulties being experienced by some farmers.  The details of the scheme are being finalised by my Department today.</P>
    <P>This scheme will be directed at sheep farmers with mountain grazings, suckler cow producers and small dairy farmers in the worst affected areas, based on a Teagasc survey published in September.  I am satisfied the mechanism being put in place to implement the scheme is practical, uses resources efficiently and delivers the payments directly and speedily to farmers.  It is <Col N="1062" /> important that these payments are made directly and speedily.  We have had schemes which did not work very well.  Vouchers went all over the place and the farmers who most needed assistance were the last to benefit.  We will use existing headage and premia systems to get money to farmers directly.  It will be a matter for the farmers to use the lower cost concentrate feed which is available to supplement their feed stocks for the winter. This scheme is targeted at those most seriously affected as we used the Teagasc survey to focus on those most directly concerned.</P>
    <P>As well as the immediate fodder scheme, my Department, in consultation with the Department of Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands, is in the process of finalising a cull ewe slaughter scheme, under which farmers will be compensated for the removal of between 100,000 and 200,000 cull ewes, particularly from the overgrazed commonages.  I hope the scheme will be up and running in the next few weeks because culling will have to be completed by the early part of December.  I pay tribute to my colleagues, Deputies de Valera and Ó Cúiv, for their assistance on this matter.  The objective of the scheme is to ease the situation for those sheep producers who will be required to undertake some level of destocking under the environmental programmes in 1999.  However, it would also assist producers who have not been able to find a market for cull ewes this autumn.  At the same time, it will make a contribution to easing the fodder shortage problem facing many sheep producers.</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place between my Department and the farming and processors' organisations to examine the practicalities of the scheme.  The general intention is that all farmers with land in degraded commonages should receive a slaughter premium to immediately remove at least a quarter of their ewes.  As producers with land in overgrazed commonages will, in any event, have some of their quota rights withdrawn for 1999, this scheme, by providing additional compensation, will help them progress towards the required level of stocking, and at the same time provide an outlet for animals that have devalued significantly in the past months.</P>
    <P>I have also held discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, on the smallholder's assistance or farmer's dole scheme.  More than 7,000 farmers are in receipt of £33 million annually under the scheme which is available to all farmers on low incomes. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will intensify its information initiatives at local level to increase awareness of the scheme and to emphasise its applicability to farmers.  In addition, the scheme is being examined with a view to increasing its relevance to farming families. In this context, due account will be taken of the difficult income situation on certain farms arising from weather and market related conditions.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to examine a problem which has been the cause of much concern for a <Col N="1063" /> number of years, namely the RSI scheme for self-employed people.  People who paid RSI from 1988 onwards and might have had six or seven years' payments did not receive any pension, merely a refund of their payments.  I hope that with a little more arm twisting, we could expect something to be done about the scheme in the forthcoming budget.  Farmers, having paid their RSI contributions, are entitled as an absolute minimum to a <i>pro rata</i> contributory pension.</P>
    <P>It would be useful to comment on the likely overall agricultural income position in 1998 and changes which have taken place in recent years. Farm incomes, as measured by the CSO, increased in each year from 1991 to 1996 but declined in 1997, mainly as a result of price decreases for most of the agricultural commodities. This was very disappointing, particularly in view of the good performance of incomes over the previous five years.  However, taking the whole period from 1991 to 1997, average farm income increased by approximately 50 per cent. It is worth noting, when considering farm incomes, that more than 50 per cent of farm household income is derived from off-farm sources.  Off farm income in these households will, along with the rest of the economy, have been boosted by the general economic boom of recent years.  Farm households have also benefited considerably from the low interest rates of the past few years, which are continuing to decline.</P>
    <P>A central aspect of farm income is the amount of direct income payments to farmers.  These have continued to increase throughout the 1990s and, in 1997, reached a record £940 million, which accounted for 48 per cent of farm income or approximately 25 per cent of farm household income.  This amount represented an increase of more than 132 per cent since 1992.</P>
    <P>Off-farm employment and other earnings, social welfare payments and direct agricultural payments taken together now account for approximately three quarters of the income of farm households.  All of these elements of income have been increasing in recent years, including this year.  The difficulty this year centres around one quarter of farm household income which derives exclusively from agricultural operations.</P>
    <P>I would like to consider the overall picture for farm income in 1998, looking at the main sectors very briefly.  The prices for livestock had generally been performing quite well up to mid-year but deteriorated since then, particularly as a result of the Russian crisis.  The position relating to the milk sector is much more positive.  Prices throughout the first seven months of the year are well ahead of 1997 levels.  Although the uncertainty surrounding the Russian market may have a negative impact towards year end, a satisfactory increase in output value is expected.  The outlook for output value in the cereals sector is one of little change over 1997.</P>
    <P>Overall, the most likely outcome at this point <Col N="1064" /> in the year is that the value of gross agricultural output for all of these products will rise in 1998. However, the cost of farm inputs also looks set to rise, mainly as a result of the need to purchase increased levels of concentrate feed.  Obviously, this overall picture also masks many differences at farm level and I am well aware that some farmers have been hard hit by recent developments. It is for this reason that I have sought to ensure that the measures to deal with the problem are well targeted.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, direct income payments accounted for 48 per cent of income arising in agriculture in 1997.  These payments play a significant role in supporting farm incomes and will do so again in 1998; this is a point which is forgotten when comparisons are made in regard to previous difficulties in agriculture.  The fact that I have secured Commission agreement to the advance payment of 80 per cent of the suckler cow and special beef premia in 1998 will provide a significant boost to direct payments this year.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that I have had to defend the level of these payments arising from adverse comments in a German magazine in which some west Cork farmers were quoted as saying they had only to sit back in Castlehaven and wait for the cheques to arrive in the letterbox. That did not do our position in Europe any good.  The broadcaster, Eamon Dunphy, contacted me seeking an explanation of the direct income payment situation.</P>
    <P>Already in 1998, outstanding progress has been made in delivering these payments to farmers. Some £653 million has been paid to farmers under the various headage and premium schemes, of which £353 million relates to payments made under the 1998 schemes.  Payments under REPS and the early retirement scheme amount to almost £108 million and £50 million respectively so far this year.  The REP scheme is an excellent one, and the level of payment to farmers is the most badly affected areas is increasing annually.</P>
    <P>An advertisement was placed in a southern newspaper last week which implied that the farm retirement scheme was to end and that farmers would no longer have a pension under it.  There is no truth whatsoever in that.  The scheme is firmly in place and I have held discussions with Commissioner Fischler on it.  Rather than being terminated, it will in fact be improved.  Two aspects of the scheme have been the cause of a great deal of anxiety.  The first is the additionality clause in relation to the acquisition of additional land and the second relates to people with an off-farm income.  It is very important that part-time farmers should qualify for the scheme.  I received a positive response from the Commissioner and the scheme will form part of the overall Agenda 2000 negotiations which are expected to conclude by spring of next year.  I cannot be sure when those negotiations will conclude as more new Ministers have been appointed to the Council of Ministers, one from Sweden, one from Britain and one from Denmark.  The German Government <Col N="1065" /> has not yet appointed a new Minister and the French and Italian Ministers are due to be replaced in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I am becoming a veteran on the Council after a period of 12 months or so.  The newspaper report, which some of my Cork colleagues doubtless read, was most misleading.</P>
      <P>The charter of rights for farmers sets very specific targets for payment of grants under the headage and premium schemes.  My intention is to meet those deadlines in 1998.  Progress to date is impressive.  Payment of sheep headage commenced this year on 21 September, one week ahead of the commencement date in 1997 and to date more than £13.4 million has been paid.  Payment of cattle headage commenced on 26 September 1998, a full three weeks ahead of the commencement date in 1997 and more than £57 million has been paid to date.  Payments under these schemes will continue over the coming weeks with a view to ensuring that all eligible applicants are paid by 31 October.  Payments under the arable aid scheme commenced on 16 October, the earliest possible commencement date under EU Regulations and, to date, more than £52 million has been paid.  Payment of the 80 per cent advance premium under the 1998 special beef premium scheme commenced last weekend, three weeks ahead of last year, and so far more than £50 million has been paid in respect of almost two thirds of January to June applications. Payment of the higher rate of advance premium under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme commenced yesterday, two weeks ahead of last year and more than £69 million has been paid to 63 per cent of May 1998 applicants.</P>
      <P>Last week, payment of additional BSE compensation of £6.3 million was made to those producers who had more animals in 1996 than they had in 1995 &mdash; the year originally chosen as the base year for the 1996 BSE compensation package. The EU regulation governing payment of the second instalment of 1998 ewe premium was published on Friday last, 16 October.  Payments valued at some £26 million are now issuing.  I am not suggesting farmers are not entitled to these payments.  They are compensation payments. However, a very special effort has been made to ensure the payments are made quickly in view of the prices and fodder problems.  Given the level of payments involved, this will have a positive effect on cash flow on family farms in the weeks ahead.  Those making out cheques and payments became somewhat exhausted in the past two weeks as in the region of £200 million has been sent to farmers in acknowledgement of the difficult cash flow problems in some areas.</P>
      <P>Live exports from Ireland to both EU and third countries are vital to maintaining competition in the cattle trade and in sustaining farm incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> The seasonality of the livestock trade in Ireland makes market access for live exports particularly critical during the back end of the year when large numbers of weanlings come off farms.  I have consistently recognised the importance of promoting live exports and have delivered in a number of areas to ensure market access for our cattle to both EU and third country markets.</P>
    <P>The availability of shipping services to transport cattle and other livestock to export markets is a critical factor and it is worth recalling the difficulties experienced in 1997.  Deputies will recall that in autumn 1997 there was no shipping service available to move animals to Europe and live animals had not left the country in 1997 up to that time.  I sought and obtained Government approval to provide £1 million towards the startup costs of a roll-on/roll-off service which provided the means by which cattle and other livestock could leave the country.  It provided an outlet over the winter and spring, but unfortunately and regrettably was not sufficiently supported by the industry and as a consequence was discontinued by the operators after six months in service. I remember meeting some co-ops to at least ensure dry goods were carried on the service as they must get cheese, milk powder and various other commodities out of the country.  While the operators could carry 12 units for livestock, the average load was about six units while the spaces for dry goods were left empty.  It is a pity this was the situation.</P>
    <P>Arising from the measures recently taken the situation is now very different from last year. Commercial operators of roll-on/roll-off ferries, both Pandoro and Irish Ferries, are again carrying livestock to the Continent and this is being augmented by the carriage of large numbers of animals on dedicated vessels.  So far this year we have exported more than 100,000 cattle to the Continent.  This is more than four times the number of cattle exported in all of 1997 and is over twice the number exported in 1996.  Cattle exports to the EU so far this year already well exceed what we exported in 1995 which was regarded as a very good year for the trade.  These are facts and figures which those who have sought to create an impression of crisis around the subject of live exports to the Continent seem consistently to ignore, but which I want to put on record.  For example, more than 6,000 cattle per week have been exported to the Continent in recent weeks and exports will continue at a high level.  Within the past four weeks we have exported to the Continent more cattle than in the whole of 1997.  This is an out-turn which speaks for itself, particularly when contrasted with some of the very negative representation of the live trade to Europe which has been put about in recent times.</P>
    <P>I have ensured a detailed ongoing monitoring of the trade and that exporters are facilitated in every appropriate way in shipping animals to Europe and elsewhere.  I am particularly anxious to provide that the long-term interests of the trade are served by ensuring relevant welfare, <Col N="1067" /> animal health and certification requirements are observed by all concerned.  My Department will, therefore, continue to give such matters careful attention and I urge all other interested parties to do likewise.</P>
    <P>Shippers and cattle traders who came to the Department with an application for approval of a vessel were granted approval.  In one case people thumped the table and said they did not have sufficient ferry facilities and I approved the <i>Caroline</i>, which did not qualify under existing rules, by modifying the rules.  When I inquired a couple of weeks later as to how the <i>Caroline</i> was doing I was told it was ferrying sheep from Wales to the Azores.  It is letting the side down when people come to the Department looking for ferry services to help the national situation and then use them for another purpose.</P>
    <P>My commitment to live exports to the Continent has been consistent and effective.  The serious EU market access problems of 1997 were addressed in a timely and effective manner and in 1998 we will have a four year high in terms of cattle exports to the EU.  I assure the House that the question of maintaining and increasing our exports of cattle and other food producing animals to continental Europe will continue to be among my foremost priorities as it has been since this Government took office.</P>
    <P>The beef sector has suffered and been in economic turmoil since the Russian collapse.  In 1997 beef exports to Russia amounted to 70,000 tonnes and were expected to reach similar levels in 1998. The effects of the loss of the market have been compounded by the fact that this was also an important market for other European exporters. We and some other member states have been thrown out of the Russian market.  All the extra stock which has resulted from this has to find a home somewhere and we have much competition from other member states.</P>
    <P>The renationalisation of the beef market in the European Union following the BSE scares in 1996 has made it extremely difficult to penetrate the European market.  This has led to a greater dependence on third country markets for our exports than at any time in the past.  Irish beef exports to European markets have recovered significantly from 1996, particularly to France, Italy and the Netherlands.  Nevertheless, there is a very substantial gap between cattle prices in Ireland and prices on these markets and I have been pressing the trade to exploit whatever opportunities exist on these markets.  An Bord Bia is formulating a strategy aimed at ensuring market recovery.  The current difficulties in the beef sector are particularly disappointing because in the absence of the Russian crisis there were very good prospects for cattle prices to remain at the higher levels which prevailed earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>From the start of the Russian crisis I put this problem on the agenda of the Council of Ministers and in recent weeks we have seen major concessions given in this context.  I would have <Col N="1068" /> liked them to have been given sooner, but nonetheless they are now available.  It is nothing short of tragic that benefits I negotiated on behalf of the Government and received in Europe are not being passed on to farmers.  It is essential that the improved support in terms of export refunds and intervention are immediately passed on to the producers, i.e., farmers.  There is no justification for processors to hold prices at current levels. There has been an increase of 9p per lb in export refunds on beef in the past three weeks while third country prices have fallen back somewhat in the aftermath of the Russian crisis.  The basis now exists for an improvement in cattle prices over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>There is a long-term problem.  We are out of the European retail market and there is a difficulty in terms of lack of competition for which the live trade is necessary.  We asked McKinsey Consultants to draw up a report which I have just received.  There are structural defects which need addressing and which will be addressed on the basis of that report.</P>
    <P>The reopening of the Libyan live trade has been well documented.  An agreement was signed on 25 July in Dublin between the Department of Foreign Affairs and representatives of the Libyan Administration and endorsed by the Libyan People's Assembly.  Our ambassador, Mr. Joe Small, has been in Tripoli for the past week and is positive about the market opening up.  Everybody would have preferred if it had opened up before now, but regrettably this has not happened.  I spent some time in Tehran in recent days.  Iran has agreed to reopen the market and a technical delegation will come here on Friday to sign the agreement.</P>
    <P>The sheep sector was doing quite well up to July this year.  However, the collapse of the Russian market caused severe difficulty which is why I have organised early payment of headage and premia and approval for the additional top up. There are also severe difficulties in the pigmeat sector.  Every effort has been made to get rid of the backlog, including working over weekends. The use of private storage has been exceptionally helpful.  I want the industry to use the EU funding for the storage of up to 70,000 tonnes of pigmeat.</P>
    <P>There is no denying that the farming sector has recently gone through a difficult period.  The economic difficulties in Russia have had a disproportionate impact on markets in this country which is attributable to our dependence on exports.  An added difficulty is the shortage of fodder in certain parts of the country.  The Government collectively and I as Minister for Agriculture and Food have recognised and faced up to these difficulties. We have used every means at our disposal to assist.  These include tangible results in the reopening of markets in Libya and Iran, a series of technical changes to bring forward direct payments, support measures for beef, pigmeat and sheep and a national scheme to assist with fodder related difficulties.  The strategy has been to <Col N="1069" /> assess issues and find solutions which will make a real difference.  We have concentrated on delivery, not on idle promises.</P>
    <P>Collectively, these amount to a formidable array of measures and they provide assistance across a range of sectors.  We can all understand farmers' anger and frustration at receiving inadequate prices for their produce.  However, comparisons with the situation in 1974 are well wide of the mark; direct payments now account for up to 50 per cent of farm incomes and provide strong and real support, but there were no such payments in l974.  It is also important to recognise that the best solution is a restoration of strong and healthy markets and, as Minister, I have been unstinting in my efforts in that regard.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that while others have been courting publicity and making wild allegations, my officials and I have been working hard and effectively for the farmers of Ireland.  The measures I outlined are substantial and will be effective in assisting farmers at a difficult time.  I intend to continue this work in support of our farming people and I will not be distracted from my task by those who seek political gain from the difficulties of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister, I appear to be living in a different country. We have different views on the agriculture sector. I will raise a number of important points, which I raised during recent weeks and which I will continue to raise.  We must acknowledge that there is a horrendous crisis in farming.  Irrespective of how the figures are dressed up or cheques in the post are added up, this has been a bad year for farmers.  It was the worst in 25 years.  I was a mart manager in 1974, but I saw greater problems this year.  The difference between 1974 and now is that everyone could see light at the end of the tunnel in 1975, but they cannot see great light at the end of this tunnel.  Because the Libyan market has not been reopened, it is difficult to know at what stage in the storm we are.</P>
      <P>The factors that account for the crisis, over which the Government does not have control, were well documented.  We all know about the atrocious weather, particularly during June, July and August and the collapse of cattle and sheep prices.  It is hard to believe that pig producers are getting £30 less than the cost of production for their pigs.  It was also a bad year for corn producers who had low yields.  All this has conspired to pull the heart out of farming.  I know, as I am sure the Minister knows, some farms are almost beyond economic salvation.  Farmers have run into hard times because of what has happened. Others are teetering on the brink of insolvency and others are so weakened financially that it is difficult to know what will happen to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The severity of this disaster is not fully recognised. I am surprised at the lack of understanding <Col N="1070" /> in non-farming areas.  I refer to large towns and villages.  Many shopkeepers, service providers, supermarket owners, wholesalers, distributors, builders and many others are about to feel the pinch.  The same amount of money is not in circulation and this crisis will also affect them.  It is only now that they are beginning to see there is trouble ahead.</P>
    <P>The crisis is worse than has been reported.  A mart in the west calculated its figures for three months up to end September 1998 last week and compared to its figures for the corresponding period last year the reduction in the price per head going through its rings was £138 for every animal sold.  That is the official amount it has lost in respect of every animal sold.  The figure for some cattle breeds is £200 per head less than it was this time last year and some cattle breeds do not attract a bid.  That will be confirmed by mart managers.</P>
    <P>Why is the position so bad and must it be so bad?  International trading difficulties, such as the collapse of the Russian economy, upset our market. Other countries with which we trade reduced their prices on foot of that because they know we are in a buyer's market.  France and Germany initiated an unofficial &ldquo;buy French&rdquo; and &ldquo;buy German&rdquo; consumer campaign, or renationalisation policy, and it has worked.  Unless I misinterpreted the principles of the Treaty of Rome and subsequent treaties, the principle of free trade and of free movement of good and services throughout the community is broken every day by our EU partners.  That is one of the reasons that today a French farmer can get £1.05 per pound for his cattle, a top rate, when our farmers can get only 70p, 78p or as low as 68p per pound for their cattle.</P>
    <P>This crisis is partially related to the BSE problem. Our figures are improving and we hope they will continue to improve this year and into next year.  Neither the Minister nor the Government handled this crisis with anything like the urgency it deserved.  It did not stop raining in June, July and August and anyone with a grasp of agriculture would realise that because there was so much water, particularly in the wetlands, there would be a winter feed shortage this year.  Farmers had only half their normal silage yield, there was no hay and the only saving was some straw from the cereal areas.  Most farms have only half the required winter fodder.</P>
    <P>It appears it only dawned on the Government in the week leading up to the ploughing championship that there was a fodder shortage.  Its the first time I have heard a figure &mdash; £10 million in this case &mdash; given for the cost of a fodder scheme, without the rules and qualifying criteria for the scheme being set out.  A decision has not been made on the category of farmers who will qualify under the scheme.  The introduction of that scheme was a panic reaction.  Unless I have it entirely wrong, I cannot see how £10 million will be of any use to the farmers who have been badly hit because of the low price they are getting for <Col N="1071" /> their cattle and the high price they must pay for feed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why even at this late stage the Minister has not indicated the category of farmers who will qualify under this scheme.  I thought he would have indicated that today.  Will farmers throughout the country be able to apply under the scheme where circumstances show that because of bad weather they have much less winter feed than they need?</P>
      <P>The Minister announced three weeks ago that trade with Libya would reopen, the necessary letters were in order and guarantees had been given and I accepted that.  However, many farmers refused to sell cattle on foot of that commitment. Cattle prices were bad at that time, but they are even worse now.  I do not know why trade with Libya has not reopened.  Does the Minister know why it has not reopened?  He should be in a position to tell the House and our farmers why it has not reopened?  He is the Minister and he is dealing with the Libyan authorities.  Will trade with Libya reopen next week, in a month's time or next spring?  Farmers want to know the answer to that question but they have not got it today.</P>
      <P>I complimented the Minister on the deal he secured on intervention.  If that had not been secured when it was, there would be no bid for any animal.  We have a double edged problem on our hands.  It appears the factories will do what they have done historically.  This has no relationship with those who pay the piper.  We are in a buyer's market.  There were never more cattle going into meat factories but it appears they will not pay the intervention price.  The sanctions decided upon, limited though they may be, must be implemented and applied to meat plants.  It is no trouble to calculate the intervention price attained by the Minister in Brussels on behalf of farmers as there is no smokescreen involved.  It could be printed on the gates of the meat factories because it is clearcut.  They know exactly what they must pay and, while there are many pressures on them, I ask the Minister to use his clout to make sure they pay and turn away from Agriculture House the ones who do not when they come to lobby on other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to trade with Iran and said a veterinary team is to visit Ireland.  I want to see that because there is no way out of this crisis unless foreign markets are opened.  How can the Minister say to farmers who have cattle out in the fields in the worst possible conditions following the floods of recent days, which puts extra pressure on them to get rid of the cattle, that if trade to Iran does not open, trade to Libya will, given the history of this issue?  It is time for honest answers and the Minister should tell us why the Libyan market did not reopen and give us the background to the Iranian market.  If the markets were to open in a week or two, farmers would <Col N="1072" /> obviously wait but if they do not open until next spring there is an onus on the Minister to outline where they stand in terms of trade to Libya.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We want another ploughing match. If we had one of them every week, we would have more announcements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone are 80,000 steers to be put into intervention, there is also a scheme for private storage.  A huge amount of tonnage is available which the meat factories could use and I am informed they will not use that scheme either. There is a need for a great deal of stern talking.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to direct payments and I acknowledge that the cheques are being sent. However, is that not what the charter of rights proclaimed?  Is it not farmers' money?  If prices had not reduced, would the cheques not go out anyway?  There is a huge deficit either way and the Minister should always remember the sum of £138 that I referred to in terms of the difference in prices between this year and last.</P>
      <P>This deficit must be monitored because it is crippling farm families.  They do not have a cash flow and when headage cheques were sent out recently, many farmers were grateful.  However, unlike 1996 and 1997, they did not go back to the marts and buy smaller cattle as they would normally because they had to use the cheques to pay silage contractors, veterinarians for calls and testing, ACC bank loans and educational institutions for their children's education.  They have a long winter ahead of them, with little income for most.  If they have to turn to the Minister's fodder scheme, they are in for a rude awakening. We do not know where this will end.</P>
      <P>On foreign markets and &ldquo;renationalisation,&rdquo; I remember the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign upon which various Governments frowned.  We were told it was contrary to the Treaty of Rome and we should desist from such a campaign.  I find it hard to understand how the French and German Governments can advocate campaigns to buy their own beef.  That is all right if one is a French or German farmer because those countries are net importers of food but where does Ireland, which exports nine out of every ten animals it produces, stand in terms of the Treaty?  This matter must be taken up at the highest level, particularly during the Agenda 2000 negotiations, but if this problem becomes Community wide it will leave Ireland in a serious position.  It breaks every rule and principle for which Ireland stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Marketing is the only way out of this crisis. Cattle must be exported and competition created. I accept it is a difficult time to market because of the problems I mentioned but I hope Bord Bia will be given resources and will be focused on what it must do.  The EU labeling system has upset our markets everywhere and unless a brand image is built, similar to the dairy industry, we will always be second best even in internal EU markets.  It is time to get whatever grip we can on third country markets before the next GATT <Col N="1073" /> negotiations and it is extremely bad news for farmers that we cannot break into the Libyan and Iranian markets more quickly.</P>
    <P>There are certain actions the Minister can and must take to help the farming community in its hour of greatest need.  On the first day of this session there was a three hour debate on agriculture during Private Member's Business and many Opposition and backbench Government Deputies, including myself, suggested that one way to financially aid the agricultural community would be to open up the family income supplement scheme to farmers and the self-employed generally.</P>
    <P>A row broke out about its cost but we are told it would cost approximately £50 million.  If this means the farming community is £50 million worse off because it cannot participate in the scheme it speaks volumes about the low incomes of farmers currently.  There is discrimination involved.  Low income PAYE families are supplemented and supported by the FIS and I agree with the principle involved.  However, why are small farming families not supplemented in a similar manner?  What is the difference given the everybody is in the tax net?  All families are subject to three or four different assessments for income tax, social welfare payments, medical card, etc.  It is a national habit and, therefore, it is not a problem to determine a farmer's income at any time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs came into the House with all guns blazing and said that under no circumstances would the Government accede to our request.  It is one of the best ways of diverting funds to farmers with cash flow problems.  Officers of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are not in a position to react.  I am talking about the farmer who does not want to receive the dole or family income supplement.  Through no fault of his or her own, he or she has no money as another dreary winter approaches.  The Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs do not seem to have grasped this.</P>
    <P>On the fodder shortage, unlike the fodder voucher scheme introduced in 1986, the headage top-up scheme introduced in the same year was a great success.  It was well targeted at those in the eye of the storm, those in disadvantaged areas. It is my information that certain district electoral divisions have been identified by Teagasc as areas in which there is a fodder shortage.  Where do farmers who have been unable to sell their cattle stand on the £10 million?  Payments are to be capped at between £300 and £400.  For those with between 50 and 60 cattle, this is peanuts.  I suspect the reason the Minister did not announce the details of the scheme is that he is looking for more money or perhaps he is hoping something will happen in the meantime.  That is a bad strategy. He should identify clearly who will benefit and there should be no discrimination.  Small milk producers should be facilitated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> The area aid unit has been closed to the public. One cannot get through on the telephone.  The staff are working extremely hard to resolve what is an intractable problem.  I do not know what the figure is in respect of the number of files in hand but I understand it is sizeable.  Because of the problems being experienced the Minister should again seek the permission of the European Commission to issue payments based on last year's figures. If penalties have to be imposed, the moneys due can be recouped from next year's payment. This should be done quickly.</P>
    <P>On brucellosis blood testing, I understand it is now possible in certain circumstances to have results returned within six to ten days in respect of cattle for sale.  Given the problems encountered in Cork during the summer, this is a remarkable turnaround.  I congratulate the staff concerned.</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's view that the rural environment protection scheme is an excellent one but why does it take the agricultural officers involved up to six months to carry out inspections?  I understand, because the sum available for mileage expenses is exhausted, agricultural officers in a certain county in the west have been grounded. This is unacceptable.  Everybody has to stretch the extra yard to ensure payments are made on time.  Payments under the scheme should be made on the due date.  If penalties have to be imposed following an inspection, the moneys due can be recouped from the next payment.</P>
    <P>Anything that can be done to relieve the problems of hill sheep farmers should be done.  Hill sheep farmers have invested heavily in sheep housing on lowlands and foothills in respect of which they were required to maintain a certain stocking density.  I appreciate the need to promote regeneration of habitat but I hope, in relation to the framework plans, hill sheep farmers will not find themselves in a position where they have only one quarter of the sheep they started with.  When a connection is made with the number of culled sheep an eye should be kept on the viability of the holdings of hill sheep farmers who are of importance to the economy.  They are the custodians of the environment.  If this is left to the Department of Agriculture and Food, they might be given a little more sympathy.  It is important that this situation is monitored.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult time for pig farmers.  I accept that the problem is cyclical but must also mention what the Minister could, but did not, do.  Why has he not removed the slaughter-health levy of £1.05?  What an income boost it would be to small pig farmers who are selling between 200 and 300 pigs a week.  That is within the remit of the Minister but it has not been done.</P>
    <P>The House has not given answers today.  What the Minister had to say has been heard a thousand times before.  As a result no farmer will feel assured that his future is secure for the next few months.  Unless the Libyan and Iranian markets open, there will be serious trouble and the Minister does not appear to have a solution.</P>

      <P>Agriculture remains one of our most important economic sectors.  It is especially critical to the wellbeing of the rural economy.  I do not wish to engage in a negative political point scoring exercise against the Minister in this debate.  The issue is too important for that.  When I was a Member of a Government party I discovered that the present Minister's colleagues were good at such negative activity but I did not place credence in it.  The people, particularly the 150,000 farmers, are not fooled by such gibberish. I do not engage in it and the Minister will always find me constructive and anxious to put forward proposals for the improvement of the rural community.</P>
      <P>I will not blame the Minister for the weather and the absence of markets.  The latter is the result of global economic problems.  Agriculture, food and forestry account for almost 14.2 per cent of our GDP and about one of every seven people employed, approximately 175,000, are employed in that sector.  It also accounts for about 13 per cent of our exports and generates substantial foreign exchange earnings for Ireland.</P>
      <P>To ensure the continuance of this important sector it is vital that we support it as an essential and central component of rural development policy. It is clear that market forces and economic trends in conjunction with, even encouraged and fostered by, EU policies have had the effect of concentrating agricultural output, resources and incomes among a declining number of farmers. That was clear in the &ldquo;Léargas&rdquo; programme on television last night.  Incidentally, &ldquo;Ear to the Ground&rdquo; is due to carry a report on Mullingar mart and the problems of beef farmers, which I have highlighted in the House for a number of months.  Those problems were highlighted in last night's edition of &ldquo;Léargas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These policies increase rather than reduce the gulf between larger and smaller farmers.  If they continue, the viability and survival of small farm families will be threatened.  Eventually those families will face extinction.  We must be honest and unambiguous about what will happen.  The number of farms and of people engaged in agriculture will continue to decline.  Agriculture is an important generator of ancillary industries and unless there is a radical shift in policy those industries will also decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that 48 per cent of farm income derives from direct income supports.  We should examine these aids, subsidies, premia and supports which cost almost £1 billion.  Why should they be allocated in such a way that factory owners can position themselves to grab a decisive share?  Why should the factories refuse to operate the intervention mechanism fully unless changes which benefit them are implemented?  Furthermore, <Col N="1076" /> is it fair that less than 30 per cent of our farmers receive more than 70 per cent of the support payments while the other 70 per cent get less than 30 per cent?  These questions go to the heart of this crisis and they must be addressed sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a wily campaigner but the first lesson he must have learned is that the factories do not care tuppence for farmers.  His exhortations to the owners to utilise all available supports, for which the Minister fought hard and won in Europe, and to take due account of the serious difficulties in the finished cattle sector have fallen on deaf ears.  The Minister was wasting his breath. I agree with Deputy Connaughton that those people only understand one language.</P>
    <P>The Minister invited them to a meeting and secured what he believed to be an agreement. However, the following day the factory owners started to shift away from what was agreed.  They are aware that more than 100,000 cattle must be removed from the system between now and early January.  What have they done?  They are receiving a 40 per cent increase in margins, from 10 to 14 ECU per 100kgs, to encourage them to tender. However, even the Minister was disappointed with the tendering process, as was every farmer.</P>
    <P>The factory owners should spell out the efforts they are making to secure market outlets for themselves.  We heard a great deal of talk about the Libyan market.  What is causing the delay there?  Can anything more be done?  What about the Iranian market?  Saying these markets are open sends an optimistic psychological message to producers but it also creates a problem.  Farmers hold on to their cattle and feed them more while they wait with bated breath for the markets to open.  When they do not open the result is a glut on the home market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring told me a few hours ago that a man in his constituency brought 19 cattle to Listowel mart a few days ago and accepted £2,300 for them.  He could not bring them home and had to sell them.  I do not blame the Minister for that; it is market forces.  However, if a signal is sent that there will be a development in a market, that development should take place.  The signal should not be a stop-gap measure to relieve pressure for a short time, after which it is forgotten.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to benefits such as the 9p per pound refund increases.  One would have expected that to act as a strong basis for an improvement in cattle prices.  One would also expect those benefits to filter down through the beef sector and to be reflected in cattle prices at about 80p or 80.5p for R3 grades.</P>
    <P>A farmer asked me about these measures yesterday. He is one of the winter finishers who, as I have repeatedly warned the Minister, face extinction.  He asked me to find out what percentage of cattle are R3s.  It is a relevant question.  Is it 3 or 4 per cent?  He said: &ldquo;It is only a store animal.  Either they are pure breds &mdash; Continentals &mdash; or store animals or Holsteins, which cannot be fattened anyway.&rdquo; This benefit is no use <Col N="1077" /> for farmers such as him.  It stabilises the situation but does not improve it.</P>
    <P>This farmer told me that most people would accept 76p per pound.  The factories can still make a profit but the farmer cannot.  The farmer has a perishable commodity which he must dispose of.  He cannot wait forever.  This farmer said it was unbelievable to hear the factory owners arguing on their own behalf.  They claim to have stopped the fall in cattle prices.  Their line is that they have done well.  They make a virtue of having prevented something in which they were involved.  No matter how hard the Minister is working, this is a slap in the face for him.  Beef processors operate independently of each other and under different managers, yet they are at one on the prices they pay.  Is that not a strange coincidence?  We will support the Minister to try to ensure there is genuine competition and that the price secured by him at intervention level in terms of export refunds is conveyed to farmers. Profit margins must be evenly spread.  The consumer must be treated fairly as he or she is still paying an exorbitant price for beef.</P>
    <P>The crisis is so severe that thousands are leaving the land.  There are insufficient markets, crises in global economies and a lack of an emergency intervention strategy.  The poor harvest and fodder shortage have all culminated in making this an extremely difficult year, and the implementation of the Agenda 2000 proposals will only serve to deepen the crisis.  I call on the Minister to convene a national conference immediately to devise a strategy to revive farming and to protect it from the destructive effects of Agenda 2000.</P>
    <P>It is no good acting on a fire brigade basis.  The Department of Agriculture and Food is devising action on a day to day basis to cope with emerging crises, but there is no long-term strategy for agriculture, and a national conference would help to initiate such a strategy.  It would involve all the interest groups in our agricultural industry, including farmers, their representatives, rural representative groups, politicians, processors, retailers, traders, exporters and, most importantly, consumers.  Our approach to agriculture is completely fragmented.  At one end of the scale farmers are getting less than 76p or 77p per pound for beef, while consumers are paying up to £5 per pound.  Beef processors have failed to reflect the recent increase in export refunds in the price they are paying to farmers.</P>
    <P>The appeal system is the reason I have called for a simplification process.  One need only look at a Roscommon household survey done by the rural development group in that area.  The survey shows clearly that the current system of allocation is not working, as 50 per cent of people there have less than £5,000 in family farm income.  That is less than social welfare, as Deputy Connaughton said.  I have received letters from farmers who applied for the special beef premium, who sent in the relevant cards and who complied with the two month retention period.  One had an inspection six months later when an animal had lost an ear <Col N="1078" /> tag, though the same bullock would have been gone to the factory if it were not for the prices offered.  The inspector said payment would not be made on the animal and there would be a reduced payment for the other animals.</P>
    <P>Why does an inspection have to take place six months later when the animal could have been sold in the four intervening months?  The farmer could have sold the animal to the factory but held on hoping for a better price; he is then penalised for having lost a tag.  Common sense must be brought into this system.  Let us have an appeal system that is relevant, independent and that does not have an eight month delay, which is a chronic length of time for anyone to have to wait.  I am not criticising people for doing their best; some of those dealing with applicants are people I went to university with and they are doing their best under tough conditions.  However, farmers are waiting for appeals to be heard.</P>
    <P>I know a sheep farmer who bought land and was waiting for his premium.  A serious situation developed with 140 of his ewes and he has been deprived of his premium.  The case is now under appeal and the Minister replied to a parliamentary question I put down on this matter to the effect that it would be dealt with as soon as possible, but that is no use.  This farmer has loan repayments to make and is depending on that premium.  I hope it comes through, as I do not know why it was taken from him in the first place. Deputy Connaughton has referred to the area aid scheme, but the Department of Agriculture and Food staff dealing with this matter are doing their best.  That unit needs extra staff and resources. The Minister seems to have made a decision that an area aid form must be cleared before any premium for headage or tillage will be made, which is a significant change from previous years, as Deputy Connaughton said.  An amnesty allowed some payments to be made without the area aid clearance, but the Minister has not agreed to do that again this year.  Will the Minister reconsider this?  Many farmers are still trying to get through to the area aid unit in the Department, and they are also contacting us to get through to that unit.</P>
    <P>Renationalisation is rampant throughout Europe.  There is nothing common about the Common Agricultural Policy or the Common Trading Bloc apart from the word &ldquo;common&rdquo;. All countries utilised crises to promulgate and support their own products.  As Deputy Connaughton said, a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign was struck down by the European Court of Justice on the basis that it was unfair, but labelling requirements were used to promote renationalisation programmes. The Minister indicated that he supported shipping facilities in Ireland, but Europe tried to tackle us on this issue also.  We have a very strong case in favour of using whatever methods we can to get our cattle out in the live export trade, and I support the Minister's stand on this issue.</P>
    <P>There are other matters the Minister must act on, such as installation aid.  If 500 or 1,000 people <Col N="1079" /> are leaving farming every week, the Minister must take positive policy measures to stem that drift.  Installation aid is very important though the amount is small and criteria must be satisfied, such as being under 35, eligible for certification and possessing agricultural college qualifications. Approximately 94 young people per month qualified for it.  That is a significant number, amounting to approximately 1,100 farmers per year.  It was an effort to stem the flight from the land.  A farmer with 200 acres in North Westmeath which has suffered a 30 per cent drop in population, gave me three files that belonged to his three sons.  He had gone to Teagasc, had qualified in every way and had started the process of legal transfer of lands.  He then received letters telling him he could not go on.  The land transference money cost him £17,000.  This scheme would have helped his sons to perhaps purchase extra stock or to develop land.</P>
    <P>A number of young farmers have already applied for this scheme.  They are in limbo, and will have to be helped.  Young people must be given an opportunity to participate in farming.  I will continue to harass the Government into giving the Minister the necessary money.  The Minister for Finance is from a rural area and his brother is involved in the agricultural advisory service.  He knows well how important this matter is, as I am sure Hugh McCreevy has told him. A modern scheme was to be reintroduced, but nothing has been done.  There is no point in the Minister scraping around other areas of his Department for some money; this is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>The scheme would cost approximately £6 million to implement in full and a number of farmers have to be included.  The Minister made an application to the Commission in September, and I am disappointed because last May I was told here in the Chamber that everything was hunky-dory and that the Minister was going ahead with it.  That is why I was so angry.  I believe I was misled, either intentionally or unintentionally, and I was angry because I had told young farmers that it would be reintroduced, but it was not.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is happening at Government level.  I remember the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, telling me on one occasion that I did not know anything about agriculture but, unlike him, I did not have somebody to write a script for me. I intend to harass the Taoiseach about this matter because as late as yesterday, young people were telling me that it is a disgrace the scheme has not been reintroduced.</P>
    <P>Improvements have been made in the areas of pollution control and environmental protection and enhancement, with an additional allocation being made in the mid-term review.  Since the introduction of the land project scheme in 1949 there has been a scheme of State grants of one type or another available for on-farm investment. The absence of the control of farmyard pollution and the control of dairy hygiene schemes, and the <Col N="1080" /> unfavourable tax treatment of on-farm investment, has impacted adversely on farmers' morale and dampened self-initiation for farmers' dwindling resources.</P>
    <P>In recent years significant levels of investment were made by farmers, particularly in farm buildings. Most of the investment now required is related to environmental protection and new standards.  The focus will be on measures to protect the environment which will not yield an increase in the income of farm families.  Farm investment as a percentage of income has increased to approximately 28 per cent in 1997.</P>
    <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government undertook to restore the control of farmyard pollution scheme and implement a scheme to encourage on-farm investment.  It is essential that the CFP and the control of dairy hygiene schemes are reintroduced as a matter of priority and that they are properly funded.</P>
    <P>The Minister should impress upon the Government the necessity of dealing with the way capital allowances for pollution control investment and animal welfare are treated under the taxation code.  The farm pollution control allowance could be increased to 100 per cent and be made available in the first or any subsequent year or in a free depreciation model, with a writing down period of over seven years.  Commitments have been given in regard to these areas.</P>
    <P>Farmers, building contractors, concrete and steel suppliers and the rural economy, given the propensity of farmers to spend money locally, all benefit from these important on-farm schemes. The Exchequer benefits also through VAT, income tax, etc.  and also the environment.  As one person put it succinctly to me lately, it is a winwin situation for everybody involved.  Education will be important in the years ahead.  With new areas of trade and additional courses in agricultural colleges, we must ensure that young people in farming acquire other skills.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, opened up the agricultural college in Multyfarnham where a major investment has been made in the dairy unit there. I attended the opening also and some of the young people I met told me they were doing a farm buildings course at the college.  Such courses could be upgraded to include plumbing or carpentry because young people now must have a wealth of skills to work on the farm.  If their incomes are affected, they should be in a position to acquire additional off-farm income.  I appeal to the Minister to liaise with FÁS in this regard who might encourage colleges to introduce certificate courses in these areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the scheme that is to be introduced to deal with the problem of the 200,000 hill ewes which have to be disposed of.  The Minister is obviously aware of the problem in the pig industry for the past five months.  It arose because of the absence of the necessary slaughter facilities as well as the turbulence on the Asian markets.  This has resulted in a build-up of approximately 10,000 pigs, many of which are now overweight, and <Col N="1081" /> farmers are losing up to £30 per head, as Deputy Connaughton said.  All farmers cannot be blamed for the problem which is a regional one.  I am aware it is not as severe in the south but it is very severe north of the midlands as well as in the north west.  Every effort should be made by processors to utilise private storage and the export refunds that have been made.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing time with me.  I have been on the hustings in recent weeks with Deputy Penrose and Deputy Connaughton and regardless of what is said about this crisis, there are many angry farmers in Cork, Tipperary, as the Minister of State will confirm, and elsewhere.  Those of us who regularly attend meetings to hear the problems farmers face know how those problems change from year to year, but I have been in public life a long time and I have no doubt this crisis is one of the worst any of us have experienced.</P>
      <P>We do not want to criticise the Minister.  We support him when he takes action to, for instance, improve the supports mechanism in the European Union.  However, we are critical of the fact that the processors have taken advantage of those improvements and set themselves up as a type of banking system for their own benefit and not for the benefit of the primary producers.  Any benefits the Minister may have obtained have not been reaped by the farmers.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his colleagues are the people who made many promises to farmers; the farmers now want those promises to be met.  The Libyan trade has become a debacle.  I know the Minister acted in regard to the political contacts that were made, and that the principle has been accepted, but that created an anticipation that the market would reopen.  It has not reopened and that has caused other problems such as farmers holding on to animals.</P>
      <P>The same position obtains in relation to the Iranian trade.  I visited Iran two years ago and met many of the main political figures, as well as veterinary representatives. I am pleased the Minister has made further progress and I hope the visit of certain technical people next week will result in that market being reopened, but it will reopen at a level that will not have a significant impact on the current crisis in exports.  Iran will not take £100 million worth of animals as it did in the past.  The Iranian Ambassador told me last night that Iran was almost self-sufficient in cattle and, therefore, we should not raise our hopes too high.  The reopening of this market will not be the panacea for all the problems that currently exist.</P>
      <P>A promise was made in regard to the installation scheme.  It has not been fulfilled and all of us in this House are being accused of breaking promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food is an excellent Department with dedicated staff from the Secretary General down.  It is a huge Department which touches on the livelihoods of many <Col N="1082" /> people every week whether for headage payments, direct payments or cheques in the post. We have a major responsibility to tidy up any inadequacies.  The Minister has addressed some of these in his speech.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made every effort in recent months to deal with the crisis.  The question of installation aid has been raised for some time and the Minister has received Government approval for the reintroduction of an installation aid package.  It is awaiting approval in Brussels and we hope to have the support of all sides in our endeavours to have it reintroduced.  The Commission has raised a number of queries but I hope in the not too distant future the Minister will be in a position to deal with them.  Given that he inherited many problems, his efforts in the crisis should be complimented.</P>
      <P>Farmers should be complimented for producing the highest number of livestock ever in the State.  The other arm which is necessary to deal with the crisis, namely, the processors and the marketers, has failed in its duty to producers in regard to market access.  We heard much about the beef sector last week.  There was agreement that 81p would be paid for grade R beef while today the price being offered is around 75p and producers are forced to accept it.  The weather conditions of the past 24 hours will force people to accept even lower prices.  Why is a kilo of steer beef, grade R, worth 167p in Ireland and 254p in France?  These figures cannot be denied.  The meat processors have a question to answer.  When McKinsey has completed his review there may be a need to look at the possibility of dividing the slaughterers and the processors and forcing those in the slaughter business out of processing.  It is a cartel and let nobody have any illusions about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I suffered very severely from it on a personal level many years ago.  I am not afraid to say so in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for new markets and to determine what can be done for processors and those who are seeking new markets.  The Russian market was fine.  Some 70,000 tonnes of frozen beef was exported to Russia.  The profit margin was accepted but nobody looked further than the following week's kill.  Nobody tried to determine what would happen if anything went wrong in Russia.  When that market failed our beef industry was destroyed at all levels.  Were it not for the considerable amount of live shipping from Ireland there would be utter chaos.  The Minister is to be complimented on ensuring that walk-on boats and ferries for roll-on roll-off were put in <Col N="1083" /> place although there is still insufficient capacity to handle the number of livestock that could be exported.  This has other consequences.  The top range of the market is being exported and there will be problems down the road.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the grading system. The quality of livestock will be diminished given that farmers have to accept the best price.  The best price is available from the shippers and farmers should accept it.  There is a need for the system to be examined.  If the price of the grade R3 steer is 167p per kilogram in Ireland and 254p in France he will seek naturalisation in France very soon.  The reason French, Spanish, Italian and Dutch farmers want to buy Irish cattle is that they are much cheaper than the cattle in their own countries.  The factories should be told that an intervention price is acceptable.  They have had an increase in their processing costs and they have no excuse for trying to take it from the farmer.  The farmer should be paid the relevant rates for the various grades instead of being cut by 4p and 5p.</P>
    <P>Third countries have been mentioned.  In regard to the opening of the Libyan markets nothing more can be done by the Government than has already been done.  We should look back at all the efforts that have been made by the Government to try to restore the markets in Libya and Iran.  Other countries in eastern Europe and western Asia are crying out for cattle and could take some of these cattle.  There should be a concerted effort to have more shipping available. We hope the Libyan situation will be resolved without delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be complimented on speeding up the payments system.  It will not solve the problem but will help to alleviate the shortterm cash flow problems of farmers.  If the other returns from the processing side and the sale of livestock are not increased there will be a major crisis in the spring.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes to be in a position to announce the necessary fodder package in the near future.  Something will have to be done to ensure fodder is provided and the livestock maintained. Livestock has no value to the economy if allowed die or deteriorate due to lack of feed. Some parts of the country do not have a problem but in the west and in my constituency there is an acute problem which has been added to by the downpour in the past 48 hours.</P>
    <P>The culling of mountain ewes is welcomed by everybody, including sheep farmers.  The lambs of 1998 are left because they could not be sold.  If the old culled ewes are removed at a reasonable price it will help farmers maintain stock and the breeding base.</P>
    <P>The APS scheme referred to by the Minister has not been taken up by the pigmeat factories. Given the increase of 33 per cent in export refunds for pigmeat something must be done on that front.  If the scheme is properly implemented it could be of major assistance to pig farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> The fodder scheme will have to be targeted at those most in need of assistance &mdash; the small farmers who have suffered most.  I hope the maximum amount will be paid.  The Minister will endeavour to have it paid as quickly as possible. It will give farmers an opportunity to plan their winter feed and what concentrates they may wish to buy.  I hope there will not be profiteering by those who control the import of grain and certain other proteins because there have been problems in the past and at times the market has been distorted.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement was mentioned earlier.  It will have to be looked at in the context of other social welfare schemes.  I am pleased it is the Minister's intention to try to persuade the Government to introduce a graduated pension scheme.  It is important to give some type of pension to those who paid contributions over the years and probably remain in farming.  That is to be appreciated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and the Ministers of State on their efforts to tackle the serious difficulties facing a number of sectors in agriculture.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has succeeded in introducing a number of measures which are very helpful in trying to tackle the difficulties and improving the prices paid to primary producers.  He has succeeded in increasing shipping capacity, intervention, export refunds and the aids to private storage, both for sheep and pigmeat.  Other measures have been introduced in respect of beef.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions I have highlighted in this House the very serious difficulties facing pig producers.  I want to see the small scale pig producer protected.  A totally inadequate range of slaughtering capacity has been available since the fire in the Lovell and Christmas plant in Ballymoney last June.  As Deputy Penrose said, pig producers in the north midlands and Border regions are finding it very difficult to get an outlet to which they can send pigs.  There is a huge differential in the prices paid to pig producers in the northern and southern parts of the country.</P>
      <P>We have said on numerous occasions that efforts must be made to protect small scale producers because we do not want that industry to be left in the hands of a small number of large producers.  Similarly, the pig slaughtering and processing capacity must not be confined to a small number of big processing companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>McCarrens and Company bacon curers were established in my county in 1860 and traded successfully until early 1996 when, unfortunately, the plant closed.  There were industrial relations problems but fortunately they have been solved. The Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, and his officials have made every effort to get that plant reopened.  We expected it to reopen last Monday week but, unfortunately, that has not happened.  The Minister stated today that he hoped it would open at an early date. <Col N="1085" /> The Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, and the officials have given every encouragement and made every possible facility available to promoters interested in the plant.  Will he ensure that every effort is made to have that modern facility reopened.  It gave employment to generations of Cavan families and provided an outlet for the pig producers in that region.</P>
    <P>It is time to review the entire pigmeat industry. There is not adequate licensed processing capacity in this country.  Pig output per annum has increased from 2.5 million in the mid-1980s to 4 million at present, which is considerable growth. It is time for the Department and the Government to review the level of assistance available to set up new pig processing facilities.</P>
    <P>We will not have competition or an adequate number of outlets for pig producers until we have a number of medium sized processing plants.  A dangerous trend in the pigmeat industry is confining processing to a small number of large companies.</P>
    <P>Members on both sides of the House tonight rightly highlighted the disgraceful conduct of the factories in regard to the prices recently paid to farmers for beef.  The Minister stated this evening:</P>
    <P>It is essential that the improved support in terms of export refunds and intervention are immediately passed on to the producers, i.e., farmers.  There is no justification for processors to hold prices at current levels.</P>
    <P>I fully support the Minister's sentiments and the Government must take whatever action it can immediately.  The farmer deserves a just price but that price is not being paid by the factories today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk and I tabled a matter on the Adjournment two weeks ago in which we raised with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the concern of farmers and consumers about the huge differentials between the prices paid at the farm gate and those charged in retail outlets.  We said that a limited number of multiples are exercising a disproportionate degree of power and control over the production chain.  It is time for the Government to refer this issue to the Competition Authority to examine the very serious differential between the price paid to the primary producer and that charged to the consumer.  Both primary producers and consumers deserve fair play, which they are not getting at the moment.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The meat factories are operating as a cartel and are ripping off farmers, which is amazing considering that the majority of meat factories are made up of farming groups.  I welcomed the farmers who took up residence in the Department of Agriculture and Food last week, for which they came in for a great deal of criticism.  I heard on the radio today that they have also been picketing outside the meat factories, which is also welcome.</P>
      <P>The factories are not offering the farming community any support at the moment &mdash; they move prices up and down, operate as a cartel and their entire operations leave a great deal to be desired. I appreciate what the Minister has done to date, but it is time for him, in conjunction with the farming organisations and the Opposition spokespersons, to put severe pressure on the meat factories to pay a fair and reasonable price to farmers.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the commitment made by the Minister on the issue of farm installation aid.  It baffles me why Brussels continues to intervene in this area.  Officials from Brussels seem to be sticking their noses into every national issue which arises &mdash; we heard today that they have reservations about the urban and rural renewal scheme and they are also blocking payment of the farm installation aid.  I ask the Minister to put severe pressure on Brussels to ensure young people are encouraged into farming and not denied the opportunity to take up their places in agriculture by bureaucrats in Brussels.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brendan Smith spoke about the pig industry, which is undoubtedly in crisis due to the worldwide surplus of pigmeat and structural problems in our processing industry which have had a severe effect on producers.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food should look seriously at the operations of the pig industry.</P>
      <P>The plan introduced 15 years ago is nowhere near adequate to meet the needs of pig producers and to get a decent price for pig farmers.  We need a complete review of the pig processing industry and I ask the Minister to look seriously at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also ask him to give the go-ahead immediately to Enterprise Ireland to bring extra capacity on stream without delay.  He has the power to do this <Col N="1087" /> and, from discussions which farm organisations and others have had with Brussels, it will not stand in the way of this happening.  He must put pressure on the factories to take pigmeat off the market using the APS system which he announced recently and of which they have not made use to date.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister bring forward proposals for an export credit insurance scheme for a limited volume of pigmeat to restart export trade with Russia?  I understand the French Government did so recently and there is no reason our Minister and Department cannot do the same.  I implore the Minister to listen to the pig producers and to do what he can to help them stay in business.  He knows of my interest in the pig industry and that of Deputies from all sides of the House.  Dramatic action is needed and I ask him to immediately intervene on their behalf.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Creed and Deputy Farrelly.  I am delighted to speak in this important debate but disagree with my good friend and colleague, Deputy Penrose, someone I respect and admire.  He said he wanted to be constructive and not be negative.  I am afraid when one is in politics, one must be positive and negative and tell it as it is.</P>
      <P>I remember being in Westport and Castlebar with his former party leader, Deputy Spring. Fianna Fáil was wonderful at bringing people out. Even when marchers came to Dublin there would be one thousand from the IFA and five thousand from Fianna Fáil.  They wondered what Deputy Spring was doing about agriculture and wanted to know why he was flying all over the world and why was he not opening markets, etc.  They said things could not be right with Deputy De Rossa in Government.  However, I saw a banner the other day when the farmers were in Dublin which read: &ldquo;We want De Rossa as Minister for Agriculture&rdquo;. How times have changed.  I saw about 2,000 people from my constituency and thousands from all over the country at that march.</P>
      <P>The farmers will come again on 28 October.  I have not yet seen the Minister face the farmers either in the Shelbourne Hotel, the Davenport Hotel or at any public meeting.  He has not appeared but has sent his two deputies.  At the ploughing championships, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Seamus Brennan, being an urban and city man, said &mdash; as Charlie Haughey once said he did not realise there was a crisis in health &mdash; he did not realise there was a crisis in agriculture, although he sits at the Cabinet table every Tuesday morning. Is he asleep at the Cabinet table or is agriculture not discussed there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I saw Fianna Fáil Deputies running throughout the House and to the telephones and radio stations I said good news would be announced this evening.  I listened to the Minister but did not hear any good news.  The same old <Col N="1088" /> promises were trotted out again, but nothing will be delivered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the culled ewe slaughter scheme and am delighted the Minister has introduced such a scheme.  I hope it will not be like the fodder scheme and we will not have to wait weeks to know how it will be implemented.  If farmers are allowed to claim for 100, 75 or 50 ewes I hope it will not affect their quotas in the future because that would be very unfair.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister this evening speak about the farm retirement scheme.  He spoke about PRSI and said he hoped there would be an announcement in the budget.  I hope he is right because many farmers will not retire of their own free will.  As a result of the antics of this Government in the area of agriculture they will have to get out of farming.</P>
    <P>A man with 100 acres of land &mdash; a mixture of commonage and low lying land both good and bad &mdash; came to me on Monday and asked me if I would sell it as I was an auctioneer.  I told him to hold on that things could not get any worse.  He said that was what I said three months ago and things were still getting worse.  We were promised live cattle would be exported to Libya, Iran and elsewhere, but that has not happened.</P>
    <P>Last week there was a protest by the IFA in Agriculture House and people slept there.  Many people believe Ministers have been asleep in Agriculture House for a long time because nothing has happened in the past 18 months. There was a meeting attended by factory managers, the IFA, the Minister and officials.  They shook hands, photographs were taken and it was reported on RTE.  Larry was there and although he does not smile that much he was certainly smiling coming out of that meeting, because nothing would change.  We were told prices would go up on Monday morning to 82p or 83p.  What happened?  Larry and the boys got together again on Sunday and rang around.  They said, &ldquo;we have them on the run and we will crucify them&rdquo;, and that is what they did.</P>
    <P>Speaking of cartels, I used to watch &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; at one time and JR would not teach these fellows anything.  We have many JRs and &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; types running the factories.  Will the Minister bring them in tomorrow morning to say &ldquo;enough is enough&rdquo;.  As Deputy Connaughton said, these fellows will be in Agriculture House at a later stage looking for something else and the answer should be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  There should be justice in this matter.  Farmers should get a fair price for their products.  In fairness to the Minister, he went to Europe and negotiated a deal.  We expected it to be passed on to the farmer but that did not happen and somebody should answer for that.  It is time these fellows answered for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooper-Flynn will have listened to hill sheep farmers as I have in recent months.  I hope she realises there is a crisis and these farmers are suffering.  She will know what happens when one goes to meetings.  The farmers put pressure on us and it is tough.  I had a clinic on Monday in Westport <Col N="1089" /> and 70 per cent of people came to discuss area aid.  We were promised this situation would never happen again.  An announcement was made in May about a revamp in the Department in relation to area aid in Mayo, Donegal and another county.  We were told there would be 11 telephone lines in the Department.  I rang on Monday but got the answering machine.  The message was, &ldquo;do not contact us, we will contact you if we have a problem.&rdquo; I know of farmers who have been waiting for many months for the postman to come on a Monday or Tuesday with a cheque.  However, there has been no sign of the cheques or anyone contacting them from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  This is 1998 and not some bygone year when there were no answering machines or telephones, in some cases.  It is a disgraceful situation.  If the Minister has any control in the Department, this matter should be resolved immediately.</P>
    <P>As regards answers to questions, the Department has said it is waiting for replies from the farmers.  Some farmers sent in replies six or seven weeks ago and are still waiting for payment.  That is not good enough.  In times of crisis these people need assistance and payments should be made. Last night I said in the Dáil that the Minister must go to Europe immediately to get a derogation in the payment of headage and premium payments.  If there are problems in the future, that money can be recouped.  The farmers are not going anywhere.</P>
    <P>Senator Chambers made a big announcement in the local newspaper last week about the assistance scheme for farmers known as the farmer's dole.  That scheme has existed for the past 50 years.  However, I urge the Minister to ask social welfare officers to stay at home.  There is nothing to monitor any more.  Farmers are going through a difficult time and they should be left alone. They are being crucified by the Department and others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in convincing the community at large that there is a crisis in agriculture.  One of the reasons for this is probably that over the years, regardless of the circumstances, the IFA and other farming organisations have been masters at crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall meeting a delegation from the IFA in one of the party rooms after Deputy Yates was appointed Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The price of winter fatteners at the time was 101p and we were told there was no way farmers could survive.  The price is now 77p or 78p but the Minister's speech did not convey any urgency or recognition of the extent of the crisis. I recall when Deputy Yates was Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and cattle prices were 85p a lb in the factories a payment of £50 a head for heifers was introduced.  This type of urgent response is required now to put money in farmers' pockets.  However, the response to questions raised by other economic interests in the community is that in the early 1990s, when Mr. <Col N="1090" /> Ray MacSharry was Commissioner for Agriculture and the current Minister was also in office, we took the road of Common Agricultural Policy reforms.  The main thrust of these was to guarantee farmers' incomes rather than prices.</P>
    <P>This is the continuing thrust of the proposals which have been published.  Therefore, income crises in agriculture demand a political response because market supports are being dismantled. This is why the type of response introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Yates, and the previous Government of a payment of £50 per heifer is needed now to put income in farmers' pockets.</P>
    <P>The Minister made great play about the almost £1 billion in direct income aid.  However, that is probably most of the income of farmers at this stage.  It equates to approximately 48 per cent on the basis of the figures given by the Minister. However, some farmers bought cattle in the spring with the intention of making money in the fall and they are now faced with a loss.  Bringing forward payments to which they are entitled anyway is only giving them tomorrow's dinner today. As Deputy Connaughton said, there is a long dreary winter ahead without the prospect of any payments.  An initiative similar to the type introduced by the previous Government of £50 a head for heifers is needed to give the cash injection required by farmers at present.</P>
    <P>There have been tax amnesties in the past. Consideration should be given to some form of amnesty in the area aid unit.  Some farmers are in difficulty because of simple errors in the completion of application forms.  All payments to these farmers are being withheld.  Other farmers have mapping problems and are awaiting digitising. They cannot get through to the area aid unit. Replies to parliamentary questions bear no resemblance to the truth because the Department cannot get through to the area aid unit.  We are getting two line responses that cases are being processed and payments will be made in due course.  No factual information is being conveyed in replies to parliamentary questions at present because the area aid unit is not replying to queries.</P>
    <P>In view of the current crisis some type of amnesty should be introduced to allow payments to be made in all areas.  If necessary, money can be recouped at a later stage.  A similar system operates in the Department if errors in other schemes are discovered subsequently.  Due to the current crisis, I urge the Minister, notwithstanding all the other efforts, to bring forward payments in most areas.  Payments which are being delayed due to digitising difficulties should be made now.  If errors are identified later, the money can be recouped from future payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at length with the issue of live exports.  However, nobody is any the wiser in terms of the exact problem or when the boats will sail.  The Minster is sending the Irish Ambassador in Rome to Tripoli in Libya to find out the exact situation.  However, he did not outline the difficulties. If all the protocols have been agreed and <Col N="1091" /> ships are ready to sail, why are they still berthed? Is it the case that Irish cattle can be bought but others have cornered the market and having the markets reopened and protocols signed does not effectively mean that cattle will be bought here? In recent weeks many farmers held off selling cattle because of the promise that the live export trade would resume and that this would put manners on the factories.  However, prices have collapsed since those expectations were raised.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made great play of the fact that significant numbers of weanlings are being exported.  That is the case, but it is a double edged sword.  The animals are being exported at the expense of winter fatteners, about whom Deputy Penrose speaks regularly.  They will be as scarce as the corncrake in agriculture soon if their livelihood is not addressed.  However, another issue is the type and quality of cattle which will be slaughtered this time next year.  The best quality cattle are being bought for weanling export.  All that is left is what is referred to in the south as racing bullocks, Friesian-Holsteins which cannot be fattened anyway.  They will go in for slaughter at the end of next year.  Attempts to market that as quality beef will be a horrendous nightmare for Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>There are serious structural problems in the beef industry.  Too many people are handling cattle between birth and slaughter; on average, there are six or seven movements of cattle.  The breeding of cattle for the beef industry is nowhere near as professional and efficient as it should be. It has been looked upon almost as a pastime rather than a serious economic activity for many. When the squeeze happens as in the current crisis as never before, they are not in any way equipped to ride out the storm.</P>
    <P>Bord Bia faces two difficulties.  First, it does not have a high quality product to market.  Ireland has never been able to command a quality price for its produce because we do not have all-yearround quality products to market.  The board is also hamstrung because if a brand image for Irish beef, such as the image for dairy products through Kerrygold, is to be developed, a sustained budget over ten years is required.  It has been done successfully with Kerrygold and there is a need to do it for beef.  This should be done in conjunction with ensuring as few movements of cattle as possible from birth to slaughter.  The quality of breeding in the beef industry also needs to be addressed if we are to be equipped to ride out the storms which are inevitable when we are trading as a small country in a global economy and at the mercy of downturns in Russia and Asia.</P>
    <P>If this is coupled with events in Europe in terms of the renationalisation of consumers and reorientation towards their own products, Ireland as a country which exports nine out of every ten cattle must be at the cutting edge of marketing. It must have the best quality product and the best <Col N="1092" /> equipped agency to sell it.  We are falling down in all those areas at present.</P>
    <P>Regarding on farm investment schemes, we have heard about installation aid since Deputy Walsh became Minister for Agriculture and Food 18 months ago.  I hoped a positive announcement would have been made at the ploughing championships. I am now hoping such an announcement will be made at the annual conference of Macra na Feirme which will take place in the Minister's constituency shortly.  Something needs to be done to give people an incentive to remain on the land.  It costs the IDA approximately £12,000 to create an industrial job.  I do not apologise to the Exchequer or to the taxpayer for suggesting that a similar incentive should be introduced during a crisis in agriculture to make it more attractive to young people to take up a career in farming.</P>
    <P>The absence of the dairy hygiene scheme, which would cost only £3 million or £4 million, is driving many small farmers out of dairying as they cannot meet the hygiene standards.  Similarly, the absence of the control of farmyard pollution scheme, and its linkage with eligibility for the REP scheme, is crucifying many small farmers because they cannot control their farmyard pollution they cannot enter the REP scheme.  These were concrete promises given by the Government before the election.  They formed part of the platform which conned the farming community at that election and the Government has failed to deliver on these promises after 18 months in office.  I suspect we are waiting for the next round of Structural Funds to be negotiated when something might be put together.</P>
    <P>Teagasc has a significant role to play in ensuring that the maximum number of people remain in farming, even if it is part-time farming.  The modules used in agricultural colleges could be geared towards ensuring that people have off-farm income skills, such as building, plumbing, plastering and so on.  This would supplement their agricultural incomes.  It is in the interests of the farming community and the social fabric of rural Ireland that as many people as possible retain an attachment to the land.</P>
    <P>It is not inevitable that there will be fewer and bigger farmers if we look creatively at these problems. Teagasc has a significant role to play.  I was disappointed its blueprint for the new millennium did not address this issue.  There is a disappointing and unhealthy turning inwards among the farming community, which is differentiating between part-time and full-time farmers.  Both have a significant role to play in the rural economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment most Deputies for the constructive manner in which they have <Col N="1093" /> approached this debate.  Everyone recognises that farming is at it lowest point since the 1970s. People in my constituency have been going through a difficult time.  In light of that fact it is appropriate that we recognise the work done by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, during this difficult period.  It is important to acknowledge that £746 million has been paid directly to farmers in 1998.  This includes £108 million in REPS payments.  It is also important to remember that a record £204 million has been paid in the last week.  This is almost twice the £107 million paid up to 22 October 1996.  These payments are assisting farmers who are suffering cashflow problems.</P>
      <P>This year, £382 million has been paid under the premium and headage payment schemes.  This is compared to £107 million at the same stage in 1996.  This will be of interest to Deputies on the opposite side, particularly Deputy Ring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers were getting prices for their cattle and sheep then.  They had plenty of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spoke in generalities during his contribution but gave few facts. I am highlighting almost a 255 per cent increase in headage and premium schemes in 1998 &mdash; £382 million as opposed to £170 million when the Deputy's party was in power.  The Deputy failed to highlight these points.</P>
      <P>The Minister has paid out more than £108 million in REPS payments in 1998.  This is more than was paid out in all headage and premium schemes at this stage in 1996.  The figure for that year was £107 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers are getting paid earlier this year than ever before.  Headage payments have been made three weeks earlier than last year.  The charter of rights says that suckler cow and special beef premiums should start on 1 November.  This year they started on 6 October and £204 million has been paid so far.  The Minister also received approval from the Commission to pay 80 per cent of the payments, as opposed to the 60 per cent previously agreed.</P>
      <P>No one is suggesting that farmers are not entitled to these direct payments.  We must recognise that the Minister has responded swiftly to the serious cashflow problems being experienced by farmers.  I have never seen such problems being experienced by any group as by farmers in County Mayo.  People do not have enough money to provide a weekly income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While recognising this fact, it is important to state that £47 million has been <Col N="1094" /> paid in headage and premium payments in County Mayo in the first ten months of 1998, compared to £46 million for the whole of last year.  This illustrates that there have been significant improvements in direct payments to farmers which have eased their lot somehow.  I was delighted to be able to tell farmers attending the IFA meeting in Westport that the slaughter premium for cull ewes was on the way.  This initiative was also welcomed by Deputy Ring.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to welcome this initiative and congratulate the Deputy on doing likewise.  I compliment the Minister for this initiative which will assist farmers in the west, particularly those with hill sheep who cannot afford to feed their animals and have nowhere to put them.  Something had to be done and the Minister has responded.</P>
      <P>Listening to media reports and comments by some Deputies in recent weeks, one would be inclined to blame the Minister for the crisis in Russia and the rain.  Why do we never receive plaudits when the weather is fine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is responding to the fodder problems.  I hope in the months ahead we will also see the re-introduction of the farmyard pollution scheme which, unfortunately, was done away with by the previous Minister, Deputy Yates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all sides of the House will campaign for such a measure.  The same applies to the installation aid.  I compliment the Minister on the work he is doing on the Libyan and Iranian markets and the significant increase in live cattle exports, which now results in 6,000 cattle leaving Ireland each week.  This compares with 1,000 under the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the situation with the factories is a disgrace.  While everyone in this House is talking about a crisis in farming, unfortunately, the factories do not seem able to recognise that fact. They are not passing on any of the benefits to producers.  It is time they recognised that they too have an obligation.  The Government is doing everything it can in a time of crisis and the factories <Col N="1095" /> should take note.  I regret that many farmers are experiencing severe income problems.  The Government is doing all it can to alleviate these problems and I compliment the Minister on his work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The pigmeat, sheepmeat, beef and cereal sectors are experiencing serious difficulties. It has been a difficult year for agriculture. I too compliment the Minister and the Ministers of State for their hard work in the past few months, not just since the crisis erupted but since taking office.  The Government's priority was to try to open as many markets as possible, particularly for live trade.  The Minister has been working to achieve this and has had some success in Libya and Iran.  He has done all he can with regard to Libya.  However, there are commercial obstacles which I hope will be overcome in the near future.</P>
      <P>Every speaker has referred to the factories. Factories are not living up to their responsibilities to the farming community.  It is disgraceful that they are out to screw farmers at a time of crisis. We all know there is a cartel operating but we cannot prove it.  The Minister must take whatever action he can against the meat factories and every Member of this House would support him in that. It is essential that improved supports in terms of export refunds and intervention are passed on to the producers immediately so that they can acquire higher prices.  There is no justification for processors to maintain prices at current levels.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward payments under the headage, REPS, premiums and suckler cow schemes as they are of assistance. We are all aware that many farming families are facing a financial crisis at the moment.  I know the Minister and Ministers of State will make whatever efforts they can to address that.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, is familiar with the situation in regard to the pig industry in the north-east.  I thank him for meeting producers in the area.  One of the finest factories in County Meath, Dromone Meats in Oldcastle, is in a position to slaughter more pigs but unfortunately it cannot get the necessary veterinary inspection.  I have appealed to the Minister of State to address this problem which I hope will be resolved as soon as possible.  This constructive debate has shown we are all behind the Minister and Ministers of State in their efforts to take whatever action is necessary in the interest of Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate although it is difficult to address the range of difficulties confronting Irish agriculture in the space of a few minutes.  The contributions so far reflect the difficulties which currently exist within the industry.  We must recognise that the agricultural sector has been through a very traumatic time.  However, we must also recognise there are a number of enterprises <Col N="1096" /> within the industry experiencing reasonable cash flow and returns, specifically the dairy sector.  The potato industry is also in a reasonable state following a number of very difficult years.</P>
      <P>The structure of Irish agriculture makes it susceptible to the type of difficulties which have come on stream recently.  The basic problem at the moment is that there is a serious over supply in the beef, sheep and pigmeat markets.  Market outlets are either sluggish or are not in a position to do business.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the importance of exports to Irish agriculture.  Due to the collapse of the Russian economy, the market there has essentially collapsed.  The Russians' capacity to buy meat from us at this time is clearly questionable. We can hope the EU will be prepared to put an aid package together to see the Russians through the winter.  I know the Minister and his officials have made strenuous efforts to open the Libyan market but it has not been possible to do so as of yet even though all the necessary arrangements are in place.  Hopefully, the market can be triggered fairly quickly if the Libyan market opens up.  The Minister has been successful in making contact with the Iranians and has also achieved success on the intervention front.  While the ball is very much in the meat factories' court, we can appeal to them to accept some responsibility and play their part in increasing the price of meat to what would effectively be a break even situation. We are not talking about individual farmers making money, merely escaping from a loss making situation.</P>
      <P>The Irish agriculture industry was very badly hit by the BSE crisis which impacted greatly on consumer confidence in Ireland and Britain. While we are making a steady recovery from that, the integrity of meat products remains very important given that consumers are now more conscious than ever of quality.</P>
      <P>Another important issue relates to the various agricultural payments.  The area aid unit is doing its best to ensure minimum delay in payments. However, there are a whole range of difficulties which can affect applications.  I am aware from contacts in the Cooley mountain area that commonages invariably create huge problems.  I often wonder whether an arbitrator should be put in place to deal with difficulties which arise in regard to commonage.  Where there are seven or eight individual farmers or shareholders, serious difficulties and delays can be experienced.  There is no recognised legal formula for the division of commonage shareholding and the procedure varies from one place to another.  I am sure it is particularly acute in the west where commonage is very much part of the farming structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time at my disposal, I wish to lend my support to the Minister and his colleagues for the important work they are doing to highlight the difficulties facing the Irish agriculture industry and in their endeavours to achieve further progress on meat prices.  One of <Col N="1097" /> the most serious problems facing farmers in my constituency relates to selling store cattle.  Every effort must be made to ensure a mechanism is found to find a genuine market for these cattle.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the various contributions made by Deputy Connaughton on this issue but did not hear many constructive proposals to deal with the crisis.  I was a member of the Opposition in 1974 when Mark Clinton was Minister in similar circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>A constructive approach was adopted by all sides of the House to deal with the matter at that time.  The only proposal put forward by Fine Gael in the numerous debates on this issue relates to the family income supplement.  Many farmers in my constituency are in receipt of smallholders' assistance and I am not convinced they would benefit enormously from a further evaluation of their means by undergoing the rigours of the FIS mechanism.  Some of those already in receipt of funding might stand to lose it.  An over dependence on markets in countries which are economically and politically unstable to the neglect of the European market and of our processing industry is a risk which should not be taken.  While the Russian, Libyan and the other markets have been very important, we have seen what can happen in the context of the Russian market.  It is not long since the Russian market was not so important to Irish agriculture.  That market has now almost collapsed resulting in serious losses.</P>

      <Col N="1098" /> That Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P>(a) notes that the Committee of Public Accounts in the course of its examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Annual Report on the Appropriation Accounts for 1997 (paragraphs 6-17 inclusive), and earlier reports on the Revenue Commissioners, is considering the position in relation to outstanding liabilities for DIRT by financial institutions;</P>
    <P>(b) congratulates the Committee on the rapid progress which it has already made in its investigations;</P>
    <P>(c) is concerned that the terms of reference of the Committee, as provided in the Standing Orders of this House, may not encompass the investigation which it has undertaken and, accordingly and notwithstanding anything in those Standing Orders, hereby resolves that the Committee may examine and report to Dáil Éireann upon:</P>
    <P>(i) the circumstances surrounding any purported settlement, agreement or understanding between financial institutions in their capacity as deposit takers and the Revenue Commissioners in respect of undeclared DIRT liabilities arising from the operation of bogus non-resident accounts, and</P>
    <P>(ii) the use of such accounts for the purpose of evading DIRT, the information known or available to the financial institutions, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank concerning this practice and the steps taken to bring it to an end;</P>
    <P>(d) considers that the Committee should be facilitated in every way possible to bring its investigation to a rapid conclusion;</P>
    <P>(e) notes that the Committee has now tabled an Interim Report to the Dáil on the matter calling for changes to its Standing Orders and legislative changes and notes its proposal that the Comptroller and Auditor General be requested to undertake certain investigations into the administration of DIRT by the Revenue Commissioners and the relevant financial institutions;</P>
    <P>(f) undertakes to give the Committee any additional powers or assistance which Dáil Éireann considers may be necessary to enable it to complete its investigations as soon as possible; and</P>
    <P>(g) in recognition of the fact that the matter under investigation is one of urgent public importance undertakes to decide on its response to each point raised in the Committee's Interim Report at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Fine Gael amendment has been withdrawn as a consequence of <Col N="1099" /> this resolution which incorporates our amendment and the wishes of Members on all sides.</P>
      <P>The discussions which have taken place in recent days on this issue have enlightened many and confused just as many.  I speak as a Member of the House and not as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>One of the things that has become obvious to everybody in recent years is the absence of a committee with sufficient power to examine the nitty gritty of issues which have arisen.  It has been necessary to have recourse to public inquiries.  A Dáil committee should not take the place of a public inquiry at any time in any event.  However, it is generally accepted outside the House that a Dáil committee with sufficient teeth is probably as effective as a public inquiry and much cheaper. Value for money from the viewpoint of the taxpayer is one of the issues which needs to be taken into account and kept in mind at all times.  Would it have been better to have had some of the inquiries which have taken place in recent years conducted by Dáil committees, assuming they had sufficient powers to carry out their work?</P>
      <P>In recent times I noted some discussion as to whether some committees have been acting <i>ultra vires.</i>  It would appear the committees have been reasonably effective as they have been able to do their work with a minimum of opposition and certainly a minimum of obstruction.  We are now changing all this and the House should note the change.  We are introducing a new system which will mean legal advice and assistance in the form of counsel and solicitors will be available to witnesses appearing before committees, particularly the Committee of Public Accounts.  This will make things very interesting and will considerably change the ground rules.  It will also change the speed with which an issue can be dealt with. It will be fair to everybody and ensure everybody has direct access to the ultimate in terms of advice.  However, there are drawbacks.  It will not be possible to have the speedy process which previously existed.  It could be said that counter-balancing this, the new system will be fairer. However, it will also be much slower.  Cognisance needs to be taken of this when changes of this nature are being made in relation to the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees of the House.</P>
      <P>We must accept that members of committees, or at least members of the Committee of Public Accounts, have absolute privilege.  Those appearing before a committee do not have such privilege. Under the current system it has not been possible to demand the appearance of particular individuals before a committee, something which will be possible under the new system.  It will also mean that the procedures, while very much taking on the same process as a court, will be slowed down considerably in the interests of fair play, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept some of the views expressed in recent times that the only issue the Committee of <Col N="1100" /> Public Accounts could or should investigate is that relating to appropriation accounts or public expenditure.  It has a wider brief and draws its strength from the Constitution which specifically mentions and provides for the committee.  I hope the legislative changes which are about to take place do not draw any of the teeth the Committee of Public Accounts or any other committee has. The Committee of Public Accounts has responsibility for appropriation accounts.  However, it rightly discusses issues where, following examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it is deemed the State suffered a loss or could potentially suffer a loss and can decide to take action based on the recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is as things should be to ensure there is no exposure on the part of the State.  In this context I do not accept that committees have acted <i>ultra vires.</i> They have acted within the ambit of their responsibilities and powers and have done so effectively.</P>
    <P>We live in a very litigation conscious society. At almost every turn somebody must resort to litigation of one kind or another.  This is one of the things modern society must face up to.  It is rightly said that in most cases litigation only occurs as a last resort.  However, one wonders in some compensation claims whether litigation is a last resort.  The suggestion has been made that the Houses of the Oireachtas could be injuncted in some manner.  We have heard this discussion on numerous occasions in recent years.  So far the Houses of the Oireachtas have been able to do their job alongside the courts without one impinging unnecessarily on the other.  This is the way things should be.  The Houses of Parliament are the Houses of the people where those elected by the general public come together to express their views in their own way and language and subject to their own thinking.  They may not always be politically correct or say what is legally correct and acceptable, but they are elected by the people and draw their strength and power from that source.</P>
    <P>In terms of effectiveness and efficacy our committees to date have done quite well.  The increase in the number of committees recognises the need for greater care, attention, advice, etc. We are nearing a position where it will be virtually impossible to become a member of a committee, speak at a meeting of a committee or act on behalf of it without needing ready access to legal advice.  That may be a good thing and a sign of the times, but it appears to be a recognition of a slowing down in the process or an intrusion from another quarter into an area of the Oireachtas, and I am not so sure that is a good thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this long and complex motion which I support.  A number of important issues have come to light which were discussed recently at the Committee of Public Accounts.  That committee issued an interim report last night and tonight we are dealing with a motion to move matters on to the next stage of the proceedings.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I wish to highlight a few points that the Comptroller and Auditor General should consider when he commences the investigation he has been requested to carry out on foot of this motion.  A number of these points were aired at the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service at the beginning of April. The Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. O'Connell, and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the committee at that time.  I wish to address a number of points made by those esteemed gentlemen on that day.  The Governor of the Central Bank perceived the Central Bank's role to be primarily a prudential one and we all accept that.  The Minister for Finance made it clear that is its role.  The public may have thought that it has a wider role, but it does not.</P>
      <P>During the course of the address of the Governor of the Central Bank to the committee, he mentioned the integrity of management.  I asked him to elaborate on what he meant about the integrity of management in banks in so far as it was a matter of concern to the Central Bank.  He replied that the integrity of management is essential and the Central Bank will not tolerate anything less.  He said that over the years it has requested the removal of management and refused to approve appointments.  He said there were several instances of such occurrences about which there were no problems or hesitations. When the Comptroller and Auditor General begins his investigation he should examine the role that the Central Bank considers it has regarding the integrity of the management in banks in so far as it concerns the Central Bank. If it is proved that financial institutions did not pay the tax they should have paid, there is a question mark over the integrity of management in the banks and the Central Bank, on foot of the admission of its Governor, will have to address that point at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners also appeared before the committee on 1 April. We were discussing the types of sample audits they carry out in companies throughout the country. Because the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners was before the committee, I asked him about the audits the Revenue Commissioners conduct into the banking system.  I asked him that question before there were any revelations in newspaper reports.  He said the Revenue Commissioners regularly send officials to conduct PAYE and VAT audits.  He would not go into detail on that, but said they have made recoveries. He said that in 1997 comprehensive audit programmes recovered £8.3 million and VAT audits <Col N="1102" /> in 46 cases resulted in the recovery of £717,000. I asked him if that figure related to the banks nationwide to which he replied &ldquo;yes, the banks&rdquo;. The Revenue Commissioners recovered £9 million last year as a result of audits they conducted into the main financial institutions.  The problem we had in the early 1990s has not gone away and, on the admission of the Revenue Commissioners, that is still the case.  That is on the record of a committee of the House.  The Comptroller and Auditor General should examine those specific points when he undertakes his investigation.  That problem was industry wide, was not specific to any bank and still exists.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed new independent financial regulatory authority.  Its terms of reference when set up must ensure it will have clear links with the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners, the banks and especially the customers.  I hope that whatever implementation committee is set up in the near future it will ensure that consumers will be represented on the board.  If deposit interest retention tax is payable as a result of this investigation, I will insist that the maximum penalties and interest due be applied in respect of those unpaid taxes.</P>
    <P>We must have regard to the economic climate in the late 1980s.  At that time there were difficulties in our economy.  The Government of the day introduced severe cuts in public expenditure to reduce its budget deficit and that caused difficulty politically and for our people.  It may transpire that one of the reasons those difficulties arose was because taxes due to the Exchequer were not paid.  If that was the case, that means that because those taxes were not paid we had a bigger budget deficit than we should have had, we had to borrow more and increase our national debt to make up for that shortfall and we have paid interest on that increase in our national debt ever since. There may be not only a legal but a moral obligation to ensure that any penalties and interest due are applied.</P>
    <P>If the Comptroller and Auditor General requires more powers to conduct the investigation he has been requested to carry out by this House, he should be given them and if his office requires additional resources, they should be provided. Above all, he will need the goodwill of the organisations with which he will be dealing.  I urge the banks and the Revenue Commissioners to co-operate fully with him and not to hide behind the issue of taxpayer confidentiality or any other issue which would prevent him doing the job this House and the public expect of him.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to the financial institutions which is a broad definition.  I am concerned that because it is broad it may make the job of the Comptroller and Auditor General more cumbersome and take him longer to carry out his investigation. If he finds that to be the case, I urge him to report back to the House to that effect rather than allow his investigation to continue over an indefinite period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> This motion, if agreed, will ensure that there will be more openness and transparency in how we conduct our affairs.  It will ensure that Revenue, the Central Bank and the financial institutions will be answerable to Dáil Éireann and, through it, to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this motion.  The motion tabled by the Labour Party was prompted by the revelations of the non-collection of DIRT by Allied Irish Banks recently.  It is now known, and was probably known for many years, that it was not the only bank involved in this activity.  This is the second big issue that has hit the banking sector in the past year.  In March the newspaper headlines referred to tax evasion through the use of offshore accounts and the overcharging and loading of customer's accounts.</P>
      <P>The Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, of which I have the honour of being chairman, immediately decided to initiate an urgent review to ascertain the precise regulatorysupervisory role of State and other institutions in relation to the commercial banking sector.  The practice in relation to the supervisory role of State institutions concerning the banking sector in our neighbouring countries of the UK, France, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria was examined by the select committee and a report was published in July 1998.</P>
      <P>Following our investigations and studies, which were carried out under narrow terms of reference, we came to the conclusion that a single regulatory independent authority should be established and given supervisory powers in regard to all commercial, friendly and voluntary bodies which handle funds or financial transactions on behalf of third parties or other institutions in Ireland.  During the hearing of evidence it became clear that the Central Bank's role in the financial services sector is that of a prudential regulator and its hands were seemingly tied as to whom it could pass information regarding tax evasion or any other irregularities that it came across.  It could pass on information only to the Garda, not the Revenue.  However, had the bank been able to do so, it would have allowed the Revenue to operate within its powers to carry out investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank did not have the staff or remit to carry out in-depth audits and other procedural work relating to consumer protection.  It must be acknowledged that the bank operated its remit to the highest standards of any western European country.  As Mr. McCreevy stated, the bank's prudential supervision has provided Ireland with a safe banking environment for the ordinary saver, but consumer protection was missing.  In addition, there is a necessity to assure the ordinary saver that he is not being ripped off by being overcharged with exorbitant interest or overloaded with bank charges.  The committee's view was that to do this an independent financial <Col N="1104" /> services authority must be established, and I welcome yesterday's Government decision to set up a financial services regulator.  I look forward to the details of this decision and I hope the authority includes consumer representatives as well as those from all other sectors of society.</P>
    <P>For a number of years commentators have questioned the need, use or existence of this House and its committees.  The manner of the investigations of my committee and others and the current actions of the Public Accounts Committee are evidence of how effective political involvement can be and this is important for democracy.  It is time for politicians to take back powers in line with the responsibility and blame that is loaded on them when State and semi-State bodies and independent institutions do not deliver that to which people are entitled.  The setting up of committees in recent years returned powers which should have been vested in those elected to run this country.</P>
    <P>The Public Accounts Committee is to be commended on the assiduous manner in which it approached the recent allegations.  Without this action we would be reading about allegations and counter allegations for weeks.  The decision to put the matter in the hands of the Comptroller and Auditor-General for examination is the proper course of action and I urge the Government to provide further powers and resources, if necessary, to carry out this examination.  There is a conflict of evidence between AIB and the Revenue Commissioners, and the Comptroller and Auditor General is the only person who will get to the bottom of it.</P>
    <P>Another question which must be asked is whether the Public Accounts Committee should usurp the most important function of the Revenue Commissioners, the care and management of the tax Acts.  Only the Revenue Commissioners should have the power to assess and collect taxes and it is up to the Oireachtas, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee to question the Revenue Commissioners on whether they have carried out their functions properly.  They have many powers to carry out their functions and examine whether taxes have been paid.  However, in 1992 the then Minister for Finance attempted to give them powers to trawl through accounts without having suspicions or being advised of any wrongdoing.  Public opinion at the time stopped the Minister from proceeding with that legislation.  Whether that opinion has changed will be seen another day.</P>
    <P>I commend the members of the Public Accounts Committee on the action they have taken and hope democracy in Ireland will be stronger in the long term following publication of its report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this many times amended motion which has the support of all parties in the House.  It represents a reasonable and commendable effort by the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I was a member for some <Col N="1105" /> years, to come to grips with the investigation that is required arising from the conflict of evidence between the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the chief executive and others in AIB on the payment of DIRT tax by the bank in 1991 for the period from 1986 up to that time.  It is obviously necessary to inquire what the position has been since and what the position is in other banks on the same question.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the initiative of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance in proposing to the Government and having adopted by it the establishment of a single financial regulatory body to cover all financial institutions and to regulate them for the first time from the point of view of the consumers' interest and the public interest. Heretofore the regulator was the Central Bank. In the more than nine years I spent in the Department of Industry and Commerce I was always unhappy with the nature and standards of regulation by the Central Bank.  Rightly or wrongly it saw its function almost entirely as prudential regulator of the banks.  The welfare and solvency of the banks seemed almost to be paramount in its mind.  The public or consumer welfare or interest never seemed to enter into the equation.</P>
      <P>I thought it was particularly inappropriate that the Central Bank regulated financial intermediaries. I hope the legislation to establish this new regulatory body will be introduced soon by the Government and passed speedily in this House. It is a pity that so often we wait for either a scandal or a catastrophe of some kind to happen before necessary legislation of this kind is decided upon and introduced.</P>
      <P>I was particularly glad to hear before I came into the House that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance have just announced the composition and terms of reference of the implementation group to advise the Government on the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector.  I welcome the terms of reference which seem to be appropriate and allembracing and I especially welcome the fact that the chairman of this important body will be my old friend and colleague, Mr. Michael McDowell SC.  I cannot imagine anyone in the country more suitable to carry out that function.  The group must report to the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance before the end of February 1999.  Four months is a reasonable period to undertake the amount of work involved and I hope the legislation will be produced soon after that report is forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is claimed within the AIB that in 1991 it may have had as many as 53,000 bogus non-resident deposit accounts.  If on investigation this proves to be the case, or anything remotely like it proves to be the case, it would be an appalling indictment of that bank and those who knowingly and deliberately took part in that form of tax evasion. That such activities seemed to be so prevalent some years ago, must in part be attributed to the abnormally high personal tax rates then, which made many people feel they had no option but to <Col N="1106" /> try to avail of a variety of devices to avoid penal tax.  Although my party, the Progressive Democrats, has been in Government for a total of only about four and a half years, it is no coincidence that during that time reductions occurred, amounting to 17 percentage points in personal tax of the 18 percentage points reduction we have seen in the last decade.</P>
    <P>The scandal of widespread bogus non-resident deposit accounts should be investigated in the context of the deplorable tax amnesty of 1993. How many of those with such bogus accounts availed of that amnesty?  How much money was involved?  How much tax was involved?  That amnesty was one of the more disgraceful features of public legislation.  It was forced through notwithstanding dire warnings from me and others that it would be extensively used to benefit those who were guilty of serious illegalities.  There is little doubt that our warnings were correct, not just in respect of bogus non-resident deposit accounts but in respect of considerably more serious criminal activities.  The amount of tax raised by that indefensible amnesty was so large, at 15 per cent and no interest, that the amount of tax owed must have run into billions of pounds.  I invite those who supported the amnesty at the time to tell us whether they still consider it justified.</P>
    <P>In recent days I have been considering a chronology of some of the events that arose following the failure of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, which was a wholly owned insurance subsidiary of the AIB, in 1985.  This chronology makes interesting reading, especially the parts relating to the early 1990s, when one considers what the AIB was allegedly doing at that time in respect of its tax liabilities and the liabilities of some of its depositors.  No company is more beholden to the State than the AIB.  In 1985 it was bailed out on generous terms by the intervention of the then Government after its insurance subsidiary failed.  We were told this happened primarily as a prudential banking matter because the failure of a bank would be catastrophic. We had already experienced the failure of two insurance companies which were not bailed out by the State.  In hindsight, it is a matter of great regret that when the initial bailing out took place in 1985 the Government did not insist on obtaining shares in the AIB to the value of the amount of public money that was put in.  If it had, those shares would now be easily worth in excess of £1 billion.</P>
    <P>When the question of a second tranche of assistance to finance the ICI run-off deficit arose in 1989 and subsequently, the AIB initially refused to make any contribution towards this second set of funding in spite of my anxiety as Minister for Industry and Commerce that it would fund it in full.  I had a number of meetings over a period of three years with the then chairman and chief executive of the bank.  Over those years the AIB's initial position was not to offer anything.  It subsequently made an offer which I <Col N="1107" /> described at the time as derisory and ultimately in 1992 it made an offer which I was not prepared to accept.  Some weeks after I resigned from Government early in November 1992 that offer was accepted.  As I understand the position, the annual instalments payable under that arrangement are deductible for tax purposes by the bank. I find this ironic.</P>
    <P>My anxiety to have the AIB meet the full cost of the collapse of the ICI was mirrored in my finding it incongruous that I should issue it with a life assurance licence.  My reluctance to do so was met by the issue of High Court proceedings against me.  I still feel uncomfortable that I was forced to issue an insurance licence to a group whose previous insurance company had failed and which had failed to meet the full liabilities of that company.  Perhaps in my innocence I did not realise fully at the time that there was one law for the banks.</P>

      <P>It is my party's view that the House has done a good day's work.  Within 24 hours of the publication of the interim report of the Committee of Public Accounts the first of its three requests has been dealt with.  I expect the Government to act speedily on the additional matters to be dealt with, as promised.  The urgency remains.  The recent revelations have shocked and outraged the public.  They confirmed the deeply held suspicion that there is one law for one section of society and another for the rest.</P>
      <P>I read in Mr. Vincent Browne's column today the remarks of Mr. Mulcahy of the AIB when he appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts last week that those involved in holding non-resident accounts were grannies and that the amount of DIRT outstanding might be as low as £500,000.  Mr. Browne correctly asks, as Deputy Rabbitte did last week, that if the sum involved is as low as £500,000, how does this square with Mr. Mulcahy's assertion that the problem cannot be solved without causing huge waves in the economy?  Mr. Mulcahy cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>Mr. Mulcahy's remarks tell another story.  To use his term, grannies are not inclined to be well read in tax law.  In most cases, if they have money in bogus non-resident accounts, it is likely they have been advised to do so, possibly by local bank managers acting under directions from more senior personnel in regional and head offices and, more than likely, acting under pressure from those same senior officers.  This process cannot be about the little people who have been caught up in this affair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existence of bogus non-resident accounts says much about society's attitude to taxation, it wants much but wants to pay little.  In the 1980s <Col N="1108" /> it was a society of high taxation for some but they were left in that position by the irresponsible spending policies adopted by the Fianna Fáil Government in the late 1970s.</P>

      <P>The real issue is that an organisation such as the AIB which received a massive sum from the State actively colluded in defrauding the State in the years immediately afterwards, biting the hand that fed it.</P>
      <P>It is the task of the Committee of Public Accounts to find answers to these questions but we need more than answers.  We need action.  I have been pleased with the affirmation from all sides of the House that we will not rest until what is owed to the State is paid and until those found guilty of the crime of tax evasion are punished in accordance with the law.  There should be no attempt to scapegoat the little people, whether they be grannies or the counter staff in banks who acted under pressure and on orders.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have been able to play a constructive role in this week's events.  I thank my fellow Whips and the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts for their assistance in improving the motion before the House.  The broadness of the motion is at the request of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

      <P>The Irish Trade Union Congress in a submission to the Commission on Banking and Credit in 1936 said:</P>
      <P>The present relation of the State to the banks is a most ignominious one for the State and the inevitable control which banks exercise on the mind of the Minister for Finance is not a healthy one for the State and hence for the people as a whole.</P>
      <P>One can see how little things have changed.</P>
      <P>The socially reckless attitude adopted by Irish banks in the late 1980s, which has been exposed in the case of AIB, should give cause for thought. To whom are the banks answerable?  When AIB drove its business towards insolvency in the early 1980s, through ill advised adventures with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, the ordinary, law abiding taxpayers had to foot the bill to bail it out.  Those were straitened times and some demands on the Exchequer were not met because of the cost of sorting out the AIB/ICI debacle.  In 1987, AIB was hurting the old, the sick and the handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the State expected a show of appreciation for bailing out the bankers in 1985, it was to be disappointed.  AIB almost immediately involved itself in a tax scam, the dimensions of which are <Col N="1109" /> only now coming to light.  It is essential that the Committee of Public Accounts be unambiguously empowered by Dáil Éireann to pursue this matter as far as necessary.  We must be assured the committee will act within its powers right to the end of this investigative process.  We must also be assured that the committee is enabled to use its powers to compel the attendance of witnesses.</P>
    <P>The DIRT fraud of the late 1980s was an inevitable result of lax controls in legislation.  The amount of tax lost to the Exchequer could be £1 billion or higher.  There is a danger that the investigation now under way will not deal with the political aspects of the case which are not matters for the Committee of Public Accounts but which will be debated when the report of the investigation is laid before the House.</P>
    <P>A number of questions must be addressed if the public is not to lose even more confidence in the relationship between Government and business. The total loss of revenue to the Exchequer is higher than £1 million and could be as high as £2 billion.  This is taking into account the entire banking sector and includes not only the DIRT which was underpaid for five or more years but also the unpaid taxes on the moneys on deposit, including interest and penalties.  Responsibility for the non-payment of DIRT in this case lies with the account holders and the Government rather than with the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank or even AIB.</P>
    <P>It was Government which gave the wink to the banks and to unscrupulous account holders in its handling of the issue after the 1983 budget.  Arguably, the Governments of the day were accomplices in this fraud against the State in the signals being given both to the banks and to those who had money put away.  Government has a responsibility to prevent fraud and abuse, not just to establish investigations and tribunals after the event.</P>
    <P>This preventable fraud was allowed to grow out of control at a time when ordinary law abiding taxpayers were being squeezed for all they were worth.  The system of declarations in the case of non-resident accounts, which was established by the Government in 1986, could be interpreted as a nod and a wink in the direction of tax evaders. The comprehensive political investigation which must follow the work of the Committee of Public Accounts must look at the role of the Department of Finance and of members of the Governments of the day in facilitating the culture of tax evasion in which AIB so enthusiastically participated.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that branch staff could, in a few cases, encourage customers to disregard the law by claiming to hold an account as a non-resident one.  However, the scale on which it was done can leave little room for doubt that management at every level knew about the misuse of the exemption from DIRT which applied to non-resident accounts.</P>
    <P>The directors must account for their role.  It must be asked whether branches were under such <Col N="1110" /> pressure to perform, as was the case in the NIB scandal, that officials encouraged customers to manage their financial affairs in a way that they would otherwise not have done.  The bank's system of control appears to have been grossly inadequate in preventing such encouragement.  It is not relevant to the scandalous abuse of its position in society by AIB that other banks were also breaking the same rules.</P>
    <P>The estimate of £1 million outstanding DIRT liability by AIB might be seriously unreliable.  In the absence of independent calculations the real figure may well be higher.  It is necessary to establish how many accounts were recategorised in 1991 by AIB as a result of the review of non-resident accounts either because a declaration was not in place or because the residential status of the account holder was in doubt.  It is necessary to confirm whether, even then, the bank confirmed the <i>bona fides</i> of non-residents by having the declarations countersigned by a member of management.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to establish whether the Revenue Commissioners established any system of audit in relation to the post 1991 regime or whether it was still left to individual banks, driven by the pursuit of profit to make the greatest possible return to their shareholders, to implement. We must establish whether April 1988 was the earliest date on which the Revenue Commissioners used their 1986 powers to check non-resident accounts.  We must also establish the reason for the two year delay.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to establish how, apart from being told by AIB, the bank's auditors verified that there was no further liability to DIRT in 1991.  While it is accepted that AIB addressed the difficulties in the system, it must be established whether the group chief executive believes these were fully solved.  Finally, it must be established that if AIB did not mislead the Revenue Commissioners on the extent of the problem, as has been claimed, whether this was simply because AIB did not take the trouble to quantify its extent.</P>
    <P>The need to prevent the outflow of funds from the economy is not a mitigating factor for the bank or for the Government.  Mr. Bulmer Hobson, another commentator on the work of the 1936 banking commission, said:</P>
    <P>The bankers and other financial interests are, of course, very pleased to have the arranging of their profitable business the way they want it, without having to face any critical or informed analysis of how their actions affect the community as a whole.  They appear to think that, as long as the trade in money is prospering, everything was all right for everybody else.</P>
    <P>That situation cannot be permitted in the 1990s. It is a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts to use its powers to ensure that it will not obtain.  I support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on behalf of my party and not in my capacity as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Although the committee has laid its first interim report before the Dáil &mdash; it will take some time for the Comptroller and Auditor General to complete the next stage of the exercise &mdash; the committee is still seized of the substantive issue.  Therefore, without prejudice to whatever conclusions might ultimately be reached, I will make a few points about the political implications of what has come into the public domain.</P>
      <P>The timely motion before the House is entirely symmetrical with the direction of the interim report.  Primarily it is now a matter for Government to dictate the pace of the legislative changes that are urgently needed.  Given the manner in which the primacy of politics has been asserted, mainly through the expeditious work of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is important that there is no foot dragging in enacting the necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>This issue goes to the heart of politics.  Does the same law apply to all taxpayers and is it applied evenhandedly?  That question is fundamental to the nature of our democracy and to the quality of our public administration.  According to the evidence of the chief executive of Allied Irish Banks, the phenomenon of bogus non-resident accounts is &ldquo;industry wide&rdquo;.  In other words, what was revealed earlier this year concerning the National Irish Bank, which has a 3 per cent market share, was merely the tip of the iceberg.  What is now in the public domain must be judged against the publicly dismissive remarks of the Minister for Finance.  At the opening of the new Tallaght regional tax office for the Revenue Commissioners immediately in the wake of the NIB revelations, the Minister poured scorn on the notion of widespread tax evasion then or now. The Minister has publicly changed his tune dramatically, but there can be little doubt that his earlier remarks are more indicative of the culture of the 1980s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So endemic was that culture then that, according to the Allied Irish Banks chief executive, it looked at one stage &ldquo;as if the entire country was going offshore.&rdquo; Many tax compliant citizens take offence at that remark.  Retired businesspeople have written to me in recent days to say that although they did resent the imposition of DIRT on their savings, which had already been exposed to tax, the question of breaking the law never crossed their minds.  The hundreds of thousands of people whose tax was deducted at source from their pay packets feel similarly.  Therefore, when Mr. Mulcahy says that it looked as if the entire country was going offshore, it should be remembered that tens of thousands of our people were going offshore at that time to earn a living. They were driven out by high personal taxes because the tax base was so narrow due to a great many people evading taxes or because they could not live on welfare because only a small base of tax compliant citizens was contributing to the <Col N="1112" /> upkeep of our social services.  I am not saying that we do not have to weigh the evidence submitted by Mr. Mulcahy carefully, but if the scale of evasion was as large as he says &mdash; that if it was tackled unilaterally by a single bank it would have threatened that bank's existence &mdash; then it puts charges of tax evasion from trade union sources in perspective.</P>
    <P>According to the banks the scale of evasion was far greater than trade unionists suspected. Members will recall the huge tax protest marches in Dublin and other cities and towns during the late 1970s and early 1980s.  People were not protesting against paying their taxes; they were protesting against paying taxes that were too high due, they believed, to the narrowness of the tax base because others were not paying their fair share.  It now looks as if the most extreme trade union computation was an underestimate.</P>
    <P>A further context should be considered.  During these same years a range of perfectly legal instruments was available to people with money to avoid tax.  An entire tax avoidance industry grew up at that time, and its purpose was to advise people with money and to identify loopholes in the tax code.  All of this happened in a culture that has only belatedly been introduced to a culture of compliance.  For a generation after the introduction of income tax it seems that nobody paid the slightest attention to it unless it was deducted at source from their wages.  For a further generation most farmers, for example, did not consider themselves to be in the tax net at all and felt it did not apply to them.  A great many other people with wealth were taught by the tax avoidance industry how to avoid paying their fair share.</P>
    <P>We now learn that in addition to all of that, the phenomenon of bogus non-resident accounts was going on at the scale alleged by the chief executive of AIB.  We can therefore see the importance of tonight's motion and of the inquiry initiated by the Committee of Public Accounts.  Even if it is true that the culture has gradually changed, and I am persuaded that it has, it is still of the highest importance that the facts of this controversy are established.  I am also persuaded that the Revenue Commissioners have significantly improved tax collection systems and have closed many loopholes from recent years.  However, they too must co-operate fully with the Comptroller and Auditor General in establishing the facts surrounding what happened from 1986 to 1991. There is no plausible reason why this cannot be done without breaching the confidentiality imperative that must apply to tax compliant citizens. I hope the Revenue Commissioners will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I watched Deputy O'Malley's contribution on my monitor and agreed with a great deal of what he said.  It is important that we put this in the context of the ICI debacle.  This is the bank that was bailed out; this is the gratitude demonstrated for being rescued from its own commercial incompetence in 1985.  Not satisfied with having <Col N="1113" /> railroaded the State into a very imprudent deal at that time &mdash; I agree with what Deputy O'Malley said about that &mdash; it was especially regrettable that no shares were taken in the bank at that time.  That was an error, though hindsight is 20/20 vision.</P>
    <P>Something that Deputy O'Malley did not mention, however, was that a further £32 million was paid to AIB in 1992.  I presume that came under Deputy O'Malley's stewardship; he was certainly in Government then.  I am curious as to why we had to come up with another tranche of £32 million in direct connection to the ICI debacle of the time.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, will deal with that when he replies.</P>
    <P>I also heard the first admission of naiveté from Deputy O'Malley since entering the House.  He said that he did not know that there was one law for the poor and one for the banks at that time, hence he sanctioned a new licence for a life assurance company for AIB in the immediate wake of the 1985 debacle, which explained why the life assurance licence was given at that time.  I would have liked the House to allow Deputy O'Malley some more time to elaborate on how it was that AIB got that licence at the time and the circumstances that provoked it.</P>
    <P>A financial regulator has been mentioned. Deputy Quinn's view on this would not find majority acceptance in this House, and I am not sure that the Cabinet decision yesterday will assist other Members in making their minds up. Yesterday's decision betrays a Cabinet divided on which way to go.  Do we avail of the expertise built up over many years in the Central Bank or do we set up a unitary financial regulator for all the financial services which is free of the culture of the Central Bank?  It seems that the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste are irreconcilably opposed on this issue.  That is usually what gives birth to an implementation group, which one only gets when the decision was badly thought out in the first place.  The thinking will now apparently be done after a decision has been made.</P>

I do not know whether this signals kiss and make up time but I welcome that decision.</P>
      <P>I agree that it has been a good week for this House in the sense that the primacy of politics has been asserted and the work of the Committee of Public Accounts has been exemplary, diligent, assiduous and speedy.  The laying of the report before the House last night is the right approach and the Comptroller and Auditor General should be enabled by legislation, as quickly as possible, to get on with doing the next phase of the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing time with me.  I intend to be brief.  I am not speaking on behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member, but as an individual Member of the House.  I want to pay tribute to the staff of the Committee of Public Accounts who worked diligently and long into the night over the past two weeks.  Their work is very much appreciated by the members of the committee.</P>
      <P>I welcome the motion put down by the Labour Party.  I pay tribute to the Whips for securing allparty agreement on the motion and accepting the advice of the committee in relation to changes to it.</P>
      <P>In a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts I asked Mr. Mulcahy if he would agree that both the banks and &ldquo;John Citizen&rdquo; were breaking the law, and he admitted that was the case.  If any other individual in the State made a statement of that kind they would probably be arrested and charged with the serious offence of defrauding the State of millions of pounds.  Is there one law for the PAYE sector and one for the financial institutions?  I hope in its deliberations the Committee of Public Accounts will answer that question.</P>
      <P>I want to put some important questions to the Minister.  I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners designed and redesigned a statutory document known as Form F, the purpose of which was to establish the basic information in relation to these deposits.  I am equally advised that at no stage, certainly up to 1991, did staff at a senior level in the Revenue Commissioners instruct the inspectorate to carry out an investigation in relation to these forms.  That is where the basic fault lies.  It was due to the negligence of senior staff in the Revenue Commissioners that this problem was created.  We must establish whether instructions were given to the inspectorate to carry out inspections of Form F not only in relation to AIB but all the financial institutions where DIRT was due to be collected.</P>
      <P>There is a reciprocal arrangement between the tax authorities in the United Kingdom and the Revenue Commissioners here in relation to exchange of information on this subject.  The British authorities use Form C8 and CB to supply the Revenue Commissioners here with that information. I am told on good authority that while the British co-operate fully and supply information to the Revenue Commissioners, the Revenue Commissioners do not supply information to the same degree to the UK tax authorities. That is a major flaw in the system because if there is not co-operation between the UK and the Revenue Commissioners, obviously there cannot be co-ordination of activity to deal with not only the avoidance of DIRT but also other problems like money laundering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bank auditors are the professionals in the banking system who certify that the financial activities of banks are correct.  If these skilled and professional people certified that the accounts of AIB and other financial institutions were correct, <Col N="1115" /> did they know that those financial institutions of the State were ripping off the PAYE sector?</P>
    <P>I congratulate my colleagues in the Labour Party for putting down the motion.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, it will give the Committee of Public Accounts real teeth to deal with these problems in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following last evening's debate and discussions held with Opposition parties to date, I want to firmly state the Government's position. The Government is fully conscious of, and shares, the public concerns about the recent revelations in regard to the use of bogus non-resident accounts for the purpose of evading DIRT.  The Government has always made clear its intolerance of tax evasion and, as I said in the course of my contribution on 8 October on this issue, the Minister for Finance has already asked the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to examine what new powers are needed for Revenue in tackling tax evasion.  The Government has already announced that it is fully committed to assisting the Committee of Public Accounts to progress its ongoing investigations as rapidly as possible and to reach early conclusions.</P>
      <P>The Government agreed with the motion put down by the Labour Party which has now been updated to take account of the committee's interim report.  I fully agree with paragraph (b) of the motion which congratulates the Committee of Public Accounts on the rapid progress it has already made in investigating this matter.  It is essential that, as far as is practicable, all available facts are brought into the public domain.  The revenues of the State are, ultimately, the resources of all the citizens of the State.  We in this House are the custodians of those resources and the citizens rely on us to ensure fairness, propriety, efficiency and effectiveness in their administration. To put it simply, the public have a right to know.  Our duty as their representatives in this matter is to ensure that the citizens and taxpayers of this State have all pertinent information made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While bringing the facts to light is a necessary duty of this House, it is not in itself sufficient. Paragraph (d) of the motion before the House states that the committee should be facilitated in every way possible to bring its investigation to a rapid conclusion.  The Government supports this view.  Speed is of the essence.  We must strive to ensure essential information is brought out quickly.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  If errors or wrongdoing against the public interest have taken place, the public must be made aware of the essential facts as soon as possible.  Equally, if allegations against individuals or organisations are incorrect, by intent or inadvertently, we in the House owe it to those individuals or organisations to produce the relevant facts in the shortest time possible.  The Government is doing everything <Col N="1116" /> possible to advance the process of investigating this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government accepts the motion subject to a detailed and careful examination of all the legal implications of the change in the terms of reference proposed in paragraph (c).  In the time available it has not been possible to give as full a consideration to all the complex legal questions which arise as would be desirable.  The Government accepts that the Committee of Public Accounts should have the powers referred to in paragraph (c) but reserves the right to come back to Dáil Éireann should more considered legal advice indicate it would be appropriate to take further or other steps to attain the objective on which we are all agreed.</P>
    <P>This is not only correct procedure: obtaining the best available legal advice will help to avoid delays in the process in the future which might result if we stumble into a constitutional or statutory blind alley.  Let us make no mistake about this.  In proceeding with the examination of the facts we are advancing into territory where there are competing rights, obligations and interests which will, rightly, be defended.</P>
    <P>The route proposed in the interim report of the Committee of Public Accounts is innovative in terms of parliamentary procedure as well as in law.  We have few precedents to guide us.  Where such precedents exist they illustrate the utmost importance of ensuring that statutory provisions and operational matters are correct in law.  In light of the known and potential pitfalls in this area, the Government is determined to ensure that, as far as possible, the procedures adopted are proper, appropriate and correct.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the legal advice the Minister for Finance will bring to Government at the earliest possible opportunity, specific proposals to give effect where necessary in legislation, to the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts on this matter.  Where the work of the committee demands enhanced statutory authority, which Dáil Éireann considers necessary and which satisfies the constitutional and legal obligations to which I referred earlier, this demand will be met without delay.  The Department of Finance has been directed to formulate proposals which can be examined by the Government with a view to bringing a Bill before the House in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>In supporting the need to provide the &ldquo;assistance which Dáil Éireann considers may be necessary to enable it to complete its investigations as soon as possible&rdquo;, as stated in paragraph (f) of the motion, the Government is concerned that the investigative process must prioritise the matters to be addressed.  It is necessary to ensure that the Dáil and committees acting for the Dáil, optimise the time available to bring the core facts to light.  It is essential that the sequence of the investigation should concentrate, in the first instance, on those aspects which are already in the public domain.  If possible, Members should try to resolve conflicts of evidence or interpretation <Col N="1117" /> already presented before the Committee of Public Accounts which have given rise to public controversy.  It is almost self-evident that a satisfactory resolution of differences of fact and opinion already submitted to the committee would greatly facilitate the investigation of this issue's wider implications.</P>
    <P>I join the other Members who have congratulated the Committee of Public Accounts on the rapid progress it has made in its investigation of these serious allegations.  It is our duty to ensure these matters are fully investigated as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised a specific point.  I do not have the details of the case but in the days ahead we will all want to know the facts surrounding the £32 million and how it came to be in 1992.  We are all anxious to know the reasons but I do not have the information in front of me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to two points raised by Deputy Rabbitte.  He asked why in 1985 we did not get shares in AIB.  At the time I argued unsuccessfully that we should have the option to buy shares at their floor price which at that time was 150p and that that option should have been open for a period of between three and four years.  I was told it was a ridiculously idealistic socialist response, typical of myself and was outvoted. The other point refers to what can be done in relation to the new financial regulatory body. There are some restrictions in the EU banking directives that would prevent the Central Bank from carrying on some of the supervisory functions. There is a need for some independence but whether that constitutes a new institution or can be accommodated within the Central Bank is the issue that should be looked at.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, I will state a fact which is well known. My eldest brother, Lochlann, has been a member of the board of AIB since May 1995 and has been its chairperson since January 1997.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I am pleased we have reached all party agreement on this motion. The party, for its part, has never been tied to any form of wording.  However, we believed the House needed to take action and more importantly, as stated by numerous speakers, to be seen to take action.  It was in this context we moved our motion in Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleagues, Deputies McDowell and Broughan made clear, the public regard this issue as a cardinal test of the House's determination and ability to root out malpractices in our society. I have been receiving that message at the doors and in the shopping centres in Cork during the past ten days.  As a result of wide-ranging revelations in recent years, those people who insist on the highest possible standards in public business and commercial life are no longer subject to the accusations of begrudgery and sabotage that were levelled at them in the past.  It is ironic that Mr. Charles Haughey, former Taoiseach, stood up and accused my colleague, Barry Desmond, of <Col N="1118" /> national sabotage in relation to the beef scandal. There is now a tribunal of inquiry into the activities of former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, and Barry Desmond is now usefully and gainfully occupied as an auditor in the Court of Auditors of the European Union.  Such is the passage of history.</P>
    <P>When my party proposed the Ethics in Public Office legislation and the reform of our electoral law, as it pertains to the financial support of politics and politicians, there was widespread opposition and suspicion in the House.  Happily that climate has changed.</P>
    <P>The task before the Committee of Public Accounts is an extremely difficult one.  Tonight's motion deals only with the first of three strands relating to the new powers the committee needs. The motion confers on the committee a specific mandate to make its investigation and removes any suspicion that it may have strayed beyond its existing terms of reference.  This is a very necessary exercise.</P>
    <P>The second and third strands are changes to the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts and amendments to the compellability of witnesses Act, 1997.  These measures must be proceeded with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business this morning Deputy Noonan, on behalf of Fine Gael, suggested these measures should be in place before Christmas. Action is required much more urgently.  My party has already transmitted to the Taoiseach a draft Bill which addresses the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Let us be clear as to what the public wants at the end of the process.  I have heard it repeatedly in the past ten to 15 days in Cork and elsewhere.  Today a secondary school teacher, outside Wilton shopping centre, said the public wants any arrears of DIRT tax liable to the State to be paid to the State with accompanying penalties.  If evidence emerges that any financial institution orchestrated DIRT evasion, those responsible should have the full rigours of the law brought down on them.  By that I do not mean the ordinary bank official or even a manager acting under instructions, but those responsible for the instructions.  I do not for one moment accept the analysis proffered by AIB to the committee that malpractice may be put down to the operations of rogue bank managers.  Incidentally, I support everything Deputy Bell said about the work of the internal auditors of the banks and the need to fully examine their investigations.</P>
    <P>There must be no scapegoating of junior staff by senior management.  Senior management is corporately responsible for the actions of its employees and in the case of AIB, they are very handsomely paid to carry that responsibility.</P>
    <P>AIB has stated it is currently re-examining its DIRT liability for the period.  I suggest &mdash; I hope the media pick this up &mdash; that all other banks, one of which was named in the press over the weekend, should do the same in the full knowledge that the State will expect full payment of any outstanding amounts.  The manner of such <Col N="1119" /> payment is not particularly important.  It could, for example, involve direct payments by each institution once the amount in question has been established, a direct levy on the banking sector or some form of windfall tax on profits declared, notwithstanding the laws surrounding retrospection. Either way, once we have established what the arrears of tax due to the State are, they must be paid without equivocation and they must be seen to be paid.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners also have some clear questions to answer.  While they have been determined not to use the word &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo;, it is clear that in effect one existed.  From what I have read of the reports of the committee and the evidence given by various individuals, particularly the chairman, it appears that if AIB was not pursued for arrears covering the period in which there was a clear legal obligation to collect DIRT, it was given to understand that that was acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners.  That must be very substantially clarified and we must look at the basis on which that decision was made.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has stated categorically that he is not entitled to inquire into individual tax cases.  Of course, we all accept that he is not, but there is emerging evidence, acknowledged both in my party's original motion and the motion before the House, that this was an industry-wide problem.  Therefore, I see no reason the Minister should not discuss this issue with the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners.  Such a discussion should centre around the adequacy of the existing powers available to the Revenue. I know from personal experience in 1995 that there is considerable resistance to new measures brought in to ensure tax compliance, but the Rubicon river must be crossed this time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stated last night that his Department and the Revenue Commissioners are engaged in a review of anti-tax evasion measures.  However, I would have more confidence in the review coming to a successful conclusion if the Minister for Finance stopped playing down the significance of what has been discovered so far.  I was appalled to hear him say on the radio on Sunday morning that tax evasion was like sin &mdash; one could legislate against it but one could not stop it.  The tone and the way in which he evinced that opinion was one of utter complacency in the light of revelations of tax evasion on the massive scale of £100 million.  The Minister of State must convey to the Minister for Finance &mdash; not the Department &mdash; that his attitude to tax evasion is far too tolerant.</P>

      <Col N="1120" /> This country has yet to have a serious civil tax offence prosecution pursued to the point where someone ends up in jail.  Prior to the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, no one went to jail for civil tax evasion.  The success of the CAB in securing prosecutions and pursuing people who were evading tax as a consequence of criminal activities has won widespread acceptance among the public.  However, we must also address this issue on the civil side.  We need a high profile Lester Piggott type case in which someone is sent to jail, sooner rather than later.  Otherwise, the compliant tax paying citizen will revolt and we will create a cynical attitude to tax paying at a time when we can least afford it.</P>
    <P>People can rightly ask what I did in the two and a half years I was Minister.  I tried to tidy up the procedures in relation to the relationship between the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and the DPP's office.  However, there has been a failure so far to advance cases to a successful conclusion.  The courts must answer for themselves in this regard because one case of substantial tax evasion in Galway, which is on the public record, resulted in the judge, who is obviously independent, not giving a custodial sentence when such a sentence was, in my view, required by the scale of the offence.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister of State that the Revenue Commissioners must be given direct responsibility and independence to initiate prosecutions. They have their own civil legal section and solicitors but, notwithstanding the streamlining of the cases we have been able to put together for them, they have not had a satisfactory relationship, judging from the results from the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a successful Lester Piggott style case &mdash; to use a description with which everyone is familiar &mdash; we need to give autonomy of operation to the Revenue Commissioners. They must have the ability to pursue cases independently and to prosecute where they believe tax evasion has occurred on a scale which would warrant such a prosecution.</P>
    <P>The culture of settling with individuals where there has been blatant abuse following all sorts of last chances must also be changed.  These are policy matters for the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and should be initiated without delay.</P>
    <P>There has been widespread anger and disgust at the revelations that up to £100 million &mdash; although I know AIB disputes the figure &mdash; was not paid in DIRT tax and that the Revenue Commissioners acquiesced in some way to a much lower payment.  There is a demand now for the Comptroller and Auditor General to be given the powers, statutory and otherwise, to establish the position and to produce a report based on the facts as they occurred, not just in that bank but in all financial institutions irrespective of the nature of their ownership.  When those facts become known to us we must ensure that tax due from those institutions, or on behalf of their clients, is <Col N="1121" /> paid in full in a manner to be agreed by this House with the relevant institutions.  Anything less than that will not meet the manifest public demand and this House will be seen to have failed in its duty &mdash; after a good week in which we moved very quickly &mdash; if we do not do that very quickly.  I call upon the Government to look at the measures we have proposed and to ensure they are implemented as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Government bungling has endangered the master plan for the development of Dublin's dockland area.  It has also jeopardised the success of measures for which we legislated this year to promote both urban and rural renewal schemes.  The Dublin docklands development plan was announced with great fanfare by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in December of last year.</P>
      <P>It was not until the Committee Stage debate on the urban renewal Bill last June that the Government admitted it had not covered all the necessary angles either for the Dublin docklands plan or the urban and rural renewal schemes.  The Government admitted that the EU Commission would not accept certain aspects of the schemes and it amended those aspects accordingly.  It now appears the Government did not get it right even then, and that there are still some aspects of the schemes about which the EU Commission has reservations.</P>
      <P>There are only two possible explanations for this &mdash; either the Government failed to understand what the Commission originally said or it has failed to persuade the Commission of the need for and value of these schemes.  Whichever way the Government bungled it, the result is that a cloud of uncertainty hangs over the docklands plan and over the urban and rural renewal schemes which could deal with unemployment blackspots outside Objective One areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A measure of the problem can be found in the chairman's statement in the 1997 annual report and accounts of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  He said one of the major challenges which has emerged since the formation of the authority arises from changes introduced in the last budget and that the authority would have to find creative ways of ensuring that the private investment required for sustainable regeneration of docklands meets the levels envisaged in the <Col N="1122" /> master plan.  In other words, there were already problems with the plan and they have now been exacerbated by further Government bungling.</P>
    <P>The private sector is being relied on to produce investments of £400 million in the docklands over the next 15 years.  To the extent that it is not forthcoming, public investment of £1.2 billion over the same period will also be reduced.  Last June, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, tabled an amendment to insert a new section into the urban renewal Bill.  That section was inserted to get the approval of the Commission, but it was not obtained.  It now appears the difficulties were more wide-ranging than was admitted at the time. Will the Minister tell us what action is being taken?  When will the Government fully understand the problem and when will the matter be resolved so these schemes can come into operation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin docklands development gives an unparalleled opportunity for the development of this area in Dublin.  Credit must be given to everyone involved in the project.  In my constituency, I was particularly struck by the work of the community liaison committee and the focus on creating local employment, training and education opportunities in an area which has seen more than 30 per cent unemployment and dropout rates of 60 per cent of children under 16 years from schools.</P>
      <P>The master plan for the Dublin docklands development area is a strategy for the social, economic and physical rejuvenation of the docklands area and it has been developed in consultation and partnership with a wide range of interests, including local residents, community groups, business interests, environmental groups and statutory bodies.  It would be a disaster for the Dublin area if funding for this development was under threat.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Government and the Minister to spell out what exactly has happened which has led to this extraordinary situation.  The uncertainty about current funding within the Commission could be very damaging to this ambitious project which means so much for Dublin, particularly for those living in the area.  I gave the statistics on unemployment and school dropout in the local area.  I support what my colleague, Deputy Dukes, said and ask the Government to outline what steps it is taking to secure funding for this scheme and to outline the sequence which has led to this impasse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will agree that certain operating assumptions have been made in relation to the time extension, particularly for the Custom House docks development.  Perhaps these assumptions may be questioned given what we are hearing from the Commission.  Does this decision have implications for future generations of urban renewal schemes in the Dublin area?  Is there a need for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, as it is allowed under the legislation, to put in some new requests for urban <Col N="1123" /> renewal schemes which perhaps do not need funding at EU level?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters are very similar, although mine was broader than the specific issue of funding for the docklands authority raised by Deputy Dukes and Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of reports in some national newspapers today to the effect that the European Commission is blocking proposals made by his Department to implement the urban and rural renewal schemes approved by the House earlier this year.  This report is the latest in series of reports from Brussels which suggest that the Commission is becoming increasingly unsympathetic to Irish efforts to direct aid to the poorest parts of our country.</P>
      <P>The truth of the matter is that the reluctance of the Commission to give the green light to these proposals is just the thin end of the wedge.  What is happening is little short of a sea change in our relations with the Commission and other member states of the European Union.  For 25 years Ireland has been a net beneficiary of EU aid.  We have benefited hugely from direct transfers financed by the taxpayers of Germany, the Netherlands and other countries, latterly Sweden and Austria.  These transfers have come by way of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, the SF and the CAP.  It is commonly accepted that these transfers have played an important part in the economic success we are now enjoying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, it is important that we appreciate and accept that the circumstances have now changed quite dramatically.  Our income <i>per capita</i> is now very close to Union average.  The Union is looking to enlarge to the east and to include countries which are by any objective criteria a good deal poorer than Ireland. Even more important perhaps is the change in circumstances in some countries which have long since provided the bulk of the Union's budget. Germany now has 4 million people unemployed and there is still a great deal of work to be done in integrating the eastern part of Germany into the Federal Republic.  In those circumstances, it is genuinely very difficult for German politicians to justify the special treatment Ireland has enjoyed for so long.  We have been too slow to recognise these new realities.  The day of the <Col N="1124" /> handout is effectively gone.  It is time to put away the begging bowl and to start to pull our weight.</P>
    <P>This requires a fundamental change in our approach to the European Union.  If we continue with a strategy designed to extract every last ecu from the German taxpayer we will very quickly lose much of the sympathy and support which has sustained us for many years.  We are in the EU for the long-term and it is time we started to think long-term.  If we use up all our credits in the short-term, we may find we have few friends left when, and if, real problems arise.  I suspect that is what is happening as things stand.</P>
    <P>In relation to the subject matter of this debate, I ask the Minister to share some information with us.  When was the extension to the Custom House docks scheme put to the Commission and what response has been received?  The Minister told the House last June that the Commission was only concerned with ongoing aid, such as rent and rates relief.  In fact, the House amended the Finance Act to cater for this apparent concern on the part of Commissioner Van Miert.  Will he confirm that that is the concern of the Commission and that it is happy to approve the capital allowance incentives set out in each of the urban and rural renewal schemes?</P>
    <P>As an aside, will the Minister also let us know how things stand in relation to the regional airport projects and other applications still pending? The message should go out from this House that we are all most unhappy at the delay in dealing with these applications.  I know the docklands authority in Dublin is working on the presumption that approval will ultimately be given but time is rapidly running out.  It is important to those concerned that they are told sooner rather than later that their projects can continue and on the basis foreseen heretofore.  Any further delay could threaten projects which are vital to some of the poorest communities in the country.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that the Government is considering subregionalising the country with the stated aim of giving disproportionate benefits to the counties of the midlands, west and Border.  It would be ironic if we were to be prevented from spending some of our money in seeking to develop those counties.</P>

      <P>This item was mentioned on RTE yesterday morning and was the subject of a headline story and an editorial today in one of the main newspapers. However, I wish to point out that the difficulties in securing EU approval for various tax incentive schemes have been mentioned in several replies by me to parliamentary questions over the past month as well as in a press release last June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The origin of our problems with the European Commission in this area goes back to May 1997 after a media report about the extension of the enterprise areas tax reliefs to Knock Airport in the Finance Act, 1997.  It appears that the European Commission thought as a result of the media report that the Government was extending to <Col N="1125" /> Knock Airport the long-standing 10 per cent corporation tax regime available to the Shannon Airport Zone.  This special tax regime for this zone is a State aid and needed European Commission approval. The Commission immediately sent a strong letter to the Irish authorities demanding full details of the proposals.  This led to several months of negotiations with the Commission which culminated last December in approval for the tax reliefs for the nonairport enterprise zones.</P>
    <P>These tax reliefs were accelerated capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of commercial buildings, double rent relief for the lessees of these buildings for ten years and rates remission on a sliding scale also for ten years. Deputy McDowell, as a member of the committee which discussed the Finance Act, will recall me speaking at length about these matters at that time.  Although they were never intended, I referred to the problems that the by-election in Mayo caused and which led us down this road in the first place.  I gave a detailed reply to a question on Committee Stage in that regard.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, after the wonderful exposé in May 1997, the European Commission wrote to the Government and asked what it was doing.

It took me until last December, after the budget, to secure approval for the existing enterprise zones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Members who took part in the discussions on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill understand this matter because I explained it in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the December 1997 approval, the European Commission was formally notified last January of proposals to give the same tax reliefs to a 12 acre extension to the Custom House docks area with effect from 24 January next.  A meeting <Col N="1126" /> took place with the Commission in Brussels on 6 February to discuss this proposal.  The new rural and urban renewal schemes were also discussed at this meeting.  Aside from delays, the first indication from the Commission that there might be a problem from its point of view was given at a meeting in Dublin in mid-April.  This was confirmed at a follow up meeting in Brussels on 25 May last.</P>
    <P>The Commission's view is that the double rent relief and the rates remission are operating aid, in other words, that they reduce the annual profits of the enterprise for ten years for tax purposes. The Commission contends that these two reliefs should in general no longer apply for new projects for ten years because Ireland has moved from a country coming under Article 92(3)(a) of the EU Treaties to one coming under Article 92(3)(c) as a result of the recent very significant improvement in the economy.  Article 92(3) states:</P>
    <P>The following may be considered to be compatible with the common market:</P>
    <P>(a) aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment; and</P>
    <P>(b) aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of certain economic areas, where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.</P>
    <P>The State Aids Directorate of the European Commission interprets these provisions in accordance with their own guidelines and European Court decisions and in the context of recent relevant economic data for the areas involved.  More favourable state aid rules apply to an Article 92(3)(a) area than an Article 92(3)(c) area.</P>
    <P>As a result of these EU concerns, a number of amendments were made to both new urban and rural renewal schemes on Committee Stage of the Urban Renewal Bill on 23 and 24 June.  They were inserted at my request because double rent and rates relief will be reduced.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government added a section to the Bill to ensure that when the schemes are put into operation, more attractive capital allowance measures will be available to make up for the almost certain shortfall following the removal of the double rent and rates reliefs.</P>
    <P>The taxation provisions for these two schemes had been legislated for earlier in the Finance Act, 1998.  The key June amendment was to increase the capital allowances from 50 per cent to 100 per cent under these schemes in situations where the double rent relief will not apply.  I announced these changes in a press release on 24 June in which I specifically stated:</P>
    <P>The EU Commission has indicated to Ireland that it is now opposed, on State Aids grounds, to granting the double rent relief except for smallscale activities or locally based <Col N="1127" /> services in areas where physical dereliction is associated with social disadvantage or high unemployment.</P>
    <P>This was in addition to the detailed comments I gave on Committee and Report Stages of the Finance Bill on this matter.  In light of the apparent general non-awareness of this announcement and of my recent replies to parliamentary questions, I must sadly come to the conclusion that elements of the media never read ministerial press releases or detailed replies to parliamentary questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard, Deputy Dukes and I are <i>ad idem.</i>  I recall the late Brian Lenihan's advice to all Ministers.  He said one could announce good news at least five times over a period of 12 months because most people did not follow it in the first place and one could keep repeating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The corollary of the Lenihan argument is that one can announce facts as often as one likes in ministerial press releases and replies to parliamentary questions, but nobody picks them up.  This matter has been in the public domain for some time.  It has come as a considerable shock in recent days to some people in the media, although it was announced inside and outside the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dukes probably knows more about this matter than other Members.  I wish to point out that the residential tax incentives under the new rural renewal scheme commenced on 1 June last, as I announced in a press release.  Commission approval is not needed for such residential incentives.  I also point out that the relevant Commission officials have so far not objected to the accelerated capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of commercial and industrial buildings because these are considered <Col N="1128" /> to be investment rather than operating aids.</P>
      <P>I also emphasise that the various tax reliefs involved are the same as or similar to those approved by the Commission for the original urban renewal scheme in 1986.  This included the Custom House docks area.  Furthermore, I wish to emphasise that the double rent relief and the rates remission were approved by the Commission for the enterprise areas in Dublin as recently as last December and that the Irish authorities were consequently taken aback when the Commission changed its views so abruptly during the year.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell raised the Custom House docks area.  This extension was applied for last January.  One would have thought, since it only involved an extension to an existing scheme, that there would have been no difficulty.  However, the matter has dragged on and there is still no decision.  Furthermore, all the other proposed tax incentives, including the new urban and rural renewal schemes, the section relating to wind energy in the Finance Act and another scheme, are being debated by the European Commission. Approval has not been received for any of them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald spoke of funding.  This has nothing to do with funding the Dublin docklands area but with tax incentives.  There is no EU funding for the Dublin docklands project.</P>

However, the capital allowances will be allowed on a case by case basis.  No regional airport project has yet progressed sufficiently to be sent for approval by the Commission.  The approval sought in December 1997 for the enterprise areas was given, but regional airports will be considered on a case by case basis.  No <Col N="1129" /> airport case has yet come up for approval, with the exception of Cork regional airport.</P>

      <P>In the absence of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I hoped the Minister for Finance would remain in the House to hear my case for a housing commission. However, I welcome the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I was deeply concerned by the response I received during Environment questions from the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy.  He refused to accept that there was a housing crisis, despite the growing evidence clear to every Member.  There is the empirical data of 40,000 families and individuals on local authority housing waiting lists at the last count.  It is clear that buying a house is beyond the reach of even double income young couples.  More and more of these people are turning to local authorities to address social housing needs.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Minister of State and the Government to this crisis is complacent.  There is daily evidence of extraordinary practices in the housing market.  This was underscored today when Annette and Stephen Butler were forced to go to court to seek to retain a house whose price had risen by an amazing £20,000, putting it well beyond their reach.  They were gazumped.  Unfortunately, the Government rejected a Fine Gael proposal to deal with this issue without proposing any other measure to deal with the problem which is affecting individuals and couples daily.</P>
      <P>There is a crisis in the supply of houses.  There is also a new crisis in the rental sector.  The impact of the measures implemented on foot of the Bacon report have put pressure on the rental sector. People are being forced to look for rent subsidies. An extraordinary amount of money is being paid out as we try to deal with a scarce resource being sought by an ever-increasing number of people.</P>
      <P>In last Saturday's <i>The Irish Times</i>, Dr. Murphy, one of the authors of the Bacon report, stated:</P>
      <P>The Government is being amazingly silent on the long-term issues raised in this report.  It has not given any convincing or credible reason for not implementing policy quickly.  In fact, we do not know what is going on at all.</P>
      <P>That is the response of people charged with mapping out a course of action for the Government on housing.  The Government and the Minister of State must acknowledge that a housing crisis exists.  The Government must establish the housing commission which I and many voluntary housing groups working at the front edge of housing provision are calling for.  It must also bring together all interested parties to address the various issues in social housing, not just the supply side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> The Government should instruct local authorities to establish social housing land banks and provide funding for them to do so.  It must also require each authority to develop a social housing plan.  The Government should provide immediate funding for the provision of infrastructure such as sewage, water and roads into these social housing land banks.</P>
    <P>The £15 million provided to augment the sums to date is totally inadequate and will go nowhere to address the scale of the housing crisis.  This is one of the main social problems which the Government must address.  I hope the Minister of State will provide a concrete response to these issues.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this matter.  My colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, is unable to be in the House this evening to respond to this item and has asked me to do so on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with the issue of the housing crisis.  Deputy Howlin and others have been calling for the declaration of a housing crisis or a housing emergency.  Deputy Molloy is not the first Minister to be called on to act in such a manner and he will not be the last.  What would the declaration of a housing crisis achieve?  The Deputy knows that it would do little or nothing in terms of a response to developments in the housing market or an increase in the supply of housing to meet needs.  In our current circumstances, with positive indicators on house prices emerging, a declaration of that sort could contribute to reintroducing some of the excessive and panic-driven behaviour which was becoming a feature of the market before this Government took action.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposal for the establishment of a national housing commission, the Minister of State is open to useful suggestions and ideas from any source which will help to meet housing needs.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy previously informed the Deputy and the House that he has met with representatives of the five voluntary bodies who originally made this proposal.  It is also noted that the recently re-appointed National Economic and Social Council will consider a proposal for a study on housing at an early meeting.  Very considerable preparatory work has already been done by the secretariat.  I have little doubt that the council will be anxious to tackle housing issues.  Accordingly, the Government, unions, employers, farmers and the voluntary sector will be debating and contributing to the development of housing strategies.  It is expected that the output of NESC's work, likely to be completed early in the New Year, will be an important input to future housing policy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not quote the author out of context.  Housing is one of the Government's top priotities.  However, there is no instant solution to the basic lack of equilibrium between housing demand and supply which underlies our current problems.</P>
      <P>I am proud of the Government's progress in addressing this matter and am delighted we will shortly see progress on the ground under the serviced land initiative.  Up to 30 of the schemes approved under the first tranche of funding will be under way before the end of the year.  In total, this initiative will result in 100,000 sites becoming available for housing.  This is hardly Government inaction, as the Deputy might have us believe.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputies of the Government's commitment to meeting social housing needs.  An Action Programme for the Millennium specifically pledges us to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups, and to the improvement and extension of social housing schemes generally.  On foot of these pledges, we provided substantially increased resources of £367 million to social housing in 1998, an increase of 28 per cent on 1997. Up to 10,000 households will be accommodated by the various social housing measures this year, compared with less than 9,300 households in 1997.</P>

      <P>We all have a responsibility to be reasonable, balanced, practical and positive in our attitude to this.  We must ensure in this marketled economy the Government, in the responsible attitude it adopts, is catering for those who are unable to compete in that market.

      <P>Hundreds of students from Donegal and possibly thousands from the rest of the Republic are pursuing third level courses in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  We all value this facility very much.  Surplus places are available in colleges in those jurisdictions and many young people from the Republic can avail of third level education who might otherwise be bypassed because of a shortage of places here.</P>
      <P>There is a long-established tradition that students from Donegal and Border counties avail of these courses as they are more convenient than courses elsewhere.  Some students return home every evening and many others return home for the weekends.  Since last year, however, students who qualify for maintenance grants have suffered a drastic reduction in the value of the grant paid. This is due to the impact of the exchange rates on the value of the grant.  At present, the maximum maintenance grant paid is £1,650 punts per annum.  When this amount is converted into sterling, its value reduces by 15 per cent or more, leaving the student with approximately £1,400 sterling.  This represents a very serious reduction in a person's income.  Which of us would be prepared to accept a 15 per cent reduction in income?  It is unthinkable and unbelievable that we would.</P>
      <P>Students already find it exceedingly difficult to survive on the maximum grant of £1,650 punts per annum without losing money on conversion. My understanding is that the regulations changed last year.  Until 1997, students in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom were paid on a punt for pound sterling basis.  They are now at the mercy of exchange rates; there has been a gap of approximately 15 per cent most of this year. Students are also subject to an administration fee which costs them a further percentage loss.  As a result of this, students from the Republic who have their maintenance grants converted to sterling are being subjected to severe hardship and anxieties.  After all, they only qualify for the maximum maintenance grant because they meet the requirements of a stringent means test.  Other sources of income are not readily available and they often have to cut back on essentials such as food, heating and so on.  This is very unfair to students who are required to leave the jurisdiction to avail of third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this urgent matter at a meeting of the County Donegal VEC last Monday and there was unanimous agreement that steps must be taken to redress the serious situation in which these unfortunate students find themselves.  We should revert to the pre-1997 position when students were paid on a punt for pound sterling basis.  I understand the local authority or VEC is paid in punts and gives the students the sterling value, having deducted transaction costs and exchange rate differences. I am informed by students that they could get a more favourable rate themselves than <Col N="1133" /> some of the local bodies.  I urge the Minister to have this matter investigated urgently and to make the necessary arrangements for students to get the full value of the maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>Accommodation costs in Northern Ireland have escalated this year with the advent of peace there.  The price of property has increased and, as a consequence, so has the cost of rents, lettings and leasings.  The cumulative effect of all these factors is that students from the Republic are finding it difficult to survive.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise this and take the necessary steps to redress this imbalance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGinley for sharing his time on this important and serious issue which relates to the exchange rate mechanism disadvantage affecting some young people.  Some students travel to Northern Ireland and the UK by choice to pursue third level courses there, while others do so because they cannot secure places in the Republic.  I encourage young people to travel to Northern Ireland and the UK as there is no better way to build up relationships than for young people from diverse backgrounds to mix together.  The primary reason for their travel is the pursuit of their studies to achieve the qualifications necessary to secure meaningful employment.</P>
      <P>The very fact these students qualify for grants in the first instance indicates they come from low income backgrounds.  Their families are not, therefore, in a position to make up the 15 per cent shortfall they are experiencing through no fault of their own.  It is not much to ask that these students would be paid on a <i>pro rata</i> basis in regard to the punt/sterling exchange rate.  I have had numerous representations on this matter which is particular to the Border area.</P>
      <P>We can all recall our student days when every penny counted and when one often ran short of money before the weekend.  It is not helpful to students to be put in that position as it does not allow them to further their education in a suitable climate.  I urge the Minister to take this serious issue on board and address it immediately, not in the long term.</P>

      <P>Since 1996, the student support schemes have been extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states.  Prior to this, such grants were only payable to students pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland.  In this context, following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying.  It was further agreed that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the relevant country in <Col N="1134" /> which the student was studying at the prevailing exchange rate.  The Department of Education and Science confirmed these arrangements in a letter dated 8 November 1996 to all local authorities and vocational education committees and a reminder was issued on 5 December 1997.</P>
      <P>Previously, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling without reference to exchange rates.  Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continued to receive their grants in sterling without reference to exchange rates.  Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under the revised arrangements.  We are satisfied these arrangements are equitable and efficient and we are not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in other EU member states, including Britain and Northern Ireland.  Moreover, such an approach could well give rise to anomalies and claims of inequitable treatment between students studying in different countries.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice in recent years to increase maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid-February to mid-February each year.  The inflation figure as provided by the Central Statistics Office for the period mid-February 1997 to mid-February 1998 was 1.7 per cent.  The value of the maintenance grant was therefore increased by 1.7 per cent for the 1998-9 academic year.  The full maintenance grant for the current academic year has been increased to £1,652 at the non-adjacent rate and £660 at the adjacent rate.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be interested to note that some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.  In the 1996-7 academic year almost 48,000 students received grants under these schemes.  The 1996 cost of the schemes was £91 million.</P>
      <P>It has also been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.  The figures are provided by the Central Statistics Office and are computed in each case to March of the previous year.  The average industrial wage increase for the period March 1996 to March 1997 was 3.2 per cent.  The reckonable income limits for the 1998-9 academic year were therefore increased by 3.2 per cent.  This increase was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.  The definition of eligible courses in this regard has also been extended.</P>
      <P>We are committed to ongoing improvements in third level student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits as resources permit. Our priority in student support has been to honour the commitment given in the programme for</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses.  We have honoured that commitment by way of introducing a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.  The scheme was issued to vocational education committees in August and it is anticipated the first payment to students, which will be retrospective to September, will be made not later than January 1999.  The grants payable under this scheme will be at the same level as the third level maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>We have identified the creation of additional third level places as our priority at third level and to this end we have significantly increased the number of student places available at third level.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that all improvements in the third level student support area must have regard to overall resource constraints and competing demands in the third level sector.</P>
    <P>Traditionally Fianna Fáil in Government and <Col N="1136" /> successive Governments have applied priority to the allocation of resources for education.  This has been a major success in terms of national economic growth.  We have created extra third level places in co-operation with industry and the third level sector.  We have also allocated extra resources for the primary and secondary level and will continue to give adequate prioritisation to further allocations to increase resources for the entire education sector as we approach the budget in December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 39 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>Most recently, the Olympic Council of Ireland applied for State funding in respect of two Olympic youth events &mdash; the European Youth Olympic Days in Lisbon in July 1997 and the World Youth Olympics in Moscow in July 1998.  I outline hereunder the details of both applications.</P>
      <P>In October 1996 the Olympic Council of Ireland sought funding of £65,000 from the Department of Education to meet the full cost of sending a team of 75 athletes and 35 officials to the European Youth Olympic Days in Lisbon.  In March 1997 the Department of Education approved a grant of £45,000 towards the cost of participation in the event.  The Olympic Council of Ireland submitted a financial statement to my Department in April 1998 which showed the final cost for the event at £45,344.60, implying a net financial contribution from the Olympic Council of Ireland of £344.60p.</P>
      <P>In October 1997 the Olympic Council of Ireland requested 100 per cent funding of £97,500 from my Department to send a team of 104 competitors and 34 officials to the inaugural World Youth Olympics in Moscow in July 1998.  The Olympic Council indicated that it had no funds at its disposal to meet the cost of participation in the event and that the sending of the team would be subject to the State meeting the entire cost. The amount requested was subsequently increased to £147,500 by the OCI &mdash; the additional £50,000 to meet the cost of sports gear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application was considered at a meeting of the high performance advisory committee of the Irish Sports Council held on 10 December 1997. A representative of the Olympic Council of Ireland attended this meeting to make a presentation on the application.  Based on the information provided, the high performance advisory committee recommended to me the allocation of a grant of £50,000 or 75 per cent of the costs involved, whichever is the lesser, subject to a more detailed cost analysis of the event when the <Col N="1139" /> teams had been identified, specification of criteria for the selection of the teams, and details of the preparations by the teams for the event.</P>
    <P>I accepted this recommendation and I wrote to the President of the Olympic Council of Ireland on 19 December 1997 informing him of my decision.  On 20 February 1998 I received a letter from the President of the Olympic Council of Ireland indicating that the offer of grant aid was inadequate and that they had no option but to withdraw from participation in the World Youth Games.</P>
    <P>In May 1998 the Olympic Council of Ireland included the same request for funding &mdash; £147,500 &mdash; for the World Youth Games as part of their own 1998 grant application.  No further details regarding the event were, however, supplied. When informing the Olympic Council of Ireland of its grant allocation for 1998 in a letter of 6 July, my Department reiterated the offer of grant aid for the World Youth Games.  However, the OCI again chose not to take up the offer.</P>
    <P>I should point out that at no stage was I or my Department informed by the Olympic Council that it was, after all, sending a team to compete in the Moscow Games, albeit with a reduced number of athletes.  Nor have I been made aware of the size of the team which attended the games, of the cost incurred by the OCI in sending the team or how it funded the cost.</P>
    <P>I have recently received a detailed application for grant aid from the Olympic Council of Ireland in respect of the European Youth Olympics to be held in Esbjerg, Denmark in July 1999.  Again the OCI is seeking full State support for the event &mdash; £87,665 including £26,522 in respect of gearclothing. This application has been submitted to the high performance advisory committee of the Irish Sports Council for consideration.  I hope to be in a position to convey a decision regarding grant aid to the Olympic Council very shortly.</P>

      <P>One of the Government's key priorities is to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities in addressing the needs of severely disadvantaged urban communities.  To that end, the interdepartmental committee on local development, which is chaired by Deputy Flood, Minister of State with responsibility for local development and with special responsibility for national drugs strategy, has been given a mandate to oversee an integrated services project which aims to produce a <Col N="1140" /> model of best practice that can be extended to other deprived urban areas.</P>
      <P>The pilot project is targeting four areas, viz. Dublin's north-east inner city; the canal communities &mdash; Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Gardens, St. Michael's House and Dolphin House; Jobstown, Tallaght; and Togher, Cork.</P>
      <P>The initial stage of the project has involved consultation with local communities about the needs of their areas and has culminated in the production of reports on each of the target areas. These reports profile existing services and resources, identify the extent of integration between them and make recommendations to enhance co-ordination and integration efforts.</P>
      <P>The reports and their recommendations have now been examined by the interdepartmental policy committee on local development and have been debated at an intensive one-day consultative workshop attended by representatives of the relevant Departments and agencies, members of the local drugs task forces and the Garda, held on 1 October.  On foot of these consultation sessions, recommendations are being.  prepared to go before the Cabinet committee on social inclusion in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Olympic Council of Ireland plays a key role in the promotion of Irish sport and, in this context, my Department, the Sports Council and <Col N="1141" /> I have a genuine desire to develop good relationships with the OCI, as indeed with all those committed to pursuing the best interests of Irish sport.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the independence of the OCI, although I regret that the council has not considered itself free to participate in such key elements of the overall sports development strategy currently under way in my Department as the High Performance Advisory Committee of the Irish Sports Council, the development of the sports science-medical support network for high performance athletes and the sports anti-doping advisory committee.</P>
    <P>Equally, I acknowledge the OCI's central role as the sole selector of Ireland's Olympic team.  In this regard, I have made clear that selection for participation in the recently announced international carding scheme for players and athletes cannot be construed by athletes as an indication of their selection for Sydney 2000.  Selection for participation at the Sydney Olympics is a matter for the National Olympic Council.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the strategies currently being pursued within my Department will be of tremendous benefit to the whole sporting community.  I look forward to the OCI playing as active a role as possible in progressing such developments into the 21st century.</P>

      <P>The current vehicle for the development of tourism facilities to the end of the century is the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.  With just over one Year to run to the end of the programme, it is expected that tourism performance in 1999 will far outstrip targets set in the programme, for both foreign exchange earnings and employment numbers. Almost all the funds have now been committed.</P>
      <P>In the context of EU funding for 2000-2006, I believe a new direction and strategic approach needs to be adopted.  This should involve the private and public sectors and the EU operating in an enhanced partnership which reflects the transition in strengths and capabilities which have taken place in Irish tourism.</P>
      <P>My Department has prepared a discussion paper on the matter and this has been circulated to the relevant State agencies and representative groups for the industry.  Discussions are currently taking place with these bodies with a view to developing a shared strategy for the continued development of the tourism product in the context of EU Structural Funding post 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position at this stage to anticipate <Col N="1142" /> the result of these discussions or the outcome of negotiations on the next round of Structural Funds but my objective is to continue to pursue the development of our tourism facilities in partnership with the industry.</P>

      <P>All providers of accommodation for tourists are obliged, whether approved or unapproved, to comply with official requirements in areas such as taxation, planning, fire and safety <Col N="1143" /> and hygiene and there is no evidence of significant non-compliance.  Earlier this year, I wrote to my ministerial colleagues with responsibility in these areas asking them to ensure that there are no advantages for unapproved operators in the application of the law.</P>
      <P>The issue of mandatory approval of bed and breakfast accommodation has been examined by successive administrations over the years and they have all come to the same conclusion that, to be effective, any system would have to be compulsory in nature, and this would require endless administration and policing, particularly as many operators only operate for short periods of the year.</P>
      <P>I believe that the best solution is to encourage unapproved operators to become approved and to this end both Bord Fáilte and the recognised approving bodies will continue to encourage all operators to seek approved status.  They will explain to them not only what is involved in terms of procedure, but also the benefits to be gained from being part of the approved sector, including access to official marketing and booking accommodation through Bord Fáilte and the tourist office network, and access to the tax breaks or other subsidised finance schemes which are available.</P>

      <P>Increased participation in sport and recreation, particularly by disadvantaged communities, is a fundamental objective of current sports policy.  The review of the sports capital programme is one of the activities currently under way in the context of delivering on this objective.  Among the issues to be considered in the context of the review is the question of securing increased access to sports facilities funded wholly or partly by the State. I expect the review to be completed before the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>Today, I circulated the Irish Sports Council Bill, 1998, and one of the specific functions which I propose to give under statute to the council is to formulate strategies aimed directly at increasing participation in recreational sport.  I expect that increased participation in areas of multiple disadvantage will be amongst the priorities for such strategies.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that the purpose of the young, people's facilities and services fund to which the Government has committed £30 million over the next three years, is to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreation facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas of major urban centres, where a drug problem exists or has the potential to develop, with a view to attracting young people in those areas into more healthy and productive pursuits.</P>
      <P>My Department, which has responsibility for the co-ordination of the Government's national drugs strategy, also chairs the assessment committee which will assess plans and proposals under the fund.  This committee will make recommendations to the Government via the Cabinet committee on social inclusion in relation to the allocation of funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The Olympic Council of Ireland wrote to me on 27 July 1998 indicating that while it had identified a sponsor willing to provide the gear and clothing requirements of the Irish team for Sydney 2000, the sponsorship deal was subject to the sponsor having the exclusive rights in relation to the gear and clothing to be worn by the team both in and out of competition at the games.</P>
      <P>This requirement would, the OCI indicated, once again bring the OCI into conflict with one of its affiliated national governing bodies of sport as happened in Atlanta, 1996.  In this context the OCI sought the Government to take over the sponsorship deal valued at £405,000.</P>
      <P>In my response to the OCI dated 18 August 1998 I intimated that while I quite agreed that a repeat of the very public dispute that arose in Atlanta over this issue of gear and clothing is not desirable, the Olympic Council of Ireland should be able to work out, to the satisfaction of all its members, an open and transparent methodology for seeking, selecting and accepting offers of sponsorship.</P>
      <P>Equally, as the availability of taxpayers' money to fund any one area of activity, such as sport is limited, it certainly would not be appropriate to divert Government funding away from sporting activities and organisations to fund a project for which appropriate private sponsorship was available.</P>
      <P>Given the independence of the OCI, I indicated my strong view that difficulties or disputes between the council and any of its affiliated federations are internal matters for the organisations concerned, that I trusted that the OCI would resolve any difficulties in this area, and that Sydney 2000 should not be tarnished by public disputes between Irish representatives.</P>
      <P>The only other funding sought by the OCI to date from my Department specifically in relation to the Sydney 2000 games relates to a request to fully fund advance visits to Sydney by OCI management and team managers from national federations during 1998, 1999 and 2000 at a cost of £48,450, £68,400 and £22,800 respectively.  On 24 August 1998 the OCI was requested to supply some additional details of these visits and a response is awaited.</P>

      <P>My Department has produced a discussion paper on strategy for tourism development <Col N="1146" /> for the next round of EU Structural Funds. This paper suggests an outline for a new, but considerably refocused, Operational Programme for Tourism, again with subprogrammes covering the three key areas of product development, marketing and training.</P>
      <P>The Department has not, however, to date undertaken or commissioned any specific studies on potential implications for tourism development of the proposed division of the country into two separate regions for the next round of EU Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>However, building on the success achieved by Irish tourism to date, the new direction suggested in the discussion paper for support for product development is founded on a selective approach based on environmentally sensitive, sustainable, tourism and regional development.  By its nature, such an approach would favour projects for those areas which are currently underdeveloped for tourism, thereby spreading development and relieving tourism congestion in peak periods.</P>
      <P>This approach can be accommodated on either the basis of two separate regions or existing arrangements, using selective application of possible EU incentives.  Suggested support for international tourism destination marketing and training, as envisaged in the decision paper will continue to involve co-funding from the EU, the State and the private sector, and could similarly be accommodated in the context of the relative future roles of these three parties.</P>
      <P>The implications of either existing arrangements or any new regional basis cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy, however, until the Commission has finalised its position on overall funding and priorities for EU expenditure for the next Community Support Framework for Ireland.</P>

Furthermore, I understand from the Olympic Solidarity 1997 report that it draws up its budgets to a four year plan and that the aid and development budget approved by the Olympic Solidarity Commission for 1997-2000 is just under US $122 million.</P>
      <P>The terms of Article 8 of the Olympic Charter indicate that the aims of Olympic Solidarity programmes include: the promotion of the fundamental principle of the Olympic movement; training sports administrators, developing the technical sports knowledge of athletes and coaches, supporting the organisation of competitions at national, regional and continental level under the authority and patronage of the national Olympic committees, and encouraging joint programmes of bilateral or multilateral co-operation between the national Olympic committee.</P>
      <P>In their application for State funding in 1998, the Olympic Council of Ireland indicated that it had received significant funding from Olympic Solidarity in respect of 1998 which the council decided to use primarily to help finance participation, in the Nagano Winter Olympic Games, and towards administrative costs.</P>
      <P>While it is appreciated that the Olympic Council of Ireland may not be able to access support under Olympic Solidarity to the same degree as developing countries, I must ensure that when determining the level of public funding to be awarded to any private organisation for any particular year that the organisation's potential access to other funding has been fully explored.</P>

      <P>The vast bulk of the recommendations in the Murphy report relate to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, IASA.  The only one of specific relevance to my Department related to the issue of public funding for the association, recommending that increased funding be allocated through the Sports Council to the association for necessary reorganisation and training.  I have indicated to the association that I will consider this matter as soon as they have completed consultation, now well under way, <Col N="1148" /> with their wider membership who, I believe, must be satisfied as to the adequacy of procedures and arrangements in place in their organisation to secure a safe environment for their younger members.</P>
      <P>The IASA was given a copy of Dr. Murphy's report on 17 June for urgent and immediate consideration. The IASA initiated a round of consultations with members which have continued over the past few months.  I understand that these will culminate in an extraordinary general meeting which the association has arranged for 1 November to discuss the IASA's formal response to the recommendations of the Murphy report.</P>
      <P>Specific recommendations relating to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, mandatory reporting and prosecution policy were referred to the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform respectively for their consideration.</P>

      <P>Last year I launched a special pilot tourism and the environment initiative.  The objective of the EU co-funded initiative is to generate practical projects which address issues where tourism and the environment interface.  My intention is to encourage projects which point to ways of supporting balanced tourism development which sustains the environment on which it is based.  The initiative attracted over 120 applications from all over Ireland and last month I was happy to announce that £2.5 million will be made available to the 20 selected projects to assist with the cost of implementation.  The progress of these projects will be closely monitored from the point of view of generating lessons on best practice for promulgation amongst the wider tourism industry.</P>

The Bill addresses a number of issues, including the creation of a new framework for the future execution of sports policy, including policy in relation to sports bodies.  It is expected to have the sports council established on a statutory basis and operational in the coming year. The intention is to have the matter of the recognition of individual sports and recreational activities, including bridge, revisited in the context of the new framework.  I have met with the Contract Bridge Association of Ireland regarding the matter, and the association is aware of my general approach.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the independent review of the community employment programme (CE) carried out by consultants Deloitte &amp; Touche to examine if CE is working efficiently and effectively as a labour market programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> Deloitte &amp; Touche reported to my Department in September and I immediately arranged for publication of the review and its circulation to stakeholders as I know there is a great deal of interest in the review and the package of recommendations it proposes.</P>
    <P>On the specific issue raised by the Deputy, the utilisation of CE by statutory bodies, the review found market linkages in this area to be weak with few of the participants finding equivalent work subsequently.  For that reason the review recommended the gradual phasing out of CE places in the statutory sector with the onus for delivery of the relevant service resting with the appropriate Department.  Commenting on the education sector the review describes the work being done on community employment as very valuable but the question is whether these supports should in fact be provided directly by the Department of Education and Science.  Any proposals I bring forward to amend the community employment programme will reflect a process of consultation with the social partners and of course with ministerial colleagues who have a Departmental interest in providing these services.</P>

      <P>The employment action plan gives effect to the 1998 EU employment guidelines.  The guidelines call for the adoption of a preventative strategy whereby there will be early intervention with all young and adult unemployed, within six and twelve months respectively of their becoming unemployed, with a view to offering them a job or other employability support, i.e. a place in a training or education course, a place on an employment scheme or in some cases referral to the local employment service for intensive mediation.</P>
      <P>The Government is meeting this commitment by focusing initially on the under 25s who cross the six-month unemployment threshold.  This programme began on 1 September 1998.  The programme is being implemented through co-operation between the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, and the FÁS employment services.</P>
      <P>The best current estimate is that each month up to 1,600 persons will approach the six months threshold.  The programme is not about coercion but about providing quality supports towards placement in a job if the individual is job ready and placement in training, education or other labour market programme if the individual is not job ready.  About 7,500 places on FÁS programmes have been ring-fenced to provide such opportunities. The whole purpose of the activation programme is to come up with a suitable response for each individual.  The process is modelled generally on the youth progression programme introduced for 18 and 19 year olds in October 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This activation procedure does not change in any way the requirement for persons in receipt of an unemployment payment to be available for and seeking employment.  It is entirely in accordance with paragraph 4.33 of P2000, agreed by all the social partners, which speaks of enhancing the <Col N="1153" /> real value of payments to the unemployed . based on the reciprocal obligations of society to provide decent incomes and worthwhile supports in job seeking for the unemployed, and of the unemployed to seek and accept reasonable employment, development and training opportunities.</P>
    <P>Review of an individual entitlements remain the responsibility of deciding officers of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, and the independent appeals procedure run under the aegis of that Department remains in place.</P>

      <P>The Kilmallock Economic Study Group is chaired by the Kilmallock Traders Association and comprises representatives from Limerick County Enterprise Board, SFADCo, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.

The study, being conducted by the consultants, involves meetings with all interested parties in Kilmallock.  A report is due from this group by the end of this month.  The refurbishment of the former Neodata plant will enhance the attractiveness of the area as a location for investment.</P>

      <P>There has not been any embargo on the filling of community employment places.  FÁS is currently implementing the rate for the job option of community employment.  While certain designated schemes were changing over some community employment schemes were asked to delay recruitment for their current vacancies for a couple of weeks.  This included the scheme to which the Deputy referred which had eight vacancies at the time of the schemes rollover on 12 October 1998.  While these vacancies were being filled the scheme did not operate for two days.</P>

      <Quest>the firm commitments to the Irish economy in terms of jobs, services and related spin-offs he will ensure and require by law from the oil companies in view of recent significant discoveries of gas off the west coast and the fact that the State offers the lowest corporation tax and royalty rates in the world to the oil and gas industry, with all drilling labour, research, production, goods and costs deductible against tax.</Quest>

      <P>It is Government policy to ensure that the Irish economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from hydrocarbon exploration activities in the Irish offshore.  I have impressed on operators that Irish workers and suppliers of goods and services must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>However, responsibility for the employment of workers, and the provision of services and related issues are a matter for the exploration companies and their contractors.  EU legislation on freedom of movement of workers within member states precludes the imposition on licence holders of any conditions relating to levels of employment of Irish workers.  In addition, the imposition of conditions in relation to employment, provision of services and related spin-offs, is also precluded under the European Communities (Hydrocarbons) (Prospection, Exploration and Production) Regulations 1998 which transposed into Irish law the EU Directive on the conditions for granting and using authorisations for the prospection, exploration and production of hydrocarbons.</P>

      <P>The specific payment details requested by the Deputy are not readily available in my Department.  This is because payments for flights are not only made to airlines directly but also to ticket agents or as staff reimbursements. Payments to one airline frequently include amounts covering connecting flights by another airline.  To obtain this information would require a disproportionate amount of staff time.</P>
      <P>The tender arrangements for air transport, travel agency, tour operator and tourist assistance services relates to official travel by Government Departments and offices.  The five group tender boards, representing 28 Departments and offices engaged in the tender process, have made their selection and the various tenderers have been informed of the selection.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a claim by one airline that the Government can save up to £2 million per annum on one route within Europe.  In relation to air travel generally, the Department of Finance, in a recently issued travel policy statement, directed that all Departments/offices must ensure, that consistent with the requirements of Departments/offices, the best value for money is obtained and that they must be prepared to use the services of all airlines operating out of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>A total of nine companies tendered to provide private security at the vacated barracks.  A number of these companies submitted tenders in respect of more than one of the properties.  The daily cost of the security services involved is approximately £1,400.  The companies have been engaged for an initial period of three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of providing military security at the properties would have involved substantial transport <Col N="1158" /> costs in deploying Defence Forces personnel from other barracks and would have unnecessarily diverted such personnel from more appropriate operational duties.  In addition, military personnel are normally paid extra remuneration by way of security duty allowances when securing military barracks.  The Price Waterhouse report on the rationalisation of the Defence Forces specifically recommended that the core business of the military should not be concentrated on the protection of military installations.  In any event, on the date of their evacuation, the barracks ceased to be military property and the securing of non-military State property is not the responsibility of military personnel.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 86, 87, 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that the military board established by the Chief of Staff in 1997 to undertake a special study of the Reserve Defence Force submitted an interim report to the Chief of Staff earlier this year.  It is anticipated that the board's final report will be submitted to the Chief of Staff before the end of this year.  It is not the practice to publish reports of boards set up by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of reviewing internal military matters and reporting to him thereon.  In the circumstances, neither the interim nor the final report of the military board will be published.  To date, the military board has met on a total of 44 occasions with a further two meetings scheduled to take place this week.</P>
      <P>The board met with the Reserve Force consultative group on two occasions.  These meetings took the form of weekend seminars and it is anticipated that a further such meeting will take place shortly.  The joint military/civilian steering group which I set up earlier this year and which has held a total of 16 meetings to date, is tasked with overseeing and guiding the military board review of the reserve.  The group submitted an interim report on 30 July 1998 and the final report is due to be submitted in February 1999.</P>

On payment of this amount, the Land Commission is prepared to favourably consider a rescheduling of repayments in respect of the larger account whereby the balance outstanding, £23,642.34, would be capitalised and the repayment period extended.</P>

      <P>The position is that under Article 2.2 of Commission Regulation 3887/92 my Department must satisfy itself that where new holdings are created after 30 June 1992 they are in fact legitimate entities managed separately from existing holdings and that holdings which existed prior to 1992 are not split into two or more holdings with the sole purpose of avoiding individual limits on eligibility for premiums.  In general, therefore, where two holdings existed separately prior to June 1992 they would not be amalgamated under the provisions of regulation 3887/92.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, cases will arise form time to time where it may be necessary to amalgamate two herd numbers which existed separately prior to 30 June 1992.  For example, on the death of a herd owner a holding is transferred to offspring or to another person who already has a herd number <Col N="1165" /> of his or her own.  In such circumstances the two herd numbers would be amalgamated where it is clear that the two farms are being operated as one individual unit.  It would not be possible to put a figure on the number of such cases dealt with since 1992.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 1.6 million mountain ewes in the counties along the western seaboard.  The lambs produced by these ewes are small and light and normally require to be finished on lowland pastures to reach a marketable quality.  In past years, such light mountain lambs <Col N="1167" /> have found a ready market in the Mediterranean countries of Italy, Portugal and Spain.  However, this year, there is considerably less demand than in previous years because of increased internal supplies in the Spanish market.  An Bord Bia has launched a publicity campaign this autumn to raise the profile of mountain lamb on the home market and a promotional drive has focused on the retail sector of some overseas markets.</P>
      <P>Over the years, research has been conducted by Teagasc into ways of further feeding lambs and identifying the strains of black face sheep most suitable for breeding.  There is a project currently in train at the Teagasc hill sheep farm at Linnane which compares the Newton-Stewart type blackface with native blackface sheep.  The project is coming into its third year.  To date the results from the Newton-Stewart breed are very promising.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>The design of a drainage scheme to deal with the flooding problems for Kilkenny city, which has been developed and which has been agreed by Kilkenny County Council and Kilkenny Corporation, is being progressed to detailed design stage.  It is envisaged that plans for a drainage scheme for Kilkenny city will reach public exhibition stage during 1999.  Pending the outcome of the public exhibition process, which will take approximately one month by which the various affected landowners and the general public will be notified of the scheme details and which will facilitate them in submitting observations on the scheme proposals, it is not possible to be definitive about when a scheme for Kilkenny city might reach works stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my Office's remit is to consider the flooding problems in Kilkenny city as a whole it is not practicable at the preparation stage of the scheme to segregate individual areas for priority treatment. <Col N="1168" /> However, depending on final design details, areas such as John's Quay could be identified for priority consideration at the works stage if it does not adversely affect other areas of the city.  Works on a scheme for Kilkenny city will be included in the drainage construction programme at the earliest possible opportunity as resources permit.</P>

      <P>In 1997 my Department's expenditure on air travel with Aer Lingus was £248,980.  Bookings with other carriers were made through a travel agency.  Some £1,335 related to British Midland services and £125 to Ryanair.  It should be noted, particularly in respect of Aer Lingus, that not all of the money paid to particular carriers may have <Col N="1169" /> related to journeys undertaken by that carrier.  It is often the case that journeys to destinations not ultimately served by a carrier operating out of Ireland would commence with the domestic serving carrier and be completed by another international carrier.  In such cases the full journey would often be booked through the domestic serving carrier and the fare paid to that carrier, whose responsibility it is to reimburse the other carrier(s) involved.  It is not possible, therefore, to extrapolate from the figures available to us that element of expenditure which though paid to one of the carriers referred to above may relate in part to the services of other international carriers.</P>
      <P>The tender arrangements for air transport, travel agency, tour operator and tourist assistance services relates to official travel by Government Departments and Offices.  The five group tender boards representing the 28 Departments and offices engaged in the tender process have made their selections and the various tenderers have been informed accordingly.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a claim by one airline that they can save up to £2 million per annum on one route within Europe.  In relation to air travel generally, all Departments/offices have been informed, in a travel policy statement issued by my Department, that they must ensure that, consistent with the requirements of Departments/offices, the best value for money is obtained and they must be prepared to use the services of all airlines operating out of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In addition, all heads of Departments/offices have recently been informed, by my Department, that the operation of these arrangements will be examined annually by external auditors whose reports will be made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The purpose of these audits is to ensure that the obligations of both the successful tenderers and the Department/offices themselves in regard to the use of all carriers and achieving value for money, as well as the other requirements of the travel policy statement, are being met effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 121, 122, 123 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The figure for public service pay and pensions that appears in the Estimates (the &lsquo;Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill&rsquo;) represents the cost to the Exchequer of the pay and pensions of civil servants, teachers, gardaí and the Defence Forces as well as the amounts which are included for pay and pensions in grants to health boards and other health agencies (such as voluntary hospitals), universities and other third level colleges and noncommercial State-sponsored bodies.  It does not include the pay or pension costs of the staff of local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Estimates figure covers pay and pension payments before deductions in respect of income tax, employee PRSI contributions, health contributions, and employment and training levies.  It includes the cost of employer PRSI contributions and takes account of certain appropriations-in-aid which come directly into departmental Votes and which relate to pay and pensions, such as superannuation contributions by civil servants, teachers, gardaí and members of the Defence</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> Forces.  Other payments received by Departments and employing organisations relating to the secondment of staff or in payment for services provided, and certain receipts from the European Social Fund are also included as appropriations-in-aid and off-set against the gross cost of pay and pensions.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that there is an element of double counting as a result of the treatment of pensions contributions in the Estimates.  As already indicated, employee superannuation contributions by civil servants, teachers, gardaí and members of the Defence Forces which are taken directly into the relevant Votes as appropriations-in-aid are netted off expenditure on pensions in those sectors.  In the case of the health service, pension contribution receipts are not shown in the Vote, but are taken into account in calculating the grant required for pay and pension payments in the health Vote.  Accordingly, the 1997 outturn for public service pay and pensions shown in the Revised Estimates for the Public Services 1998 represents, in the case of pension expenditure, the net cost to the Exchequer after allowing for employee superannuation contributions.</P>
    <P>While it is reasonable for the Government as employer to off-set the gross cost of pay and pensions expenditure by receipts in respect of employee superannuation contributions, it would not be appropriate to express the costs involved net of income tax and other statutory deductions. Unlike pension contributions, these deductions do not come in as a receipt to the public service employer concerned.  I would also point out that certain elements of all public expenditure (pay, non-pay and capital) tend to generate revenue for the Exchequer by way of direct and indirect taxation. This revenue is not shown in the Estimates but is taken into account in the overall budgetary arithmetic as part of overall tax receipts.  Moreover, I believe that a comparison of public service and private sector employment costs should be on the basis of the full cost before taxation, PRSI and levies are deducted &mdash; any other approach would favour Government expenditure over private sector expenditure.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with details of the receipts from income tax, employee PRSI contributions and statutory levies paid by those public servants covered by the Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill.  Details of such payments by this group are not recorded separately by the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, and a generalised global figure cannot be calculated because the amount paid depends not just on the level of salary or pension but also on individual circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have provided a total of £12 million to address hospital waiting lists in 1998 which represents a 50 per cent increase over the funding made available by the previous Government in 1997.  This funding was made available in January with the allocation to health agencies thus enabling them to co-ordinate their waiting list initiative activity with their normal activity over the full year.  This brings to £70 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initiative commenced in 1993.  In addition in December 1997, my Department issued a policy circular which put in place the following arrangements relating to the waiting list initiative: agencies were notified in their determination of net expenditure of the level of funding available to them &mdash; this gave agencies early notice of the money available and enabled them to plan their activity accordingly; agencies were asked to specify targets for waiting list activity in their service plans during the year &mdash; it is the responsibility of the chief executive officer &mdash; hospital manager to ensure targets are achieved and to take corrective action as necessary; there will be an increased focus on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective of ensuring children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialities targeted for attention; and agencies were requested to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work and as a contact point with the funding agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to maximise the effectiveness of the waiting list initiative, I established a review group consisting of clinicians and managers to consider: the net effect of the current waiting list initiative on waiting lists and waiting times; any incentive effects of the waiting list initiative on participating hospitals in relation to their activity and treatment schedules; the extent to which hospitals can consistently and accurately validate their waiting lists; and the adequacy of existing information <Col N="1175" /> systems to permit routine evaluation of the waiting list initiative.</P>
    <P>The review group on the waiting list initiative has submitted its report to me.  I have accepted its recommendations and I am now preparing a plan for their implementation designed to deal with the underlying causes of waiting lists and waiting times in the longer term.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board to deal with the reduction of waiting lists and waiting times at Waterford Regional Hospital in the first instance.  In this regard the South-Eastern Health Board received funding of £697,000 under the waiting list initiative in 1998 which represents an increase of 44 per cent compared with the funding of £482,909 approved by the previous Government in 1997.</P>

      <P>The next statutory assessment of housing needs will be carried out by local authorities in March 1999.  Guidelines in relation to the <Col N="1177" /> carrying out of the assessment will issue shortly to local authorities.  Details of results, on a local authority basis, of the previous assessment carried out in March 1996, including information on household size and category of need, were published in my Department's annual housing statistics bulletin for 1996, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium sets out the Government's commitment to a continuing, house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups.  A programme of 3,900 housing starts and acquisitions has been notified to local authorities for 1998.  These, with output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing local authority housing stock, will enable up to 10,000 households to be catered for in 1998.  Having regard to increasing needs, I am seeking additional resources for social housing in the 1999 Estimates.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 146 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware my Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant available under the scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment.  The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was made available to the scheme in 1996, and some 15,000 individuals were assisted that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997 an initial allocation of £2 million was again made to the scheme.  However, on coming into office, in fulfilment of our commitment to <Col N="1181" /> look after vulnerable people in our community, I sought and received approval from Government to allocate an additional £3 million to the scheme. Approximately 860 applications were received under the 1997 scheme.  A total of 839 grants amounting to £4,824,159 were paid out under the 1997 scheme providing assistance to over 21,000 people.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2 million was again allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  As I have already announced, I have yet again, for the second year in a row, obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme in 1998 bringing the total allocation to £10 million for the last two years.</P>
    <P>A total sum of £5 million has therefore been allocated to the scheme for 1998 and a total of 940 applications have been received.  These applications are currently being considered in the regional offices of my Department.  My Department expects to be in a position soon to advise groups of the decision regarding their applications.</P>
    <P>The additional allocations over the last two years since this Government came into office represent a significant increase in the level of support for this scheme and will provide the necessary resources to meet the volume of worthwhile applications received.</P>

Any plans for further legislation in any of these areas would be a matter for the relevant Minister.</P>
    <P>For general guidance, particularly for sport and recreational bodies, the Department of Education and Science published a voluntary code of practice for safety at sports grounds in January, 1996.  This is additional, of course, to the normal rules and regulations imposed by the respective governing bodies regarding the safe running of their particular sports, including the use of facilities by and for their members for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 156 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for tourism, I, together with my Department, am responsible for the formulation and development of national tourism policy.  This policy is, in turn, implemented by the main tourism agencies under my Department's remit, namely Bord Fáilte, CERT and Shannon Development.  These agencies report directly to the Department which monitors their respective performance against policy objectives, including overall expenditure of grants-in-aid, from the Department's Vote. However, the agencies retain day-to-day responsibility for their expenditures and for the operation of schemes and services provided by them to the tourism industry.  Further information about these bodies, together with the mission, goals and strategies of the Department are to be found in the Department's strategic management statement, 1997-1999, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding possible changes to our tourism promotion policies, the Deputy is no doubt aware that my Department has developed an outline strategy for the continued development of tourism in the context of EU structural funding, 2000-2006, and is currently engaged in a process of consultation with the tourism industry and the relevant agencies with the objective of developing a shared vision for the continued development of <Col N="1185" /> Irish tourism.  In this context, implementing structures will be kept under review, not only to assist with short to medium term policy adjustments, where necessary, and the emerging political situation in relation to the British-Irish Agreement, but also to help set the parameters for the development of tourism into the next century.</P>

      <P>The budget for sport in 1998, my first full year as Minister, will be almost double that of 1997.  As there is no distinction made on the basis suggested by the Deputy funding for the promotion of sport and recreational activities is provided primarily by way of annual grants to national governing bodies of sport towards their administration and programme activity costs. This year I expect to allocate over £5.5 million to such bodies for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Another £1.5 million is being made available towards the cost of programmes run by vocational education committees and other bodies, aimed specifically at increasing participation by various target groups in sport and recreation.</P>
      <P>These monies are, of course, additional to the services offered by the Sports Council, the National Coaching and Training Centre and other initiatives undertaken by my Department, in support of the work of sports organisations, and also additional to the £9 million provided this year for the sports capital programme.</P>

      <P>The Government, in line with the commitment given in the joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium, to invite proposals for a national 50 metre swimming pool, decided in November last year to initiate a tender procedure to invite such proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tender procedure is being conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts. Under Article 22 of the Directive, candidates are selected for invitation to tender from among those qualified in accordance with Articles 24 to 29 thereof.  These requirements were outlined in the tender procedure notice for the project which <Col N="1186" /> was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on Wednesday 21 January 1998, and in the Irish media on the following day. The invitation was open to both the public and private sectors, and the location for proposals is a matter for individual developers.  The Government has agreed depending, of course, on the actual proposal, to provide capital assistance, up to a maximum of £6 million, and annual operational assistance, up to a maximum of £250,000 towards cost of implementation of the successful tender.</P>
    <P>The deadline for submission of full tender proposals from qualified candidates is set for 27 November 1998, following which a detailed evaluation process will be undertaken.  It is expected that the successful tenderer will be identified early in the new year.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme is currently being reviewed by my Department. Among the priorities of the new programme will be to promote a more strategic approach to the use of available resources for sport and recreation, particularly in areas of greatest need, and to assist with the creation of opportunities to participate in sport and recreation through access to facilities and activities, especially for young people.  The equitable distribution of funds <Col N="1187" /> throughout the country will continue to be a priority for my Department.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that the purpose of the young people's facilities and services fund to which the Government has committed £30 million over the next three years, is to develop youth facilities, including sport and recreation facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas of major urban centres, where a drug problem exists or has the potential to develop, with a view to attracting young people in those areas into more healthy and productive pursuits.</P>
      <P>My Department, which has responsibility for the co-ordination of the Government's National Drugs Strategy, also chairs the assessment committee which will assess plans and proposals under the fund.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, schools were selected for designation as disadvantaged by reference to a range of agreed socio-economic criteria.  The factors taken into account included the incidence of unemployment; local authority housing occupancy; and medical card holding among the families of the pupils concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applicants for disadvantaged status were allocated points under each of the above headings and disadvantaged status was allocated on the basis of priority of need as reflected by points scored and within the limit of available resources. I can confirm that, while the school in question <Col N="1190" /> demonstrated a level of need under the above criteria, it did not score sufficiently highly in terms of priority of need to secure inclusion in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I can also confirm that the Taoiseach, who recently made representations in relation to this matter, has been advised of the above situation.</P>

      <P>In order to achieve an efficient and costeffective transport service, vehicles frequently operate a number of runs to both primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>The transport service to the school in question has been recently reorganised due to the retirement of a contractor.  The school is now served by a bus which operates a feeder service to a postprimary centre and also caters for another national school.</P>
      <P>It is possible to re-organise this service so that pupils would be in a position to fulfil their minimum school day of 5 hours and 40 minutes.  This service could arrive at school at 8.45 a.m and depart at 2.30 p.m., or, alternatively, the pupils could be set down at school at 9.45 a.m. and depart at 3.45 p.m. However, the school has advised my Department that neither of these options is acceptable.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I have asked officials of my Department to re-examine the situation, in consultation with Bus Éireann with a view to finding an early resolution.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 and 171 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes.  One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which <Col N="1192" /> my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI.  This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
    <P>There are currently two full-time secretaries and one full-time caretaker employed in schools in County Donegal under the 1978-79 scheme. There are no such posts in schools in County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial services.</P>
    <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, £15 per pupil in respect of each scheme, based on their enrolments, which are paid as additions to the standard per capita grant. The level and extent of services provided is a matter for local school management who have discretion as to how the grants are to be applied to these services.</P>
    <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of such services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP.  The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    <P>There are 32 schools in County Donegal in receipt of funding under this scheme towards the cost of secretarial services and 33 towards caretaking services.  There is currently one school in County Leitrim which qualifies for such funding.</P>
    <P>Overall, the percentage breakdown of schools in receipt of financial assistance towards secretarial and caretaking services, in respect of both schemes, is as follows:</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment in this regard was clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates, which <Col N="1193" /> provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant represented an important step forward in the process of improving funding of the primary sector.</P>
    <P>Mercy primary school, Moyderwell received a total of £17,428 in capitation funding in the 1997-98 school year based on an enrolment of 305 pupils.  As this was the appropriate amount payable under the terms of the scheme, I regret that it is not open to my Department to make an additional or increased capitation grant available to the school.</P>
    <P>However, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to give priority to the issue of further increases in the capitation grant, which will benefit all primary schools, including the Mercy primary school.</P>

      <P>Of the 60 remedial and 26 resource teaching posts recently allocated to national schools, five remedial posts and one resource teacher post were allocated to schools in County Limerick.</P>
      <P>The remedial posts were allocated to the following schools: Lisnagry and Ahane national schools; Kilteely, Lough Gur, Caherally, Knockainey, Garrydoolis and Cloverfield national schools; Knocklong, Knockadea, Ballylanders and Glenbrohane national schools; Croagh, Kilfinny, Cappagh, Coolcappagh and Kilcolman national schools; St. Patrick's Monastery national school, Bruff.</P>
      <P>The resource teacher post is shared between Roxboro and Crecora national schools.</P>
      <P>The number of pupils in the schools recently allocated a remedial teacher service is 1,448.</P>
      <P>My Department does not keep details on an annual basis of the numbers of children attending school who are in need of a remedial teacher.

      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, maintenance grants are not payable to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second undergraduate degree.  Similarly, tuition fees are not payable in respect of a second period of college attendance at the same level.  As the student referred to by the Deputy already holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree, she is ineligible for a higher education grant or to benefit under the free fees initiative in respect of her studies in medicine.  As the rules governing the schemes are of general application, exceptions cannot be made in individual instances.</P>
      <P>I will, however, ask my officials to examine the effect of granting the concession suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The position is that arrears of pension are due to some retired teachers in accordance with the terms of the PCW agreement.  The PCW agreement is a complex one and in order to cope with implementation of its provisions, including paying pension arrears, my Department has taken on additional staff, both permanent and temporary. My Department's plan to complete the work of paying the arrears by September of this year was based on the required temporary staff being in place in the spring.  It was not possible, however, to appoint them until June, following protracted negotiations with staff unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from this, the pace of the work has been affected by the fact that normal retirements, which reached a record level in 1997, have continued to occur at the same high level &mdash; almost 50 per cent higher than in 1996.  The work has also been delayed by the amount of queries which are received on a daily basis regarding the benefits of the PCW agreement and regarding superannuation generally.  The rate of queries received is such that staff are dedicated to answering phone queries between 10 and 12 in the morning in the case of secondary teachers and between <Col N="1200" /> 2.30 and 4.30 in the afternoon in the case of primary teachers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the outstanding arrears, the position is that a dedicated group of staff are working full-time with a view to making payments to as many retired teachers as possible before Christmas.  Where it is not possible to complete the work of calculating the amounts due by Christmas, my Department will make payments on account to the retired teachers involved.</P>

      <P>As regards the nature of the other teacher allocations made, I would point out that remedial and resource teacher posts are allocated on a shared basis among a number of schools The actual amount of time allocated to each school in the cluster is a matter to be determined by the board of management and the local inspector.  Accordingly my Department does not maintain details of the actual teaching allocation in these areas which is given to each school.</P>
      <P>Of the 122 posts allocated in the special education area, 60 were allocated as remedial teacher posts, 26 as resource teacher posts, 26 as home school community liaison co-ordinators and ten as teacher counsellors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, the third level colleges levied a standardised charge of £150 in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services.  This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for two academic years.  At that time, the then Minister stated that the level of the charge would be reviewed.  In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year.  In line with the 4 per cent increase agreed for third level tuition fees for the 1998-99 academic year, I also accepted a similar increase in the level of this charge to £260.  The level of the charge is subject to annual review.</P>
      <P>I would point out that students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>The distribution of the charge payable by students for registration, exams and student services, is a matter for the third level institution involved.  When I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge, I was concerned about that portion of the charge, which is intended to fund student services and in particular, the lack of transparent procedures.  Accordingly, I requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The Higher Education Authority issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions in January, 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with <Col N="1202" /> students in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution should provide information as to the allocation of the charge towards exams/registration and towards student services on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to my direction that any arrangements put in place should not adversely affect the current funding of students' unions, clubs and societies, the framework recommends that institutions be cognisant of the average contribution from the £150 base in this regard of £50, when determining the revised contribution for these services from the £250 charge.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority is currently co-ordinating a review of the consultative and decision making procedures in place in the various third level institutions in relation to the disbursement of these funds.</P>
    <P>Finally, I understand that a number of colleges have agreed local additional levies with their student bodies for the provision of specific facilities. These arrangements are a matter for the individual colleges concerned and my Department has no function in their regard.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following Table.</P>
      <P>The figures shown represent expenditure on adult education which can readily be identified separately.  They exclude services for which separate costs of adult participation are not maintained, such as the costs of mature students in third level education and PLC courses, education provision for participants on the back to education allowance schemes, the prison education service, the costs of posts of responsibility allocated to second level schools on foot of part-time adult participants, and the costs of staff assigned to adult education and literacy services in the vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>The provision for adult literacy was doubled in 1998 and is being used to support innovative projects under an adult literacy development fund which will inform future policy and practice in this area.  In addition, a new childcare measure has been introduced for the children of participants on VTOS, Youthreach and senior traveller training centre programmes.</P>
