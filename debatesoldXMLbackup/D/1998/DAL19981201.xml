      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the number of occasions the interdepartmental committee of officials, chaired by his Department, with the mandate to develop work practices and procedures for the protection of classified information has met.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The interdepartmental committee established to develop detailed work practices and procedures for the protection of classified information met on 22 September 1998.  At that meeting, the committee considered the draft of a Department of Finance circular on the classification of material as top secret.  The circular has since issued to all Departments and gives guidance on material which might be classified top secret and on procedures to be applied to such material.  The interdepartmental committee also decided to compile an inventory of current practices in Government Departments and offices for the handling, circulation and storage of sensitive official information with a view to preparing a preliminary draft report.  The compilation is in hand and the committee will meet again in due course to consider the preliminary draft report when it is available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What guidance does the circular give as to what information should be classified as top secret?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a copy of the circular. The committee is examining what issues must be addressed to identify the practices and procedures currently used across Departments. An enormous difference has built up between them over the years in what is classified as secret. The departmental circular and the committee are an attempt to narrow this down so that only what is necessary will be top secret and not every file.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the nature of the guidance?  I do not ask for the full circular to be read <Col N="926" /> out, merely that the Taoiseach would give the gist or essence of the guidance issued to Departments as to what should be top secret.  I take it the Taoiseach has been briefed on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The gist is that the material should be anything which comes under the Official Secrets Act, which is confidential to Government and which relates to Northern Ireland and which could endanger a person's life. It is quite narrow compared with what was the case before and reflects the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <Quest>the number of civil servants in his Department allocated full-time or part-time to servicing the needs of independent Deputies who have made commitments to support the Government; if the number is to be increased in view of the recent decision of Deputy Tom Gildea; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>One assistant principal officer attached to my office has been designated as the liaison person with the independent Deputies who support the Government.  This arrangement will include Deputy Gildea and there are no proposals to provide additional staff for this purpose. The officer also assists the Chief Whip in his dealings with all independent Deputies in the Dáil as well as fulfilling other duties in the Taoiseach's office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The civil servant concerned would have a good idea about the issues the Members who contact him consider a priority.  He tries to assist them in whatever way he can and liaises with them by way of giving them whatever information he can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach considered whether this appointment involves an inappropriate politicisation of the Civil Service in so far as a civil servant is being asked to do work that would normally be done by the Government Whip?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The work of this civil servant is not much different from the work of any civil servant who tries to assist and help Members.  When this civil servant is asked about matters all he can do is check the position, liaise with and report back to the Member.  He cannot do any more than that.  I do not consider that politicisation of a civil servant.</P>

      <P>On what list of priority issues does this civil servant maintain contact with the Independent Deputies concerned?  Is it a list with which those Deputies or the Taoiseach has provided him?  Given that, presumably, such a list would consist of political matters, does the Taoiseach consider it appropriate that a civil servant should have a political task?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider there is a list. When Deputies raise issues they are entitled to have them followed up.  That is what this person does along with his other duties.  He has been designated to follow up on these issues.  That is what he does.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Secretary General of the Department in question agreed to the role that has been created for this public servant?  Does the Taoiseach agree that keeping the Government in office and winning Dáil divisions is probably the most political task any person could be asked to perform and that it is naive to suggest, as the Taoiseach has, that this is not politicising a civil servant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During my 21 years in this House I have been a Government Whip and I saw civil servants, attached to the Whip's office, keep Members on track.  I saw them ring hotels, bars and taxis to find Members for votes.  That is politicising an issue.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree this is not normal whipping, but a separate arrangement for four Deputies involving a clear choice by the Government to politicise an individual?  This is a known individual, while people who work in the Whip's office preserve the anonymity of the Civil Service.  In this case a known civil servant has been asked to perform a party political task and that is outside the normal canons of public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission prepared its first programme, pursuant to the provisions of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, and it was approved by the Government and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in January 1977. The commission has advised that the majority of the projects contained in that programme have <Col N="930" /> now been dealt with in its published reports, consultation papers and working papers.</P>
    <P>In addition to the first programme, research undertaken at the request of successive Attorneys General, as provided for in Section 4(2)(c) of the Act, also formed a substantial part of the commission's work.</P>
    <P>A considerable body of work has been completed by the commission this year.  I welcome the publication of its reports on land law and conveyancing law, privacy and the implementation of the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption and its consultation paper on aggravated, exemplary and restitutionary damages.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the publication of the consultation paper on the statutes of limitation &mdash; claims in contract and tort in respect of latent damage, other than personal injury &mdash; which is expected this week.</P>
    <P>A detailed account of the work undertaken by the commission under its first programme and research undertaken at the request of the Attorney General are to be found in the appendices to the annual report for 1997 which has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The commission is also continuing its work in the areas of land law and conveyancing law, and aggravated, exemplary and restitutionary damages as well as on the law of homicide, statute of limitations, drafting and interpretation of legislation, aspects of the Civil Liability Acts and ratification, implementation and interpretation of treaties.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the commission's work in connection with international bodies, such as UNCITRAL and the Hague conference on private international law is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The commission is currently in the process of formulating a new draft programme for law reform to form the basis of its future work, with the intent that this programme will play a significant role in enabling the law to respond to the needs of our changing society.  The new programme for law reform will be prepared by the commission in consultation with the Attorney General and other interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply.  I acknowledge that the Government has laid before the Oireachtas Library the Leahy Report, which was given to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform this summer. Arising from that report, which arose out of an SMI efficiency inquiry, is it the Government's intention to incorporate into the next programme of law reform for the commission the whole area of criminal law?  In the list the Taoiseach has just read out, as I heard it, he did not refer to reform of criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing in mind the substantial changes proposed in the Leahy report, does the Taoiseach think the Attorney General, in consultation with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, should take on board some of the proposals <Col N="931" /> set out in that report and ask the Law Reform Commission to bring forward, as a priority, changes in the criminal law code, which clearly seem to be necessary at present?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make the Deputy's views known to the Minister and to the Attorney General. At this stage I do not have the full list of issues they are examining.  While I did not read out the full list, the first programme certainly examined criminal law.  I am not too sure in what year that was, but criminal law was part of the commission's discussions.</P>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the Deputy's question, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report recommended the setting up of a consultative commission.  That has been set up and it includes representatives of the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society and a number of Government Departments, including that of the Tánaiste and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  As envisaged in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, they are working with the Attorney General in identifying the areas to be included in the next work programme.  The consultative committee stated that it would assist the Attorney General in his consultations with the commission in relation to research programmes, in the selection of specific topics for examination, and in monitoring the implementation of the recommendations of the commission.  They are currently involved in all three tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in a recent court case a builder got away with increasing the price of a house by £20,000 for a couple in County Kildare after they had paid their deposit?  Is the Taoiseach further aware that at the time that court case was reported the Government said it was referring the practice of gazumping to the Law Reform Commission?  Why then did the Taoiseach not include reference to this in his comprehensive reply?  Is it the case that the gazumping issue has not in fact been referred to the Law Reform Commission, even though that was the excuse given for voting down Deputy Brian Hayes's Bill on that subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As was stated at the time, the Attorney General is considering whether to refer the issue of gazumping to the Law Reform Commission. It should be noted that the referral of matters to the Law Reform Commission rests with the Attorney General, under section 4(2)(c) of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975.  That matter was referred in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately Deputy Bruton probably was not listening when I answered Deputy Quinn.  I stated that the Deloitte &amp; Touche <Col N="932" /> report envisaged that a consultative committee would be set up.  That consultative committee is being set up.  It is to work in tandem with the Attorney General to decide the next report.  The matters are being considered by both.  The matter referred to by the Deputy is one of the matters being considered.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the work of the Law Reform Commission in regard to the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, as I did not hear it specifically mentioned in his reply?  I would like to draw his attention to the <i>Bar Review</i> which contains criticisms of that Act.  Will he include it in a future programme of work for the Law Reform Commission, given that the <i>Bar Review</i> article specifies five areas in which the Domestic Violence Act fails, for instance, where a parent wants to bar an adult child and the property is owned by the adult child?  Is that to be included in a future programme of work or is it being considered already?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The visit of the Prime Minister Mr. Blair and Mrs. Blair to Ireland last week was both historic and extremely successful.  The centrepiece of the visit was the Prime Minister's address to a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The House will agree that his speech was a fitting reflection of the new departure in relations between our two countries represented by the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>At our meeting last Thursday, the Prime Minister and I had a valuable exchange on the implementation of the provisions of the Agreement. We focused on Strand Two issues and the setting up of the North-South Ministerial Council and the implementation bodies.  We were at one on the need for accelerated progress in implementing the Agreement.  We must now &mdash; Governments and parties alike &mdash; make a concerted and intensive effort to bring the current discussions to a conclusion and to reach agreement on the areas for enhanced North-South co-operation, including for all-island implementation bodies, and on the configuration of the Northern Ireland Executive and Departments.  It should be possible to do so this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> The Prime Minister and I also discussed the forthcoming Vienna Council.  I repeated to him our concerns about the current proposals for CAP reform and I raised our concerns about Structural and Cohesion Funds.  We discussed the issue of co-ordination of taxation policies within the EU and also touched upon the prospects for EU enlargement.</P>
    <P>Following our meeting, the Prime Minister and I signed an Agreement relating to co-operation between Ireland and Britain in the fight against crime.  We also announced a joint research project involving co-operation in the area of education for those with special needs, including children with autism.  These two initiatives represent a fitting and welcome development of existing co-operation in these areas, foreshadowing the fuller development of enhanced relations in the framework of the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, towards which both of us looked forward with enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity last weekend to meet Senator George Mitchell in Cork, where he was awarded the freedom of the city and an honorary degree from UCC.  I was delighted to see what a wonderful welcome the Senator received from the people of Cork.  At our meeting we discussed the current situation with regard to the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement and I informed the Senator that the Government's proposed legislation to establish the scholarships named in his honour had been published.</P>
    <P>I was also glad to have the opportunity, this morning, to review the situation with former Prime Minister Harri Holkeri, who played such a pivotal role in the negotiations which led to the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>As I said in reply to previous questions, it is my intention to visit Northern Ireland again as and when it may be appropriate to do so, including when we are in a position to progress to agreement stage on the North-South arrangements under strand two.  I hope this will be the case soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has the full support of the House in seeking to have the details of the implementation bodies and the distribution of executive responsibilities in the Northern Ireland Executive agreed at the earliest possible moment.  Is the Taoiseach of the view that it is possible to bring those agreed arrangements into effect with the formation of a functioning Executive without some progress on decommissioning by the paramilitary organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again, I thank Deputy Bruton for his support in these matters.  I and the Government appreciate it.</P>
      <P>The short and direct reply is that it will be difficult to do that.  I do not see Mr. Trimble being able to deliver on that without a positive sign from the paramilitary organisations.  I doubt that it is within his call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="935" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's frank reply is helpful.  Has he reflected on the fact that the republican movement stated on many occasions that there would not be decommissioning until there were talks and, after the talks started, that there would not be decommissioning until there was a settlement?</P>
      <P>Now that there is, in effect, a settlement, it still seems unwilling to agree to decommissioning. Will the Taoiseach agree that decommissioning at this stage by the republican movement would be consistent with and a logical development of its previous statements and something which it had indicated in previous statements would happen?  Therefore, in no way could it be construed as a surrender but as a logical development of its previous positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage it is good to look back over the past period to see where this issue has moved from.  There are a number of aspects to this matter.  The key issues are that during 1998 the republican movement has stuck firmly to its ceasefire with the exception of one rather serious breach &mdash; which involved an internal issue &mdash; when an individual was shot and murdered. Other than that and some punishment beatings which have been on the decline, but are still a cause of concern, the ceasefire has held.  That is acknowledged by the security forces, as outlined by the head of the RUC about ten days ago.  We are still left with a position that it has issued two statements making it clear it does not intend to decommission ever.  That is the difficulty.  Both the April and September statements are in the negative.  Perhaps if they were never made people could look positively in the direction we are trying to move towards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In looking back over the period there have been three positions.  Prior to the negotiations, Sir Patrick Mayhew made his statements which were listed as helpful but turned out to be the opposite. His position was to set out conditions that would try to achieve prior decommissioning.  That was moved away from in the international group's report in February or March 1996 which stated parallel decommissioning was the issue and if the multi-party talks moved on there would be parallel decommissioning.  If I recall correctly, that was contained in paragraphs 31 to 34 of the report. Parallel decommissioning did not happen during the talks.  We are now at the third stage, the implementation phase, and we are no further on regarding the issue of decommissioning.  When I raised this with republican sources they said that was the intention and that my assessment was correct.  They were against prior decommissioning, there was agreement to parallel decommissioning but that was superseded by the British-Irish Agreement.  I still think that makes life more difficult for those who have consistently argued all along.  Having moved away from prior decommissioning and parallel decommissioning it is hard to drop the issue altogether.  There lies the crux.  If that was not bad enough, the other position <Col N="936" /> is there are two negative statements.  It is not even silent on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The republican movement did not use the word &ldquo;never&rdquo;.  It said it would not disarm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not disarm but the interpretation is that those two statements of April and September are in the negative.  The reality is that nobody is asking the republican movement to surrender.  It is not being asked to give up its arms in any formal way to the RUC or to the British army, which it has no intention of doing one way or the other.  It is being asked to make some unspecified gesture to allow it room to co-operate with an international commission on decommissioning under an international agreement.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the IRA will be well removed from any threat.  A gesture of that nature would not be entirely unhelpful and the IRA must be urged to make it.  There is a consistency in arguing that such a gesture should be made and contrary to what might have been stated last weekend, that view is held by all of the other parties involved in the talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive original reply and his comprehensive if somewhat depressing supplementary reply.</P>
      <P>In light of everyone's desire to move this process forward, does the Taoiseach agree it is necessary, if not essential, to try to make progress on those areas of the Agreement where progress can be made?  I am not referring to decommissioning in that regard.  Will he indicate the nature of the difficulties surrounding the establishment of cross-Border bodies?  Will he confirm that there is no truth to the rumours that the Department of Agriculture and Food is refusing to fully co-operate with Northern Ireland in respect of establishing a body to monitor and assist agriculture on an all-Ireland basis?  Will he further confirm whether the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has adamantly refused to contemplate the idea that the IDA and the IDB might be merged or whether the Unionists oppose this proposal?  In the context of those two bodies, will the Taoiseach bear in mind that only five months remain before the decision of the electorate to change Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution will lapse and we will be required to introduce legislation to obtain an extension?  Does he believe this situation to be entirely unsatisfactory and does he accept that the Government could move forward, particularly in terms of its being generous in the area of cross-Border bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quinn for his questions because they will allow me to respond to rumours which emanated from outside the House.  At a time when negotiations are approaching a conclusion, it is unhelpful for <Col N="937" /> people outside the House to raise the matters under discussion in a way which tries to attribute blame to those involved in the talks.  From our point of view, all of those conducting negotiations on the Government's behalf and all of the officials involved from the parties concerned have carried out their work in a thoroughly committed and professional manner.  Government Departments have shown great enthusiasm for North-South co-operation and have taken forward positions in their respective areas.  The Government is completely satisfied with the commitment they have given and I am confident that at the conclusion of the process we will have identified implementation bodies of real substance.  The Government looks forward to participating in the North-South Ministerial Council when it comes into operation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn asked me to confirm whether rumours about the two bodies to which he referred and those involving Government Departments and agencies are untrue.  There is no truth in the rumour concerning the Department of Agriculture and Food.  With regard to the IDB and the IDA, Mr. Trimble and his colleagues have great difficulty with that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the necessity to put in place confidence building measures which might assuage the fears of the IRA in respect of decommissioning, the substance of cross-Border bodies is regarded by everyone on this side of the Border as being significant.  Do I understand that the Taoiseach stated that the Government has offered substantial incentives in respect of the establishment of cross-Border bodies on agricultural and economic development &mdash; specifically by means of foreign direct investment &mdash; and that those offers have not been accepted by people in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>What reasons did the republican movement convey to the Government for its unwillingness to even offer a gesture on decommissioning?  Given the history of the Agreement and the enormous progress which has been made, from which the republican movement in particular has benefited enormously, why does it believe it is incumbent on it to deny everybody else the advantage of a gesture at least on decommissioning?  Does the Taoiseach agree with the assessment of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs who was deeply involved in its development and negotiation that the unstoppable Agreement has stopped because of the IRA's refusal to fulfil its part of bargain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On where the republican movement stands on the issue &mdash; I will be as balanced as I can &mdash; once the election was over the Executive should have been established under the D'Hondt mechanism without regard to any other issue.  For Sinn Féin to have two seats, the Executive <Col N="938" /> would have to comprise ten seats.  As of today, the figure stands at six.  If I were to ask Sinn Féin to convince its republican colleagues to move forward, it would say to me that under the Agreement it was to have an inclusive role, including Cabinet seats, but I cannot guarantee this.  All Mr. Trimble will say is that there should be six seats, although there has been movement in recent days.  For the past five or six months I have been asking Sinn Féin to participate in an Executive in which it would have no seats.  The ministerial positions have yet to be agreed.  I have not accepted the other part of Sinn Féin's reply. Although it may not have been in the big print, it was the reality.</P>
      <P>I read a report of the interview given by Deputy Spring.  It is incorrect to say that the matter is stalled.  In the same week there was finality on the Agreement at Westminster, there was movement on the legislation dealing with human rights, the release of prisoners, important meetings of the Patten commission and the British Prime Minister visited here.  Removing one line is not always the best thing to do as it can lead to misrepresentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree a possible or likely way out of the current impasse would be for the Ulster Unionist Party to agree to a hypothetical agreement, the hypothesis being that there is an acceptable level of disarmament?</P>
      <P>In that hypothetical agreement they would also agree to a ten member executive which would allow two places for Sinn Féin, and two implementation bodies.  Perhaps that approach of agreeing a hypothesis which would be brought into effect by disarmament may be the way out of the current impasse, rather than not concluding any agreement, even in hypothetical form, because the disarmament issue has not been settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is four weeks from yesterday since we had the round table meetings in Stormont. We have been endeavouring to conclude all of the matters involving the executive which strictly is not my domain.  However, it is important to discuss the numbers in the executive, the departmental structure, the remit of the implementation bodies, their content, terms and as much detail as we possibly can.  I am anxious we complete the discussion of as much detail as possible so we do not encounter further difficulties when we try to move from implementation bodies to the working of North-South ministerial bodies.  It is important we have clarity on these issues which is why we are taking more time than would otherwise be necessary, though that is the only reason for the delay on our side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have to try to agree the areas of co-operation as regards the North-South ministerial bodies.  It is clear that if we do not achieve finality on these issues prior to Christmas we will create enormous difficulties for ourselves.  I have emphasised that and persuaded people that is the <Col N="939" /> case in recent weeks.  I hope these matters will be resolved prior to Christmas, if they are not we will have made a terrible mistake.  If we can resolve them, it will not move the other issue on but it will bring it into focus and remove the problem to which I referred earlier &mdash; it has not been within my call in trying to deal with the other issue to be able to say that that position exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that he will only get all the parties to agree to a hypothetical arrangement as regards North-South bodies and the executive if they are convinced that if that is done by the end of this year, in January there will be no attempt to fudge the decommissioning issue, but that it will be dealt with honestly and there will be no attempt to say it does not matter or that some verbal formula will be found?  Decommissioning must be dealt with in the same detail as the executive arrangements. It cannot be shunted aside by the endless ransacking of the dictionary to find evasive words to cover up a lack of political will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether we can reach agreement without achieving finality on the issue of decommissioning.  Perhaps we can achieve finality on the basis that we will make progress on it.  The issue will not go away &mdash; it has not gone away since 7 March, 1995 and it will not go away now.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amount of progress that has been made on this issue but I would like to discuss it at greater length outside Question Time.  Did the Taoiseach raise a matter to which he referred as a &ldquo;fight against crime&rdquo;, a crime which relates to the discharges from Sellafield, with the Prime Minister?  The levels in the Irish Sea are now shown to be higher than those which would result from a nuclear disaster.  Was that raised as a matter of common concern and will the Taoiseach continue to raise it, particularly the expansion of MOX which awaits the granting of a licence from the British Government?  Is that matter on the agenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  I raised it when I met the Prime Minister last Thursday as I always do, except when we are only discussing matters relating to Northern Ireland.  I raised the extension and licensing of the MOX plant and strongly stated our views on the issue.</P>

Did that matter arise within his discussions with the Prime Minister?  Will he indicate if he has any concerns with regard to the reference by the Prime Minister in his speech here that he looks forward to a closer alignment between Ireland and Britain within the European Union?

      <P>Does the Taoiseach share my concern at the growing evidence that confrontations are being engineered with the RUC in a number of places in the North.  underlining what is already obvious to everyone, that there is a difficulty with acceptance of the RUC?  Four years after a commitment was given by the Republican movement in relation to the disappeared, does the Taoiseach have any progress to report on that matter?</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 37 and 304 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A final decision on the availability of EU funding for the Spencer Dock Conference Centre proposal will be forthcoming on completion, expected shortly, by the Commission of its investigation <Col N="942" /> into a complaint about the tender procedures. Location was one of a number of elements examined in the independent cost benefit analysis, which concluded in favour of the proposal and which accompanied the application to the Commission for EU funding approval.  In the event of a grant offer to Spencer Dock, such an offer will of course be subject to planning approval in accordance with procedures laid down in statute.</P>
    <P>In the context, I would echo the comments made recently by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, to the effect that the promoters and relevant planning authorities should work together to secure implementation of the project.  He has also stated that he is satisfied that the Dublin Dockland Development Authority is committed to the concept of a major conference centre for the area, while acknowledging that it has particular statutory obligations to fulfil.  I note that the promoters have expressed confidence that the centre can be constructed within the framework of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, and I look forward to their working closely with the DDDA towards achieving that objective.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister been in contact with both bodies, that is the Spencer Dock development company and the DDDA, in relation to the reported dispute as reported in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> on 8 November?  Has that problem, which has the potential to torpedo the project, been resolved to his satisfaction?  Has he had hands-on involvement in resolving what is potentially a disastrous dispute between both bodies?  Will he respond to the recent reported statement of one of the senior executives of the Spencer Dock Development Company that not one single development will take place unless there is a major change of attitude by the DDDA?</P>

It was my duty to make sure that this project was brought through the successful tender procedure, brought through Cabinet and brought forward to the EU Commission.  The Government has clearly indicated that it is in favour of this project.  It went through Cabinet and it is currently with the EU Commission.  The other matter is one entirely for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the relevant parties involved.</P>

Surely somebody in Government must be investigating the claim made by Spencer Dock <Col N="943" /> Development Company that a £50 million payment was being sought by the authority in order to accede to a planning application.</P>

The Government has continuously expressed its commitment to the building of a national conference centre and we will continue to do that at various levels of Government.  At present the matter is with the statutory bodies and the consortium involved.  The question asked whether I am satisfied that the time criteria for funding set by the EU will be met in view of the ongoing dispute.  It is our position that they will meet the time criteria for funding set by the EU in view of the ongoing dispute.  I am quite confident we will meet the time criteria about which the Deputy is concerned.  That is my only consideration in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Creatine is an amino acid found in meat and fish and helps to boost energy levels in the body.  The product is regarded as a food supplement and is available over the counter in many chemists shops.  Recent reports on the use of creatine and possible side effects have been varied.  As I said on a previous occasion, I would be wary of the use of creatine and would strongly advise against taking it as a performance enhancing substance.</P>
      <P>Despite concerns over its use, creatine is not, as far as I am aware, included in the list of banned substances of any international sports federation or the International Olympic Committee.  The IOC is, I understand, currently investigating the product.  As lists of banned substances may vary from sport to sport, the decision to ban creatine as a performance enhancing substance is a matter, in the first instance, for each national and international governing body of sport in the context of the operation of their doping control programmes.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Department of Health and Children that as creatine is not considered a drug, there is no legal basis for having it listed as a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  However, I am further advised that in the light of reports of the abuse potential of creatine, particularly with regard to high performance sport, the Department of Health and Children, in consultation with the Irish Medicines Board, will examine information on this substance to see whether products containing it should be classed as medicines and subject to prescription controls.</P>
      <P>Sporting performance, ideally, should be based on natural ability, sound training techniques and application.  I have consistently expressed my deep concern with regard to the use of all performance enhancing drugs within sport.  As a doctor, I would also be concerned about the possible misuse of food supplements and other health products in that such misuse may have adverse health effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to the introduction of the National Sports Anti-Doping Programme.  The programme will be operated under the auspices of the Irish Sports Council when the council is set up on statutory basis and, as Deputies will be aware, the Sports Council Bill is going through Second Stage in the Dáil at present.  All recognised national governing bodies of sport have been circularised with the programme details and will be involved in consultation with the Irish Sports Council on the operational aspects of the programme.  Its provisions go beyond testing, to incorporate assisting in the education of our young athletes on the dangers inherent in drug taking.  While the programme will be voluntary in nature, public funding will be withheld from any national governing body of sport or individual athlete who opts out of participation in the programme <Col N="945" /> or, if participating, breach any element of the rules governing its operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister on the misuse of food supplements.  Has he communicated his concern and that expressed by Members about creatine to the International Olympics Committee?  Has he actively sought to have it added to the list of banned substances?  Has he, in accordance with the commitment he gave on 21 October at Question Time, communicated with the Minister for Education and Science on the dangers attached to this substance?  Has he asked the Minister for Education and Science to contact all schools to acquaint them with the undesirability of the use of this substance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to a previous report in this House with which all Deputies agreed on these substances, a loud and clear message went out that there was a problem with this substance and other supplements in the health area, such as vitamins and other substances.  It is a matter which has been communicated through the Dáil but it has not been communicated specifically to the Minister for Education and Science as regards schools.  The dangers of this drug have been widely profiled.</P>
      <P>We are trying to see if creatine can be added to the list and if it is possible to get information on it.  We have been in contact with the Department of Health and Children to see if we can get more information on the adverse effect of this drug and if it may be added to the list of banned substances.  That will be a matter for the Department of Health and Children.  I also point out to the Deputy that it is up to national and international federations to put substances on their banned lists and more and more are being added to those lists.  Unfortunately, this substance has not been added as yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy in that this matter has been discussed and the area of drugs in sport has a profile which it never had before thanks to Deputies such as Deputy Upton raising the issue and to it being raised at different conferences.  We had a conference in Dublin Castle last Saturday attended by the health boards, the Garda and all the national governing bodies of sport at which the matter was raised.  I agree it must be continuously raised, particularly in schools.  Creatine, a powder, was being liberally taken in schools for a variety of purposes.  I point out that there is a medical condition called hypervitaminosis <Col N="946" /> caused by somebody taking too many vitamins.  There should be more education regarding the use of such substances because simple substances may cause harm.</P>

      <Quest>the number of national sporting federations which have introduced a system of sanctions or penalties against their athletes who are proven to have used performance enhancing drugs or substances.</Quest>

      <P>While I do not have up to date details of the number of national governing bodies of sports which have systems of sanctions or penalties against athletes who are proven to have used performance enhancing drugs or substances requested by the Deputy, the position varies significantly from body to body and also relates to whether the relevant international governing body has specified appropriate arrangements.</P>
      <P>That situation was one of the reasons which prompted me, on assuming office, to prioritise the proper action and launch of Ireland's first National Sports Anti-Doping Programme, details of which were announced by me last summer. Details of the programme have already been circulated to all the national governing bodies of sport and discussions have commenced between representatives of the national governing bodies and the Irish Sports Council with a view to bringing the programme into effect when the council is established on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, national governing bodies of sport are required to actively co-operate with the Irish Sports Council in the fostering and maintenance of an anti-doping culture within Irish sport through, for example: adopting standard anti-doping provisions in their constitutions, to be agreed in conjunction with the Irish Sports Council.  The agreed provisions will be so drafted as to facilitate developments in non-urine based anti-doping techniques and the possible subsequent application of associated tests subject to agreed relevant standards and protocols being in place; having clear operating systems in place for dealing with testing and the results of tests and applying sanctions in accordance with their own rules and regulations, to any athlete or player found in breach of anti-doping regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is incredible that while he is talking about criminalising drug takers in sport and new revolutionary blood analysis techniques, we are not getting the basics right?  Does the Minister agree the basic system should be a urine analysis system, as is in operation throughout the world?  The Minister is two years in office, yet he has still not introduced it. Will there be any testing this year?  Will the money allocated for the drug testing programme this year be spent?  According to the Estimates, it will not be?  It is incredible that three years after <Col N="947" /> the Department asked the 78 federations to include a system of sanctions in their constitutions, the Minister does not know which federations responded to this request.  He must agree that without sanctions there is no deterrent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 35 of the 75 national governing bodies I approached have replied to us about sanctions.  Unfortunately, as this is an entirely new area, there are inconsistencies in the sanctions introduced.  I want to ensure that all the governing bodies introduce consistent sanctions which are severe and with which they agree.</P>
      <P>There would not be an anti-doping programme if we had not brought it forward.  I have received funding for this programme which will start at the beginning of the year.  We will carry out 600 tests throughout next year and only after those tests have been completed, will we have an indication of the prevalence of doping in sport.  The budget has been put in place and systems will be available where random tests will be taken throughout the country, whether it is at a Gaelic football or boxing match or at a training ground or swimming pool.  Two vehicles will patrol the country next year and resources have already been allocated for 600 tests.</P>

It was impossible for the Government to issue an unconditional guarantee that it would undertake to underwrite any debts arising from holding the world games.</P>
      <P>With the approval of the Minister for Finance and the agreement of the Government, I wrote to Special Olympics Ireland on 20 November last to inform it that to enable the games organising committee step up the momentum of its fund raising efforts and to leverage financial backing on the scale required from other sources by the end of 1999, the allocation for the games in the 1999 Estimates would be increased from £250,000 as provided in the Abridged Book of Estimates, to £2.5 million, which represents 50 per cent of the total grant approved towards the cost of organising the 2003 games in Ireland, and that the new allocation will be published in the revised Estimates volume for 1999.

The necessary documentation has already been submitted by Castleview F.C and Temple United F.C. and grants of £30,000 each were paid to them in August and September 1997 respectively.</P>
      <P>As regards the grants allocated to St. Vincent's and Na Piarsiag GAA Clubs, I understand the work in question has not yet commenced on these projects.  The grants will be paid as soon as the necessary documentation is submitted and found to be in order.  I am happy to tell the Deputy that approval, in principle, has since been given to a further contribution to the project to enable it to be completed, pending further clarification on matters such as terms and conditions of payment, draw down arrangements, etc.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is a shame that 18 months after the project was first sanctioned and £350,000 was given by the Department work has not commenced on some of the key areas of the project because money was transferred from Cork to Dublin in July 1997 which resulted in an escalation of the cost of the project?  Does he agree that the long delay and escalating costs are shameful in view of the revelation today that £5 million under subhead D4 of the Department's Estimates, which is allocated to local drug task forces, will not be spent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has agreed to the commissioning of a feasibility study for the development of a national stadium and to the establishment of a stadium steering committee to conduct the study and make recommendations based on its findings.  I have not met the GAA to discuss possible uses of Croke Park as a multi-functional national stadium.  However, the Government's concept for the stadium is for a state-of-the-art facility capable of accommodating all key sports played on the island, including Gaelic games, and the GAA is, accordingly, represented on the steering committee, where it will have full opportunity to make its views on the matter known.</P>
      <P>The feasibility study will address the issues necessary for the Government to make an early decision on all aspects of a new stadium.  The steering committee is chaired by Mr. Derek Keogh, former chief executive of Aer Rianta, and includes representatives of other major sporting organisations, including the FAI and the IRFU, as well as representatives from the private sector and a number of Departments.  The committee will welcome inputs from all interested sporting bodies.  It is the Government's clear intention that the proposed stadium will cater for as many uses as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A process to select experts to carry out the feasibility study is under way and it is expected that the finalised study will be available for detailed consideration by the Government by mid-1999.  No decision has yet been taken by <Col N="952" /> Government on whether the study will eventually be published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be reasonable to mention the unmentionable and grasp the nettle as regards Croke Park?  Taking into consideration the rights of the GAA and its investment in Croke Park, surely it would make common sense to hold realistic discussions with the authorities in Croke Park about the future use of the stadium?  Surely Croke Park should be considered as a multi-functional stadium at a time when the Government has set up a group to assess the feasibility of another stadium?  At a time when sports facilities are crying out for investment, surely there should be mature discussions on a common sense approach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>URBAN is a Community initiative of the European Commission under which assistance is made available for integrated development programmes for a limited number of geographically defined deprived urban areas throughout the EU.  The Operational Programme for URBAN in Ireland has total funding of about £21 million over the period 1994-9 and operates in three areas: north Dublin, Ballymun, Finglas and Darndale; south Dublin, west Tallaght and north Clondalkin; and the northside of Cork city.</P>
      <P>Although the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals do not contemplate the continuance of the URBAN initiative after 1999 the Government has decided that Ireland should avail of every opportunity presented at EU fora to press for the retention of the URBAN initiative.</P>
      <P>Concern has already been expressed on behalf of the Government at the structural actions group in Brussels that the type of schemes and projects assisted by URBAN in this round should not be neglected in the event that URBAN is not renewed.  In response, the Commission has said the type of scheme and project now assisted by URBAN could also be assisted from within the general scope of the European Regional Development Fund and the ESF post-1999.</P>
      <P>Whatever the position with regard to the URBAN programme post-1999, the Government has indicated that it will not be deflected from its commitment to tackle social exclusion in deprived urban areas.  In relation to those programmes in the area of social exclusion which are eligible for EU co&mdash;financing under the current round, the Government has indicated that it will, within the overall parameters of EU and other funding available post-1999, ensure that the objectives of these programmes remain a priority.</P>

I asked him if he would give a commitment that the URBAN programme will be continued by the Government after 1999 if the European Commission does not renew it. This is especially important given the Government's proposal to split the country into two artificial economic areas resulting in areas such as Darndale, Ballymun, Coolock and north Cork being able to offer only 20 per cent grants for capital investment compared with 57 per cent in other areas.

      <P>The Government has shown itself to be committed to dealing with the problem of disadvantaged urban areas and will continue to do so.  Dealing with the problem will be part of the national development plan after 1999 and is also an integral part of my Department's local development plan being compiled for the period after 1999.  To suggest the Government is not committed to blackspot areas or areas of disadvantage is inaccurate.  The URBAN programme is a community initiative which has nothing to do with regional status.  The Government is committed to tackling urban blackspots and will continue to do so.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which Ireland rates in international terms as a tourist destination; and the steps, if any, taken to improve our status in this regard.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is rated highly as a tourist destination by overseas visitors.  A survey of non-Irish holidaymakers to Ireland conducted by Bord Fáilte in 1997 found that Ireland rated highly in terms of the quality of the scenery, the friendliness and hospitality of the people, the relaxed pace of life and the natural, unspoilt environment.  These results are underlined by the fact that tourism growth between 1990 and 1997 <Col N="959" /> was substantially higher than the average achieved by world tourism, especially European tourism.  In that period, Ireland returned annual average growth rates of 7 per cent per annum for overseas visitor arrivals and 10 per cent for visitor receipts, compared with annual average increases of 4 per cent and 7 per cent respectively for world tourism arrivals and receipts and 4 per cent and 6 per cent for European.</P>
      <P>The potential for continued tourism growth remains strong provided a balance is maintained between the key drivers of quality, quantity and price.  Assuming investment in tourism is correctly targeted, Bord Fáilte predicts average growth of 6 per cent per annum for tourist numbers and 9 per cent for revenue can be achieved between now and 2003.</P>
      <P>Maintaining our positive image as an international tourist destination also requires that we protect and enhance those attributes for which we are highly rated and that we act to improve on certain areas where Ireland's image is not secure. Preserving the quality of our natural environment is fundamental to Ireland's appeal, while improvements in product quality, continuing investment in road and signposting and a commitment to ensuring good value for money are also critical.  Improvements in the area of customer service will play an essential part in maintaining our reputation for hospitality.</P>

      <P>We are perhaps too inward looking in the development of tourism policies. Is there an international league table of countries heavily dependent on tourism?  Are there any criteria for being in the premier league?  How do we rate in international terms?  Is there anything we can learn from studying the policies of other countries which have been successful in developing their tourism industries?</P>

      <P>The WTTC rates us at the top of the European league.  Our figures for visitor numbers and growth are higher than any other European country.  The WTTC reckons that the only country with which we will compete in future is China.  Our figures are comparable to China's.</P>
      <P>Regarding our positive attributes, figures show that 63 per cent of those questioned said their holidays here matched their expectations and 31 per cent said they exceeded them.  They said our main attribute is our people who they described as friendly, humorous and kind, next is our scenery, next the quality of our history and culture and then our relaxed pace of life.  They said the negative aspects of holidaying here are that it is expensive to do so, that there is poor road signage and we have bad weather.</P>

There is a question on today's Order Paper seeking detailed information about the state of the hospital waiting lists.  The Government has that information available to it.  Traditionally the answer to written questions was made available to Members by 4.30 p.m. but it has become a practice of the Department of Health and Children that Members do not now receive replies to their questions until 7 p.m. I seek the Taoiseach's assurance that the reply to Question No. 236 to which I am entitled will be made available by 4.30 p.m. so that we can deal with the current position <Col N="963" /> of hospital waiting lists and not that which pertained last June in the debate on the Government Supplementary Estimate to determine the priorities for the additional spending.

      <P>On a point of order, are there any guidelines for Departments, such as the Department of Health and Children, as to when the General Office should have copies of replies to parliamentary questions available for Members?  Is it acceptable that the Department of Health and Children should provide this information, for example, on waiting lists, at 7 o'clock this evening, when it will be too late to be of use to Members in the debate?  Unlike the Taoiseach, who claims he does not have authority in this matter, can the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who does have such authority, ensure that this information is supplied to Members for the debate?</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a matter that was raised a week ago by Deputy Quinn.  It concerns the parliamentary timetable for the legislation to set up the implementing bodies under the British-Irish Agreement.  Clearly, there will be a problem with the parliamentary timetable if this matter is not agreed.  Will the Taoiseach indicate his estimate of the length of parliamentary time that will be needed for the legislation on the implementing bodies, so that all the legislation will be passed in this House and the institutions can go live in February, as planned?  How many parliamentary days does the Taoiseach believe will be necessary for the purpose and is there any possibility that this legislation could be passed on a contingency basis, even if the decommissioning issue has not been finally sorted out, so that the legislation can take effect?  In that way, we will not have all night sittings for three or four consecutive days to get the legislation through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Hopefully, parliamentary time will not be our difficulty.  If we could complete matters we could begin working on the arrangements. A number of issues have to be put forward and I provided a list of these some time ago.  If we could reach the stage of getting the implementation bodies agreed, then hopefully the heads of the human rights legislation could be circulated to Departments.  I told Deputy McManus that the matter would go a committee in about a fortnight's time &mdash; certainly before Christmas.  The legislation will be ready directly after Christmas. The Equal Status Bill is in preparation, as is the legislation to amend the Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  There are other matters, not all of which would be required at the same time. However, the legislation concerning the implementation bodies will have to be worked on during January and into February.  It will certainly be tight in the present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a problem in that the legislation has to be introduced in this House in plenary session before it can be debated by a committee?  When is the Taoiseach likely to introduce the legislation for the implementing bodies?  Is it not the case that, if we do not get agreement before Christmas, it will be some time in mid-January before this legislation can be introduced?  Is legislation for the implementing bodies available in draft form, which can simply be introduced with a few minor amendments to take account of the final agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, obviously it is not because we have not even agreed what they are.  That will not be ready in January.  All of January will be required to deal with that.  My comment about the committee of the House was in relation to the human rights legislation where I gave a commitment that, as soon as the heads were ready, they would be discussed in committee prior to Christmas so that a Bill could be drafted in January.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be helpful in relation to this matter.  The British-Irish Agreement belongs to all parties in this House and to the 95 per cent of the electorate in the Republic who voted for it.  Will the Taoiseach not agree with my observation that the legislative programme required from this House to enable the process to go live on 1 February is now seriously out of line?  By the Taoiseach's own admission, the human rights commission legislation, which is relatively straightforward, will not be available until early in the new year.  He has slightly changed what he said on a previous occasion, when he said the heads would be circulated to the Departments.  He indicated previously that the heads were coming to Government, which would have implied in the normal convention that they had already gone to various Departments.  Be that as it may, may I formally propose that the Taoiseach brief party leaders and give us, and the Whips, a clear indication of the legislative programme required in relation to making the British-Irish Agreement work?  We should get agreement specifically about the legislation that is required.  In that way, the Taoiseach will get the co-operation that is available to him from the House in order to make this happen.  The last thing we want is to be on our feet at three minutes to midnight in late night sittings, drawing to the Taoiseach's attention defects in legislation that will have been cobbled together because of lack of time.  I make this suggestion specifically in relation to the implementing bodies.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible, although I do not know, that the legislation could be drafted and circulated and that the schedule, which would incorporate the agreed bodies &mdash; which have clearly not yet been agreed &mdash; could be attached.  That may be one possibility.</P>

After this week, there remain only two weeks until the end of the current session.  I understand that we will not be returning until close to the end of January.  This means that the amount of parliamentary time available for passing critical legislation in relation to the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement will be limited.  It is a matter of urgency that this House gets its business organised in such a way as to ensure that, at the very least, it is not <Col N="967" /> at fault in delaying the implementation of the agreement.  The Agreement has the support of everybody in the House.  Virtually everybody had a hand in negotiating it and 95 per cent of the people supported it.  Therefore, it is critical that we get our act together.</P>

As regards the other legislation that is not part of the implementation bodies, work is ongoing.  I will ask the Government Whip to brief the Opposition and get agreement on the timespan required to allow these matters to be dealt with.  All matters mentioned in the Agreement do not have to go through at the one time.  It really concerns the implementation bodies so that the North-South Ministerial Council &mdash; which should be meeting in shadow form at this stage, but is not for other reasons &mdash; is allowed to continue with its work.

Last week a house in the Taoiseach's constituency, originally lived in by James Joyce, was demolished.  It could not be listed because literary association does not make buildings eligible for listing as heritage buildings.  Will the Taoiseach look at that question in the context of the forthcoming Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter is one which I sought to raise on the Adjournment but it was not selected, <Col N="968" /> which I accept.  It relates to the apparently malicious rumours circulating in respect of a former Taoiseach about his involvement as a fundraiser for the National Gallery.  Under the National Institutions Bill, with which everybody is concerned, will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to make a statement to clear up this matter?</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to bring the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Health and Children before the House.  The gross additional requirement is for £90,049,000.

      <P>When I spoke in the House last week, I set out the basis on which the Government wishes to develop and progress the provision of health services. Progress continues to be made on achieving the priority objectives of both the health strategy and the Programme for Government.  Moving this Estimate underpins the Government's commitment to moving forward with this strategy.</P>
      <P>Last week I met the health boards and the major voluntary hospitals to outline to them my approach to service provision, development, funding and accountability.

      <P>Service plans were to reflect appropriate service delivery within this agreed funding.  While the 1998 funding reflected a significant increase, it was clear to those managing the services that strict control would be required to achieve this objective.  Despite this significant additional supplementary funding, I continue to require agencies to achieve delivery of service plans as agreed.</P>
      <P>However, I agreed with the Minister for Finance that certain items, where individuals have a statutory right to recoupment of expenditure outlined and in respect of certain pay related issues, would be treated in a special way.  This arrangement does not invalidate the requirement to deliver on the service plan as required by the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act.</P>
      <P>The major element of this Supplementary Estimate is in respect of these special issues.  There are other elements of this demand, although small, which relate to health safety issues and funding for once-of relief for deserving sectors of our services in line with initiatives taken by Government last year.</P>
      <P>During 1998 I sought to ensure that available resources are distributed as objectively as possible, consistent with real needs and have not allowed the agenda to be dominated by those who are best placed to make the loudest noises about their needs.  The Irish health service has been acknowledged by the OECD as an efficient, well organised service.  The service plans produced annually by each agency are evidence of this.</P>
      <P>The additional moneys sought in this Supplementary Estimate are necessary to fund adequately a number of items within the health service which have given rise to additional expenditure which was unforeseen or could not be computed accurately when the original Estimate was passed by the House.  The document circulated to Deputies gives the background to this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>I intend to cover a number of the main areas but I cannot, within the time at my disposal, go through all issues in much detail.  Broadly, the items in the Supplementary Estimate are items where there is an inevitable degree of uncertainty in forecasting the actual costs in any one year and, consequently, the original Estimates did not provide fully for these costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the delay in circulating the script and the Supplementary Estimate. There was a technical problem in the Department of which I was unaware until just before I came into the House.  The script will be available soon. It is not a matter over which I have direct control and its non-availability is not my fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreed practice has been to seek supplementary funding in these areas when the amount needed becomes apparent during the year.  The items recognised by the Department of Finance as falling within this category are medical indemnity insurance, superannuation costs, PRSI costs and demand led schemes, which consist of <Col N="975" /> the community drugs schemes and certain capitation payments such as the domiciliary care allowance.  Expenditure on these items is influenced by a number of factors which are difficult to predict in advance.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the community drug schemes is a factor of the number and cost of claims under these schemes which, again, is difficult to predict in advance.  There is a statutory right to relief for expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of the expenditure thresholds which are laid down.</P>
    <P>There is an additional requirement for £30 million in respect of these schemes.  Some £9 million of this refers to a shortfall in expenditure in 1997 and £21 million is related to additional expenditure on these schemes in 1998.</P>
    <P>The increase in expenditure under the community drugs scheme arises in the main from an increase in the number of persons claiming under these schemes and also an increase in the cost of medicines due to the prescribing of newer, more expensive drugs which has been a feature of prescribing trends in recent years.  Developments in drug therapies throughout the developed world has increased pressure on the State to fund such therapies.  Arising from these developments, many patients can now be treated in their homes rather than on an institutional basis, life expectancy for others has been increased and drugs have been developed which can give comfort and improve quality of life where no such improvement was previously thought possible.</P>
    <P>Drugs for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, for example, figure prominently in the list of drugs of significant cost both in the GMS and the community drugs schemes, as do drugs for the treatment of asthma and cardiovascular disease. Substitution of newer and, in almost all instances, more expensive forms of medication for older treatments is, therefore, a significant contributory factor in increasing expenditure on drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>I turn now to changes I am proposing in the community drugs schemes with effect from 1 March next.  First, the existing drugs cost subsidisation and drugs refund schemes will be merged into one new drugs payments scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per family unit. Second, a common drugs-medicines list for all schemes will be introduced.  This list will essentially be the current list of items reimbursable under the general medical services scheme.  Third, in tandem with these changes, a common prescription form for all schemes will be introduced. The primary aim of the new drugs payment scheme is to bring about important improvements and equity in the existing schemes.</P>
    <P>The new family scheme will have significant advantages over the existing drugs refund scheme.  Under the drugs refund scheme, families pay the full cost of their prescription medicines and may, at the end of the quarter, claim reimbursement from their health board, of expenditure <Col N="976" /> over £90 in that calendar quarter.  Many families have heavy expenditure on drugs and medicines in a quarter and have to wait a further six weeks from the end of that quarter before they receive a refund.  In effect, they may have to wait up to four and a half months and be incurring expenditure in the next quarter before they receive a refund.  In 1997 more than 110,000 claims under the drugs refund scheme were in excess of £150 per quarter.  Of these approximately 33,000 were for £300 or more per quarter or almost £80 per month.  This can cause considerable cashflow problems for a significant number of families.  This will not happen under the new drugs payment scheme.  From 1 March next no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per month for prescribed medicines.  It means that, for the first time, families will be able to budget for the cost of medicines.  Families will know that, whatever the size of their drugs bill, whatever unexpected illness might befall them, they will not have to pay more than £42 per month.  There are families where, although one member may qualify for a drug cost subsidisation scheme card, combined expenditure on medicines by other members, which can be considerable, cannot be recouped until the end of the quarter. With the new drugs payment scheme, no family will have to pay more than £42 in any month for prescribed medicines.  The new scheme will be of significant benefit to such families.</P>
    <P>That the drugs payment scheme will operate on a monthly basis has distinct advantages over the drugs refund scheme.  Under the refund scheme, a family could, for example, in one month have expenditure of, say, £80 but no expenditure in the other two months.  They would have not have been entitled to a refund.  Under the new scheme, they will have to pay only £42 in that month.</P>
    <P>The new drugs payment scheme is for everyone. To qualify under the old drug cost subsidisation scheme, patients had to be certified by their doctor as suffering from a condition requiring ongoing expenditure on medicines in excess of £32 per month.  There are no qualifying criteria for the new scheme.  Where expenditure by a family exceeds £42 per month, the balance will be met by the State.</P>
    <P>There has been no increase in the threshold for existing schemes since 1991.  It must also be borne in mind that the new threshold refers to family expenditure as opposed to the existing threshold in the drug cost subsidisation scheme which relates to individual expenditure.  The introduction of the common medicines list will ensure equity between the general medical services and the new drugs payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes.  It will not remove any essential prescribed medicines from the schemes.  The comprehensive range of the most modern therapies required to treat all conditions, which is available on the GMS, will continue to be paid for under the new scheme.  What is being removed is a <Col N="977" /> range of over the counter preparations that do not need a prescription from a doctor and are available in many instances in supermarkets and other retail outlets.  Examples of such products are some simple analgesics such as panadol, disprin, solpadeine, neurofen; vitamin supplements such as rubex, vivioptal, seven seas, royal jelly; and products for the treatment of baldness such as Regaine.  A range of analgesics is available on the GMS and these will continue to be paid for under both schemes.  It is seriously inequitable that the cost of these products is reimbursed to patients who may have significant means, whereas those with medical cards who constitute some of the least well off in society have to pay for them.  The introduction of a common prescription form is necessary to close the accountability chain between the prescriber, the dispenser and the end user.</P>
    <P>Increases in PRSI costs are related to the growth in the number of new entrants to the health services and the replacement of the old D rate with the new A rate.  Modified social insurance status does not apply to workers recruited into the public service after 6 April 1995.</P>
    <P>The additional superannuation costs for which funding is sought are due to the age profile of personnel in the health sector.  Agencies are experiencing an increasing number of retirements, including those opting for early retirement, and a consequent increase in the yearly budget provision is required.  A sum of £9 million in additional funding is required.</P>
    <P>An additional £500,000 is being provided to cover costs arising from the tribunal of inquiry into the BTSB and certain other legal fees.  The tribunal of inquiry costs are in respect of the legal costs of parties, associations and witnesses who were granted full or limited representation before the tribunal including, in some cases, the cost of judicial reviews.</P>
    <P>To date the compensation tribunal has made 1,042 awards.  The total amount of the awards made to date is £147 million.  A claimant to whom an award is made is entitled to the legal costs and expenses associated with the claim.  The average legal costs per claim amount to £22,000.  A sum of £85 million was provided in the original Vote in 1998 in respect of payments from the special account established under section 10 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Act, 1997, and £15 million in respect of payments from the reparation fund. A further sum of £4 million is being made available this year for payments from the special account established under section 10.</P>
    <P>Another important area which is being addressed in the Supplementary Estimate is child care.  The Supplementary Estimate includes provision for a sum of £1.625 million to defray the 1998 costs of a number of pilot projects which have been set up under the young people at risk programme established by the Government in January.  This initiative is being overseen by the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion.  This <Col N="978" /> funding is to be used for 12 family support projects, spread throughout the eight health board regions.</P>
    <P>The objective of the projects is to prevent at risk children and young people from engaging in various forms of anti-social behaviour by providing a pro-active response to the children and their families.  There are two key elements to this approach: the establishment of formal collaborative structures involving relevant State agencies, the voluntary sector and the local community; and the identification or establishment of a local centre which will act as a focal point for the delivery of services to young people and children. These pilot projects meet a need identified in Partnership 2000 in regard to tackling social exclusion.  I have no doubt these projects will make a significant contribution and I am pleased there will be a formal evaluation of them.  This will allow us, in time, to assess the effectiveness of the projects and to identify best practice in this area.</P>
    <P>The process of tackling the so-called Millennium bug is proceeding apace in health agencies and it is essential that the necessary remedial work is completed on time.  The overall project is turning out to be quite significant.  A sum of £5 million was originally earmarked for this in 1988 from my Department's capital budget, based on the best estimates made late last year.  This sum has proven insufficient and, although additional moneys have already been diverted to the year 2000 problem, at the expense of other developments in the technology area, there is still a need for this further expenditure of £1 million in 1998 to ensure the projects in health agencies proceed unhindered.  My Department is assembling a final estimate of the costs of dealing with the Millennium bug and the total figure is expected to be significant.</P>
    <P>The Government has also agreed to provide a package of funding to meet pressing needs in relation to new technologies to further improve the safety of the blood supply.  The BTSB is introducing these new technologies to ensure it meets the best international standards.</P>
    <P>One of the most pressing needs for people with physical and sensory disabilities is aids and appliances.  These include essential items such as artificial limbs and wheelchairs.  Waiting lists in this area can be a cause of great hardship for those affected.  For this reason, substantial additional funding to alleviate this hardship.  has been provided by the Government since it took office.  At the end of last year grants totalling £4.325 million were given to voluntary agencies providing services in this sector for aids, appliances and equipment for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  A further £1 million was made available to health boards this year for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>In spite of this substantial investment, it has been brought to my attention that health boards still have substantial waiting lists for aids and appliances.  I am determined to deal with this <Col N="979" /> issue and I am making a further grant of £4 million available to health boards this year.  This will help eliminate those waiting lists and provide some additional funding for much needed equipment such as wheelchair accessible transport to enable more people with disabilities to access services.</P>
    <P>A sum of £22.924 million is being sought to cover the cost to the health service in 1998 of the settlements in June and September with craftworkers and non-nursing personnel, respectively. This sum includes retrospection.  These settlements, which also relate to local authority craftworkers and general operatives, were concluded under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and represent a significant advance in flexibility and productivity which will translate into gains in efficiency and cost-effectiveness in health agencies.</P>
    <P>The original estimate of the cost of implementing the recommendations of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector was made when the review body's report No. 36 was published in December 1996.  By the time the revised contract, based on the review body's recommendations, was introduced in 1998 a number of factors pointed to a review of this estimate. The number of hospital consultants had increased from 1,100 to 1,300.  There was also a need for greater provision for locum cover and rest days. The new contract is significantly different in several respects from its predecessor and a more precise estimate of its ultimate cost can only be made on full implementation.  This heading will cost an additional £10 million in 1998.</P>
    <P>The original Estimate provided for the Department for 1998 included receipts of £239 million from health contributions.  It is now estimated that health contributions will contribute £282.5 million to the Department, an increase of £43.5 million.  It is normal practice that the Department of Finance calculates the original estimate of receipts due from this source when preparing its estimate of health needs.  A combination of the increased numbers in employment and pay rises have led to this significant amount being available.</P>
    <P>It is expected that receipts of £90 million will be received in 1998 under EU regulations on the social security of migrant workers.  This is against a projected £63 million.  The additional £27 million is being put towards the delivery of health services in 1998.  Taking health contributions and receipts under EU regulations together, there is an additional income of £70.5 million in excess of that contained in my Department's original Estimate.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate will add further to overall health expenditure and a budget day package to be announced tomorrow in regard to key areas of the services will add even further funding.  These figures clearly illustrate that we have ensured more than adequate resources are being applied to the health programmes.  The <Col N="980" /> increases already announced for 1999 over 1998 for non-capital expenditure and the increase for 1999 over the expected outturn for 1998 represents a figure of 9.5 per cent.  This figure will be further increases by the additional funding in tomorrow's budget.  It gives the lie to critics who have claimed that our health services are being under-funded.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister I have been conscious of the challenges which are faced in managing a system as complex and dynamic as the health services. Perhaps more than any other sector of the public services, health is influenced by constant technological innovation and new methods of service delivery.  There are undoubted benefits attaching to such developments but they are almost always invariably very costly.  The Supplementary Estimate before the House illustrates this point clearly.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate will greatly assist health agencies in meeting the additional costs they are experiencing and in addressing the need for immediate investment in key service areas. The funding being sought shows the real commitment of the Government to adequately fund the health service and accordingly I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely dissatisfied with the manner in which Members of the House have been treated.  We have not yet received copies of the Minister's script.  That is a completely inappropriate way to deal with a Health Estimate.  It is unfair to Opposition Deputies that matters are proceeding in this way.  I hope it is not a manner in which the Minister intends to deal with the House in the future.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's contribution on the Supplementary Estimate, which has undergone an extraordinary metamorphosis. Three weeks ago the Government Estimates were published.  It was indicated that a portion of the substantial windfall from the health levy would be spent by the Department of Health and Children while the remainder would be retained in the Government's coffers.  Arguments took place in the House and outside regarding the apparent retention by the Government of a sum estimated to be in excess of £32.5 million at time when hospital waiting lists are growing and when the Government itself has failed to meet its commitments to those with mental, physical and sensory handicaps in the context of commitments previously given and recommendations made in a variety of reports which are supported by Members on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following those arguments, two weeks ago the Minister distributed to Members of the Opposition a proposed Supplementary Estimate which it was requested should be taken in the House without debate.  That Supplementary Estimate envisaged diverting a large portion of the windfall from the health levy into a superannuation fund and provided for the allocation of an additional <Col N="981" /> £5.5 million in respect of health services.  Two weeks ago the Minister for Health and Children wanted the House to endorse, without debate, a Supplementary Estimate of £5.5 million.  That figure has grown to £19 million in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the funding which will be made available under the Supplementary Estimate has increased in respect of a number of areas, particularly in the context of the motion which will come before the House for debate this evening seeking to force the Government to meet not only its capital but also its revenue commitments to people suffering from disabilities.  We have forced the Government, in the context of this Supplementary Estimate, to make additional allocations.  The Supplementary Estimate published two weeks ago contained no additional moneys for the purchase of aids, appliances and other equipment for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  The Supplementary Estimate now before us does precisely that.  This proves that if Opposition parties can work in co-operation with each other to meet and address the needs of people whose needs are not being properly addressed and whose difficulties are not being provided for properly, we can force the Government to alter its priorities and change tack.</P>
    <P>I will not condemn the Minister for introducing this Supplementary Estimate and for changing his mind on two occasions during the past four weeks.  I merely wish to point out that when the</P>
    <P>Minister refers to the ordered financing of the Department of Health and Children and its long and medium&mdash;term planning in meeting health needs that does not reflect the reality of the manner in which he is dealing with his responsibilities in this House.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions during his contribution the Minister stated, in the context of the Supplementary Estimate and a number of other issues, that expenditure on certain items is difficult to predict.  He also stated, in another context in respect of another area, that inevitable difficulties in calculating expenditure arise.  However, it is extraordinary and scandalous that there is one area in respect of which the Minister is not willing to admit that inevitable difficulties in calculating required expenditure arise and in respect of which he is not willing to accept that, 12 months in advance, there are difficulties with regard to determining the needs of the men, women and children throughout the country who are dependent on the GMS, who require in-patient hospital treatment and who, having consulted their general practitioners and consultants, are discovered to be in need of a variety of different procedures to address a range of illnesses, some of which are life threatening, others of which are severely debilitating and diminish people's quality of life.  It is extraordinary that the Minister made no reference to the in-patient hospital waiting lists.  It is amazing that he did not believe this <Col N="982" /> matter required readjustment in the context of the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The waiting list figures have now become available, though I stress that these are not the figures an efficient Department should be in a position to make available . By 1 December, through the use of modern communications mechanisms, we should be able to gain access to the waiting list figures for 30 November.  Today, we have available to us the waiting list figures for 30 September. They show that from June to September, a period of three months, the numbers on the waiting lists grew by over 1,000.  There are now 35,405 people on the in-patient hospital waiting list as opposed to the 34,331 people who were on it at the end of June.  That represents an increase of 1,100 during a three month period.  I stated previously that the numbers of those on the waiting lists will approach 38,000 by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In the context of the 16,000 bed days being lost in December and also those lost in October and November by hospitals which have been obliged to implement cut-backs and cancel operations, it is inevitable that, when the waiting lists for the end of December become available &mdash; presumably in April &mdash; we will discover that the waiting list crisis is even worse than these figures show. In the context of the Minister being able to find, over a period of two weeks, an additional £14 million for inclusion in the Supplementary Estimate and of his knowing that 16,000 bed days will be lost in December, it would have been possible for him, with proper planning in his Department, to have allocated additional funding to particular hospitals to avoid bed and theatre closures in December.</P>
    <P>The figures are interesting.  The numbers on waiting lists at some of the hospitals which have been in the news grew between June and September. The number on the waiting list at University College Hospital, Galway, where a theatre will remain closed during December despite the best efforts of staff, grew from 2,891 to 3,517.  The number on the waiting list at Tullamore General Hospital, where the number of beds available will be reduced from 5 December, grew from 1,737 to 1,995.</P>
    <P>It is irrational and inefficient financially to reduce the numbers of beds available in December and to announce in the budget a waiting list initiative to apply from January to target particular specialties or hospitals to reduce the numbers on waiting lists.  Patients awaiting essential cardiac, orthopaedic or ear, nose and throat surgery should not have to suffer in this way.  This is an inhumane way of running the health service. There is a failure to take into account the impact on quality of life of health difficulties being experienced by those awaiting in-patient hospital care and the pressure that relations are under in caring for them.  Children have to miss school because relatively straightforward and simple ear, nose and throat procedures cannot be performed within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> The Minister referred to those who make loud noises and have a vested interest.  He appears to believe that he is engaged in trench warfare with the medical profession.  The people with whom he is engaged in trench warfare are ordinary men, women and children dependent on the General Medical Service awaiting admission to acute hospitals for essential treatment.  They are the people to whom he is saying this Christmas &ldquo;tough, we do not care about you&rdquo;.  Although he is willing to be flexible across a range of areas, when it comes to those awaiting in-patient hospital care he is not prepared during the course of the year to reassess requirements in particular areas and allocate additional funds.  That is not the way to run a health service in a country awash with money, to which many thousands have returned and in which there has been a huge increase in the workforce.</P>
    <P>This is a problem that every Deputy experiences in his or her day-to-day contact with constituents on hospital waiting lists.  Most Members are insured with the VHI or BUPA and have ready access to hospital care.  It is wrong that we should tolerate a two-tier in-patient hospital system which guarantees immediate access to those who can afford to pay.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>There is dramatic growth in the number awaiting in-patient gynaecological treatment.  In three months the number grew from 2,545 to 2,746.  There is the extraordinary number of 3,734 awaiting breast screening.  There are 1,719 on the waiting list in the Eastern Health Board area, some of whom will have to wait over 12 months for a mammograph.  This is not good enough at a time when the economy is booming.  It appears that the health problems of a section of the community are considered less important than the health problems of the wealthy.  That is not a system of health care over which we should stand.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced that an additional £4 million will be made available to health boards for the provision of appliances, aids and other equipments for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Additional moneys will also be made available to other health agencies for similar purposes. The Minister should clarify the amount involved and the agencies to which the additional funds will be made available.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister could not have planned this expenditure better.  Is he seriously suggesting that in the final three or four weeks of the year health boards will be in a position to spend £4 million to provide new appliances and equipment for people with a disability?  Will this money be placed in a trust fund?  When will it be spent?  When will those on waiting lists for a variety of equipment benefit?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the new drug payment scheme.  While some families will benefit, others will not.  Currently a family member in need of regular medication may recoup expenditure above the figure of £90 in a three month period. If that family member finds that in any one <Col N="984" /> month their expenditure falls before £42, they will recoup nothing.  That person on prescribed medication, when the Minister introduces this scheme to recoup moneys, will have to expend in excess of £126 in a three month period on medication instead of £90, as provided for at present.  That will lead to some families already in financial difficulty experiencing additional difficulty.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister is trying to put in place a scheme which will benefit some families and reform current schemes.  However, he should revise his proposal.  Individual patients who over a three month period are currently entitled to reclaim upwards of £36 will be excluded from this scheme.  In effect, the Minister, at a time when the country is awash with money and the Government is about to introduce tax cuts tomorrow, is proposing to introduce health cuts on the drug refund scheme, through the back door &mdash; health cuts as they apply to some families.</P>
    <P>I accept that selectively other families may benefit from this scheme.  Some families and individuals who currently can reclaim any moneys in excess of £90 spent on prescriptive medicines over a three month period will now be unable to reclaim any moneys over a three month period unless they spend in excess of £126.  That is not a reform, it is taking money away from people who require regular medication.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by referring to the year 2000 problem.  When I raised the matter earlier this year, the Minister reassured Members that all of the problems in the medical service, in his Department, hospitals and health agencies, were being monitored and addressed and they would not exist in 2000.  It seems the Minister is now moderating his language on that issue and hedging his bets.  It is a vital health issue and the Minister's duty to ensure that all hospital equipment and all health agencies utilising essential equipment are year 2000 compliant.  I hope as we enter the new millennium the Minister will be able to give the House a categorical assurance that no patients will be at risk from computer failures in any of our health agencies or hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my dissatisfaction with the manner in which Members of the Opposition have been treated in this debate.  We were not provided with a copy of the Estimate prior to the start of the debate, as we were promised.  The Minister had finished his speech ten minutes before a copy was circulated.  This makes it difficult for the Opposition to respond to announcements made by the Minister.  I would like an undertaking from him that the same type of cock-up will not recur in a health debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate before us is a housekeeping one at the end of the year and is somewhat unremarkable.  However, the difficulty is that we are in a remarkable situation at the moment, with a growing crisis across the health service.  We have a similarly remarkable situation today where the Government announced a £1.3 billion surplus.  We have a unique opportunity to <Col N="985" /> do something significant about the crisis in our health service and to provide the necessary funding to alleviate the enormous hardship which a huge percentage of our population is enduring because of the underfunding of our health service. It is regretted by all Members, in Opposition and Government, who are well aware of the difficulties in the health service, that the Minister has not availed of this opportunity to provide an additional injection of funding where it is greatly needed.</P>
    <P>I was surprised when I saw the draft Estimate today and compared it to the one circulated two weeks ago.  In the space of two weeks, the Minister has managed to come up with an additional £14 million.  I ask him to provide greater clarification on exactly where that additional money will be spent and why it was not deemed necessary two weeks ago.</P>
    <P>I was also surprised that pilot projects for children at risk are included in this Estimate.  I understood that initiative was to be funded from the young people's services and facilities fund.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether this fund is being part &mdash; funded by his Department and who is funding the rest of it.  I would like to comment on that initiative.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned on several occasions in this House, our child care services are in crisis.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, this crisis was recognised at an early stage.  He said there was a need to spend £100 million on our child care services immediately, not on a phased basis as he is saying now.  Eighty per cent of funding is being spent on the welfare and protection services and the area of prevention is grossly underfunded.</P>
    <P>Suddenly we heard an announcement about 12 family support projects.  I attended the launch of that initiative in my capacity as chairperson of the Eastern Health Board and being somewhat surprised that this had appeared out of nowhere.  It seemed to be a smokescreen for the fact that the services were so utterly underfunded.  The announcement was made with a great deal of publicity and the involvement of the Taoiseach. Yet, when I spoke to some senior health board officials on the day of the launch, no-one seemed to know what was envisaged.  It was an idea which seemed to have been cooked up overnight without being explained to anyone involved.  It had not been thought out fully, although the theory might have been all right.  The Minister must accept that at this point we need something far more comprehensive than pilot projects.  The child care service is in such an appalling state that pilot projects only scrape the surface.  We need a proper strategy to put sufficient funding in place.</P>
    <P>I was also surprised to hear the locations of those 12 family support projects.  By any yardstick, it is accepted by anyone working in the field that the highest concentration of child welfare problems is in the Dublin area, followed by the other main urban centres.  Child care is the biggest issue in the Eastern Health Board. <Col N="986" /> However, when the locations of the projects were announced, two were in the Eastern Health Board area, only one of which was in the Dublin region, in Cherry Orchard.</P>
    <P>As somebody who represents the northside of Dublin, I am very aware of the huge child care problems which exist in many of the communities across the northside.  I was flabbergasted at the complete exclusion of the northside and the fact that there was only one project on the other side of the city.  Perhaps the Minister, given that we are meant to agree this expenditure today, will give some justification for the location of those pilot projects.  I do not know if it is a coincidence, but it seems that most of the locations are based in the constituencies of various Cabinet Ministers. If this is the Minister's approach to child care, it leaves a lot to be desired.  If he is basing it on trying to give as many goodies to as many Ministers as possible, he has lost the whole point of it. If we have learnt anything over recent years it is that we must prioritise spending and put funding into the areas which are in greatest need.  I strongly object to the fact that these child care projects would seem to have been selected purely on political grounds, without any reference to where they were most needed.  It was quite a cynical exercise.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister does not think he can fob off the Opposition with additional money for appliances when of course the real need for people with physical and sensory disability is to provide ongoing Revenue funding year on year, as outlined in the recent reports in that area.</P>
    <P>I want to comment briefly on the announcement which the Minister made in relation to the community drugs.  While there is no doubt that some families will gain in a particular month in which there are high medical expenses, the point has already been made by Deputy Shatter that many people who have ongoing high medical expenses will lose out.  Where previously they could have claimed anything over £90 per quarter, it will now be amounts in excess of £126 per quarter.  The bills of people who are on the long-term illness scheme, where they currently pay the first £32 per month and everything above that is covered, will be increased from £32 to £42 per month.  The Minister might think that £10 is not a great deal of money but one must bear in mind the kind of people who usually qualify for the long-term illness scheme.  These are often elderly people who have chronic conditions and who may have an occupational pension which takes them above the already low income limit for medical card entitlement.  Those people will now find themselves having to spend an additional £10 per month.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind what £10 means to somebody in that situation.  It may not mean a great deal to those of us in this House.  However, £10 per month in additional health expenditure for those people represents half of the increase which they received in social welfare pensions last year &mdash; there was an increase of £5 per week.  We <Col N="987" /> are talking about taking back half of that increase by way of additional health expenditure.  In a time of plenty, it is unfair, bearing in mind that it is people on low incomes and by and large elderly people who suffer from illnesses who are caught in this situation.  The Minister will further penalise them by imposing an additional charge.</P>
    <P>My party and I are opposing this Estimate on the grounds that it is insufficient.  It does not go far enough.  It is a housekeeping Estimate with a few little extras thrown in.  The Minister should avail of this time of plenty and the huge additional money which is in the Government's coffers to deal with many of the outstanding problems in the health services.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister stated that last week he met with the chief executive officers of health boards and the voluntary hospitals to outline his approach to service provision, accountability and funding.  Perhaps he would enlighten Members of this House as to his approach.  It is difficult to know his approach given the fact that he has been sitting on the report of the Review Group on Waiting Lists since the middle of August.  He has refused on a number of occasions to publish that document or make it available to Opposition Members.  Perhaps he would use this opportunity to outline his approach.</P>
    <P>Time and time again over recent months when serious difficulties were coming to light in the health services the Minister referred to the accountability legislation.  I am not suggesting that the approach he should take is to bail out any health board or hospital.  Of course there must be accountability and health agencies must keep within budget.  However, I would maintain that the original allocation of the Minister is grossly inadequate.  It is not enough to meet the present health demands.  It is certainly not enough given the buoyancy in the economy.  One could spend ten times or 100 times the current budget on health services without too much difficulty but we as a nation must decide the level of health services which we can afford.</P>
    <P>This is why earlier in the year I suggested that the Minister look at the possibility of linking health expenditure to GDP.  We are now in a situation where expenditure on health is the fourth lowest in the EU.  There are two separate arguments. One is that there must be accountability and people must live within budgets, but the more fundamental argument concerns the level of health service we can afford.  Given the economic buoyancy, we can afford a far greater level of health service and a far better quality health service. If we do not ensure that people are given access to adequate health care at this time of plenty, when will we ever do it?  No doubt there will be hard times ahead.  If we are not able to look after the weakest members of society when there is money to spare, we will never look after them.  It is unacceptable in a so-called civilised society that we should have large numbers of people in the public health service who are being <Col N="988" /> failed by the service.  They are waiting and waiting and larger numbers of them are enduring ongoing suffering during that waiting period. Regrettably, many of them die while waiting.  Yet again I call on the Minister to publish the report of the review group.</P>
    <P>With regard to the waiting lists, the Minister does not seem to be expecting productivity from the health agencies.  He is expecting them to keep within budget but he does not seem to link funding to productivity.  Therefore, if a health board or a hospital is cost effective, meets all of its targets, is extremely productive and carries out more operations than it should, it does not get any credit for that in terms of funding.  If they have completed all their operations by October, it is too bad; they must cut back and they cannot do any more work until the end of the year.  That is a fundamental problem with the Minister's approach.  There is no reward in the system for agencies which are productive and cost effective and of course we should be trying to encourage that.  One of my concerns is that money which has been provided for the waiting list initiative seems to have been spent with no strings attached.</P>
    <P>We still find ourselves in the situation where we do not know the cost of different operations in different hospitals.  What value for money did the Minister get from the waiting list initiative?  Does he know?  Can he state specifically what operations were done?  Was the Mater Hospital better value than St. James's Hospital?  Does he know which hospital is the most cost effective?  Unless he knows these answers he will continue in a situation where money is vanishing into a black hole.</P>
    <P>The response to date on child care services, to which I referred earlier, has been completely inadequate.  We need to invest substantial amounts of money in improving the services, in putting in place the kind of prevention services which will stop problems arising later in life.  On a regular basis in my constituency clinic I see instances where a small amount of spending on family support work would head off problems which that family without that support will undoubtedly encounter in years to come.  Instead of doing that, it seems all the money is going into child welfare services, and we have no choice but to spend in that area.  It draws attention to the fact that so much more funding is needed in that area.  It would make much financial sense to put the investment into the area of child and family support to ensure children can stay on in school, stay living with their families, can be kept out of care and be given an equal opportunity in life &mdash; a chance to live a full life.  Regrettably, too many of our children do not have that chance.</P>
    <P>The transfer of funds from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Department of Health and Children would make much sense.  That principle of prevention does not seem to have been accepted at a senior level in either the Department of Health and Children or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="989" /> Reform.  Money spent during the early years in providing support to young people will be repaid many times over in terms of savings to the Exchequer in later years.</P>
    <P>Equally, there is a serious crisis in relation to services for the elderly.  There are currently 500 elderly people taking up acute hospital beds, receiving care which is completely inappropriate and who are in need of nursing home care.  In addition, we do not know the countless numbers of elderly people at home waiting for care.  The thrust of the approach to providing funding for nursing homes seems to be to free up hospital beds.  That is a very important element and more hospital beds would have been freed up by now if the Minister had acted when he should have done earlier in the year.  They would have been provided on a much more cost effective basis. Serious attention must be paid to the countless number of elderly people living in very difficult situations at home, with in-laws or others, and who need long-term care.  That is an area which needs a serious injection of money.</P>
    <P>I refer to the young chronic sick.  I have a constituent with multiple sclerosis who cannot do anything for herself and who has an 11 year old daughter.  She is number 45 on a waiting list for one of the Eastern Health Board units for the young chronic sick and has been told that usually two beds per year become available because of the nature of the patients.  That is simply not acceptable in a civilised society.  We need to provide appropriate levels of care to those who desperately need it.</P>
    <P>We oppose the Supplementary Estimate because the Minister has an opportunity to do something significant about the health services &mdash; the money is there and there is no excuse. Because the Minister is not taking the opportunity to do something this year, we cannot accept a promise tomorrow of something maybe next year &mdash; it is not enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the Whips meetings at which it was agreed this Supplementary Estimate would be taken.  I recall the Government Whip indicated that we could not take it last week, as we suggested, but that it would have to be taken this week.  I note that during that time the additional money found has gone up by £11 million.  Had we deferred this Supplementary Estimate to next week, would there have been even more money in the kitty?  It seems remarkable that additional money can be magicked out of nowhere to meet costs which I am sure are valid but which, if shown to the public, invariably would bring about the response that if it is possible for the Minister to pay bills and meet the shortfall in his Estimate, why in God's name can he not accept there are difficulties in forecasting at hospital level as well?  People find they cannot have procedures and operations which they desperately need because the Minister is taking a hard line for others and yet is able to magic <Col N="990" /> money from nowhere to balance the books for himself.</P>
      <P>I recognise the waiting list issue is one which may not be solved simply but requires a response which is real, serious and committed.  At the moment we do not have that but the same old secrecy for which this Minister is well known &mdash; inexplicably withholding information which would be an important part of finding a solution to deal with waiting lists.  Resources are being wasted and beds are being closed at a time when they should be kept open.  That is something which is inexplicable to the public.  Why are we wasting resources?  Why do we have the type of systems failure which is not being addressed by this Minister?  I accept his point that structural changes are required.</P>
      <P>I was given an example today of a public patient &mdash; this would not have happened had he been a private one &mdash; who went twice to one of the major acute hospitals in Dublin city and was seen by a very junior doctor who was clearly out of his depth.  The poor man was sent home twice although he had lumps on his back and was suffering considerable pain.  That man was not attended to by a properly qualified person at consultant level.  When he finally went, after I imagine considerable cost to the State and himself, to another hospital, he was diagnosed correctly and although he may have been incurable anyway, the poor man died.  That is the type of wastage which occurs in our acute hospital system because the right people are not seeing the patients, that is, suitably qualified specialists at senior enough level to make decisions and the diagnosis required.  The Minister, by lobbing this issue into a forum on manpower, is ducking the issue instead of dealing with it.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on the drugs refund scheme and drugs cost subsidisation scheme. Thanks are due to the medical journalist who was able to discover this issue ahead of time because I do not know when the Minister might have announced this otherwise.  He probably would have waited as he did last year to announce hospital cost increases when the budget was being announced so that people did not realise what was doing on.  He had the grace to come in and indicate to us that the journalist was right and that these costs will go up for people in relation to both of the drugs schemes.</P>
      <P>The community drugs schemes are a very good investment and keep people out of hospitals and in work.  They are productive and enabled to contribute instead of being dependent.  Let us not fool ourselves that somehow this is an insatiable demand.  This is good investment and it has a return.  That is an important point.  According to the Minister's figures, there have been 110,000 claims.  That is an enormous number of people and some will benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A friend of mine was a postman but had to leave his job because he had a cardiac condition. He will never be better and will have to stay on medication which costs him £100 per month.  He <Col N="991" /> is on the community drugs scheme which costs him £32 per month.  Under the Minister's scheme, no matter how he puts it, that man will pay £42. Is that not correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The specific scheme this man is on means that he contributes £90 over three months.  There may be delays as regards payment and I accept that streamlining the system and making it more efficient is a wonderful idea and that there should be one scheme only.  I have no problem with that but let us not dress it up as something other than it is.  What it is for thousands of people if the Minister's figure may be referred to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It will affect those on a ceiling of £32 per month.  There is no way around that.  I know speeches are dressed up to give the most positive spin on things.  The people who will be affected by this are those just above the medical card limit, which is low.  Most people on drug schemes are on medication for a long time.  The ceiling has been increased from £32 in one scheme and £90 over three months in another scheme to £42 per month.  That money must be taken out of people's pockets to pay for medication for conditions such as arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma or psychiatric disorders. We are talking about vulnerable people who should not be caught in the trap Deputy Shatter mentioned or have to pay more to keep themselves alive and well.</P>
      <P>There should be equality in terms of what drugs can be prescribed under the GMS and drugs schemes, but it should not be an equality of misery.  For example, gaviscon liquid, which was mentioned in the newspapers, has been excluded from the scheme.  As no equivalent treatment is available, a more expensive drug will probably be prescribed which will cost the State money.  We must look carefully at what is window dressing and what is real and at what is saving money and what is presented by the Minister as saving money.  The Minister is not a fool and I am sure he knows that reducing options for patients and not providing the same good care to which they are entitled in order to save money does not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child care was mentioned by previous speakers. Once the health boards are reorganised, I will be living in the only health board area in the country without a paediatric service or paediatrician. I accept that at present people go to Our <Col N="992" /> Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin or Tallaght hospital, but I am concerned about this issue.  I want to know how the Minister intends to address this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address two main issues &mdash; the acute hospital sector and my responsibilities in the child care sector.  The most telling case for the policy undertaken by the Minister for Health and Children is the litany of difficulties outlined by the previous speakers, particularly Deputy Shortall.  The strategy adopted by this Government for the development of the acute hospital sector is a comprehensive and coherent one.  One of its important aspects is the development of regional self-sufficiency, ensuring equity of access to services and redressing regional imbalances in the organisation of services which have developed over many years.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies said that fundamental changes must be made to the way our health services are run.  For the first time, the Minister is adopting significant initiatives to deal with the operation of our health services, particularly our waiting lists. Deputy Shortall said there must be value for money.  It is clear that although there has been a 50 per cent increase in the amount of money spent on waiting lists this year, we still have a serious problem.  I am proud the Minister is, for the first time, changing the approach to this problem and is looking at waiting lists in a different way.  He has appointed an expert group which has advised him well on the current difficulties and how to tackle them.</P>
      <P>There has been a history of neglect as far as waiting lists and acute hospital expenditure are concerned.  The last Government significantly reduced the amount of money spent in this area. Deputy Shortall said she agrees with the policy of not bailing out acute hospitals, but the basic allocation is not enough.  No politician would say the allocation for the health sector is enough.  It is a bottomless pit.</P>

      <P>It was far less than what is being allocated this year by the Minister for Health and Children.  The 9.5 per cent increase is one of the highest increases in a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy for Deputy Shortall to preach to us about the need to link health expenditure to GDP.  When the Labour Party and Democratic Left were in Government, they totally neglected the health sector and the amount of money available was reduced.  The policies pursued by the Labour Party in Government on the health services <Col N="993" /> contributed to the difficulties we inherited, which we are now trying to tackle in a comprehensive and coherent manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the health strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not continue to fund health boards on the basis of those who shouted loudest towards the end of the year.</P>
      <P>We supported the previous Government when the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, introduced the 1996 legislation.  He knew the only way to sort out the difficulties in the health service was to discipline health service providers and then to provide more money.  The present Minister for Finance has put that policy into place for the first time this year.</P>
      <P>We have seen how the Fine Gael Party has acted on the first opportunity it has had to stand up and be counted on its own legislation.  The bleating on the Fine Gael benches is a far cry from the days when Deputy Dukes had the courage to introduce the Tallaght strategy or Deputy John Bruton had the courage to introduce difficult budgets.</P>
      <P>In the early 1980s there were cries from the Opposition benches about Fianna Fáil allowing public expenditure to run out of control.  We were all guilty of that in the early 1980s.  It was only in 1987 that we adopted a different approach.  It was a difficult approach at the time but it was the bed&mdash;rock on which our present economic development was born.  That is why we have a surplus of £1.3 billion today and why the Estimate for the Department of Health and Children can be increased by 9.5 per cent.  I remind Deputies Shortall and Shatter that there is only one way forward and that is with proper, comprehensive, strategic planning and proper budgetary controls and investment.  We all agree that no matter how much money is allocated by the Department of Finance it will not be enough, irrespective of which party is in Government.  We have to plan for the future and go forward within the budgetary constraints.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with the child care pilot projects mentioned by Deputy Shortall.  I had to smile while the Deputy was speaking.  She is right that the projects were initiated when this Government took office.  At that time, nothing was being done in a co-ordinated, interdepartmental, strategic way for young children at risk or for families facing adversity.  We had to start from scratch.  These pilot projects were well thought out.  When we announced them we knew exactly what we were doing.  It is a reflection on previous Governments that Deputy Shortall did not know what they were about when they were announced.  That is more a reflection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the basis on which the locations were picked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The locations were quite simple. This was part of an important and well thought <Col N="994" /> out strategic approach, whereby £30 million was made available under the youth services budget. The vast majority of the £20 million is going to Dublin under the drugs initiative.  The Cabinet sub-committee decided that the £2.4 million per year over three years should be spread around the country.  Essentially, these were preventative programmes and the feeling was that because so much of the £20 million was being spent in Dublin, it was only fair that it be spread throughout the eight health board areas.</P>
      <P>One of the major problems which has bedevilled us is that people such as Deputy Shortall believe that there is nothing outside the Pale. This has been reflected in health service spending over the years and we are determined to change this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>There was no question of Ministers' constituencies being chosen over anywhere else. We had discussions with the health boards and we put those projects into every health board area.  I am pleased that it is already evident that this small amount of expenditure will be one of the most efficient items this year.  I have no problem with the amount of money being spent or where it is being spent.  I hope that when we have good news tomorrow regarding funding for child care, Deputy Shortall will wish us well.  It will be the first serious attempt to properly fund child care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has come a long way in the past two weeks.  Two weeks ago one could not even ask a question about health in the House.  If one did so one risked being expelled, as happened to me.  The Minister and the Government conceded that party leaders could make statements, then agreed to a debate on health.  Two weeks later we are discussing a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago the Estimate was £5.5 million. Now we are discussing an Estimate of £19.5 million, an increase of £11 million.  The Minister stated that the Supplementary Estimate relates to those areas where there is a degree of uncertainty in forecasting the actual costs in any one year and, consequently, the original Estimates did not provide for these full costs.  The agreed practice has been to seek supplementary funding in these areas when the actual amount needed becomes apparent during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I question him on the serious situation at University College Hospital, Galway, the Minister of State continues to assert that it is illegal and that the Government cannot introduce a Supplementary <Col N="995" /> Estimate.  I am glad that this assertion has been proved to be a misstatement, given that we are debating a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The problem with this Estimate is not what is included but what is not.  There is no mention of reducing waiting lists or solving the serious problem at University College Hospital, Galway.  The situation at that hospital has deteriorated in the past two weeks.  There was a work to rule by staff to prevent ward closures and the laying off of nurses, the theatre is already closed.  We now have a situation of divide and conquer.  One section of the staff has received assurances which may satisfy them.  The other section is not happy and will take all steps necessary to avoid ward closures.  If the solution is as good as it is claimed, why did we not reach this solution four weeks ago rather than having nurses, doctors, patients and their families going through such anxiety and drama?</P>
    <P>The situation in Galway has become worse.  In the first part of the day nursing staff belonging to one union may work normally while during the second half of the day the staff may be members of a different union.  In such cases, two different sets of procedures will apply.  Management will have to answer telephones and perform other non-nursing duties for one section of staff.  During the other part of the day those managers will not be required.</P>
    <P>The situation is costing a lot more than would have been the case if the Minister had grasped the nettle initially and provided the money to keep the wards and the theatre open.  This is what is missing from this Estimate.  The Minister could have had the courage to provide the necessary £1 million which would have kept these wards open.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State handed out a prepared script but did not refer to it.  Instead he spent ten minutes attacking the two previous speakers. That is the sort of politics he has carried on in Galway over the past two weeks.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has not faced up to his responsibilities, and those of the Minister, in solving the serious crisis.  The buck stops with the Minister and the Minister of State was told this in no uncertain terms at two public meetings in Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said that he was proud of the Minister's record on waiting lists.  He must not be aware of the situation in the hospital in the constituency we both <Col N="996" /> represent.  At the end of June the waiting list was 2,891.  At the end of September it was 3,570, an increase of 600 in three months.  It is a year and a half since the Government came to power.  The Minster of State seeks to blame Deputies Shortall and McManus but the present difficulties have arisen since this Government took office.  The waiting list figures have risen dramatically in the past three months and one wonders how far they will have risen by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>All wards are now full to capacity in Galway. Last night, three patients remained overnight in casualty.  St. Gerard's ward, which was to have been closed under the terms of proposals to settle the dispute at the hospital, now contains 31 beds. Where will those patients be accommodated if not in other wards and at the expense of other patients?  If that happens waiting lists must get even longer.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to abandon his negative attitude to the health service and to desist from making veiled threats to the management of University College Hospital, Galway that the hospital will be deprived of funding for future projects if they criticise Government action.  If the Minister of State, the Minister for Health and Children or officials of the Department have evidence of mismanagement at University College Hospital, they should investigate that matter.  I would support such an investigation provided wards are not closed in the meantime.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, made such a veiled threat at a public meeting last evening.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Minister of State must face up to their responsibilities.  They are responsible for the situation which has arisen in the major hospital in the constituency which Deputy Fahey and I represent.  The problem must be dealt with now because next year waiting lists will have become even longer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>

      <P>The problem was inherited from the previous Government and I compliment the Minister on acting positively, on putting procedures in place to analyse the problem and on targeting funding to alleviate the problems associated with long waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must examine the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our hospitals.  Some are very efficient and perform admirably within their budget constraints while others are not.  The issue of efficiency must be addressed.  We must examine the number of procedures carried out in each hospital each year and how much each procedure costs.  The number of procedures carried out in <Col N="997" /> various hospitals appears to vary greatly.  One wonders if mechanisms are in place to monitor the efficiency of hospitals.</P>
    <P>The problem of doctors making inappropriate admissions to accident and emergency units must also be addressed.  I am convinced that some doctors admit almost every patient who arrives at their hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and I apologise once again for the delay in distributing the text of my speech.  This was due to a technical difficulty which arose at the last minute and was not within my control.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the difference in the amounts of the Supplementary Estimates of two weeks ago and now.  The net original figure was £5.5 millon.  I obtained agreement that the issue of consultants' pay be dealt with in the context of the Supplementary Estimate.  This allows for an increase of £10 million.  I have also arranged an additional £4 million for aids and appliances.  This amount of £14 million added to the original figure of £5.5 million gives the present figure of £19.5 million.  Under the new contract, consultants are being paid on an ongoing basis by health boards, authorities and agencies.  Making this money available now rather than carrying it as a cash flow item to be dealt with next year will assist voluntary hospitals and health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extra money for aids and appliances will assist the physically disabled.  Last year, for the first time, a significant grant was given for aids and appliances.  The measure proved very effective <Col N="998" /> and was welcomed.  This year, I have been able to make provision of £4 million in the Supplementary Estimate for aids and appliances for the physically handicapped.  Health boards already have names of disabled people who will benefit from these appliances.  The money will be forwarded to the health boards and will be passed, by way of grants to various organisations, to the individuals who need them.  That method allows for individual needs to be met quickly while maintaining strict accountability.  The Supplementary Estimate has not substantively changed from two weeks ago.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about the waiting list initiative.  Waiting lists are not strictly relevant to the Supplementary Estimate.  However, I can say that improvements in waiting times in a number of specialties are already evident.  These validated results have only become available in the last few days.  The allocation of funds to the waiting list initiative next year will depend on this year's case mix figures and the cost information under those figures.  I will be seeking to reserve money as an incentive to hospitals who improve their throughput. These hospitals may receive a second allocation during the course of the year.  The problem has been that a hospital was allocated funds on the basis of a long waiting list.  That is not the best way to solve the problem.  Consideration must be given to the publication of waiting times in all specialties in hospitals so that general practitioners may be encouraged to change their referral patterns and public patients will know where they will receive treatment most quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the commencement on 10 December 1997 of United Nations Human Rights Year which will culminate on 10 December 1998, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and reaffirms its support for the principles set out in the Declaration.</P>
      <P>Earlier in my term of office, I said that a fitting way to mark the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights would be to hold a Dáil debate such as this so that Members could express their views on our approach to human rights issues.  It is a formidable exercise to measure our policies against the 1948 call of the UN General Assembly to set the provisions of the declaration as &ldquo;a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations&rdquo;.  Human rights are the birthright of all human beings.  The protection and promotion of these rights is the first responsibility of every Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has a progressive and consistent human rights policy, building on the achievements of successive Governments over the years, and one which is firmly rooted in the principles of the Universal Declaration.  As Minister of State with special responsibility for human rights, it is my primary responsibility to ensure that awareness and vindication of human rights issues permeates the whole of our foreign policy.  This is essential because of the moral imperative to uphold fundamental values and also because it enables us to make a practical and effective contribution to peace and justice throughout the world.  A world of gross inequality, of massive economic and social deprivation in some regions, and of competition to secure the bare necessities of life would not be a world in which the rule of law and the fostering of democratic values thrive.  What we must do is integrate all the major strands of our foreign policy.  To be serious about advancing the cause of human rights we must also be effective <Col N="1001" /> in many other areas, including conflict prevention and crisis management, peacekeeping, asylum issues, humanitarian assistance, development co-operation, economic reconstruction and the protection of Irish citizens' interest.  The credo of human rights principles must be implemented.</P>
    <P>I stress this because I believe the advancement of human rights as a moral obligation cannot be fulfilled merely by making routine statements in those international human rights fora.  These important bodies play a key role, but a meaningful human rights policy cannot exist in isolation or on paper: it must be related to all the other policies which we are pursuing, including our domestic polices.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I would like to state four key objective of our human rights policy, central to our efforts not only in this 50th anniversary year of the Universal Declaration but in every year.  They are to make human rights a reality worldwide; to prevent human rights violations at home and abroad; to build a global partnership for human rights; and to make human rights, along with peace, democracy and development, the guiding principles of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Our policies must make a difference at home and abroad.  We pursue these objectives on two levels.  As a member state of the European Union, we seek to agree common positions on a broad range of thematic and country-specific issues.  The EU, when it speaks with one voice, carries a considerable amount of weight with world opinion.  The other level is bilateral, and we maximise our impact through our current membership of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>In responding to the many humanitarian crises which confront the international community, there is an absolute need for the integrated approach, to which I referred earlier.  An illustration of this is the war and resultant famine in Sudan.  I have witnessed at first hand the combined effects of oppression, civil war and drought in that country.  The results have been truly horrendous in terms of human suffering for the people of Sudan.  Both I and the Minister, Deputy Andrews, in our respective visits, have pursued the concerns of the Irish people about human rights and humanitarian issues in that country.  As well as raising these concerns with EU partners at ministerial level, we have pursued them directly with the Sudanese Government, rebel representatives and international aid agencies on the ground.  We have consulted with other international donors and with neighbouring states who are seeking to broker a peaceful settlement within the regional framework of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD.</P>
    <P>Irish aid to Sudan &mdash; almost £1.65 million in emergency assistance so far this year &mdash; represents our response to the humanitarian crisis there.  Our support for the peace efforts being made by a group of Sudan's neighbours, in the framework of IGAD, represents our political <Col N="1002" /> contribution to a settlement of the underlying conflict.  It is now accepted by all involved in Sudan that the peace process itself needs to be made more robust and enhanced.</P>
    <P>Underlying our efforts in Sudan, as well as in the Great Lakes region and other African countries is the critical realisation that humanitarian efforts on behalf of the Irish people must be matched by concerted efforts in conflict resolution and democratic transition in the countries concerned.  Our role in Sudan is not only humanitarian: it is helping to foster an enduring peace.</P>
    <P>All too often it can be frustrating for a small, neutral country like Ireland to try to make an impact on global human rights.  Our role can be one of rhetoric, motions and diplomacy rather than direct action.  However, in one area &mdash; development and emergency humanitarian assistance &mdash; we truly move from rhetoric to real action on human rights.  Human rights are not just about civil and political rights, though these provide the cornerstones.  The right to development is in itself a human right.  Perhaps there is no greater and more practical example of how Ireland vindicates human rights globally than via our development efforts.  Through our development co-operation we value the dignity of each human being.  We are building the capacity of people in developing countries to have a better life in a world hopefully enhanced by justice and peace.</P>
    <P>Development co-operation policy, therefore, is no longer just a matter of aid transfers.  It is about ways of strengthening democracy and good governance, promoting greater and fairer trade and offering developing countries a reasonable chance to participate in the global economy.  It is about preventing conflicts as much as providing a strong humanitarian response when they do occur.  It is about long-term investment in development.</P>
    <P>War, poverty, disease, debt and illiteracy still face the people of sub-Saharan Africa where 220 million people subsist on one dollar a day.  This state of affairs brutally denies human rights.  We have a moral responsibility in the developed world to respond in terms of quantity and quality of aid.  For our part, we take this responsibility very seriously.</P>
    <P>Since 1992 our aid budget has risen from £40 million to £137 million in 1998.  This represents an honourable and substantial commitment to the goal of development co-operation.  I am delighted to say that we have secured agreement to an increase of 66 per cent, or more than £62.2 million, over the next three years for that part of the budget that covers poverty-related programmes, democratisation, emergencies and NGO activities. The total amount in discretionary spending will be £400 million over three years.  This will place Irish aid on a firm trajectory towards our commitment to reaching 0.45 per cent of GNP, on the way to achieving the overall UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Last week in the Seanad I announced that we have achieved a significant breakthrough on the <Col N="1003" /> issue of funding the aid budget of my Department. I would like to make a number of points about this issue, which will be useful in outlining the main features and implications of this breakthrough.</P>
    <P>First, by securing an agreement on multi-annual funding for the discretionary spending elements of the aid budget, I have arrested the potential slide from the upward trajectory toward reaching our GNP targets.  Deputies will be aware of the nature of the difficulty which had arisen and were aware, as I have been for some time, of the need to liberate the aid budget from the annual adversarial Estimates process and from competing domestic spending demands.  Deputies on all sides recognised the challenge and Deputy Gay Mitchell suggested that we introduce legislation to give statutory underpinning to our development aid targets.  This was a good idea and a worthy suggestion, but what has been achieved by introducing multi-annual budgeting reflects this suggestion and has the merit of taking effect immediately.</P>
    <P>Second, the increase in the budget for the next three years for the discretionary direct aid part of my budget alone will be greater than the entire aid budget was in 1992.  Ireland currently ranks twelfth in the table of donor generosity out a total of 21 countries It has been estimated that the aid increases secured will mean that we will move from twelfth place to eighth place by the year 2001.</P>
    <P>Third, by increasing the discretionary spending element of the aid budget over the next three years by 66 per cent, the target of reaching 0.45 per cent of GNP is firmly within sight.  Far from this target being abandoned, we have put the target within reach.  The increases agreed are quite separate and additional to the other ODA subheads, multilateral and debt relief packages.</P>

      <P>I will return to certain aspects of the Minister of State's speech when the debate is resumed, including her comments on overseas development aid.  In the couple of minutes available to me I wish to make one particular point. We should not only be concerned about human rights abroad &mdash; where, of course, we have a duty and a contribution to make &mdash; but also at home, particularly in Dublin, where we have a problem with human rights.  Dublin has become a multicultural city, albeit on a small scale, and this trend is likely to continue as Ireland's wealth continues to grow at multiples of the EU growth rates.  No plan exists, and no preparations have been made, to accommodate this dramatic change.  The presence on our streets and in our communities of people with different coloured skin and different traditions, culture and language, could be harnessed as an enrichment of Irish life.  Instead, ignorance, racism and xenophobia have been allowed to take root, with apparent indifference on the part of both local and central Government and State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> We have already witnessed racist violence in this city.  Daily I hear extreme racist and xenophobic comments.  Last night I was given a racist poem by a person who thought it was normal to pass this on to me to read at my convenience.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that further violence will follow, perhaps worse than we have seen to date, if officialdom continues to ignore the need to tackle this issue.  The Government should assign responsibility for immigrant issues to one Minister who would have the responsibility for tackling racism and xenophobia in a proactive, co-ordinated campaign.  This campaign should involve social and central Government, State agencies such as health boards and vocational education committees, and religious organisations &mdash; Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Moslem.</P>

      <P>It is not unusual to move a motion in this House knowing it will be defeated. Neither is it unusual to move a motion knowing it will be successful.  Win or lose, the outcome is usually very clear.  Somehow the situation this evening is different.  We do not know whether we have won, lost, or even if it is a draw.  The Government has tabled an amendment to this motion which one would need a Ph.  D. in communications to decipher.  Does the Government intend to give an additional £22.4 million in revenue funding in this year's budget?  If so, we on the Opposition benches will welcome it whole-heartedly as a victory for people with sensory and physical disability.  It will be no more than they deserve.  They have already achieved one small victory today.  The Minister has announced that, as a result of Opposition pressure, he will give £4 million in capital funding in a Supplementary Estimate for aids and appliances.  This is welcome, but it does not for one minute detract from the real and pressing need for ongoing revenue funding.  We must wait for the Minister to solve the riddle and tell us whether the £22.4 million mentioned in the Government amendment is real or imaginary, whether it relates to the past or the future, to capital funding or to revenue funding. Unfortunately, knowing this Minister's sleight of hand, my instinct tells me this is not really additional money, but we will wait and see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One sentence from the chairperson's foreword to the report Towards an Independent Future sets the scene for tonight's debate on the motion sponsored by Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Democratic Left, the Green Party and the majority of Independent Deputies.  Dr. Ruth Barrington writes on behalf of the review group: <Col N="1006" />&ldquo;The main thrust of our report is the development of services to enable people with a physical or sensory disability to live as independently as possible in the community&rdquo;.  The key issues in the submissions to the review group highlight the deficiencies in the system which should be addressed to achieve the objective outlined above, that of enabling, and independence for, people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The submissions to the review group highlighted the lack of comprehensive data on the numbers and services needed; the inadequate access to information on service provision; the disparities in eligibility criteria between and within health board areas; the inadequate statutory financial funding for individuals; the uncertain funding for voluntary organisations; the shortfalls in service relating to therapy, day care, counselling and home support; the uneven geographic distribution of services; the inadequate transport services; the inadequate co-ordination of services; and poor consumer choice.  This is quite a litany of disaster, by anyone's judgment. The recommendations in the report are designed to overcome these inadequacies, uncertainties and shortfalls.</P>
    <P>One of the most critical recommendations of the report is the establishment of a database.  This would allow all the agencies, statutory and voluntary, to ascertain the scale of the problem and to allow for proper planning and financial provision to be made to address the real needs of those thousands of people who lack even the most basic support services.</P>
    <P>During the debate last month on people with a mental handicap all Members had access to information on the scale of the problems and the need for services through the Intellectual Disability Database.  There is no such database available to identify the needs of those with a physical or sensory handicap.  Without this information, gathered by the voluntary agencies, we have no idea of the number of our citizens who have a physical or sensory handicap.</P>
    <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association has done valuable work in establishing that 2,667 of its members do not benefit from day activity or development.  Of these, 1,248 are physically isolated &mdash; prisoners in their own homes.  Some 1,153 people require aids and appliances and 1,375 people require personal assistance with basic needs such as dressing and feeding.</P>
    <P>How many thousands more who are not members of the IWA require services?  Other voluntary agencies working in this sector have carried out equally valuable work in assessing the needs of their members and the people who avail of their services, but in the absence of a national database how can we be sure we will provide the necessary supports to vindicate the rights of all our citizens to achieve full economic, social and educational integration as equal, independent and participative members within the general community?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> Paragraph 10.1.1 of Towards an Independent Future states:</P>
    <P>In this report, we have made recommendations on the level of services required by people with disabilities based on our assessment of clear gaps in the current provision. With the establishment of a comprehensive database, more detailed long-term planning at both national and regional levels should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Information is vital for co-ordination.  In addition to ongoing and consistent funding, the establishment of a database must be a priority.  The lack of information highlights a wider deficiency &mdash; lack of awareness by those not directly involved with people with sensory of physical handicap of the fact that such problems exist.</P>
    <P>We in this House have access to reports, legislation and information.  We meet our constituents regularly.  We have knowledge of the scale of the difficulties faced by those who have physical or sensory disability.  However, we have been and are complacent.  That is why debates such as this are so useful.  Through this debate, we should seek not only the necessary funding to implement the recommendations of the review group but also to raise public awareness.</P>
    <P>To understand the scale of the problems faced by people who are physically disabled we could consider putting our own house in order.  This building is the seat of the national parliament and as such should be open and accessible to all our citizens.  However, we might ask whether it is. Leinster House is not exactly a wheelchair friendly place today, but it is hundred times more wheelchair friendly than it used to be.  The corridors of this House used to be hills and valleys of stairs, steps and narrow doorways.  Some of them remain so.</P>
    <P>The situation improved only when Brian Crowley was elected to the Seanad.  Overnight the hills and valleys were smoothed out to allow an elected Member have access.  We all became aware of the scale of the problem faced when Brian Crowley arrived.  We all welcomed the changes in the landscape because they made life easier for us too &mdash; there were less stairs to climb. In other words, they increased our comfort. However, what would have been the implications for Senator Crowley if the stairs had not been taken away and the floors not levelled and sloped?  Senator Crowley would have been prevented from carrying out his electoral mandate. He would not have had easy and independent access to the Chamber of the Upper House. He would not have been able to do his job.  What an outrage that would have caused.  However, changes were made, and while I am sure they were not ideal, they did allow Senator Crowley to access the building, to carry on with his work and to do all that we take for granted every day. Nobody who was physically disabled could have worked here otherwise.  One might ask how we <Col N="1008" /> could have filled the 3 per cent quota.  How could anybody who became incapacitated have coped with the physical reality of this House?  How many citizens were unable to attend a debate in the House or to take a tour of the building simply because the corridors did not allow them to use a wheelchair?</P>
    <P>All Members have advocated independence and inclusion for people with physical disability. How could these people have an independent and inclusive life in Leinster House?  We have nothing to be proud of, even at the most basic level, and we must be reminded of this.</P>
    <P>The barriers which we consciously or unconsciously place in the way of people with disability are often more disabling to them than their conditions. The Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, states:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government are committed to radical change to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, their carers and their advocates are comprehensively addressed.  We are committed to ensuring that disability is placed where it belongs, on the agenda of every Government Department and every public body.  Our policy is based on the core principle of promoting empowerment through appropriate, accessible and responsive services.</P>
    <P>These are fine words with which we agree.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil was in Opposition in 1996, the current Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, produced an excellent and comprehensive policy document on disability entitled Meeting the Challenge of Equality.  It states that there is no economic reason for Dublin Bus to continue investing in non-accessible buses.  One wonders if the Minister for Public Enterprise is aware of the content of that policy document and of the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question on 4 November 1997 the Minister said: &ldquo;I am personally committed to ensuring that, within my area of responsibility, meeting the requirements of people with disabilities continues to be accorded a high priority by service providers&rdquo;.  On 11 November 1998 the same Minister announced that for the first time the Exchequer was providing direct capital funding for public transport.  Of the £56 million being provided, £17 million was allocated for 100 additional buses in Dublin.  In addition, 50 new buses were approved for purchase as part of the reallocation of the Luas EU assistance.</P>
    <P>One hundred and fifty new buses is a better deal for commuters.  Good news travels fast when the Minister for Public Enterprise makes an announcement.  It should be good news for everybody since the Government is committed to the core principles of promoting empowerment through appropriate, accessible and responsive services.  However, that is not the case.  Good news may travel but wheelchair users will not, at <Col N="1009" /> least not on the 150 new buses funded by the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise told my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, in reply to a parliamentary question, that it was her policy that all transport providers should, as far as possible, make their services and facilities accessible to people with disabilities.  She went on to say that the new buses are urgently required to meet traffic congestion problems in Dublin.  None of the new buses is wheelchair accessible.  The Minister told the House that there are low floor buses which might be suitable and which will be in use in London shortly.  Dublin Bus is seeking to obtain one such bus for trials in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise gave Dublin Bus the money for new buses but, in spite of her stated commitment with regard to disability, she did not ask or demand that Dublin Bus buy low floor buses.  She did not introduce regulations requiring all public service bus operators to include only low floor accessible buses in their fleet replacement programmes.  No wonder people with physical or sensory disabilities are cynical; no wonder they are angry.</P>
    <P>The Government had the opportunity to live up to its commitments.  It had the opportunity to make a difference to the lives of the people in the Public Gallery tonight and to the lives of their carers and their families.  I hope the Government is sincere and that its amendment to the motion is not cynical.  I await the Minister's explanation of the riddle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I must point out that as the Minister was late coming to the House Deputy Ahearn was obliged to wait and as a result lost about four minutes of her allotted time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a debate about political will.  The Opposition parties and a number of Independent Deputies have placed a motion before the House which calls on the Government to use a relatively small proportion of the massive Exchequer surplus to ensure that people with a physical or sensory disability have the necessary supports to lead a dignified life.  For the first time in the history of the State, the Government has the resources available to make a substantial difference to the lives of thousands of families.  It must demonstrate that it has the political will to make that necessary investment.</P>
      <P>For too long people with disabilities have been excluded and marginalised in society.  Historically, the response to their needs has been characterised by a belief in charity rather than a belief in rights.  If the Government fails to accept the thrust of this motion and fails to grasp the opportunity of tomorrow's budget, many people will be forced to continue to depend on charity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial content of the motion seeks to put back on track the five year investment programme outlined in Towards an Independent Future.  People with a physical disability, their <Col N="1010" /> families and their advocates have a genuine and legitimate fear that the targets in that five year plan will not be reached.  As we approach the mid-point of the plan, there is already a major deficit, a deficit which the motion seeks to redress by demanding the investment of £21 million of Exchequer funds in this year's budget and seeking a commitment that future Exchequer and capital funding will be made available.</P>
    <P>Investment of that amount was proposed in Towards an Independent Future but it is in this area that slippage has occurred in the past two years.  While everybody welcomes special capital allocations for appliances and once-of expenses, annual expenditure by the Exchequer is essential, as was outlined in the five year plan.  There has been huge slippage and, in order to put the plan back on track to meet its targets, it is essential that £21 million be allocated in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>The disability sector has also historically been chronically underfunded.  This is made clear in the document, Strategy for Equality, which states in paragraph 15: &ldquo;It is clear that few resources have been invested in the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities&rdquo;. The report goes on to warn that there might be insufficient funds to meet the huge range of service needs of this group over the next few years.  The first statement is a statement of fact.  All Members and parties in the House have been remiss in their failure to recognise the necessity of putting proper funding in place to enable all members of society to live a full and dignified life.  However, there is now a new situation where money is at last available to the Government.</P>
    <P>The principle of equality demands that all citizens have an equal right to participate in the social, economic and cultural life of this country. At present, despite some advances in recent years, the vindication of the principle of equality still remains a huge political challenge.  The Government is in a unique position to respond to this challenge.  It can either treat the needs of people with a disability as a priority and provide the necessary funding to make significant changes in their daily lives or it can tell these people to wait and take their place in the queue.</P>
    <P>The motion details three areas of need in this sector &mdash; day resource centres, aids and appliances and personal assistant services.  In 1996, the Irish Wheelchair Association identified 2,667 people who would benefit from day services. This is just one organisation working in the sector and does not indicate the total outstanding day care needs.  What is shocking about the Irish Wheelchair Association's finding is that more than 1,200 of these people did not leave their homes on a regular basis.  These figures show how marginalised people with a disability can become in a society that does not value their rights or invest in their wellbeing.</P>
    <P>Due to a lack of services and a wholly inadequate transport system, thousands of people across the country are effectively prisoners in <Col N="1011" /> their homes.  The isolation that many of these people endure is appalling.  Fine words about equality ring hollow when this is the daily reality for thousands of people throughout the State. Day care places fulfil two fundamental roles for people with a physical disability.  They enable the person with the disability to socialise, to feel part of society, to have a role and a purpose.  They also provide respite for family members or friends who care for the person with a disability.  The five year plan, Towards an Independent Future, contains a requirement to invest more than £3 million each year in day places.  In overall budgetary terms this represents a drop in the ocean but the effect this investment has on the quality of life of thousands of people is inestimable.</P>
    <P>In common with day care services, the role of personal assistants in the lives of people with a physical or sensory disability is critical.  The valuable work of home care attendants, benefits the person with the disability and provides respite for carers and family members.  The personal assistant service is concerned with making the philosophy of independent living a reality.  This service has been critical in enabling people with a disability to access further education and work opportunities.  If we are serious about dignity and equality these services must be expanded and access must be readily available for all people with a disability.</P>
    <P>The motion refers also to the need to invest in aids and appliances.  A sum of £1 million each year over five years is suggested in Towards an Independent Future.  Aids and appliances can transform the quality of life, particularly in the home, of people with a disability.  There is no Deputy in the House who does not know the value of an appropriate wheelchair, a bed hoist or even an access ramp to a person with a disability.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the struggle which people have to avail of these necessary aids and the frustration of voluntary organisations who have to cope with the reality of waiting lists and what seem like interminable delays.  All these investments make a real difference to people's lives. None of them would overburden the coffers of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. However, due to the slippage in funding that has occurred for people with physical disability, services that provide a minimum of dignity and independence to thousands of people are being affected.  These services are being held back due to a lack of political will to invest the necessary funding to make good the development plan in Towards an Independent Future.  This is the stark reality.</P>
    <P>In common with the recent motion on services to people with a mental handicap, this motion seeks to treat people with a disability as a priority.  Our economy has never performed so well and the revenue flowing into the Department of Finance is unprecedented.  This year there will be a current budget surplus of £1.3 billion.  I call on Deputies on all sides to support <Col N="1012" /> this motion to ensure people with disabilities will be given their right to participate as full and equal members of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the cross-party co-operation on this Bill.  Each of us has only one life to live.  As part of that life we expect to have a wide variety of experiences: to exercise certain freedoms and to build many personal and social connections.  Access to school, work, recreation, security and, most importantly, to independence are taken for granted.  These expectations, we consider, are ours to be realised as of right.  Yet those who have to live with disability do not have the same choices or the same opportunity to realise their potential in the way we do.  If equality is to mean anything, it must address their needs.  To do so, political commitment is required as well as the financing to back that commitment.</P>
      <P>This motion is vitally important.  It establishes the yardstick by which each of us can be judged on that commitment.  It sets out clearly and realistically how this Government can give the necessary focus on equality for those with disability. It sets out modest realisable funding requirements that this Government could meet comfortably.  It sets a challenge to every member of Fianna Fáil, to members of the Progressive Democrats and to the three independent Deputies &mdash; Deputies Fox, Gildea and Healy-Rae &mdash; as to where each of those stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion does what the Government motion avoids doing, it faces up to the responsibilities of supporting people with disabilities in line with the leading thinking of today's world.  In recent years there has been a welcome shift in our understanding of disability.  Even if the thinking is not always followed by action, it produced the two reports: Towards an Independent Future and a Strategy for Equality.  It produced centres of independent living and the introduction of personal assistant schemes.  It has generated a campaigning spirit among those with disability that defines their role not as dependants but as decision makers.  All of this has produced an enormous range of recommendations and proposals. If we are to look at a synopsis of what needs to be done, I can think of no better example than the policy document produced by Fianna Fáil as recently as 1996.  It contains a number of significant statements, for example: &ldquo;People with disabilities form one of the most marginalised and excluded groups within our society&rdquo; and &ldquo;Action on issues of concern to people with disabilities and their families should be prioritised and placed at the centre of official policy&rdquo;.  &ldquo;There must be a dramatic movement away from the provision of most services for people with disabilities through health agencies. The current situation serves to medicalise social issues and promote marginalisation&rdquo;.  Finally, there is a declaration of where the Fianna Fáil Party stands on the needs of people with a disability if returned to power: &ldquo;Significant extra Government expenditure is required.  Fianna Fáil <Col N="1013" /> believes that disability should become one of the priorities in Government social spending and accepts that this will require difficult budgetary choices&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is back in power and now is the time for difficult budgetary choices.  Now is the time to live up to the fine words.  It is pay back time for people with a disability, many of whom voted for Fianna Fáil because they believed what they were told.  So far the record is dismal.  That is why this motion offers a chance to redeem the policy commitments made so easily in Opposition and forgotten about so quickly in Government. There is something deeply undermining public confidence when the rhetoric of a party is so out of kilter with the reality.  We have a Minister of State who has responsibility for people with disabilities. She is responsible not only for her own actions but for how other Ministers respond to the needs of those with a disability.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight the issue of mobility.  People are restricted not only by their disability but by the legion of obstacles put in their way by society at large: footpaths too high, shop doors too narrow, steps too steep, cinemas inaccessible, schools and offices without lifts and, more importantly, public transport is not accessible to those who happen to use wheelchairs.  According to its policy document Fianna Fáil said: &ldquo;Government should work with statutory and non-statutory bodies to ensure that the whole of the travel chain become accessible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we have seen the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, cheerfully &mdash; she always appears cheerful &mdash; trample all over that policy document.  She announced the procurement of 100 buses for Dublin to help with the traffic log&mdash;jam but not one of those will help the permanent log&mdash;jam experienced by those with disabilities. The wheelchair&mdash;bound will still be in the log&mdash;jam when the rest of us are able to avail of public transport.  Those with disabilities will, therefore, be further disenfranchised by a Government which had no compunction in sending a message of hope while in Opposition and abandoning it on entering office.</P>
    <P>There are those among the population whose stories are remarkable and it is amazing what they have achieved despite the obstacles they encountered.  I wish to record the views of one such person who has a remarkable story to tell in terms of how he managed to overcome his disability. I will now read part of the letter he sent to me:</P>
    <P>I personally am a wheelchair user with muscular dystrophy.  I have a doctorate in structural engineering.  With that level of qualification, I have to work hard as an ordinary full-time engineer in ESB International.  Yet, most disabled people I know or have come in contact with seem to place me on some kind of pedestal. As far as these people are concerned, in my ordinary job, I've made it.  Mind you, I remain where I am because I am one of the 40 or so lucky ones who is able to avail of the <Col N="1014" />&lsquo;permanent&rsquo; shoestring Personal Assistance Service operated by the Irish Wheelchair Association.</P>
    <P>I am not all right Jack.</P>
    <P>Why should my &lsquo;lofty&rsquo; position be denied to the rest of the disabled fraternity?  There are currently 1,375 people nationwide who require Personal Assistance service.  Of these, 200 require the all&mdash;encompassing Personal Assistance Service and the remainder require 12 hours of support per week from a Care Attendant type service at the cost of £8 million.  As a witness of the injustice perpetrated through denial of equity to the physically disabled over the years, I cannot bear to see the injustice of bread&mdash;line wages paid to the few Personal Assistants who are charitable (not charity again!) enough to effectively give up a year or two of their lives so that we don't have to give up ours.</P>
    <P>The man who sent me this letter ends with the following plea to Opposition Members which, obviously, he wishes us to forward to the Government:</P>
    <P>Persuade the Government to invest in us, just as I am investing in my adopted son's and wife&mdash;to&mdash;be's full-time education.  I don't see investing in the future as a cost, so why can't you persuade your parliamentary colleagues to be of like mind when it comes to the physically disabled members of the family called Ireland. It is never too late &mdash; please convince us and persuade Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to put money where their mouths were before the general election.</P>

      <P>The Green Party is appalled that the needs of 140,000 citizens with sensory and physical disabilities are not being adequately resourced despite the country's seemingly booming economy.  It cannot be right that people with a disability, be it physical or sensory, and their carers should be obliged, as happened last week, to make their way to Dublin to protest at the gates of Leinster House in order to make their demands heard.  Carers receive as little as £70 for what is in some cases a 168 hour week.  They only obtain that money following a demeaning and intrusive means test.</P>
      <P>There can be no excuse for the chronic underfunding of services for those with mental or physical disabilities.  The isolation and poverty experienced by people with disabilities could easily be remedied by the provision of additional funding for personal assistants and carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children with autism or similar severe learning disabilities are being disadvantaged educationally in breach of their constitutional right to education. According to the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, education, which should be a right for autistic and severely mentally handicapped children, is instead available to them only &ldquo;as far as practicable and having regard to resources&rdquo;.  Should the <Col N="1015" /> weakest in our society not be placed at the top of the list when it comes to educational and emotional development?</P>
    <P>Our primary schools provide the forum for the first significant interaction our young citizens have with the institutions of the State.  It is an encounter which does little to reassure children with mental or physical disabilities that this State with its &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; Government sees their needs as anything but burdensome.  The education and development of children and young people with physical, mental or sensory disabilities means everything to those families which are struggling with limited resources to make their children's lives and opportunities the best possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus referred to Fianna Fáil's pre-election promise to make the travel chain accessible.  However, the Minister for Public Enterprise recently revealed what she described as a major boost to the Dublin Bus fleet.  Unfortunately, few if any of the new buses will be able to accommodate passengers in wheelchairs.  That is a disgrace.  It means that a large section of the population is being subjected to State-funded infrastructural discrimination and is unable to go about its daily business.  The Government is keeping wheelchair users in their homes or making them dependent on the grace or favour of others. If those Deputies who were elected as Independents support the Government amendment, which is based on the sleight of hand of the party of professional accountants, they will have cause to think long and hard about their role in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is a need to provide funding in order to make information services available to those with physical and sensory disabilities.  There is an urgent need to inject capital funding to make the centres providing such information physically accessible to all citizens.  The information held there should be made available in formats which ensure that people with sensory disabilities can obtain the same level of information and advice as every other citizen.</P>
    <P>This motion represents an opportunity to remedy years of neglect in this sector and to give those in our society who are in real need the capital investment they urgently require.  The programme of work facing a caring, sensitive and responsive Government and a Minister with a more positive attitude towards and interest in the workings of his Department is clearly set out in the two reports to which the motion refers, Towards an Independent Future and Strategy for Equality.  These reports contain several hundred recommendations which the pro&mdash;Government Independents would do well to study and which the Government would do well to implement.  I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion which has been tabled jointly by the Members of the Opposition and by a number of Independent Deputies. It is appalling that people with disabilities face <Col N="1016" /> hardship at a time when the Minister for Finance is collecting enormous amounts of money and when there has been talk of between £500 million and £700 million being made available through extra taxes.  During the period when the country underwent a serious economic crisis, it was not always possible to provide facilities or funding for people with mental and physical disabilities and the many other people who require extra care. However, there is no excuse why the Minister cannot provide the money to make life marginally better for those who suffer with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I gained a small sense of how difficult life can be for people with disabilities when my mother, who died last year, became disabled and was obliged to use a wheelchair.  Many places became inaccessible to her and if we wanted to take her somewhere we had to make special arrangements.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago a group of people in Malahide, the town where I live, decided to take action in order to make certain areas more accessible to wheelchairs.  I assisted their campaign by sitting in a wheelchair and allowing them to push me around Malahide.  I was shocked and appalled by my experience &mdash; it stimulated me to encourage the local council, of which I was a member, to take action &mdash; because I discovered how difficult it is for those in wheelchairs to make their way past street furniture, kerbs, steps, litter bins and carelessly parked cars.  The most ordinary things in life are denied to people with disabilities and sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>On reading the amendment one could be forgiven for thinking that the Minister intends to make a major announcement during the debate because he gives the false impression that an additional £22 million will be made available.  I await his contribution to discover if that is the case, but I suspect it is not.  I hope that after the vote on this motion the Government will be shamed into making some of the additional tax revenue it has collected available to the 140,000 people who must cope with disabilities while the Minister cannot find it in his heart to make available to them the extra funding collected from the health levy.  I hope we will be in a position to thank the Minister tomorrow if he sees fit to make that money available.</P>
      <P>I am not optimistic about what the Minister will say.  He is trying to fool the people listening to the debate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil Éireann recognises the need for the further development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities and approves both the Government's commitment to put in place an enhanced level of service provision in line with the commitments outlined in the programme for <Col N="1017" /> Government and Partnership 2000 and the actions taken by the Government to date in meeting these commitments which include the provision of additional funding of £22.4 million.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we have to listen to such comments from a Deputy who was her party's number two in government and did not do much when she had the opportunity.  The white flag has been raised by the Opposition.  It does not want to compare its record with that of the Government on any of these issues as it knows it does not have a leg to stand on.  The line being taken is that this is the first opportunity to do something about them.  The leader of the Labour Party adopted this line in the debate on the Private Members' motion on learning disabilities.  As Minister for Finance he announced three budgets involving the expenditure of £40 billion across all line Departments.  In adopting this line of argument he is insulting people's intelligence.</P>
    <P>There is another problem that it appears no one wants to address.  A sum of £2 billion is being paid out each year in interest repayments.  If this could be reduced to £1.7 billion, there would be an additional £300 million available to deal with issues such as these.  The idea that the national debt should be reduced is being decried.  Interest repayments are crippling the country and have deprived us of untold billions.  Up to ten years ago budgets meant nothing and we thought we could spend our way out of trouble but all we did was put ourselves in deeper trouble and mortgaged the futures of hundreds of thousands of people, especially those about whom we are speaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>I listened in silence for 40 minutes to contributions from the opposite side of the House.  I am as concerned as Deputy Owen about these issues which I want to deal with properly. If interest payments of £40 million a week could be reduced, there would be more money available to deal with them.</P>
      <P>The Opposition made no attempt to defend its record in government or compare it with that of the Government over the past 18 months.  It does people with disabilities a disservice in suggesting there is a golden opportunity to address these issues.  It is a facile argument.  The objective is not professional accountancy, as the Green Party suggests, but to ensure the Minister for Health and Children will have much more money at his or her disposal to provide the required services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on issues related to the provision of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities and to outline the Government's plan to meet the needs of this group.  The Government fully supports the principle that people with disabilities are entitled to all the rights and privileges which <Col N="1018" /> go with citizenship and that any and every barrier to the enjoyment of these rights and privileges should be removed.  These barriers have been identified by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in its report, A Strategy for Equality.  In drawing up its recommendations the commission adopted three guiding principles &mdash; equality, maximising participation and enabling independence and choice.  The overall thrust of health policy for people with disabilities is to provide the supports necessary to enable each individual to live in the community with the maximum possible degree of independence.</P>
    <P>Ensuring equality, participation and independence for people with disabilities involves much more than health services appropriate to their needs.  People with disabilities are tired of what they call &ldquo;the health model of disability&rdquo;.  They wish to be treated the same as their fellow citizens by having services delivered to them by the mainstream agencies, that is, the agency that provides the service for the rest of the community.  This is one of the objectives set out by the commission in its report.  The pursuit of this objective is a fundamental element of the Government's policy on people with disabilities.  As it involves a wide range of services crossing numerous boundaries of Government Departments, the Government decided on day one to appoint one person to co-ordinate efforts to achieve this objective.  That person is the Minister for State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, who has responsibility for all matters related to disability.  The appointment of a Minister of State with special responsibility for disability issues is a clear indication of the Government's determination to tackle not just health issues but all issues affecting people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>A specific commitment is given in the programme for Government to the implementation of the commission's report.  The practical steps needed to develop services within my area of responsibility are outlined in the report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future.  A commitment to implement the recommendations of this report is given in Partnership 2000 which states that &ldquo;resources will be allocated, within overall expenditure parameters, for the development of services for people with disabilities in line with the Report of the Review Group&rdquo;.  A commitment was also given in the Department's strategy statement, 1998-2001, which undertakes to pursue the development of services for people with disabilities in line with the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>There are no definitive statistics for the number of people with physical and sensory disabilities. Based on population trends in other countries it has been variously estimated that the number here could be anywhere between 100,000 and 200,000.  Not every person with a physical or sensory disability is in need of a health service.  The <Col N="1019" /> report, Towards an Independent Future, highlighted the lack of reliable information on the numbers and service needs of people with physical and sensory disabilities and recommended the establishment by the Department, health boards and voluntary bodies of a database on the health service needs of people with physical and sensory disabilities.  As a first step the review group recommended the establishment by the Department of a database development committee to prepare detailed proposals for the development of the database.  Nominations for membership have now been made and the committee will begin its work next month.  A joint database pilot project has been undertaken in three health boards and this will provide a valuable impetus to the work of the committee.</P>
    <P>Once established the database will provide reliable and up-to-date information for a number of separate but related purposes.  It will provide epidemiological information at national level to describe the prevalence and, where possible, annual incidence of the various types of disability and to provide a baseline from which trends can be monitored over time; provide the factual information necessary for the orderly planning of service developments at national, regional and sub-regional level, including prioritising service needs and assisting in decisions on the allocation of resources; enable individual health boards and other service providers to maintain, at their discretion, data for their own purposes such as the development of group or individual care plans; and it will provide a valuable resource for the purposes of research.</P>
    <P>One of the basic recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is the establishment of a national disability authority. Progress is continuing on the implementation of the report of the establishment group on the new national disability authority.  As the House is aware, the establishment group is currently analysing and discussing the practical implementation of the report, Building a Future Together, which was approved by the Government earlier this year.  All relevant Government Departments and agencies are fully engaged in this process.</P>
    <P>The final stages in the preparation of the national disability authority Bill have been reached.  I give credit to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, for her contribution to achieving this progress.  Her determination to see matters through has meant that the impetus for change will not be lost.  Credit is also due to the staff of the NRB.  Without their valuable input and co-operation over the past three decades or so, we would not have reached the stage we are at now &mdash; improving, advancing and reshaping the State's apparatus for the delivery of services for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise the importance of their contribution. I take this opportunity to thank all the staff at the NRB.  The imminent dissolution of the <Col N="1020" /> NRB signals not the end of its influence but a milestone in the beginning of a whole new emphasis for the delivery of services for people with disabilities.  The proposed reconfiguration of institutional responsibilities for these services will ensure a more targeted and inclusive approach.</P>
    <P>The planned changes should be effected early next year.  The knock-on effect of the transfer and the mainstreaming of vocational training and employment opportunities for people with disabilities within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will free up my Department to concentrate fully on its primary role which is to provide rehabilitative training and care services, and appropriate work opportunities for people with disabilities.  The aim will be to equip and enable them where possible to advance through the training continuum to other mainstream activities.</P>
    <P>Currently some £18 million is provided through the Operational Programme for Human Resources, from the European Social Fund, on an annual basis towards the cost of vocational training for people with disabilities.  This funding supports vocational training services and the very important work of many service providers.  A sum of £33 million pounds has been provided through the same operational programme from the European Regional Development fund over the five year period 1994-95.  This funding has been made available towards the purchase of new centres, the upgrading of existing centres and for equipment.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in developing services for people with physical and sensory disabilities is the very wide range and variety of disabilities included in that category.  This makes the development of the services rather complex. From time to time a certain group will mount a campaign for the development of a particular service. Respite care and personal assistance services are examples.  While these and other services are of vital importance and are among the priority areas for development, they cannot be treated in isolation.  What is involved is a wide range of interlocking and complementary services, designed to provide the person with a disability with a flexible range of services.  Many individuals with disabilities may require a combination of several services to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>To clarify the complex issues involved and to provide a blueprint for the development of the services my predecessor, Dr. John O'Connell established on 30 June 1992 the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities. The terms of reference of the group were :</P>
    <P>To examine the current provision of health care services to people with physical and sensory disabilities and to consider how they should be developed to meet more effectively their needs and specifically to make recommendations for service developments in accordance with the commitment contained in <Col N="1021" /> Section IV, Paragraph 33 of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</P>
    <P>The Minister requested the group to prepare an interim report on the most urgent service needs so that these could be considered in the context of developments under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress in 1993.  The interim report was submitted to the Minister in December 1992.  On foot of the interim report, additional revenue funding of £1.5 million was made available in 1993 for the development of the services and a pattern established whereby additional development funding is provided every year.</P>
    <P>The final report of the review group, Towards an Independent Future, was published in December 1996.  It set out the requirements for the development of the services over a five year period.  I am committed to the implementation of the report.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate to have a culture of concern for the welfare of our fellow citizens.  This is manifested by the considerable number of people who work tirelessly both in a voluntary capacity and on a professional basis with voluntary agencies in providing a wide range of supports and services to their fellow citizens.  The effect of this is most evident in the health sector where many voluntary agencies provide services which have, over time, become a vital part of our overall scheme of health care delivery.  This was fully recognised by the review group in looking at the organisation of services.  The group recommended the structured involvement of the voluntary agencies in planning and co-ordinating the services and in fixing priorities for the allocation of funding for the development of the services.</P>
    <P>The review group's recommendation was that the chief executive officer of each health board should establish a regional co-ordinating committee for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Membership of the committee would comprise officers of the health board, major voluntary sector services providers, representatives of service users, that is, people with disabilities and the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
    <P>These committees have now been established in every health board.  My Department is currently pursuing a review of the operation of the committees in consultation with the health boards and the voluntary organisations concerned.  The purpose of the review is to identify best practice, to encourage a cross-fertilisation of ideas across the regions, to come up with solutions to any teething problems which may have arisen and to contribute to the development of overall national policy.</P>
    <P>Voluntary service cannot be mentioned without referring to the invaluable contribution made by carers.  It is estimated that there are about 100,000 carers in lreland, 25,000 of whom provide care on a full-time basis.  Although the majority of these care for an elderly person, a sizeable proportion provide care for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> People with disabilities living at home require assistance with the tasks of daily living and often the responsibility for the care rests with one person principally.  The review group report acknowledges the need to expand and develop different levels of home support services for people with disabilities and their carers.  The crucial role of the carer is taken into account in the planning of services with, for instance, the strong emphasis placed on the development of respite care services, which benefit both the person with a disability and the carer.  The provision of this and other support services with the object of enabling the person with a disability to remain in the home serve the dual purpose of promoting independent living for the person with a disability and of taking as much pressure as possible off the carer.</P>
    <P>There has been a long running campaign by the Centre for Independent Living for a personal assistance service funded by an independent living fund.  A personal assistant provides assistance at the discretion and direction of a person with a disability with everyday tasks, such as personal care, household tasks etc., which the person is unable to do for him or herself.  A full PA service is defined by the Centre for Independent Living as a need for at least 20 hours service per week. One person can require up to 105 hours, necessitating the employment of three PA's and can cost in excess of £20,000 per annum.  The independent living fund is no more than a model for funding a PA service.  The important thing is that the service itself be provided to those needing it &mdash; the precise manner of funding it is a detail.  The PA service is one of a range of support services designed to enable people with disabilities to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence.  The range includes home helps, home care attendants, respite care, day care etc. and the objective of policy is to develop the range of services as a whole.  The amount of funding to be devoted to the development of this service will be decided in each health board area in accordance with locally perceived priorities.  Out of £3 million provided for development of services in 1998, £113,000 was allocated by the boards to personal assistance services.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding, the review group report set out the requirements for the development of the services over a five year period.  It specified numbers of additional places in services such as long-term residential and respite care and day care and numbers of additional staff, such as therapists and nurses.  The review group estimated the cost of implementing its recommendations at £50 million over the five year period.</P>
    <P>A major proportion of the services for people with disabilities are provided by agencies in the voluntary sector.  Very often the provision of services was in response to demands for services from their own members.  Some of these could be funded out of fundraising income but not all.  A situation developed over a period of years where services were not fully funded by the State.  In <Col N="1023" /> recent years with falling income from fundraising most agencies have been running services at a loss and thereby building up debts.  One of the basic recommendations of the review group is that existing services be put on a firm financial footing to provide a sound basis for future development. In 1998, £2.4 million has been provided in my Department's Estimates towards the elimination of this underfunding by the State.  In addition, in 1997, a Supplementary Estimate of £5 million was provided to eliminate the accumulated deficits of these agencies.</P>
    <P>One of the areas singled out by people with disabilities and their advocates is aids and appliances for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Shortly after taking office this Government took an early opportunity to alleviate this problem when, on 27 October 1997, decided, with the agreement of my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, to make £4.325 million available out of savings on his Department's Vote for aids, appliances and equipment for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  It is estimated that more than 10,000 people with disabilities benefited.  A further £1 million in capital funding was made available to health boards in 1998 for aids and appliances.  Notwithstanding this funding, it was brought to my attention recently that there are still substantial waiting lists in health boards for aids and appliances and, as I announced earlier, I have decided to allocate a further £4 million to help eliminate these waiting lists.  This will be distributed on a regional basis through health boards to specific organisations. The Irish Wheelchair Association will receive £1.5 million; Cerebral Palsy Ireland will receive £500,000; the Rehab group will receive £500,000; the Central Remedial Clinic will receive £500,000; the National Rehabilitation Hospital will receive £100,000; £500,000 will be allocated for sensory disabilities; and £400,000 will be allocated for other organisations.</P>
    <P>I expect the agencies will work closely with the health boards to ensure primacy is given to those already identified as waiting for aids and appliances.  It is important that there continues to be a high level of co-operation between statutory and voluntary bodies to ensure services are provided in an orderly and planned way.</P>
    <P>This year a total of £8.4 million was allocated to the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Of this, £2.4 million was devoted to eliminating core underfunding of existing services and nine of the main voluntary agencies in the sector received grants for this purpose.  A further £3 million was for capital projects, £1 million of which was invested in aids and appliances.  The balance of £3 million was allocated to health boards for further development of the services.  Almost half of this funding was used to create 50 new posts in health boards such as speech and language therapists, <Col N="1024" /> physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers and public health nurses.</P>
    <P>In terms of new structures put in place to facilitate the co-ordination of existing services and to make the development of services more effective and the allocation of substantial additional funding, this Government's commitment to improving the quality of life of people with physical and sensory disabilities is clearly demonstrated.  Following the publication of the report, Towards an Independent Future, in December 1996, the previous Government provided a total of £3.688 million in 1997.  Since taking office my Government has to date provided a total of £22.4 million for these services.  No matter how you parse and analyse those figures, the performance of the present Government in pursuing the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities cannot be faulted in comparison with the previous Administration.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is an important one, particularly on the eve of budget day, when the Government will have at its disposal an unprecedented budgetary surplus. The Government can choose to bank this surplus or to invest it in key areas of social and economic need which have been neglected for a long time. One such area of extreme need is that of physical and sensory disability.</P>
      <P>In the limited time available, I wish to address the huge inadequacies which exist in the support structures for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  In particular, I wish to look at the shortfalls in the provision of carers and personal assistants for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>In acknowledging the need to build an inclusive society, the needs of people with a disability should be fully considered in terms of empowerment in the context of the tomorrow's budget.  As we become a more affluent society, it is important to ensure that those who require care are looked after in the most adaptable and comfortable way possible.  To this end, the area of home care needs to be supported and expanded.  The key deficits in the lives of people with disabilities are those of mobility, integration and communication.  These are basic rights of all citizens.  We are not talking about charity; we are talking about rights and human dignity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Care in the home is generally the most desirable form of care from the point of view of the person requiring the care and family members. For many, the thought of entering a home can be <Col N="1025" /> a source of great distress.  Family members often feel compromised because the lack of financial resources prevents them from being able to leave work and act as a carer.</P>
    <P>The current punitive means test for the carer's allowance does nothing to alleviate this dilemma. The income disregard for the carer's allowance is only £150.  While wages are still relatively low, the punitive means test does not make it practical for a person to leave a job and become a carer as he or she would end up substantially worse off.</P>
    <P>Most carers provide a 24 hour service in their homes.  A ten hour break from this routine, as provided, in fairness, by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, is still highly insufficient.  We need further reform which would allow carers to take holidays each year without a threat to their payment.  There is also a need to increase the availability of respite care through employing home care assistants as well as places in the community.</P>
    <P>As it stands, many people with physical and sensory disabilities require part-time or full-time assistance in the form of a personal assistant. Many personal assistants are employed under the community employment programme, which this Government proposes to cut.  The work which these personal assistants do is invaluable and they should be funded through the social economy initiative under the Partnership 2000 programme.</P>
    <P>The temporary and short-term nature of CE neither benefits the person with the disability nor the personal assistant.  By mainstreaming their work and providing specific training for personal assistants, substantial inroads could be made in the area of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow is an important day.  It is a day to reward those who have waited the longest for basic services.  I sincerely hope that wait is over for those with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> In the short time available to me, I extend my solidarity and that of the Socialist Party to those in our society who are struggling with physical and sensory disabilities, the organisations which represent them, and families and carers who must carry such a major portion of responsibility for their loved ones.</P>
      <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association, in one of the briefing documents which I studied for this debate, lays out clearly what is called for in practical terms.  From its expert knowledge in the area, it states that 2,667 people must be accommodated in day care and day activity centres.  Of those, 1,248 are not getting out of their homes.  It is unacceptable that people should be isolated and helpless simply due to a lack of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The association also outlined the people who need aids and appliances.  Again we are talking about small amounts of money &mdash; £5 million for aids and appliances in the short-term.  They further outline the number of people who need assistance in their homes with dressing, toiletry, feeding and so on.  There is no question that the <Col N="1026" /> tolerance and compassion of carers has been abused and used by successive Governments beyond any reasonable expectation.</P>
    <P>The compassion of carers is bottomless but their physical reserves of energy and their emotional reserves are not.  Many people are crying out for modest assistance such as respite care or a break at weekends.  Even those modest improvements would be a great help in their quality of life.  Yet our society denigrates not only those with disabilities but those who are employed as home helps by the health boards to care for them in a small way.  Only two weeks ago in the Dáil I exposed the Southern Health Board as paying £2 per hour to home helps for the huge range of strenuous tasks they do in assisting people who are not able to look after themselves. What an insult to those workers and to the people for whom they care.  Other boards are somewhat more generous but do not show any understanding of the needs of the disabled or those who look after them.</P>
    <P>The terms of this motion outline the least that can be done in the short-term.  It is tiresome to hear the Government and parties of previous Governments pretending to argue across the floor over spending and to see them looking at their various policy documents.  All Governments and political parties which have been in Government recently bear full responsibility for the dereliction of duty to those with disabilities, their carers and their families.</P>
    <P>In the last budget this Government handed back a fortune to speculators and the very wealthy by cutting capital gains tax.  A previous Government handed back between £0.5 billion and £1 billion to the super wealthy, tax dodgers, criminals and so on in an amnesty &mdash; funding which is desperately needed and would be well utilised by those about whom we are talking. Other powerful institutions, such as the banks, have been exposed as defrauding the taxpayer and the taxation system of a fortune which could have gone to caring for people in need.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion and the fact that it received cross party support on this side of the House, including support from an independent Deputy.  This motion is about equality and addressing inequalities.  The key principle underlining the recommendations in the reports, A Strategy for Equality and Towards an Independent Future, is equality.  People with physical and sensory disabilities must be recognised and treated as equal to all other citizens.  Now is the time for positive action to address inequalities and to give people the opportunity and facilities to direct their lives and to participate in education, employment, sport and cultural activities, all of which are taken for granted by those without a disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the issue of aids and appliances was addressed by the Minister.  I welcome the provision of £4 million to meet an unmet need in this area.  Will this, as the Minister said, eliminate the <Col N="1027" /> waiting list?  My information is that a similar amount granted in this area alleviated 10 per cent only of the application for such aids.  This figure will not meet the requirements of many who are on waiting lists for an appliance to ease the burden to themselves, their families and their carers. We are talking about expensive equipment.  A motorised wheelchair can cost up to £4,000 or more and the grant available towards this necessary equipment is £500.</P>
    <P>Disability resource centres operating support services for people with disability on a national network have been recommended.  They will provide information to people with disabilities, will give them necessary advice, guidance and support and will help them assess their entitlements to services.  The majority of these resource centres exist through the community employment programme. According to a figure from the Irish Wheelchair Association, more than 1,248 people rarely get out of their houses &mdash; they are prisoners in their own homes.</P>
    <P>The situation in Cork is a national disgrace.  At present nearly 100 people with physical disability are waiting for a place at a resource centre.  There is no significant resource centre in the city and the Irish Wheelchair Association depends on a single unit dwelling to provide a day resource centre.  This building is not suitable for the needs of the community as it can only accommodate six wheelchairs at any one time.  The capital cost for this building is £200,000.  This matter was not mentioned by the Minister but I hope he has given it some consideration.  Perhaps there will be better news for us in Cork in tomorrow's budget.</P>
    <P>Personal assistants were mentioned and we cannot underestimate their value to somebody who is confined to a wheelchair and is unable to take care of himself.  Personal assistants open up education and employment opportunities and facilitates disabled people in taking their place in society, which is right and just.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago a number of people travelled from all corners of the country to the Dáil to voice their concerns about the lack of funding.  I would like to let their voices be heard tonight by quoting from a briefing document I received.</P>
    <P>Tax cuts are no use to me, I need services to dress and feed me and to take me to the toilet. It is degrading and unfair to be always dependent on family and friends to assist with personal matters.  With the right wheelchair I could be so independent.  If it was not for the few people who have to call to the house I would never get to talk to anyone.</P>
    <P>That is what we are talking about &mdash; the need to address inequality and to provide equality for the 140,000 people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>

      <P>I am glad to contribute to this brief debate.  It is impossible to deal with a problem when one does not know its scale.  It is beyond <Col N="1028" /> my understanding that the Department of Health and Children is not in a position to have an accurate account of the scale, nature and categories of this problem.</P>
      <P>There are an estimated 140,000 people with physical or sensory disabilities.  Christmas will come tomorrow for many people but in the confusion of millions of pounds being bandied around the Chamber, there will be thousands left on the sidelines and forgotten about.  This is a case of pride versus competence.  Recently, I met a lorry driver who was involved in a crash a number of years ago and is paralysed from the neck down.  He came to me with his personal assistant. He is a grown man who has to be brought to the toilet, changed, fed and dressed and he needs somebody to get him out of and into bed.  Yet in his eyes he had a burning ambition to play his part, as he now can, in modern society.  All these people want is a recognition of their right to do that and assistance from the State to help them. It is not beyond the competence of Government to help when it has £1 billion at the disposal of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The Wheelchair Association organised a very effective lobby outside the gates of the House a number of weeks ago.  That was only a lobby but we should look behind it at those who got up at 4 a.m. with or without their personal assistants and travelled here on a wet and dreary November day to make their protest outside the gates of a democratic parliament.  I hope the Government was listening.</P>
      <P>The Centre for Independent Living, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Cheshire Homes and other such organisations take great pride in their work.  The Government must recognise this and provide appropriate facilities for the physically handicapped.  Last week the Muintir Mhaigh Eo Association in Dublin raised £50,000 for the Cheshire Home at its annual function.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the Government cracking the whip.  For disabled people there should be access to all public buildings, post offices, local authority offices and the offices of the Revenue Commissioners.  The distance between train platforms and carriages should also be improved. After much pressure over recent years, one space is available for wheelchair users in the dining carriage of trains, but other users must wait between carriages until it becomes free, which is dangerous.</P>
      <P>The Barony of Erris, which is as big geographically as County Louth, would like to provide a centre with appropriate facilities so that disabled people could meet on social occasions.  I have received letters from people who cannot get in or out of a bath or shower because they have no handrails.  The walls of their houses must be knocked down to make them accessible to wheelchairs. I pay tribute to the large number of committed people who work in the area of physical and sensory disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to preside over a Department which does not know the scale of this <Col N="1029" /> problem and is, therefore, not in a position to deal with it.  The opportunity to resolve this issue rarely comes around and I would like the Government to avail of it.  I know the Minister is competent to deal with it, but he must have the political will to use the money provided by the taxpayer to deal with the legitimate needs of approximately 140,000 disabled people.  The Minister will give these people confidence and courage to live their lives if he decides to resolve this problem and not to waste any more time.</P>

      <P>This is the time to make a case for a better deal for the physically handicapped. I have not seen a better opportunity in my 21 years in this House.  We are experiencing the greatest economic activity for many years. Our growth rate is increasing so quickly we have almost outstripped every other economy in the world.</P>
      <P>We should spare a thought for the people who contributed and continue to contribute to our economy, such as those who were disabled due to accidents or those born with a physical handicap. I know many disabled people who are confident, tenacious, brave and resilient, yet there is a limit to what they can do for themselves.</P>
      <P>I was fortunate in recent months to be associated with a branch of the Irish Wheelchair Association in Tuam which is trying to provide a day care service for wheelchair users and their families within a 20 mile radius of the town.  This ambitious project will cost a great deal of money. It is proposed to use buses to bring wheelchair users to this purpose built centre every day.  The group has applied for planning permission to build this centre, but it has a long way to go before the project is completed.  The people of Tuam and other areas around the country must get an equal share of the booming economy.</P>
      <P>Wheelchair users will be able to avail of this facility at least five days a week.  Meals, recreational activities and personal care will be provided and a modern library will be established, which is extremely important.  Many physically handicapped people have the ability to take up jobs under certain conditions and the proposed day care centre in Tuam will give them the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>Personal assistants are important for independent living.  As a member of the Committee on Finance and General Affairs in the last Government, I heard submissions from several hundred people and groups, including the Centre for Independent Living.  It convinced me that the personal assistant scheme is important for those who use it and for creating employment.  This scheme has worked extremely well in America.  My research shows that it is an excellent service.  However, it has not been placed on a sound footing.  A person who uses this service cannot be sure it will be available next year.  That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day care centre in Tuam will cost between £400,000 and £500,000.  I make no apologies to any Government for insisting that the committee <Col N="1030" /> in Tuam is entitled to its fair share of the economic cake.  It has spent every day for the past ten years organising flag days and other fund-raising activities.  If ever a group was entitled to a substantial slice of the budget, this is it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> There is no auto turning training centre in this country.  Mechanical engineering continues to stride ahead, yet it does so handicapped and hamstrung.  This industry requires specialist, precision, highly-trained auto turners.  In 1996, the industry took the initiative. It identified its needs and a solution &mdash; an auto turning school of excellence.  This heralded the possibility of a new, exciting venture which would be a partnership between FÁS and the industry. This was a novel approach and was the perfect marriage based on a partnership approach.</P>
      <P>FÁS was to provide the training and the industry would provide the plant and all the machinery. A series of businesslike meetings took place.  I attended several of them and was amazed at the enthusiasm and determination on both sides.  It looked as if everything was set for the most perfect industrial marriage one could imagine.</P>
      <P>A curriculum expert was appointed and the curriculum was agreed.  Ballina, County Mayo, was identified as the most suitable location.  A site was identified adjacent to the FÁS training centre in Ballina and planning permission was obtained. A 10,000 square foot building was mooted and a general specification agreed.  A building contractor came up with a novel and progressive approach which seemed acceptable to FÁS.  This approach was a build and lease back proposal.</P>
      <P>When the rainbow Government left office in 1997 it was all systems go as regards this project. I have a letter on file from Mr. John Lynch, director general of FÁS, dated 14 March 1997, in which he indicates that he would bring the project to the board of FÁS at the earliest possible date. He also gave the assurance that FÁS was progressing the project with due haste.  However, there has been no progress since.  The project seems bogged down and matters are at a standstill. What looked like the perfect partnership, a novel venture and an exciting approach, seems lost in some lacuna.  This project is a first for the industry and for FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after the closure of Asahi last year with the loss of 260 jobs, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, visited Ballina and set up a task force.  This task force had a tailor made venture on its desk which was ready to go, namely, the auto turning centre. However, this project is no further progressed today.  I have not seen any jobs delivered to Ballina by this task force.  This makes me extremely <Col N="1031" /> sceptical about task forces in areas experiencing industrial difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will cite Coca Cola.  However, this project was well in the pipeline by the time this Government took office.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> The industry has assured me that its needs have never been greater.  Those needs have expanded.  There are more exports and there is more competition.  Standards have gone up and people want items made to higher specifications.  This centre would raise industry standards to new heights and bring new results. However, there are no optimistic indications as to the future of this project which only required the push of a button to go ahead.  Where stands this project and what developments can be expected in Ballina?  Everything seemed ready to go 16 months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to the proposed auto turning centre is that Auto Turning Excellence Ireland, a non-profit making company, limited by guarantee, approached FÁS in 1995 with a proposal to establish a centre of excellence in auto turning to be located in the west.  It was proposed that the centre should train people in the operation and setting of the machine tools used to produce precision engineered components.  FÁS appointed an external consultant to evaluate the proposal.</P>
      <P>In late 1997, following its consideration of the consultant's report, FÁS made an offer of assistance to the promoters.  I understand the FÁS response to the promoters was based on the essential underlying rationale that the proposed centre would be industry-led.  That is to say, it would be driven by industry needs and managed by the industry.  The question of official approval for the centre does not arise.  The only point at issue is the level of FÁS support which may be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Against that background, I understand the FÁS proposal involves a financial contribution towards the operation of the centre and the provision of training allowances for new trainees at the centre.  These would be paid at standard FÁS rates.  In line with the industry-driven nature of the proposal, the management and day-to-day operation of the centre would be the responsibility of Auto Turning Excellence Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes the increasing involvement of industry in determining and addressing its developmental needs.  My Department is collaborating with the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation in the establishment of an employer-led training network programme which will commence shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the new indigenous development agency, Enterprise Ireland, is implementing a <Col N="1032" /> client-centered business development model involving a close partnership between the State and industry in the drive for sustainable, competitive advantage.  I welcome the positive response by FÁS to the proposal from Auto Turning Excellence Ireland, which has been framed in the context of support for an industry-led initiative. Equally, I share the agency's concern to ensure that an appropriate balance of assistance is struck which maintains the essential industry-led character of the project and provides good value for money for the Exchequer resources applied to it.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the very strenuous demands being placed on the State training infrastructure. We are facing an unprecedented demand for skills in response to the continuing accelerated growth of the economy.  The Government is responding to this challenge on a range of fronts.  I have provided additional resources in the 1999 Estimates to allow FÁS to cater for significantly increased apprentice numbers and to address the recommendations of the expert skills group on the provision of training in information technology and electronics.  I again stress that I am positively disposed to industry-led initiatives. I encourage FÁS and Auto Turning Excellence Ireland to make every effort to engage in constructive dialogue and to bring the matter to a conclusion as soon as possible.  I will ensure that the concerns expressed in the House are brought to the attention of FÁS immediately.</P>
    <P>I also stress the constant commitment to this project of the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who is the local Deputy.  I have discussed this matter with the promoters and they have my full support.  It is now a matter for the industry and FÁS to bring this project to a positive conclusion. This was an unfinished symphony which the Government inherited and we are confident we can conclude the matter in the interests of north Mayo, the west and the industry.  The Deputy and the House can be assured that the Government will continue to make further investment in north Mayo as soon as possible, similar to investment in the recent Coca Cola project which will create many jobs.  Other Members and parts of Ireland were not pleased that project went to Ballina. However, the Government made the decision on a regional basis and the need to provide jobs and economic growth in north Mayo.  That will continue to be the hallmark of the Government while in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This serious issue is slightly different from that being raised by Deputy Brendan Smith, but they are related.  I raise this matter because the herds of two of my neighbours have been stricken with bovine tuberculosis.  In one instance, 18 cattle have been slaughtered.  It is devastating for a farmer to have his animals identified as being infected, brought to a factory and slaughtered.  One of these neighbours had a suckler herd consisting of some half bred cattle and <Col N="1033" /> some pure bred Charolais cows.  I would like the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food to explain how the factory decided the price this farmer would be paid for these slaughtered animals and to tell me what becomes of these cattle when they are slaughtered.</P>
      <P>Let me give some examples of the prices paid by the factory.  For 18 cattle this farmer received £2,113.  96.  Some of the prices were outrageous and scandalous.  For an animal weighing 179 kilogrammes he received 14 pence per lb which came to £55.53 for his cow.  For an animal weighing 183 kilogrammes he was paid 14 pence per lb which came to £56.  For an animal weighing 153 kilogrammes he was paid 18 pence per lb which came to £60.98 and for one weighing 215 kilogrammes he was also paid 18 pence per lb which came to £85.40. My neighbour suffered the loss of his herd and the factory insulted him with these prices.  I do not know how the prices of 14 and 18 pence per lb were arrived at.</P>
      <P>Who sets these prices and what happens to the carcases when the animals are slaughtered?  Are they used for pet food?  A tin of Pedigree dog food costs 70 pence.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us assume that half the dog food consists of meat.  The return on one of those cattle, if it were used for pet food would be approximately £4 per lb.  That represents a mark&mdash;up of more than 300 per cent.  That is not acceptable. The onus is on the Minister to ensure farmers are protected.  It is devastating for a farmer to have his herd destroyed, but he must at least be assured of fair compensation.  No one expects a meat factory to pay the top price for cattle slaughtered in these circumstances, but I do not understand how the price of 14p per lb is calculated.</P>
      <P>I understand the rate of compensation varies from a maximum of £600 for pedigree cattle or top&mdash;yielding dairy cows to a minimum of £400.  I would have expected my neighbour to receive the bottom rate of compensation of £400 for cattle which would have been worth between £800 and £900.  How can he replace his herd?  The Minister must ensure farmers are properly compensated at the factories or replace that system of compensation with the system that applies to BSE cattle, where the Department values the cattle on the farm, buys them and compensates the farmer. The families of my neighbours are facing poverty and their devastation is heartbreaking.</P>
      <P>The Minister must tell us how he proposes to deal with this situation and how he will compensate my neighbour, whom I will not humiliate by naming in the House.  I will give his name to the Minister after the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy John Brady.  You are aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, of the intense anger among <Col N="1034" /> the farming community at the scandalously low prices being paid for cattle by meat factories.  On a number of occasions I have raised in the House the serious difficulties facing pig producers, particularly in the Border region.  These difficulties arose from a combination of over-supply of pig meat in the European Union and a lack of adequate slaughtering capacity in the northern part of the country.  Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators have raised with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and other members of the Government our serious concerns about the cattle trade and the serious difficulties facing the beef sector.</P>
      <P>On 12 November last, I raised this issue with the Minister for Agriculture and Food during Question Time.  He responded by saying:</P>
      <P>There is scope for much further improvement in view of the 9p per lb increase in refunds, the flexibility of intervention arrangements and the relatively strong market prices in the European Union.  I expect Irish beef processors to make full use of the supports available and to pass back to producers the full benefits in the prices paid for cattle.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, meat processors have not responded to the Minister's request or to the new market conditions which arose from the increase in export refunds or the improved intervention system.  There is no reason meat factories could not increase prices immediately, and at least a 6p in the lb increase is essential for the primary producer, the farmer.  The very survival of many farmers depends on an immediate increase in prices.</P>
      <P>In early October, the Minister secured an increase in export refunds of 9p per lb.  Unfortunately, none of that increase was passed on to the farmers.  Again, the processors have not taken advantage of the newly negotiated intervention package.  Processors did not pass the increase on to farmers, factories failed to make use of the new intervention package which could have provided a valuable outlet for our beef product and the farmer is still being paid a scandalously low price for cattle despite the fact that export refunds are now worth 51p per lb and European Union and third country markets are returning higher prices. Presumably, the Minister is not empowered by law to direct factories to pay a fair price, but I urge him to exert the maximum pressure on meat factories to increase cattle prices with immediate effect.</P>
      <P>The farming community seeks only fair play. They have been denied it and immediate action is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Market prices in the United Kingdom have improved, EU markets remain buoyant and export refunds have improved by 9p per lb since last October.  Factories accept that cattle farmers cannot survive at this autumn's low price of between 74p and 75p per lb and recognise that market returns have improved.  They <Col N="1035" /> must act now by raising prices from the present low levels.</P>
      <P>In addition to the improved market returns, cattle supplies are beginning to tighten this week. UK markets have improved by up to 83p per lb in recent days.  EU markets return an average of 103p per lb.  Prices are 114p per lb in France, 96p per lb in Holland and 137p per lb in Italy.  Third country markets export refunds have increased by 9p per lb to 51p per lb since October and the dollar exchange rate has improved by almost 0.5p in the pound.  Irish factories should improve prices by at least 6p per lb immediately.</P>
      <P>Intervention tenders have not been taken up in full.  Factories must realise the importance of the beef producer to the industry.  If this trend continues we will have fewer and fewer beef producers. The Minister for Agriculture and Food successfully negotiated an increase in export refunds and the restoration of intervention for certain types of cattle.  However, the factories have not passed these benefits on to farmers. While I know their hands are tied regarding what they can do, I appeal to the Minister and Ministers of State to bring pressure to bear on the beef processors to increase prices paid to hard pressed farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Brendan Smith, Boylan and Brady for raising these matters.  Regarding the issue raised by Deputy Smith, our disappointment with the current level of cattle prices paid by meat factories has been made clear on a number of occasions. The disappointment is two-fold.  First, we regret that cattle producers have had to accept extremely low prices and the inevitable consequent economic hardship.  Second, we are disappointed beef processors have not passed on the full benefits of the improved market support arrangements negotiated in the autumn.</P>
      <P>It is appreciated that the loss of the Russian market has created considerable difficulties for the Irish beef industry.  Irish beef exports to Russia amounted to 70,000 tonnes in I997 and were expected to reach similar levels in 1998.  There was always awareness that the loss of such an important market was likely to have an adverse impact on cattle prices and it was for this reason that, early in the Russian crisis, strong representations were made to Commissioner Fischler for the introduction of a more effective intervention system and increased export refunds.  He responded positively to those representations by increasing the maximum carcase weight for intervention to 360 kg and by extending intervention purchasing to grade 04 steers.  Furthermore, export refunds were increased on two separate occasions by a total of 9p per lb.  for beef from male cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The response of the beef processors to the concessions secured has been disappointing.  The quantities offered into intervention were significantly <Col N="1036" /> lower than expected and little, if any, of the increase in export refunds has been passed on to producers.  While intervention should be used sparingly, more effective use could and should have been made of the concessions negotiated.  It is difficult to understand why a proportion of the increase in export refunds has not been passed on to producers.  I acknowledge that, because of the difficult market situation, prices fell in many third country markets.  Nevertheless, I do not believe they fell by the equivalent of 9p a lb.</P>
    <P>Cattle prices on the EU market have remained strong throughout autumn despite the Russian crisis.  That the EU market has remained strong is because beef production in the EU has fallen significantly this year as a result of calf slaughtering measures adopted in October 1996.  This fall in production has created market opportunities for Irish beef exporters, and it is evident from the quantity of export licences issued to Irish beef exporters that a significant quantity of Irish steer beef is currently being exported to EU markets.  It is disappointing that the benefits of selling in these high priced markets are not enjoyed by Irish beef producers.</P>
    <P>While we are disappointed the full benefits of the concessions negotiated are not passed on to producers, I am satisfied that, without these concessions, cattle prices in Ireland would be lower than they are at present.  Cattle prices were in virtual free fall before these measures were introduced and a huge backlog of cattle was building up on farms.  Since the introduction of the measures, cattle prices have increased slightly and the backlog has been more or less removed.  The concessions have been effective in protecting Irish farmers from the worst effects of the Russian crisis.</P>
    <P>Market conditions in the EU have improved in recent weeks and this should continue.  This means there is increasing scope for processors to pay higher prices for cattle.  There is no reason cattle prices in Ireland should remain indefinitely parked just above the safety net level and, as recently as last Friday, I called on processors to pass on to producers a fair share of the improving market returns through a meaningful increase in prices.  I repeat that call now.</P>
    <P>Regarding the matter raised by Deputy Boylan, under current arrangements for the disposal of reactor animals, farmers receive salvage values for carcases from meat factories and compensation related to animal types from my Department. As regards the former, my Department operates a weekly tendering arrangement in respect of reactor animals whereby meat plants make quotations for different categories of stock. The quotations selected reflect the type of reactor animals disclosed, while the prices quoted tend to follow the prices available for the different categories of cattle involved.  Apart from this, my Department also pays for a reactor collection service which provides transport for cattle to the selected meat plant free of charge to herd owners <Col N="1037" /> which can result in a significant cost saving to them.</P>
    <P>Reactor quotations from meat plants are generally lower than those for the general run of cattle and the difference can be significant at certain times, especially when outlets for beef are reduced.  Recently large numbers of cattle have been coming to the market and unfortunately, despite our best efforts, prices paid by factories for all types of cattle remain low.  Concurrent with this is the significant and regrettable increase in the number of reactor animals being disclosed at tests which must be slaughtered.  We anticipate the current relatively low prices for reactors will improve when the current heavy slaughtering concludes and when prices available generally improve.</P>
    <P>The prices received by farmers from factories are supplemented by means of the appropriate reactor grants paid under the non-statutory scheme operated by my Department.  The level of grant rate payable can be substantial.  In the case of dairy cows, up to £600 may be payable by way of grant currently.  Reactor grant levels are reviewed and reset periodically, having regard to the cost of equivalent replacement commercial animals.  Having regard to overall price levels, the current combined factory prices and grant arrangements cover the costs of such cattle.  I will continue to keep the position under review.  The Deputy said he would give me the names of people affected after the debate and I will ensure their situation is examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter.  It is estimated that there are 250,000 asthma sufferers in Ireland.  In the one to 16 year age group, 15 per cent are asthmatics.  In 1980, it was estimated that only 2.5 to 5 per cent of this group suffered from asthma.  Today's 15 per cent estimate is in line with figures produced for Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand.  Asthmatics are not overtly visible in society and only 2 per cent of them are members of the Asthma Society of Ireland.  Until a few years ago, following the death of a school friend, I did not realise an asthma attack could result in loss of life.  I do not suspect I was unique in this as the plight of asthma sufferers lay hidden for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year marks the Asthma Society's 25th anniversary.  The inaugural meeting took place in the old Power's Hotel in 1973.  The society at the time had a two-fold aim with regard to patient information and statutory entitlements.  Following the society's continuous lobbying, the drugs cost subsidisation scheme was introduced by the then Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon.  While this was a welcome improvement for some, poor entitlements are every bit as much a stumbling <Col N="1038" /> block to better asthma control today as it was in the early years.</P>
    <P>At least one in every seven children suffers from asthma.  No one knows why the numbers are rising.  One of the reasons put forward is that children spend more time indoors.  Children watch television for a greater number of hours than before.  There is no cure but there are several treatments which can help control the symptoms. The more one understands about the condition and its treatment, the better are one's chances of keeping it under control.</P>
    <P>Many asthmatics are not aware of how to treat the problem and, in this respect, greater financial support is required for the Asthma Society's educational initiatives, such as the mobile asthma information unit and the asthma telephone help line.  In addition, improved financial support should be made available for medical research.</P>
    <P>Drug treatment plays a vital role in controlling the ailment.  Treatment is by way of inhalers, steroid tablets where appropriate, or injections.  Drug treatment is a continuous process and can prove very expensive.  Fortunately, to date, asthmatics can avail of refunds for expenditure of more than £32 per month under the drug refund scheme.  This pales in comparison to the position of their counterparts in Northern Ireland who enjoy free GP services, free medicines for dependent children and an annual £85 medicines bill for the rest. I fear that any drugs fund reductions may lead to many sufferers cutting back on their treatment.</P>
    <P>Many branches of the Asthma Society do excellent work.  In Arklow, County Wicklow the local branch provides year round swimming and exercise lessons at a cost of £1,500 and they provide seven nebulisers to the local Garda station for use in emergencies by the community at an annual cost of £300.  All their income comes from local fundraising activities.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind the needs of our asthma sufferers as he divides his very substantial budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister who cannot be here to reply to this matter this evening.  I am pleased the Deputy raised it and gave me, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, the opportunity to clarify some issues of concern to people with asthma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of current reports in the media, I assume the Deputy has in mind the level of assistance available to asthma sufferers towards the costs of their drugs and medicines.  Drugs and medicines for the treatment of asthma, are available to medical card holders free of charge.  The present position with regard to non-medical card holders is that help with the cost of drugs and medicines is provided through the community drugs schemes.  Under the drug refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medicine above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded on application to the relevant health board.  There is also <Col N="1039" /> the drug cost subsidisation scheme, which caters for people who do not have a medical card and are certified by their doctor as having a long-term medical condition, with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. People who qualify for inclusion in this scheme do not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    <P>Earlier today, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, announced proposals for the introduction next year of a new improved scheme, the drug payment scheme, which will replace the existing drugs cost subsidisation and drug refund scheme, merge the best elements of both schemes and is designed to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  Under the new drug payment scheme, no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per month for prescribed medicines.  The balance will be met by the State.</P>
    <P>This new scheme will have considerable benefits for asthma sufferers and their families.  With the drug refund scheme, many families have heavy expenditure on drugs and medicines in a quarter and may have to wait a further six weeks from the end of that quarter while their claims are being processed before they can receive their refunds.  In effect, they may have to wait up to four and a half months and incur expenditures in the next quarter before they receive their refunds. In l997 more than 110,000 claims under the drug refund scheme were for claims in excess of £150 per quarter.  Of these, approximately 33,000 were for claims of £300 or more per quarter, or almost £80 per month.</P>
    <P>This can cause considerable cashflow problems for a significant number of families.  This difficulty will not arise under the new drug payment scheme.  The new scheme will allow families to budget for the cost of medicines.  Regardless of <Col N="1040" /> the size of their drugs bill, they will know they do not have to pay more than £42 in any month.</P>
    <P>Because the drug payment scheme will operate on a monthly basis, it will have a distinct advantage over the current drug refund scheme.  Under the refund scheme, a family could, for example, in one month have expenditure of, say, £80 but no expenditure in the other two months.  They would not have been entitled to a refund.  Under the new scheme, they will only have to pay £42 in that month.</P>
    <P>There are also families where one member may qualify for a drug cost subsidisation scheme card but the combined expenditure on medicines by other members may be considerable.  At present, this other expenditure cannot be recouped until the end of the quarter.  This will change with the new drug payment scheme.  Under that scheme no family will have to pay more than £42 in any month for prescribed medicines, a significant benefit for families where a few members may suffer from asthma.  There are no qualifying criteria for the new drug payment scheme, unlike the current drug costs subsidisation scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increase in the threshold, I emphasise there has been no increase in the threshold for the existing schemes since 1991.  It must also be borne in mind that the new threshold refers to family expenditure as opposed to the existing threshold in the drug cost subsidisation scheme which relates to individual expenditure.</P>
    <P>I mention the work of the Asthma Society of Ireland which has done so much to increase awareness of asthma.  The health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children has had ongoing involvement with the Asthma Society and has supported the society through the provision of funding towards the costs involved in providing promotional materials and information leaflets incorporating advice of asthma.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 2 December 1998.</P>

      <P>My Department has produced a discussion paper on strategy for tourism development for the next round of EU Structural Funds. This paper suggests an outline for a new, but considerably refocused, operational programme for tourism, again with subprogrammes covering the three key areas of product development, marketing and training.</P>
      <P>The Department has not to date undertaken or commissioned any specific studies on potential implications for tourism development of the proposed division of the country into two separate regions for the next round of EU Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>However, building on the success achieved by Irish tourism to date, the new direction suggested in the discussion paper for support for product development is founded on a selective approach based on environmentally sensitive, sustainable, tourism and regional development.  By its nature such an approach would favour projects for those areas which are currently underdeveloped for tourism, thereby spreading development and relieving tourism congestion in peak periods.</P>
      <P>This approach can be accommodated on either the basis of two separate regions or existing arrangements, using selective application of possible EU incentives.  Suggested support for international tourism destination marketing and training as envisaged in the decision paper will continue to involve co&mdash;funding from the EU, the State and the private sector, and could similarly be accommodated in the context of the relative future roles of these three parties.</P>
      <P>The implications of either existing arrangements or any new regional basis cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy, however, until the Commission has finalised its position on overall funding and priorities for EU expenditure for the next Community support framework for Ireland.</P>

Under Article 22 of the directive, candidates are selected for invitation to tender from among those qualified in accordance with Articles 24 to 29 thereof.  These requirements were outlined in the tender procedure notice for the project which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on Wednesday, 21 January 1998, and in the Irish media on the following day. The invitation was open to both the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed to provide capital assistance up to a maximum of £6 million and annual operational assistance up to a maximum of £250,000 towards the cost of implementation of the successful tender.</P>
      <P>The deadline for submission of tenders from qualified candidates was last Friday, 27 November 1998 and three tender proposals were received on that date.  These submissions will now undergo a detailed evaluation process and a decision is expected early in the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 55 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully aware of the links between heroin misuse and social exclusion in specific urban areas and is fully committed to tackling the problem of drug abuse in the context of the wider issue of social and economic exclusion.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion has been established under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach to address issues relating to social exclusion.  I report to this committee on the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy and the Local Development Programme.</P>
      <P>Under the National Drugs Strategy, local drugs task forces have been set up in Dublin and north Cork city to develop locally based, integrated responses to the drug problem in the worst affected parts of these cities.</P>
      <P>The Government has allocated £10 million to support the implementation of action plans prepared by the local drugs task forces.  As projects approved in the plans come on stream, funding is drawn down through Departments and agencies identified as appropriate channels for funding. The pace of drawdown is increasing as more projects get up and running.  To date, over £5.3 million has been drawn down to implement over 160 of the 234 approved projects, which are mostly community-based.</P>
      <P>A report on an external evaluation of the drugs initiative was recently considered by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion.  The evaluation found that the task forces have achieved a number of significant successes in the short time since they were established and that their existence has provided a strong focus for tackling drugs issues in target areas, reducing the feeling of isolation felt by many local communities and preventing a potentially critical solution from developing into a downward spiral of economic deprivation, addiction and crime.</P>
      <P>Arising from recommendations in the evaluation, the Cabinet committee has agreed, in principle, to the continuation of the local drugs task forces for the time being to facilitate the putting in place of an evaluation framework which includes: clear statements of the overall aim of the initiative, the specific objectives arising from this aim and the specific targets arising from these objectives, quantified where possible; and appropriate macro&mdash;level monitoring arrangements to allow performance against stated objectives and targets to be measured.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a full review of task forces, having regard to the findings and recommendations of the evaluation, has already begun with a view to submitting a more detailed response to the Cabinet committee at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the provision of treatment and rehabilitation services, the Government is committed <Col N="1046" /> to focusing on the development of preventative measures as part of its overall drugs strategy.  The purpose of the young people's facilities and services fund, established by the Government earlier this year, is to assist in the development of preventative strategies in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  The aim of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</P>
    <P>An Exchequer contribution of £30 million has been set aside over the next three years for this purpose, with £20 million of this amount being targeted at the local drugs task force areas, where development groups were set up in each of the 13 areas to develop locally integrated facility and service plans.  These plans have recently been submitted for evaluation by an assessment committee, chaired by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  I expect that recommendations on funding for the plans will be submitted to the Cabinet committee early in the new year.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive review of the overall National Drugs Strategy, taking on board the findings of the evaluation of the drugs task forces and experience to date of the young people's facilities and services fund, is due to commence early in the new year and be completed before the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion last met on 26 November.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, funding for specific sports is channelled through national governing bodies of sport which are recognised by my Department as eligible for funding.  In the case of swimming, the recognised NGB is the Irish Amateur Swimming Association.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, in the context of concerns raised about the handling of issues relating to child sexual abuse in swimming, I decided that funding would be withheld from the IASA until such time as I was satisfied that the association had put in place the appropriate structures and measures in the organisation to secure a safe environment for their younger members.</P>
      <P>The IASA has been in consultation with its wider membership over recent months and, following an EGM on 1 November, submitted to me its proposals to reconstitute the association and change its name to Swim Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> I indicated my desire to see this programme for structural change accelerated so that the wider membership has an early opportunity to vote in the new arrangements for the governance of swimming.  An outcome satisfactory to the membership should pave the way for a speedy resolution of outstanding issues and the restoration of Government funding.</P>

      <P>I believe that, at present, the implementation of national tourism marketing and promotion policies, as developed by me and my Department, is best undertaken by a dedicated executive body such as Bord Fáilte.  As the Deputy is aware, with the implementation of the central recommendations of the AD Little review of Bord Fáilte, the board is now free to devote particular attention to the defining role of promoting and marketing Ireland overseas as a tourist destination.</P>
      <P>Of course, tourism industry practitioners also have a vital role in marketing their own products and services and in promoting the Ireland destination, whether in partnership with the State, as is the case with the overseas tourism marketing initiative, as part of a co-operative marketing group, or independently.  There is no doubt but that the marketing efforts of the private sector largely complement those of the State and have contributed in no small way to the outstanding success of Irish tourism over the past decade.</P>

      <P>The latest available statistics on total tourism revenue show that all regions are enjoying tourism spending far in excess of the levels achieved in the past.  Tourism revenue in every region of the country has grown faster than the international or European averages over the period 1989-97.  This key achievement has tended to be overlooked when the issue of the varying levels of growth within the regions is raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of last year's Supplementary Estimate, I obtained an extra £5 million for Bord Fáilte to enable it to increase and intensify its level of promotional and marketing activity for the 1998 tourist season, with the particular objective of securing a broader regional distribution of <Col N="1048" /> tourism revenue.  Some of these initatives targeted a range of advertising, publicity and other niche market activities such as angling, golf, equestrian and walking.  Another dealt with providing additional funds to integrate and supplement local and regional marketing activity consistent with national destination spend.  Support has also been given to advancing the seasonality profile of Irish tourism through the promotion of out of season events.</P>
    <P>The response by the industry at large and the regional tourism authorities in particular has been very encouraging to date.  Following consultation at local level the representatives of the regional tourism authorities have been involved with Bord Fáilte in producing literature in various languages to promote their individual regions; promoting new business in new markets; providing support for the various product marketing groups on a regional basis; assisting in the con struction of regional tourism Internet sites; and exhibiting at the various international trade fairs what the individual regions have to offer.</P>
    <P>These are just some examples of where industry, working in conjunction with their regional tourism authorities and Bord Fáilte, can put in place sound business strategies to successfully market the attractions of their particular area.</P>

      <P>The further growth of Irish tourism is heavily dependent on the continued promotion of Ireland as an attractive, competitive, quality visitor destination.  The focus in developing, growing and consolidating the tourism market is on developing a less peaked market, with higher yield and greater regional distribution of economic benefits.  This involves a range of measures undertaken by Bord Fáilte in full partnership with the tourism trade in Ireland and, where relevant, overseas, which are designed to encourage both the consumers and trade to consider Ireland as a year round destination, with a wide variety of top class facilities and attractions throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the three years between 1994 and 1997, the number of overseas visitors to Ireland increased at an annual average rate of 11 per cent per annum, with annual revenue from these visitors increasing by 13 per cent.  The target set for 1998 is a further 8 per cent increase in visitor numbers, which would amount to 5.4 million visitors to Ireland this year.  In 1997, out of State tourist expenditure amounted to £1.705 billion, with further expenditure of £400 million by visitors with Irish carriers.  In addition, domestic tourism <Col N="1049" /> expenditure amounted to an estimated £671 million.</P>
    <P>In 1997 tourism accounted for approximately 5.3 per cent of the value of exported goods and services and 6.3 per cent of GNP.  Tourism expenditures have a very low import content in comparison with other exports.  Finally, tourism provided 119,000 job equivalents in 1997 &mdash; an increase of 58,000 since 1987.  This amounts to just under 9 per cent of all jobs in Ireland &mdash; or more than one in 12.</P>

      <P>Selection of the Irish team for participation in the Sydney Olympic Games is a matter for the Olympic Council of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government's strategic plans for the development of high performance sport include the provision of substantial funding in 1998 and 1999 to the national governing bodies of sport to improve their operational and technical capabilities and assist with their international training and competition programmes which are aimed primarily at preparing teams to compete successfully at the highest level including the Olympic Games in Sydney.  In addition, under the new international carding scheme launched earlier this year, many of Ireland's high performance players and athletes who have embarked on qualification for the Sydney games have received much improved individual grants to help meet necessary international competition and training expenses.  The carding scheme also provides access to a full range of specified back&mdash;up services which include sports science and medical support, career planning and counselling and training facilities.  Financial support is also being provided from my Department towards the cost of a specified range of activities in respect of the Olympic Council of Ireland which has a pivotal role to play in Ireland's participation in the Sydney games.</P>

      <P>Over the years, successive Administrations have devoted <Col N="1050" /> significant resources to tackling the problems associated with pockets of acute deprivation in urban areas.  Despite the good work being done by the staff of State funded organisations working in those areas, we still have major problems.</P>
      <P>One factor inhibiting the effectiveness of the State's collective endeavour in deprived urban areas is a history of insufficient co-operation and co-ordination between organisations in the State funded sector.  Each of the organisations operating in these areas pursues its own brief. There is often no over&mdash;arching vision.  Sustained, structured dialogue between the different organisations is not the general rule.</P>
      <P>This is not a criticism of specific individuals or organisations.  It is a reflection on systems failure and this is the issue the Taoiseach was addressing in his remarks in Killarney.  Such systems failure is not unique to Ireland.  It tends to happen wherever you have different organisations working in the same area addressing different but related problems.</P>
      <P>The fact that this is a chronic problem and a universal one does not, however, excuse us from trying to tackle it.  The Government certainly feels that it is time for change and to that end, it launched, under the auspices of the Inter-Departmental Policy Committee on Local Development, a pilot project, known as the Integrated Services Project.</P>
      <P>The first phase of that project was a research phase which involved a close look at the situation on the ground in four areas &mdash; Dublin's north east inner City, the canal communities, Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Gardens, St. Michael's House and Dolphin House, Jobstown, Tallaght and Togher, Cork.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that the situation on the ground does suggest the value of closer working and planning relationships between the organisations from the State funded sector which are active in deprived urban areas.  It also indicates the value of taking account of the real needs and experience of end users in the design and planning of service delivery in those areas.</P>
      <P>Following discussions in various fora, the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion has now decided to proceed with the implementation phase of the project.  This will be launched following discussions at a special meeting of SecretariesGeneral of relevant Departments and chief executive officers of relevant agencies which is being convened by the Taoiseach and will take place shortly.</P>
      <P>The ultimate aim of the project is to develop models to secure more effective use of the State's resources in deprived urban areas generally and, thereby, improve the overall quality of life of the communities in those areas.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the approach being adopted by the French authorities in relation to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment negotiations to which Ireland is a party; if she will be instructing Ireland's negotiators to support the French position in relation to the negotiations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations on a Multilateral Agreement on Investment, to be known as the MAI, were held under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic co-operation and Development, OECD, in Paris.  It was intended that the MAI would be a free&mdash;standing, international treaty, open to all countries willing and able to meet its obligations. As a small country with a high dependence on trade and foreign investment Ireland would tend to favour a multilateral approach to dealing with regulatory issues that involve governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns were raised in the course of the negotiations on a number of issues including national sovereignty, labour and environment, culture, dispute settlement, extra-territoriality, regional integration and the needs of developing countries. In April 1998, governments decided to engage in a period of assessment and further consultation <Col N="1063" /> and to have no further negotiations for six months.  France announced in October 1998 that it would not continue with the negotiations. Negotiations on the MAI have ceased.  Therefore, the question of whether Ireland's negotiators should support the French position does not arise.</P>
    <P>I met Monsieur Jacques Dondoux, the French Minister of State with responsibility for Trade, on 5 November last and we agreed that there was still a recognised need for a multilateral framework for investment.  France has suggested that the World Trade Organisation, WTO, would be the most suitable forum to negotiate such a framework.  Many other countries, including Ireland have already expressed this view.  For example, last April, at the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris I argued in favour of using the WTO to negotiate investment rules.  This position was also set out in a reply to parliamentary questions on 21 April 1998.  One of the main arguments in favour of this approach is that it would facilitate the full participation of developing countries in the process.  However, there would need to be a consensus in the WTO before negotiations can commence there.</P>

      <Quest>the review, if any, she has undertaken of the present practices in relation to Sunday working; if she has found a significant incidence of cases where Sunday working is not optional and of cases where no premium is being paid for work on a Sunday; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I initiated a discussion process in January last between IBEC and trade union interests, including the unions primarily concerned, SIPTU and MANDATE, under an agreed independent chairman to address the difficulties on the employment front associated with the growing practice of Sunday trading.  My considered view was that a partnership approach could succeed in resolving the difficulties involved in a manner that would be mutually acceptable to both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May I received a report of the discussion process which indicated that the parties involved had accepted that a code of practice along lines proposed by the chairman could, without prejudicing the fundamental position of either side, form the basis of a common and voluntary approach to practice in relation to retail sector Sunday working.  I accepted that report and, under section 35 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, I formally requested the Labour Relations Commission to prepare a code of practice on Sundy working in the retail sector.  The LRC, having consulted the relevant interested parties, duly submitted such a code to me which, <Col N="1064" /> by order signed by me on 19 November 1998, I declared to be a code of practice for purposes of the Sunday work supplemental provisions set down in section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.  Copies of the code were lodged in the Dáil Library on 23 November and publication of the code was formally launched on 25 November.</P>
    <P>As regards the incidence of cases where Sunday working is obligatory, the Deputy may wish to note that employment regulation orders, EROs, and registered employment agreements, REAs, established under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946-1990 prescribe statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for workers employed in a number of sectors where Sunday working is prevalent.  The retail grocery &mdash; allied trades and the drapery &mdash; footwear sectors, for example, are covered by, respectively, an ERO and an REA: the conditions of employment laid down in these two sectors allow for Sunday working which, however, is compensated for by means of shift allowances paid in respect of work carried out during unsocial hours.</P>
    <P>As regards the incidence of cases where no premium is paid for Sunday work, the Deputy will be aware that section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, provides that an employer who requires an employee to work on Sunday &mdash; except an employee whose pay conditions already reflect the fact of his-her having to work on Sunday &mdash; shall pay compensation to that employee by means of a reasonable allowance or a reasonable increase in pay or reasonable paid time off or a combination of two or more of these means.  In the event of default by an employer in respect of this obligation, an aggrieved employee, may present a complaint to a rights commissioner who, having given the parties involved an opportunity to be heard, shall give a decision in writing in relation to the complaint. Such decision may be appealed to the Labour Court.  Having checked the position with the rights commissioner service, I can confirm that the low level of complaints on this isssue would seem to suggest that employers generally are satisfactorily implementing their section 14 obligations.</P>

      <Quest>if she will consider as a possible alternative the introduction of compulsory maximum six day opening for retail premises which could be applied uniformly and still permit shops to make distinctive offering regarding opening times in view of the legal difficulties in proceeding with restrictions on Sunday trading in a way which discriminates between different outlets.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Shops (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938 governs the opening of retail establishments.  The Act provided for a ban on Sunday trading for most shops <Col N="1065" /> but gave the Minister power by order to add to the list of exempted businesses, or to exempt specified regions from the provisions of the Act. However, an order made later that year (1938) exempted the whole country from the provisions of the Act and effectively removed all restrictions on Sunday trading.  This remains the position to the present day.  My understanding is that the current legislation would not permit what the Deputy suggests.  I have no proposals currently to legislate in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 73, 74, 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>I was informed in early October last that the staff of Betatherm in Ballinrobe were being put on a week by week notice.  In the interim regular briefing notes were supplied to my Department to keep me informed of the situation at the company.</P>
      <P>While I did not meet with representatives from Enterprise Ireland or from the company, I was kept fully informed of developments.  In this regard, I was aware that Enterprise Ireland was engaged in on&mdash;going contact with Betatherm in an effort to resolve the difficulties which the company was encountering and to safeguard jobs at the Ballinrobe plant.  Regrettably, the company was faced with a seriously deteriorating market situation and it considered that it could no longer maintain the Ballinrobe operation.</P>
      <P>I am informed that Enterprise Ireland-IDA Ireland has grant-aided Betatherm (Ireland) in Ballinrobe on a number of occasions since its establishment.  In the past two years a total of £156,000 was paid by Enterprise Ireland-IDA Ireland to the company in respect of expansion plans approved prior to 1996.  Under the legal agreement which the company entered into in respect of those grants, Enterprise Ireland will enter into discussions with the company concerning repayment of any relevant moneys.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the economic impact of the job losses at Betatherm on the Ballinrobe area. The development agencies are committed to the development of all regions in Ireland and are working closely with industry and local interests to promote industrial development in the Mayo area through the attraction of new industry and the expansion of existing industry.  I have asked the agencies to intensify their efforts to facilitate additional industrial investment and job maintenance in the Mayo region.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I was very pleased to announce yesterday that McHale Engineering, Claremorris is to expand its operation in Mayo and that this expansion will involve the construction and equipment of a new 50,000 sq.  ft.  factory in Ballinrobe. McHale Engineering Ltd.  is a family owned company specialising in the manufacture of silage bale wrapping equipment.  Employment at the company is to increase from 60 to 120 people.  This expansion will greatly benefit the local economy and help reduce the impact of the Betatherm closure on the area.</P>

      <P>The company in question has completed its drilling operations for 1998 in the Irish offshore.  It drilled an appraisal well earlier this year in Block 18/20 about 70 kilometres west of Achill.  The appraisal well was successfully tested and production of gas was measured at a stabilised rate of 63 million standard cubic feet of gas per day.  The test indicated that very favourable <Col N="1068" /> production rates can be achieved from this discovery. Full evaluation of the discovery will involve further appraisal work, including the drilling of additional appraisal wells; over the next two to three years.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the employment of workers and indeed the provision of services and related issues is a matter for the exploration companies and their contractors.  EU legislation on freedom of movement of workers within member states precludes the imposition on operators of any conditions as regards minimum levels of employment of Irish workers.</P>
      <P>However, it is Government policy to ensure that the Irish economy benefits to the maximum extent possible from offshore exploration activities within the constraints of EU legislation.  I have continually impressed on the Irish Offshore Operators Association and the individual operators that Irish suppliers of goods and services and indeed Irish workers must be given opportunities to participate in such activities and I will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>I issued a statement on 24 November expressing my horror at reports that a large number of civilians had been killed by the military in or near the East Timor town of Alas.  I joined my voice to that of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who had appealed for an end to all military operations in the area and for respect to be shown for the safety and security of unarmed civilians.</P>
      <P>The precise details of the incident or incidents in question are still unclear.  The matter is currently under discussion among partners in the European Union.  The EU Presidency is approaching the Indonesian authorities in order to express its concern and to request exact information. It is clearly essential, however, that all military activities should end immediately so as to ensure that no further loss of civilian life occurs.  It is also essential that all those guilty of perpetrating atrocities should be brought to justice.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply on 30 September, I have been following the situation in Chiapas with concern.  The Mexican authorities have been made aware of this concern, as well as our desire to see progress and continuing action to ensure the human rights of the people of Chiapas.</P>
      <P>I am aware that over the weekend of 21 and 22 November, the EZLN, the Zapatista National Liberation Army, met the Concord and Pacification Commission (COCOPA), which is made up of representatives of all the main political parties in Mexico.  I understand that, while the Zapatista representatives complained on the first day about the quality of the facilities provided for their delegation, meetings resumed on the second day.  At that point, I am informed, the Zapatistas repeated the well-known preconditions for dialogue with the government.</P>
      <P>While the meeting did not in itself move the negotiation process forward, reports indicate that the Zapatistas agreed to maintaining lines of communication through COCOPA and further meetings are possible.  I welcome the prospect of further contacts amongst the participants in the future.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, the Government proposes to take to ratify the large number of international conventions and agreements pertaining to different Departments which Ireland has signed but not ratified; and if a method of ratification other than legislation can be devised to avoid long delays and to avoid giving the impression that Ireland is not supportive of, in particular, international conventions on human rights and humanitarian law in view of the fact that sections 5 and 6 of Article 29 of the Constitution do not, of themselves, require ratification by legislation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The ratification of an international agreement is a step which is undertaken only when required by the terms of the agreement itself &mdash; it is, therefore, a requirement of international law rather than Article 29 of the Constitution.  Ratification is a formal act whereby the State agrees to be bound by the terms of an agreement, but before this can happen the State must have taken whatever <Col N="1072" /> legislative or administrative measures that may be required in order to meet its obligations under the agreement.</P>
      <P>Where international agreements are readily accommodated by our existing domestic arrangements it may be possible to ratify them without having to enact legislation.  However, in many cases it will be necessary to change existing legislation and adminstrative practices before we can comply with the obligation contained in an international agreement.  This inevitably requires thorough and careful checking to ensure the compatibility of agreements with our domestic laws and administrative practices.  The care which is taken in these matters underlines the seriousness of our commitment to international agreements.</P>
      <P>I agree that prompt action to meet our international obligations is especially important in relation to human rights and humanitarian law. The Deputy will be aware of the priority which is given to these areas and of the progress made in recent years with the enactment of legislation which has enabled the State to ratify a number of important agreements on human rights issues.  In the area of humanitarian law the passage of the Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Act, 1998, will enable Ireland to ratify the two Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions and I am pleased to say that this process will be concluded shortly.</P>

      <P>The Irish Immigration Centre, Boston is one of many organisations in the US providing excellent advice and information services to Irish immigrants. Grants amounting to £153,700 were given to such groups from the Vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs this year.  The amount provided for similar grants in 1999 is £175,450, an increase of over 14 per cent.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate the organisations which will receive grants next year nor how much they will receive.  If the Irish Immigration Centre, Boston applies for a grant again I can promise that the application will be sympathetically considered.</P>

      <P>The additional 150 buses are required urgently to meet the traffic congestion problems in Dublin as part of the Government's commitment to implementation of the Dublin Transportation Office's short-term action plan.  If an alternative fuel such as LPG was to be specified for all or part of the order, Dublin Bus would have to begin a new tendering procedure which would delay the delivery schedule beyond the current end 1999 completion date.</P>
      <P>The use of alternative fuels such as LPG in public transport vehicles is of particular interest to my Department.  However, there are a number of detailed issues which would have be considered before any policy decision can be arrived at.  My Department will continue to work closely with the relevant agencies to develop a strategy to promote a suitable fuel mix in public transport vehicles, taking into account the overall costs and benefits of the various options available.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 96 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of these concerns.  The EU, with 128 other Members of the World Trade Organisation, is bound by WTO agreements and rules on trade.  The payment of refunds on exports to third countries has been part of EU agricultural policy for many years and is permissible under WTO rules.  Occasionally, the level of export refunds may adversely affect markets in developing countries. In such circumstances, the EU normally takes appropriate action.</P>

    <P>Under the terms of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, WTO members are committed to reductions in the areas of domestic support and export refunds and to the easing of access to their domestic markets.  Also, the WTO recognises the importance of favourable differential treatment for developing and least&mdash;developed countries through its provisions for special and differential treatment.  For its part, the EU grants preferential access to Community markets on a wide range of agricultural products from <Col N="1078" /> developing countries through the Generalised System of Preferences and the Lomé Convention.</P>
    <P>With regard to South Africa, the EU and South Africa have been negotiating a Trade and co-operation Agreement since 1995.  The negotiations are being conducted on the EU side by the European Commission in accordance with the Negotiating Mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 1995 and amended by the Council in March 1996.  I support the conclusion of an agreement between the EU and South Africa in accordance with the Council's Negotiating Mandate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>This person's application includes commonage land.  The revised REP scheme requires that a framework plan be drawn up for each commonage under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  It will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> In the meantime, as I announced recently, interim arrangements have been agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to put a national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans.  This means that the farmers concerned who are already in REPS or who join, on the basis of the national framework plan, can avail of the higher rates of compensation of £80 per acre for the first 100 acres with additional payments for the next 200 acres.  Plans prepared under the national framework plan will be reviewed when the individual commonage framework plans are available.</P>
    <P>It has been necessary to revise the scheme document and the agri&mdash;environmental specifications to take account of the new measure.  This, along with application forms, will be available from my Department's farm development services offices shortly.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the interim framework plan for commonages recently agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, all sheep farmers with mountain ewes who declared commonage land in counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry on their 1998 area aid application are now required to reduce their mountain ewes by at least 30 per cent of their 1998 quota.  As the person named has commonage on which his mountain sheep are maintained the terms of the destocking measure do apply in his case.  It is possible that when the individual framework plans are drawn up, the person named will be allowed to carry sheep whereupon the 30 per cent of quota rights now being frozen can be returned to him.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121, 122 and 123 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding under the fodder scheme is being targeted at the worst affected areas identified by Teagasc in its September survey.  The DED of Dysart, County Roscommon is one of those and <Col N="1084" /> is included in the scheme.  While some farmers in other areas were also affected by the fodder crisis, the aim of the present scheme is to provide assistance to those who suffered the most hardship. I expect that the details of the scheme will be approved by the EU Commission shortly.</P>

      <P>The revised REP scheme requires that a framework plan be drawn up for each commonage. The preparation of the framework plans will be carried out under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  As there are over 8,000 commonages it will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, as I announced recently, interim arrangements have been agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to put a national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans.  The national plan involves a 30 per cent reduction of the quota held in 1998 for <Col N="1085" /> flock holders who use commonage in six counties, including Donegal.  This means that the farmers concerned who are already in REPS or who join, on the basis of the national framework plan, can avail of the higher rates of compensation of £80 per acre for the first 100 acres with additional payments for the next 200 acres.</P>

As the person named has commonage on which his mountain sheep are maintained the terms of the destocking measure do apply in his case.  It is possible that when the individual framework plans are drawn up, the person named will be allowed to carry extra sheep whereupon the 30 per cent of quota rights now being frozen can be returned to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of an interim framework plan for commonages recently agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, all sheep farmers with mountain ewes who declared commonage land in counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry on their 1998 area aid application are now required to reduce their mountain ewe numbers by at least 30 per cent of their 1998 quota.  This interim measure is necessary to address the problem of commonage areas which have become degraded because of overgrazing by sheep and to protect those commonages areas which, while not now degraded, are in danger of becoming degraded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quota reduction measure in the counties concerned, contained in the interim framework plan, will remain in place until such time as detailed framework plans for these commonages are completed.  It is possible that when the individual <Col N="1091" /> framework plans are drawn up, some farmers who are now subject to the 30 per cent reduction on quotas will be allowed to carry extra sheep whereupon the 30 per cent of quota rights now being frozen for them can be made available to them again.</P>
    <P>Work on the preparation of detailed framework plans has already commenced and it is expected that many will become available in 1999. Priority is being given to drawing up framework plans for commonages in the six counties affected by the quota reduction measure contained in the interim framework plan.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the interim framework plan arrangements, all farmers who farm commonage land will be able to apply for the new rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, which provides for an annual payment of £80 per acre on the first 100 acres, £8 per acre on the next 100 acres and £6 per acre on the next 100 acres. An alternative compensation scheme will be made available by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for farmers who do not wish to join REPS.</P>
    <P>The farmers concerned are already entitled to a payment of up to £300 under the winter fodder scheme for farmers with mountain breeding ewes. In order to assist sheep farmers in the six counties who are subject to the 30 per cent reduction in quotas, I am arranging to pay an additional £10 per ewe on the 70 per cent balance of their quota. The overall cost of this measure, together with weather related schemes announced earlier, will be £18.75 million.  It is expected that these payments will be made during December.</P>

      <P>This application was subject to a plan examination and on&mdash;farm inspection.  The REPS plan was found to contain a number of deficiencies which need to be rectified in a revised agri&mdash;environmental plan.  My Department wrote to the person named on the 25 November 1998 informing him of this.  His REPS planner has also been written to outlining the deficiencies and requesting that a revised agri&mdash;environmental plan be submitted.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of an interim framework plan for commonages recently agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, all sheep farmers with mountain ewes who declared commonage land in counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry on their 1998 area aid application are now required to reduce their mountain ewe numbers by at least 30 per cent of their 1998 quota.  This interim measure is necessary to address the problem of commonage areas which have become degraded because of overgrazing by sheep and to protect those commonage areas which, while not now degraded, are in danger of becoming degraded.  The quota reduction measure in the counties concerned, contained in the interim framework plan, will remain in place until such times as detailed framework plans for those commonages are completed.  It is possible that when the individual framework plans are drawn up, some farmers who are now subject to the 30 per cent reduction in quotas will be allowed to carry extra sheep whereupon the 30 per cent of quota rights now being frozen for them can be made available to them again.</P>
      <P>Work on the preparation of detailed framework plans has already commenced and it is expected that many will become available in 1999. Priority is being given to drawing up framework plans for commonages in the six counties affected by the quota reduction measure contained in the interim framework plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence of the interim framework plan arrangements, all farmers who farm commonage land will be able to apply for the new rural environmental protection scheme (REPS) which provides for an annual payment of £80 per acre on the first 100 acres, £8 per acre on the next <Col N="1098" /> 100 acres and £6 per acre on the next 100 acres. An alternative compensation scheme will be made available by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for farmers who do not wish to join REPS.</P>
    <P>The farmers concerned are already entitled to a payment of up to £300 under the winter fodder scheme for farmers with mountain breeding ewes. In order to assist sheep farmers in the six counties who are subject to the 30 per cent reduction in quotas I am arranging to pay an additional £10 per ewe on the 70 per cent balance of their quota. It is expected that all of these payments will be made during December.</P>

      <P>I consider that, in the context of the major debt relief package announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and me on 16 September, it is now appropriate for Ireland to honour its proposed contribution to ESAF.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the need for reform of certain aspects of ESAF programmes and note the positive response of the IMF to the external evaluation of the facility.  Based on the IMP's response to the recommendations in the external evaluation, it is clear that ownership issues, the role of civil society and social impact will be given much greater consideration in the future design, planning <Col N="1100" /> and implementation stages of ESAF programmes.</P>

      <P>Since no motor vehicles are manufactured in the State, all vehicles registered, whether new or used, must be imported.</P>
      <P>I understand from data supplied from the Revenue Commissioners that, to the end of October 1998, the number of second-hand cars registered in the State was 31,708 as compared to 32,328 for the same period last year.  The number of such registrations has dropped slightly in recent years. This figure has to be seen against sales of 138,280 new cars to end of October 1998, up from 120,932 for the same period last year.</P>
      <P>There may be a number of factors which affect the export of second-hand cars from the State. These may include the relative range and choice of second-hand cars in the State <i>vis-à-vis</i> those available in, for example, the United Kingdom, where there is a higher ratio of car ownership as well as higher car fleet ownership.  That the UK has had for many years an &ldquo;MOT test&rdquo; may also militate against imports into that country from the State.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, recently announced the contractor for car testing here.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to introduce a facility which would subsidise the export of used cars from the State, if this is what the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the press release issued on 17 November last in connection with the issue of regionalisation, the Government has decided to make an application for a change of Ireland's current status as a single region to one comprising two regions.  One of these regions would comprise the regional authority areas of the Border, the midlands and the west &mdash; now to include Clare and Kerry.  This application, which was submitted to EUROSTAT last week, encompassed the proposed inclusion of Clare and Kerry in the west regional authority area.  Before decisions are taken on the final shape of a revised regional structure, this issue will be discussed with the Commission and will also take account of the views of regional interests.  I would like to stress that a major consideration in this regard is that the efficient and effective administration and management of Structural Funds investment, for which Ireland justly enjoys a high reputation, must not be jeopardised, particularly in the coming period of declining overall assistance from Europe.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware there are a number of tax reliefs for the payment of third level fees.  Following the introduction of free fees for full-time under-graduate students in publicly funded colleges, the Finance Act, 1995 &mdash; now section 474 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 &mdash; provided tax relief for fees of full-time under-graduate students attending private third level colleges provided the course is of at least two years duration. The Minister for Education and Science approves the colleges and courses.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1996 &mdash; now section 475 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 &mdash; provided for tax relief for tuition fees of part-time under-graduate students attending approved courses of not less than two years duration in private or publicly funded third level colleges.  Courses which are normally not less than two years duration but which, because of exemptions granted to the student following the conferring of a related certificate or diploma, may be completed in less than two years are also eligible for this relief.  Again the Minister for Education and Science approves the colleges and the courses.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1997 &mdash; now section 476 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 &mdash; provided tax relief for fees paid by students pursuing a course of study or training, other than a post-graduate course, provided the course is confined to certain aspects of information technology and certain foreign languages.  The courses must be of less than two years duration and result in the awarding of a certificate of competence.  Both course providers and courses are approved by FÁS.  Accordingly, one year courses are not eligible for tax relief under sections 474 or 475 but may be eligible under section 476 if they comply with the general conditions of the section and have been approved by FÁS.</P>

The total number of claims allowable for that year in respect of such fees is currently estimated to be of the order of 1,600.

      <P>Pensions parity has been applied to nurses in the same way as it has been applied to other public servants.  The aim of pension parity is, broadly speaking, to provide that pensions are increased by reference to increases in the rate of salary payable to the person currently holding the post which the pensioner held at retirement.  Parity is very valuable and it does not apply generally in the private sector.  I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, that what the Deputy is proposing would go beyond parity and would represent an unwarranted improvement in the already very generous public service pensions increase system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Interventions by a wide range of health professionals, including psychologists, can make a beneficial contribution to a person's health. However, the request that health insurers should be required to provide benefit in respect of treatment <Col N="1105" /> by psychologists gives rise to a number of considerations relating to commercial freedom, financial capacity, customer preference, competition and appropriate legislative intervention. There are, of course, significant and obvious implications to the State intervening into the decision of private health insurance undertakings as regards what services they can and should cover in a competitive market.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently engaged in the preparation of a White Paper on private health insurance which has involved receipt of submissions from, and discussions with, a large variety of interests.  The Psychological Society of Ireland was among the bodies which presented views in connection with the preparation of the White Paper.  The society's submission is receiving consideration in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210, 227 and 233 together.</P>
      <P>The overall thrust of the Government's policy in relation to services for people with disabilities is to provide the supports necessary to enable them to achieve the maximum degree of independence possible for each individual and, if at all possible, to live in the community.  In keeping with the recommendations in the report, Towards an Independent Future, this involves the provision of a wide range of services, including respite care, day care, therapy services and home supports, including personal assistants.  My objective is to develop all of these services having regard to available funding.  The Government allocated £8.4 million additional funding this year for services specifically for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Of this, £3 million has been provided for the development of services. As recommended in the report, it is a matter for each health board to decide, in consultation with its local co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services, on priorities for allocation of this funding in its functional area.  The development of personal assistance services is one of the priority areas to be considered in this process.</P>
      <P>Personal assistance services are provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association, funded by the Eastern Health Board and by the Centre for Independent Living &mdash;CIL&mdash; through the use of FÁS trainees under the community employment scheme.  The establishment of an independent living fund has been proposed by the CIL as a means of funding a personal assistance service to enable people with physical disabilities to live as independently as possible in the community.  An advisory group, set up by one of my predecessors, explored the option of establishing such a fund but considered that it would be too cumbersome to administer.  I am aware that some difficulties are being experienced in the operation of the personal assistance scheme run by the Irish Wheelchair Association in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board.  One of the difficulties is in recruiting and retaining persons to act as personal assistants.  It has been represented to me that this is due, in part, to the relatively low level of remuneration being paid to personal assistants by the Irish Wheelchair Association for a 35 hour week which, I understand, is £134 per week in the first year, rising to £154 in the second year and £166 in the third year.  These rates are exclusive of the employers PRSI contribution.  I am currently examining this particular issue.  The operation of personal assistance schemes run by centres for independent living throughout the country is not affected by this proposal, as these are operated under the community employment scheme, which is funded by FÁS.</P>

      <P>Information regarding the number of patients left for long periods on trolleys in the accident and emergency departments of acute hospitals is not routinely collected by my Department.  The Deputy will appreciate that the levels of attendance at accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy and in this regard all hospitals providing an accident and emergency service experience periods of exceptional demand.  Those who require admission may be retained in accident and emergency departments on trolleys but it is important to note that they receive appropriate medical treatment at all times and that waiting periods, which can vary depending on demand, are kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that I provided additional funding of £2.3 million in the current year for the accident and emergency services in the major acute hospitals.  This has enabled the hospitals to implement various initiatives aimed at addressing the pressures experienced by accident and emergency departments particularly during periods of peak demand, initiatives which include the provision of an improved service for patients through enhanced staffing and organisation of accident and emergency departments and the provision of more appropriate long-stay facilities for patients who are occupying beds in hospitals in order to relieve the pressure on acute beds and to have more places available for emergency admissions as a consequence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 217 together.</P>
      <P>The statutory entitlement of children attending national school to dental services is established under section 67 of the Health Act 1970.  Under this section, children attending national school are entitled to dental treatment for defects noticed at school health examinations.  For the past number of years health boards have been progressively adopting a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and phasing out a demand led system.  This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention. Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools.  Children in second, fourth and sixth classes are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach.  Subject to available resources the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary.  The provision of fissure sealants for vulnerable teeth is an important element of the preventive programme.  The programme <Col N="1111" /> has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.  The small number of children who require more frequent attention will be identified and the required level of advice, check-ups, treatment etc.  provided as necessary.  An emergency service for acute conditions requiring immediate attention is available on demand.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, some health boards can have difficulty in filling dental posts in geographically remote areas and in fully implementing the school based approach as outlined.  I have asked my Department to explore with health boards ways in which it might be possible for the boards to provide an adequate dental service to children in areas which experience persistent recruitment difficulties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 221 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's policy on births is informed by the report of the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme Review Group which was circulated in April 1997.  This report gives a strong endorsement to the policy that the safest place to have a baby is in a well-equipped and staffed maternity hospital or unit.  It also recognised that one of the main reasons why women opt to give birth at home is their desire for a positive experience in friendly, familiar surroundings where they retain full control.  The review group recommended that a number of approaches to the management of pregnancy and birth be pilot tested and one of these is the DOMINO&mdash;domiciliary care in and out of hospital&mdash;Project.</P>
      <P>This project allows the midwife/general practitioner to monitor the mother throughout her pregnancy, to be with her in hospital and to continue to provide care on her return home.  The project, which also includes an outreach/home birth aspect, is based at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles St and is funded by my Department through the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Based on information supplied by the National Maternity Hospital, I am informed that the average cost of a normal delivery in hospital is £1,283 and up to £4,000 where special care is required for the baby following birth.  Independent mid-wives provide care as private practitioners to women who wish to give birth at home and consequently they determine their own scale of fees. Where a women engages the service of an independent midwife for a domiciliary birth, health boards pay a maximum grant of £600.</P>

      <P>Each year, hospitals are notified of their non-capital allocation and a service plan is drawn up by them and agreed with the Department.  This plan sets down parameters for activity for the year and hospitals are required to maintain activity levels within the hospital's agreed parameters. Detailed decisions in relation to hospital spending are a matter for the hospital management. The hospital's chief executive officer recently advised my Department that as part of its service planning and its management of activity within budget it will be taking one of the hospital's CT scanners out of operation until the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 and 226 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Southern Health Board that there are a number of reasons for the waiting time of ten weeks for the receipt of the results of smear tests from Cork University Hospital.  The laboratory at this hospital has a much higher throughput of smears, for example, it received in excess of 16,000 tests for analysis in 1997 compared with approximately 2,500 tests in the Bon Secours Hospital and approximately 1,000 tests in the Mercy Hospital.  In addition, the existence of colposcopy clinics in the Cork University <Col N="1114" /> Hospital places additional demands for diagnostic services on the cytology service.</P>
    <P>Arising from its concern on this issue the Southern Health Board sought approval for the appointment of a consultant cytopathologist and screening staff to improve the reporting situation in the laboratory at Cork University Hospital. The board anticipates that the consultant post will be advertised in the near future and it will be supported by additional laboratory technical staff.  The Southern Health Board is confident that these developments will make a significant difference to the service at the hospital.</P>

    <P>My Department has had no previous indication of the availability of this vehicle on the Irish market. In principle, an electrically assisted tricycle is a mechanically propelled vehicle for the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts.  As such, any person driving such a vehicle in a public place should hold a driving licence, and the vehicle may be liable for vehicle registration tax and motor tax. It would be appropriate for those marketing this vehicle to contact the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1119" /> and the relevant local licensing authority in order to assess these possible requirements in more detail.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 239, 255, 256 and 257 together.</P>
      <P>I have received a number of proposals in relation to hackneys, including the use of bus lanes, the use of two-way radios, and the external identification of hackneys.  I am giving careful consideration to these issues in the context of a package of recommendations in relation to the operation of taxis and hackneys which the Dublin Taxi Forum has addressed to my Department, other Departments and agencies, and taxi and hackney interests.  I intend to complete my consideration of the issues involved with a view to any necessary action as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Ireland, in common with a number of other countries, has long maintained a distinction between the service roles of hackneys and taxis, with the right to stand or ply for hire in public being reserved to the latter.  I do not consider that it would be practicable in the short-term to abolish this distinction of service roles, and I have no such proposal.</P>

      <P>EU directives already require the mandatory fitting of speed limitation devices on coaches over ten tonnes in weight and on goods vehicles over 12 tonnes in weight.</P>
      <P>The Commission's road safety programme, 1997-2000, provides that the impact of these directives will be evaluated and that research will also be undertaken into the use of such speed limiters in all vehicles.  Ireland has indicated its support for the Commission's programme, and this will be facilitated by the recent completion of the Government strategy for road safety, 1998-2002. The strategy includes the Government's general commitment that Ireland will continue to support strongly the development and introduction of new vehicle safety measures at the earliest possible dates.  It specifically states that we will press for the wider application of the requirement to fit speed limitation devices.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the company in question, which is involved in the collection of metal cans for subsequent export and reprocessing, is experiencing market difficulties arising from a significant downturn in world prices for metal recyclables.  Ongoing volatility in international markets for recyclables can clearly affect the development and growth of a sustainable recycling industry and the achievement of national and EU waste recovery objectives.</P>
      <P>The Council of the European Union recently adopted conclusions arising from a Commission communication on the competitiveness of the recycling industries, which addressed the problems encountered by those industries in achieving and maintaining viability, and identified areas for action in order to support recycling activity.  In particular, the Council welcomed the Commission's proposal for the establishment of a recycling forum, representing member states, economic operators and consumer and environmental organisations, to assess the key factors of competitiveness and identify the most appropriate mix of actions to be taken in respect of the main recycling sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent data on fertiliser sales indicate that the usage of phosphorus chemical fertiliser in the year ended on 30 September 1998 was 50,000 tonnes, compared with an average annual usage of some 62,000 tonnes during the early to mid-1990s.  This reduction of 20 per cent in phosphorus chemical fertiliser use although less than earlier estimates, is substantial by any standard and reflects, <i>inter alia</i>, the wide range of measures which have been taken as part of my Department's strategy to reduce phosphorus inputs to waters from all sectors, including agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1997 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus) Regulations, 1998, which I made in July this year provide clearly formulated targets for reducing phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes within a specified timeframe.  The targets are to be achieved, in general, over a ten year timeframe. The setting of water quality standards for phosphorus represents a key response by Ireland to EU Commission concerns about implementation of EU Directive 76/464 in relation to the protection of water against pollution caused by certain dangerous substances.  The Commission has recognised for some time the predominant role which phosphorus plays in terms of water quality in Ireland.  The phosphorus regulations underpin the comprehensive strategy which is designed to tackle all sources of phosphorus as detailed in Managing Ireland's Rivers and Lakes &mdash; A catchment-Based Strategy against Eutrophication.</P>
      <P>A central feature of the strategy is the development of catchment-based initiatives which seek to integrate the energy and resources of all relevant interests under the overall direction of local authorities. Initiatives have been launched in respect of Lough Derg, Lough Ree, Lough Leane and the Rivers Liffey, Boyne, Suir and Barrow.  Projected total investment in these catchments in respect of sewage infrastructure and monitoring and management systems is £130 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent interim report on progress in relation to the first year of the catchment-based initiative for Loughs Derg and Ree indicates that there is already evidence of improvements in water quality.  There has been a marked reduction in phosphorus concentrations in the River Shannon between Athlone and Shannonbridge and in the lower reaches of the Nenagh River.  These improvements can be directly attributed to the phosphorus reduction facilities which have been installed in both Athlone and Nenagh sewage treatment plants.  In addition, monitoring of Lough Derg in 1997 has provided evidence of a considerable improvement in water quality, particularly in the middle and lower sections of the lake.  The improvement in the overall quality rating for the lake from strongly eutrophic to <Col N="1127" /> moderately eutrophic is a positive indication that current strategies are beginning to take effect.</P>
    <P>The efforts which have been ongoing in the Lough Conn catchment have resulted in a 30 per cent reduction in phosphorus loadings to the lake over the last five years.</P>
    <P>These improvements are positive indications that the strategy which I am pursuing to tackle eutrophication in our rivers and lakes is taking effect.</P>
    <P>Nutrient management planning is being promoted extensively.  Nutrient management planning is a requirement under REPS and also under the improved capital allowance scheme for pollution control investment which was introduced under the Finance Act, 1997.  Some 40,000 farmers currently participate in REPS and it is hoped to extend the scheme to an additional 10,000 farmers by the end of 1999.  Nutrient management planning is also obligatory in respect of IPC-licensed intensive pig and poultry production activities.  The local authorities have powers under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts to require farmers to prepare nutrient management plans where this is considered necessary in the interests of water quality protection.  In August this year, I published detailed guidelines for these authorities on how to maximise use of these new powers.  My Department does not have information in relation to the number of such plans made by individual farmers.</P>

      <P>A total of £39 million special Exchequer funding is being provided to local authorities under the Government's serviced land initiative for water and sewerage projects designed specifically to open up additional land for housing.  A total of 161 projects will be funded under the initiative.  Local authorities expect that over 40 of these will commence this year.  The serviced land initiative is a special measure to supplement the main water and sewerage investment programme which is at the highest level ever at almost £185 million in 1998, and is being increased further to £268 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>Funding under the serviced land initiative is being provided at a rate of 40 per cent of cost, with the balance being provided by local authorities, primarily through development levies, resulting in total investment of about £100 million. It is estimated that this investment will result in the servicing of sites for an additional 100,000 housing units.  In addition, £5 million special Exchequer funding is being provided for road access to open up land for housing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265, 266, 267, 268 and 269 together.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a wide range of powers to enable them to provide an effective response to the accommodation needs of homeless people. Homeless people have benefited from the maintenance of the local authority housing programme at a high and consistent level in recent years. Increased resources for housing, which I have secured in the Estimates for 1999, will ensure the continuation of the existing programme and its expansion by a further 600 &ldquo;starts&rdquo; to its highest level since 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital provision for hostel accommodation has been increased from £2 million in 1998 to £4 <Col N="1130" /> million in 1999.  The funding is available for the provision of suitable short-term and transitional housing for homeless people.</P>
    <P>A substantial part of the accommodation provided under the voluntary housing schemes, administered by local authorities, has been used to fund the capital cost of providing emergency, transitional and long-term accommodation for homeless people.  I recently announced substantial increases in the funding limits of the capital assistance scheme designed to improve the capacity of voluntary bodies to provide housing accommodation under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Local authorities also have powers under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988 to provide or fund the cost of accommodation for homeless people.  This includes contributions to voluntary bodies providing such accommodation, meeting the cost of accommodation arranged directly by local authorities themselves or by health boards on their behalf, and funding appropriate resettlement and other initiatives to assist homeless people.  My Department recoups 90 per cent of these costs to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The total annual funding available for the Dublin Homeless Initiative is £600,000, of which £350,000 is provided by Dublin Corporation and £250,000 by the Eastern Health Board.  My Department recoups 90 per cent of the corporation's funding to the initiative.</P>
    <P>I have asked local authorities, in guidelines issued to them on 17 November in relation to the next assessment of homelessness to be carried out in March 1999, to ensure that every effort is made to record accurately the total number of homeless people in their functional areas.  To this end, I have asked them to consult and liaise with adjoining local authorities, health boards and voluntary bodies providing accommodation and services for homeless people in their areas.  In addition, the guidelines suggest a survey over a period of a week rather than on a specific date, in an effort to more accurately identify the extent of homelessness. Local authorities have also been requested to gather information on the number of &ldquo;rough sleepers&rdquo; on the same basis.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which payments made by the United Kingdom Department of Health and Social Services and other EU social services departments to people resident in Ireland will be calculated for means test purposes following the commencement of the euro regime in January 1999.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>When determining, for the purposes of assessing a claimant's means, the value in IR£ &lsquo;Irish punts&rsquo; of social security payments made in other EU currencies, the Department employs an exchange rate mechanism which is used within the EU for social security transactions betweeen member states.</P>
      <P>This exchange rate mechanism is provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 on social security for migrant workers. The rate represents the average of the daily exchange rates for each currency in the first month of a quarter for use in all transactions during the course of the succeeding quarter.  The exchange rate is calculated by the EU Commission on the basis of the rates used for the calculation into ECU within the framework of the European Monetary System.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 January 1999, the method for fixing exchange rates set out in Article 107 will become obsolete for conversions between the currencies of member states participating in the euro, since the conversion rates will be fixed irrevocably from that date onwards.</P>
      <P>In the case of participating member states, the current method of conversion will be replaced after 1 January 1999 by the conversion rule contained in Article 4(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1103/97 of 17 June 1997.  In effect, there will be a fixed exchange rate between currencies of participating states up to 1 January 2002.  Conversion will no longer arise between participating states after 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>In relation to conversions between a participating and a non-participating member state, such as the United Kingdom, the conversion rule contained in Article 107 can continue to be applied after 1 January 1999.  However, as the national currency units of the participating member states will no longer be quoted, the euro will act as the central currency for all such States from that date onwards.</P>
      <P>In the case of the United Kingdom, for example, the exchange rate of the pound sterling for the euro will be determined in accordance with Article 107 for each quarter.  In calculating the value of a payment made by the UK Department of Social Security, the amount will first be converted into euro using the appropriate rule prescribed under Article 107 for the reference period.  Then the euro amount will be converted into IR£ &lsquo;punts&rsquo; using the fixed exchange rate. This will also apply in currency conversion in the case of payments made by the other non-participating states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fixed exchange rates, in the case of payments from the other participating states, will <Col N="1132" /> eliminate the uncertainty and related problems heretofore associated with fluctuations in exchange rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In assessing means for social assistance purposes, account is taken of the value of any capital or investments, together with any cash income that the person has.</P>
      <P>Over the years, different methods of assessing capital and income have applied in the case of the various social assistance schemes.  Some of these differences are designed to achieve specific policy objectives.  For instance, in recognition of the special contribution which carers make to our society, the carer's allowance scheme provides for a substantial disregard of £150 a week in the amount of income which the spouse of a recipient may have, without affecting the carer's entitlement.</P>
      <P>However, it is recognised that there is a need to standardise many of the different methods of calculating means in order to achieve greater equity within the system.  In this regard, considerable progress has already been made in the area of standardising the assessment of capital.  The question of making further progress in this area, including the extension to the disability allowance scheme of the current disregard in respect of REPS payments, would have financial implications. Any such measure would therefore, have to be considered in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>
      <P>Disability benefit is a contributory social insurance payment and entitlement is not, therefore, affected by any income that the claimant may have.  However, as the self-employed, including farmers, are not insured for disability benefit purposes, it is highly unlikely that a person who would be qualified for disability benefit would also be eligible to receive a REPS payment.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 273, 275 and 278 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.</P>
      <P>This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  A review of applications under the 1998 scheme indicated that some 940 applications had been received.  Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme this year I recently sought, and obtained, Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation for 1998 to £5 million.</P>
      <P>The allocation of these additional funds will allow my Department to assist a large number of people again this year and the regional offices of my Department are currently processing applications.  They expect to be in a position soon to advise groups of the decision regarding their applications.  While  the maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the once-of cost of the purchase and&mdash;or installation of the necessary equipment it is not possible to guarantee this level of funding in respect of all applications received under the scheme.  This will continue to apply as it has since the inception of the scheme and the actual amount of the grant will continue to vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands.  No decision has been made by me to change the basis for making awards under the scheme.  I am satisfied that the current level of funding is sufficient to allow my Department to make a meaningful response to worthwhile applications and to assist a large number of people again this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme.  It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people will be assisted this year.</P>
    <P>Provision of £2 million has been made in the 1999 Estimates for continuation of the work supported under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.  The final report from the consultants will be available later this year.</P>

Payments to an estimated 59,200 recipients of supplementary welfare allowance and short-term unemployment assistance were approximately 3 per cent below the CSW target rate.</P>
      <P>The commission did not set a specific minimum rate for adult dependant allowances, now known as qualified adult allowance.  The commission did, however, recommend that the appropriate rate for a couple should be 1.6 times the basic personal rate. At the end of September 1998, there were some 122,000 qualified adult allowances in payment.  In over 57,000, or 47 per cent, of these cases, the rate for the couple was at least 1.6 times the commission's minimum payment for a single person.</P>

The pensioner, or a person of pension age, must either buy or rent alternative accommodation or move into a private nursing home.  Where the applicant has a spouse, he/she must also be over 66.</P>
      <P>My officials are undertaking a wide-ranging review of these provisions, at present, and I expect this to be completed in early 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of net income assessment for the purposes of determining <Col N="1137" /> entitlement to family income supplement came into effect on 1 October 1998.</P>
      <P>The number of people in receipt of FIS at 30 September 1998 was 12,790.  As of the week ending 13 November, there were 12,513 FIS claims in payment.  The small reduction in numbers is a temporary phenomenon which reflects the fact that the entitlements of existing claimants are being re-assessed in line with the new arrangements as they apply to renew their FIS claims; and that some 1,800 new claims, received since 1 October 1998, are also now being dealt with.  It is envisaged therefore that the numbers in payment will show a significant increase in the short to medium term.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made by my Department to ensure that people are made aware of their entitlements to all social welfare schemes, including the FIS scheme.  For instance, information on FIS is provided on child benefit payable order books and by the Revenue Commissioners when they issue tax free allowances.  Both of these measures ensure that information in relation to the scheme is available in every eligible household in the country.  In addition, the scheme is extensively advertised through local and national media outlets, including newspapers, radio, and the Aertel service, as well as through poster campaigns and targeted mailshots.</P>
      <P>The payment of FIS through the tax system would not necessarily result in an increase in the take up of the scheme.  In the first instance, a substantial number of FIS claimants have income which comes below the tax exemption limits appropriate to their family size.  It must be borne in mind also that entitlement to FIS is not determined solely on the basis of the claimant's earnings. Account is also taken, for instance, of family size, hours worked, the likely duration of employment, as well as any earnings which the spouse or partner of the claimant, where relevant, may have.  Not all of this information is collected through tax returns made to the Revenue Commissioners, and the tax system is not therefore capable of automatically identifying the households with an entitlement to FIS.  Any payment through the tax system would therefore still have to operate on the basis of the individual applying for the payment.</P>

      <Quest>the extent, if any, to which a rent supplement is affected when a person receives a back to education allowance.</Quest>
      <QRef>[25801/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern) Dermot Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to education allowance scheme provides for a standard weekly rate of payment to participants equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit in the case of people who were formerly unemployed and the maximum rate of one-parent family payment <Col N="1138" /> in the case of lone parents.  The scheme also provides for the retention of entitlement to secondary benefits, such as rent or mortgage interest supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This is an important feature as SWA is not normally paid to people in full-time education.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a rent supplement is determined by the health boards.  Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person after payment of rent has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the relevant SWA rate for a household in their circumstances.</P>
      <P>Almost all participants in the back to education allowance scheme are in receipt of the maximum weekly rate of payment immediately prior to going on to the scheme and continue to receive rent supplement at the same level as previously.</P>
      <P>Participants who were previously in receipt of a reduced rate of payment, for example, because they had other means, receive an increase in their basic payment to bring them up to the maximum rate on the commencement of the back to education allowance scheme.  This increase in their weekly income has the effect of reducing the level of their rent supplement payable by a similar amount because the amount of rent supplement depends on the income level of the recipient.</P>
      <P>Back to education participants are paid for the full duration of their course, including holiday periods.  While earnings from part-time employment or holiday work do not affect the basic rate of back to education allowance to which they are entitled, such earnings are assessable for rent supplement purposes in the normal way.  This may result in a reduction in the rate of rent supplementation in payment.</P>
      <P>In all cases, back to education participants receive the same amount of rent supplement as others in similar financial and household circumstances. The amount of rent supplement payable to participants in schemes such as the back to work allowance and community employment is subject to different rules.</P>
      <P>If those rules were applied to back to education allowance participants, it could result in a slightly higher rate of rent supplement being paid in up to 4 per cent of cases, a lower rate in at least 8 per cent of cases and no change in the remaining cases which comprise the great majority.</P>
      <P>The whole question of retention of secondary benefits is being examined by my Department at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The current regulations (the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988) stipulate that male applicants must not be <Col N="1143" /> less than five feet nine inches in height and female applicants must not be less than five feet five inches in height.  In 1972 the height requirement for male applicants was amended from five feet nine to five feet eight inches but it was restored to five feet nine inches in 1981.</P>
    <P>There is provision for persons with certain special technical qualifications to be exempted from the general height requirement when being recruited to specialised areas of An Garda Síochána such as the Garda Band and telecommunications section.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that it is not possible to give an exact figure for the number of serving members who do not meet the current general height requirement for applicants as records are not maintained in a manner which would facilitate the provision of the information sought by the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the upper age limit requirement for recruitment to the Garda in view of the fact that other forces allow applications from those aged up to 45.</Quest>

      <P>The Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988, as amended, prescribe the criteria for recruitment of trainees to the force.  In general, the upper age limit for recruitment of trainees to the Garda Síochána is 26 years.  Subject to certain limits, deductions in age can be granted in respect of service in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> The Employment Equality Act, 1998 exempts the Garda Síochána from the provisions of the Act relating to discrimination on grounds of age. This exemption was sought because the essential functions of the Force require that it be comprised of a reasonable proportion of young people.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, police work can entail dealing with individuals disposed to violent, aggressive and disorderly behaviour and this phenomenon is often compounded by the abuse of intoxicants. These physical challenges come into sharper focus when one considers that the Garda Síochána is essentially an unarmed police force unlike the majority of police forces worldwide, preferring to base its influence and effectiveness on its moral authority.</P>
    <P>The cost of Garda training and the voluntary retirement arrangements in the Force are other important factors in considering the upper age limit for recruitment.</P>
    <P>On a related matter, the potential for increased civilianisation in the Force is under examination in the context of implementation of the recommendations of the Steering Group on the Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. The upper age limit referred to above is not applicable in the case of civilians working in the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>My Department funds the courts building programme which enables court&mdash;houses to be refurbished throughout the country in conjunction with local authorities who act as <Col N="1145" /> our agents.  Refurbishment projects are prioritised on the basis of certain criteria, including office locations, the number of sittings, caseload, etc.  On this basis the venues located in county towns are getting priority as they usually accommodate the District and Circuit Courts and the High Court on Circuit and the offices of the District and Circuit Courts.  Accordingly, major refurbishment work is expected to commence on the Circuit courthouse in Limerick in the new year.</P>
      <P>Newcastle West courthouse will be fully refurbished as part of the courts building programme and, while a design team is at present in the process of being appointed, it is not possible at present to say when this work will be undertaken.

The Bill addresses a number of issues, relating to the creation of a new framework for the future execution of sports policy, including policy in relation to sports bodies.  It is expected to have the Sports Council established on a statutory basis and operational in the coming year.  The intention is to have the matter of the recognition of individual sports and recreational activities, including bridge, revisited in the context of the new framework.</P>

      <P>While the use of railway lines is <Col N="1149" /> essentially a matter for CIE and my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, disused lines are regularly looked at by various local interests with a view to exploiting their potential for the development of tourism amenities such as walking, cycling and pony trekking routes.</P>
      <P>Agreement has been secured in a number of instances by local groups to incorporate stretches of disused lines into such routes.  However, a number of difficulties have been identified in the past, such as sections of disused line already being used for house construction and agricultural purposes.</P>
      <P>Studies also indicate that the costs associated with the conversion of derelict railway lines to suitable cycling, walking or pony trekking routes are very high, particularly in relation to providing adequate security for those likely to use such facilities.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless Bord Fáilte, Shannon development and the regional tourism authorities, will continue to help tourism interests to explore the possibilities of developing such disused railway lines as suitable tourist amenities both in their local areas, and as part of longer routes with broader geographic bases.</P>

Meanwhile, provision for <Col N="1151" /> this programme in the recently published 1999 Abridged Book of Estimates at £14.25 million shows an increase of 64 per cent on the 1998 provision, which is up 80 per cent on 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 323 and 324 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding available to my Department from the Exchequer for the development and promotion of tourism in 1998 presently stands at £42.1 million. This funding is for a wide range of tourism related services and activities, including those provided and undertaken by the various State agencies directly responsible for tourism promotion and development.  Funding from this <Col N="1152" /> source is also used to assist the development and expansion of the tourism small business sector. Deputies may also be aware that this week I will be seeking approval, by way of Supplementary Estimate, for a further allocation in 1998 specifically to assist Bord Fáilte's marketing campaigns with a view to maintaining tourism growth and addressing regional spread.  Taken together with the £47.2 million provided for tourism promotion and development in the 1999 Estimates under my Department's Vote, this level of funding reflects the ongoing commitment on the part of this Government to develop this key sector of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Significant funding is, of course, also available for tourism promotion and development under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99.  Between this programme and its predecessor, covering the decade 1989-99, over £1 billion is expected to be invested in tourism, leading to a transformation in the range, quality and volume of tourism product available and acting as a major boost to international tourism marketing and training.</P>
    <P>Over recent months, my Department has been developing an outline strategy for the continued development of tourism in the context of the next round of EU Structural Funding, covering the period 2000-06.  The strategy includes a vision for the future, key objectives and targets and a proposed strategic approach under the product, marketing and training headings.  Consultations are taking place with the industry with the aim of developing a shared vision for the future.  The development of a partnership approach between the Exchequer, the European Union, the State agencies and the private sector which has proved so successful in the context of the two Operational Programmes for Tourism to date is, I believe, the key to sponsoring a more self sustaining tourism sector which is also environmentally sensitive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 331 and 332 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>My Department recently grant-aided the pur chase of a computer for the school in question to assist in meeting this child's needs.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The response may take the form of extra teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the assessed needs of each child.</P>
      <P>The school attended by this child has already made application to my Department for additional assistance in meeting the child's needs. This request is currently being considered in the context of the recent development in special needs provision.  A response will issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Some 116 national schools catering for 11,586 pupils in County Mayo have the services of a remedial teacher and 72 schools catering for 3,538 pupils do not, as yet, have access to a remedial teacher service.  Details of these schools are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>My Department does not keep details on an annual basis of the numbers of children attending school who are in need of a remedial teacher. However, the Special Education Review Com mittee considered that pupils are in need of remedial teaching if they perform at or below the tenth percentile on standardised literacy or numeracy tests.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I allocated an additional 60 remedial teacher posts with effect from September 1998.  The number of remedial teachers in place in the primary system now stands at 1,302.</P>
      <P>I am currently examining the scope for further development of the remedial service, in keeping with my objective of ensuring that a remedial service is made available to every national school in the country.  The needs of schools in County Mayo will be fully considered within this context.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the increase of only 77p in the maintenance grant in view of the fact that many third level students survive on £45.90 per week and are paying over that amount for accommodation; if he will increase the amounts paid out to maintenance grant holders by 50 per cent across the board and the income threshold for those attempting to secure half maintenance grant by £5,000 on each of the existing schedules; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid February to mid February each year.  The value of the maintenance grant was increased by 1.7 per cent for the 1998-9 academic year to £1,652 at the non-adjacent rate and £600 at the adjacent rate.  Also in line with existing practice, I increased the reckonable income limits for the 1998-9 academic year by 3.2 per cent, based on the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1996 to March 1997.  I also applied this increase to the allowance by which the income limits may increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.  The definition of eligible courses in this regard has also been extended.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware some 50 per cent of out third level students are in receipt of maintenance grants.  It is my intention to first seek to deal with the more significant anomalies or disincentives in the grants scheme before dealing with the more general issue of grant levels.  In this regard, my priority has been to honour the commitment given in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses.  I have honoured that commitment and introduced a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses with effect from the current 1998-9 academic year.</P>

I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved.  The response may take the form of full or part-time teacher support or child care support, or both, depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their special needs.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP, a scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants for primary schools towards the cost of caretaking and clerical services.</P>
      <P>Under the PESP scheme, schools receive grants of £30 per pupil, £15 per pupil in respect of each service, to a maximum of £15,000 per annum, which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant.  The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management full discretion as to the level and extent of the services to which the grants are to be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of such services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP.  The priority has <Col N="1162" /> been to extend the scheme in the first instance to schools which have no caretaking or clerical provision already.  In this regard the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for caretaking and clerical services.  The position of those schools which are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the scheme will be examined in the context of any improvements to the scheme which may be implemented in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 342 and 343 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has been made aware by teachers and schools of concerns about the gradual accumulation, over a period of years, of unwanted chemicals which are no longer required for school work and also of chemicals in containers on which the labels are no longer present, and which cannot be identified.  Responsibility for the management of their own chemical stocks and for ensuring the safety of students, staff and property rests with individual schools.  My Department is co-operating with school management authorities in planning, developing and implementing a strategy to assist individual schools and teachers in dealing with the issue.</P>
      <P>In October 1996, my Department published a manual, &ldquo;Safety in School Science: A Code of Practice&rdquo;, and issued it to all schools.  It contains general guidelines for best practice in school science, including a section on laboratory organisation and management which deals with matters such as storage, stock control and waste disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, my Department published a manual which it commissioned from Forbairt titled, &ldquo;Safety in the School Laboratory: Disposal of Chemicals&rdquo;.  This manual gives clear guidelines on the disposal of individual chemicals which are commonly found in school science laboratories. The manual explains how most of these chemicals <Col N="1163" /> may be safely disposed of in schools in accordance with the instructions given.  My Department also contracted Forbairt to operate a help-line to further assist schools.</P>
    <P>A questionnaire was issued to all second level schools asking them to identify and report on the amount of certain chemicals which are no longer required for school purposes and which could not be disposed of by the school in accordance with the guidelines given.  The completed returns were collated and analysed by the curriculum development unit, CDU, of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  A report by CDU of this analysis was issued to all schools in February 1998.  I will arrange for a copy of this report to be furnished to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the results of the survey, my Department in conjunction with CDU and the Health and Safety Authority arranged for a training programme to further assist and advise all second level schools on disposal and storage issues.  The programme was conducted in April and June 1998 for science teachers from all second level schools.  It is envisaged that following this training programme schools will further review their chemical stocks, arranging safe storage of chemicals which will be required for future use and arranging for the disposal of unwanted chemicals which can be safely disposed in accordance with the guidelines already given.  The curriculum development unit will update its data base of unwanted chemicals held by schools in the context of this further work.</P>
    <P>My Department has now established a pilot project in conjunction with the school management authorities and the Health and Safety Authority on the collection of unwanted chemicals which cannot be disposed of by schools themselves. This pilot project will be carried out in a number of community and comprehensive schools in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Further elements of this strategy to assist schools in dealing with the issue will be developed based on the results of the pilot project and the development of the CDU data base.</P>
    <P>The detailed information requested by the Deputy is currently held by the CDU but it is not entirely up to date having regard to the ongoing work on the project.  The CDU (phone 01-453 5487) would be happy to further discuss the project with the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 346 and 347 together.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate biology syllabus currently in use was introduced in 1970 and examined for the first time in 1972.  The chemistry and physics syllabi were revised respectively in 1983 and 1984 and examined for the first time in 1985 and 1986.</P>
      <P>When my Department received proposals from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for a revised syllabus in the case of each of these three subjects, approval of the content of each syllabus was given quickly.</P>
      <P>The delay in relation to the introduction of new syllabi in the case of physics and chemistry arose because no final proposals were received from the council in relation to how practical work should be assessed given that it was recommended that 15 per cent of the overall marks should be awarded for such assessment.</P>
      <P>A feasibility study on the assessment of practical work in physics and chemistry was carried out by my Department in conjunction with the NCCA during 1997.  The results indicated that the proposed model required further refinement. However, I decided in the summer of 1998 that the revised syllabi should be introduced from September 2000 and that the assessment of practical work, if any, should be delayed until the new syllabus has been examined at least twice, that is, until the year 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation of the new biology syllabus was more recent and the approval of the new proposed syllabus by the NCCA was given earlier this year.  The NCCA is still refining its proposals for the assessment of practical work for which 15 <Col N="1165" /> per cent of the overall marks was allocated.  It is not likely that the new syllabus could or would be introduced before 2001 as the proposals for this assessment have to be refined.  In addition the introduction of three new science syllabi at leaving certificate level in the same year could be very demanding on schools and in particular on those teachers who may happen to teach all three subjects.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the applications referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre in 1996 concluded that disadvantaged status should be confined to 16 per cent of the school&mdash;going population.  The study noted that such status had already been granted to 17 per cent of pupils.  As an alternative to extending the disadvantaged areas scheme to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources should be targeted on the most disadvantaged schools already in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Breaking the Cycle scheme was subsequently introduced to deliver the sort of targeted support recommended in the study.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage.  My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support they need to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I recently allocated 60 additional remedial teacher posts to national schools with effect from September 1998. There are now 1,302 remedial teacher posts in place in national schools.</P>
      <P>I am currently examining the scope for further development in this area, in keeping with my objective of ensuring that a remedial service is made available to every national school in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which she refers will be considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage or remedial needs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 349, 350 and 351 together.</P>
      <P>The decision by Limerick Institute of Technology to change its architectural technology course has been raised several times by parliamentary question and representations from Deputies.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Limerick Institute of Technology that the students who successfully complete the course in the institute will qualify for the college professional Diploma in Architectural Technology and can proceed to pursue the Bachelor of Science Degree in Architectural Technology from Heriot&mdash;Watt University.</P>
      <P>Under the Regional Technical College Act, 1992, and the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, it is a function of an institute of technology to provide such courses of study as its governing body considers appropriate, subject to the annual programme and budget approval process laid down in the Acts.  Under the Acts the responsibility for course design, review and modifications is a matter for the institute.  I have no function therefore in this process.  Accordingly I have had no discussions with either the Limerick Institute of Technology or the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland regarding the changes to the architectural technology course in question.</P>
      <P>However, my Department has made inquiries regarding the course with Limerick Institute of Technology and has been advised by the institute as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> The changes to the course in Limerick Institute of Technology leading to the College Professional Diploma in Architectural Technology were the outcome of a prolonged and detailed revision within the Institute and in response to the views expressed by external advisers and examiners and approved by the Governing Body.</P>
    <P>The industrial review process which included a practising Architectural Technican and other appropriate Building Industry Professionals also endorsed these changes.  As this course has a link to the B.Sc. Degree from Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh the Board of Studies of the University has reviewed the new structure and the changes to date were approved.</P>
    <P>The first year students on this course are fully aware of the nature, structure and content of this course and the Institute has a contractual obligation to them.</P>
    <P>The second and third year students who enrolled under the old syllabus will complete their course in accordance with that syllabus.</P>
    <P>With regard to the views of the profession in the matter, it is understood that, at a meeting between the institute and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland on 29 September 1998, agreement was reached and confirmed by the RIAI in the following terms:</P>
    <P>1.  The RIAI regarded Limerick Institute of Technology's pre-existing course in Architectural Technology as the model for the education of Architectural Technicians.</P>
    <P>2.  The RIAI fully accepts the right of Limerick Institute of Technology to change the structure and/or content of its course.</P>
    <P>3.  The RIAI would wish the new four-;year course to produce an output at least as good as the graduates of the pre-existing course.</P>
    <P>4.  The RIAI would be concerned that the views of architectural practices be taken into account in the re-design of the Architectural Technology stream of the new course.</P>
    <P>5.  The RIAI wishes to maintain effective communications with LIT. To this end, it was agreed at our meeting that:</P>
    <P>LIT will send course details of the new programme to the RIAI by December 1998;</P>
    <P>LIT will keep the RIAI informed of developments as appropriate;</P>
    <P>The RIAI will visit the school for a review of the programme in the year 2000, when the first entrants to the new programme will have completed the first two years of the new course; <Col N="1168" /> The RIAI will send an RIAI Visiting Board to the LIT in the year 2002, when the first cycle of the new programme has been completed.</P>

      <P>The managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, a graded system of sanctions and procedures is drawn up and applied in the school.  My Department has issued guidelines to assist schools in dis-charging their responsibilities in this area.</P>
      <P>While the guidelines recognise that there is a need for sanctions, including temporary suspension, in order to register disapproval of unacceptable behaviour, they stress both the need for proportionality of response to incidents of misbehaviour and the use of serious sanctions such as suspension and expulsion only after all avenues of rehabilitation have been attempted and normal channels of communication between home and school have been utilised.  In reaching decisions in individual cases, school authorities have to balance carefully the needs of individual students with their responsibility to the general body of their students.  In the context of imposing sanctions, schools are advised that they should ensure that the rules of natural justice apply and pupils are advised of their right of appeal.  In the suggested code of discipline which accompanied the guidelines, detailed procedures are set out which might be followed by schools in dealing with behavioural problems in school.  At primary level no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil in another suitable school.</P>
      <P>The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin has been made available to every school.  The report sets out models of best practice and is a very valuable resource for schools.</P>
      <P>The Education (No. 2) Bill, which is currently before the Houses, provides for a statutory right of appeal against decisions of boards of management including decisions concerning suspension and expulsion.  This right of appeal will greatly strengthen the capacity to balance all rights and obligations in this difficult area.</P>

      <P>The Green Paper on adult education, which was published last week, provides the consultative backdrop to the publication of a White Paper on adult education.  The paper sets out a basis for a national policy on adult education and proposes a series of priority actions in the field. It proposes mechanisms for the co-ordination and future development of the sector, as a key component within an inclusive education system which promotes access, participation and benefit for all on a lifelong basis.  In that context, particular emphasis is placed on mainstreaming the learning from provision in the community education sector.</P>
      <P>In addition, the womens' education initiative was established to assist projects which address gaps in provision for educationally disadvantaged women.  £0.6 million is being provided for 13 projects in 1998 and 1999 under the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development 1994-9.  The objective is to support the development of models of good practice which will be capable of wider applications and which will impact on future policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other support for students and groups outside the educational mainstream is also offered through: second chance education programmes such as Youthreach, the vocational training opportunity scheme and senior traveller training centres, which are now being supported by a new child care measure; the expansion of the adult literacy service through a doubling of funds this year; the secondment of an education co-ordinator to each of the area based partnerships and the close co-operation of the education sector with the work of the partnerships and with projects availing of EU Community initiative funding; <Col N="1170" /> extensive funding of youth services; and the forging of close links between the formal and informal sectors through the new eight to 15 early school leavers initiative.</P>

      <P>The way in which resources are provided to second-level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges, community and comprehensive schools and voluntary secondary schools.  Consequently, direct comparison between the different sectors is difficult.</P>
      <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant which also covers the VEC overheads and other activities apart from the second-level programme.  Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis based upon enrolments while the annual budget for community and comprehensive schools takes into account factors which vary from school to school.</P>
      <P>The matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second-level is currently being examined by a steering group on funding which has available to it the report of a technical working group.  Under its terms of reference, the group will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second-level sector while taking account of the needs of these different schools.  The group's recommendations when available will inform future developments in relation to the funding of schools.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Education and Science I am committed to ensuring that all resources available to combat educational disadvantage are properly targeted to achieve maximum benefit for those most in need of such supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally, schools were selected for disadvantaged area supports on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of socio-economic criteria.  The criteria in question, which have been agreed with the partners in education, had <Col N="1171" /> regard to such factors as the levels of unemployment; medical card holding and local authority housing occupancy, among the families of the pupils concerned.</P>
    <P>More recently, following a study of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, the criteria were broadened to take account of the educational standards achieved by the childrens' parents and to take account of families in receipt of assistance because of limited means from farm incomes.</P>
    <P>While the above refinements have been of assistance in ensuring the accurate targeting of resources, I regard it as equally important that the growing range of special supports now being provided to combat educational disadvantage should be co-ordinated in a manner which ensures maximum benefit to the receipients.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>A campaign for the promotion of the leaving certificate applied was initiated in 1997 and is continuing in 1998.  The campaign is being administered by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment under a joint Department/NCCA steering group.</P>
      <P>The essential objective of the campaign is to make information available about the educational value of the leaving certificate applied.  The promotion is primarily directed at employers.  It is directed also at schools, teachers, parents and the further education sector.</P>
      <P>The promotion campaign has involved media briefings and a publicity campaign.  It has involved the production and dissemination of materials including: a video; an individual pay slip insert for all post primary teachers; a brochure for employers; a brochure for the further education sector and the leaving certificate applied journal.</P>

      <P>The prevention of the effects of educational disadvantage and early school leaving and the provision of appropriate supports for young people who experience such disadvantage are priority issues for the Department of Education and Science.  It is also a priority issue for this Government and, in particular, for the Cabinet sub-committee on Social Inclusion.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has a range of supports for young people who are at risk of early school leaving.  These include additional funding and ex&mdash;quota staffing for schools which are designated as serving areas of disadvantage.  They also include projects and initiatives such and the early start pre-school project, the home-school-community liaison scheme, Breaking the Cycle, the teacher&mdash;counsellor project and the eight to 15 year old early school leavers' project.</P>
      <P>The primary school curriculum caters for the flexibility which is needed for its differentiated delivery to meet the needs of individual pupils and the revised curriculum incorporates specific guidelines on meeting individual pupils' needs.  At second level the junior certificate schools programme and the introduction of the transition year of alternative programmes at leaving certificate level are designed to meet pupils' needs. Additional funding, ex&mdash;quota teaching posts and liaison services are also provided in designated second level schools.</P>
      <P>The eight to 15 year old early school leavers' initiative, which was introduced in 14 areas this autumn, aims to identify models of good practice in preventing early school leaving and in supporting young people who are already outside the formal school system.  After evaluation effective models will be disseminated and integrated into mainstream policy and practice.</P>
      <P>This Youthreach programme for unqualified early school leavers is currently being expanded by some 2,637 places in FÁS and vocational education committees.  This development is supported by new guidance and psychological services and child care measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The related issues of educational disadvantage and early school leaving are multi-faceted in their causes and effects and early school leaving without certification is a very strong predictor of unemployment and social exclusion.  Education is one of the key factors in ameliorating the effects of early school leaving but the collaborative supports of a wide range of statutory and voluntary bodies are required if the needs of children and families at risk are to be met over time.  Predicting the elimination of early school leaving by any specific date is unrealistic.  However, this does not diminish in any way the obligation on all staturory and voluntary bodies, including the Department of Education and Science, to redouble our <Col N="1174" /> efforts to deal effectively with the problem of early school leaving.</P>

This integration is ongoing and its effects are incremental.  Specific actions to promote integration are in-career development modules for school personnel and the promotion of complementary actions by the personnel appointed to develop related schemes.</P>
      <P>Since the home-school-community liaison scheme began in 1990, part of the local co-ordinators' remit has been the establishment of networks with personnel in local statutory and voluntary agencies with a view to promoting the integrated delivery of services to children and families at risk.  That work is continuing and local committees with the aim of developing co-ordination and integration have been set up in many of the liaison areas.</P>
      <P>The new eight to 15 year old early school leavers' initiative gives further impetus to the concept of integration and emphasises the integration of the Department's schemes with the services of other statory and voluntary agencies in the school communities.  This further and developing level of integration is seen as a vital component in the promotion of social inclusion.  Such integration and co-ordination are fundamental to a multi-faceted approach to the retention in school children from disadvantaged backgrounds, to school attainment that is in keeping with the children's abilities, to their certification before leaving the formal educational system and to their life&mdash;long attitude to learning and further education.</P>
      <P>The importance which attaches to the promotion of co-ordination and integration of services is underlined by the establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion.  The work of integration and co-ordination will continue to be an important focus within my Department and a priority issue in its relations and collaboration with all the other relevant agencies.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to a recommendation made by CORI in its submission to the Points Commission which was repeated in its contribution to a seminar which CORI organised last spring on the role of assessment and certification. The recommendation was not to establish a forum to oversee the reform of the curriculum and assessment methods at senior cycle but rather to seek a consensus on the skills and qualities which need to be recognised in a system certification through involvement of third level institutes and employers in such a forum.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that various initiatives undertaken by me over the past year will inform fully the need for reform of curriculum and assessment at senior cycle.  These include the work and report of the Points Commission which will be available during 1999.  In addition, a senior cycle committee has been established in the NCCA to oversee all curriculum assessment proposals emanating from course committees before final consideration by the council.</P>
      <P>Employers are consulted in appropriate areas as syllabi are being revised and there is strong representation from the third level sector on such committees.  There is active involvement of employers in the implementation of the leaving certificate applied, LCA.  Through the Irish Business Employers Confederation strong school-industry links have been established with many schools to assist with elements of the leaving certificate vocational programme and modular components within LCA.  In addition strong links have been developed by employers in particular with business, science and technical subjects at leaving certificate level.</P>

      <P>The recently published Green Paper Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning contains a range of specific recommendations as to how participation in adult education might be increased.  It identifies the priorities for State investment as addressing literacy needs, providing a back to education initiative for adults who left school with less than upper second level education, <Col N="1176" /> and putting in place the necessary supports, such as guidance, child care and certification arrangements to facilitate access and progression.  The paper places a key emphasis on evaluating and mainstreaming the learning from the community education sector, particularly in its successes in engaging those who are most marginalised and excluded.</P>
      <P>A consultancy study has been commissioned by my Department on the outreach, recruitment and delivery strategies which are most effective in meeting the needs of participants on the vocational training opportunity scheme who are hardest to reach.  In addition, arising from an increase of £2 million provided in 1998, a range of initiatives for adults whose literacy and numeracy skills are inadequate for functional participation in economic and social life is being piloted.  Key elements of these initiatives include a strong emphasis on awareness promotion, outreach strategies to target those most in need, the establishment of referral networks on an area basis involving key actors such as FÁS, the local employment service, the area partnerships, welfare and health interests, the Garda and probation services, schools and youth services, and the promotion of flexibility, innovation and a continuum from one-to-one voluntary tuition to certified learning options.</P>
      <P>Under the women's education initiative, grants have been awarded this year to 13 women's education groups to enable disadvantaged women to plan and pursue lifelong education opportunities and to acquire access to mainstream programmes.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to expand and develop this scheme in future years subject to available resources.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers contains more than 160 separate recommendations relating to the education and training of travellers.  The recommendations are very wide-ranging and span the full spectrum of provision from pre-school to adult education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inter-departmental working group was convened to consider implementation of this report. The working group concluded that co-ordination of the delivery of education services for travellers could best be addressed by establishing a special committee in my Department to oversee the delivery of education services for travellers.  This committee is involved in drawing up a comprehensive plan for the implementation of those task force recommendations approved by Government. I understand that the committee is currently focusing on a plan to address the educational needs of traveller pupils at post-primary <Col N="1177" /> level and that it has consulted with traveller representatives in this regard.</P>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the task force report, the number of visiting teachers for travellers was increased in 1997 from 12 to 20. My Department is also continuing its support for traveller children at primary level through the provision of special resource teachers for travellers. There are currently 363 such posts in place and serving traveller pupils integrated into 309 primary schools.</P>
    <P>In April of this year, my Department took over responsibility from the Department of Enterprise and Employment for senior traveller training centres, which cater for travellers in the 15 to 25 age group.</P>
    <P>I also recently announced the establishment of an Advisory Committee on Traveller Education which I believe will complement the services already in place and help to address the educational issues which affect the travelling community. The inclusion of traveller representatives on this committee will give travellers a real voice in shaping educational provision for future generations of traveller children and adults.  I am committed to ensuring that the process of implementing those recommendations in the task force report which have been approved by Government will continue in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entry arrangements to third level institutions are a matter for the institutions themselves.</P>
      <P>In the university sector the Higher Education Authority provided funding of £260,000 and £475,000 in 1996 and 1997 for initiatives in a number of universities specifically relating to disadvantages students.  Funding of £695,000 is being provided in 1998.  These initiatives build on existing programmes and involve links with second level schools and local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two aspects to these programmes, one involving assistance to some students to meet the points requirement for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure.  The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for <Col N="1179" /> students entering by this method.  Support for the university proposals is very firmly based on the intention of meeting set targets and progress reports will be submitted to the Higher Education Authority on each of the programmes funded.</P>
    <P>In the technological sector, the Dublin Institute of Technology has a comprehensive set of activities in which the college is interacting with different disadvantaged groups in Dublin city and there are currently a number of courses in place for mature students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In addition, a policy decision has been taken by the Dublin Institute of Technology authorities that direct entry should occur in relation to second level students from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not meet the normal admission criteria.</P>
    <P>There is also a pilot scheme which enables holders of NCVA level 2 awards to progress to designated certificate and diploma courses in the institutes of technology, which is an important development in establishing alternative progression pathways for students to higher levels of education and training.</P>
    <P>Initiatives in the third level sector are one element of the wide range of measures in place to improve participation in education.  These measures include the development of early childhood education, the allocation of additional resources to schools in disadvantaged areas, and a range of other initiatives to break the cycle of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate the multi-faceted nature of the initiatives under way which are indicative of my commitment to tackle educational disadvantage.  My objective is to ensure that all available resources are targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support necessary to enable them to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>

      <P>The home-school-community liaison scheme was evaluated by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, during its pilot phase from autumn 1990 until June 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was introduced to schools that were designated as serving areas of disadvantage to develop and promote partnership and collaboration between parents and teachers in the interests of the children's learning.  Its focus is on the salient adults in children's lives, namely parents and teachers, and the indirect focus is on the <Col N="1180" /> educational attainment of the children, their retention in the school system and their lifelong attitudes to education.  The evaluation of the pilot phase of the scheme indicated that benefits were accruing to the children of parents who were actively involved in scheme activities and the practices.  These benefits related to factors such as pupils' attitudes, attendance, attention to homework, behaviour and discipline.  The evaluation also indicated that practices and processes were being put in place that boded well for the ongoing effects of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The development of the scheme continues to be supported by in-career development for the liaison co-ordinators and other school personnel and the work is being monitored by the Department's inspectors during routine school visits and during whole-school evaluations.</P>

      <P>The Bill will set up the appropriate organisational framework to underpin the development of a national framework of qualifications.

      <P>The National Council for Vocational Awards launched national certification at foundation level for young people and adults who left school with no qualifications in September 1997.  Level 1, the next stage of progression, will be implemented nationally with effect from March 1999, and registrations and inservice training for this are currently taking place.  These developments mean that for the first time those who left school with no qualifications can re-enter the system and progress from foundation to level 2 PLC courses, and from there to third level.  NCVA certification is available to a wide range of literacy classes, adult and community groups, EU projects and providers outside the formal system, as well as applying within the prison service, VTOS, Youthreach and traveller training programmes.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Educational Awards also launched a foundation certificate in July 1998 to provide an effective foundation course leading to certification for adult learners embarking on a course of third level education after a break in their education.</P>

      <P>The Youthreach programme is a joint initiative implemented in VEC Youthreach centres and FÁS-funded community training workshops.  The pay claim for staff in the education sector is seeking teacher's pay and conditions with appropriate adjustments and extra allowances for the length of the programme.  An offer was made which included salary improvements, the introduction of pension, fixed purpose <Col N="1184" /> contracts, an incremental scale and movement on the ratio of full-time to part-time posts.  This was rejected on the basis that the pay levels envisaged fell far short of what was being sought.</P>
      <P>A hearing of the Public Service Arbitration Board was held on 23 June 1997.  The board directed that both sides should return to negotiations in the light of a recent pay offer to community training workshops workers and to examine the possibility of a settlement in the context of this offer.  Discussions ensued but the union was not in a position to agree that the CTW offer provided the basis for a settlement.</P>
      <P>The matter was referred back to the arbitration board who held a further hearing on 3 September 1998.  Further documentation was supplied by both sides on 23 September 1998 which is now being considered by the board, and a decision is expected very shortly.</P>
      <P>My Department is fully committed to reaching an amicable solution to the dispute within the overall parameters of public pay policy.</P>

      <P>The rates of allowance payable to VTOS participants were equalised recently with those paid to participants in the BTEA scheme.  The only differences at this stage are: (i) the study options under the BTEA scheme, unlike the VTOS, include third level courses; (ii) an annual cost of education allowance of £150 per annum is paid to students on the BTEA scheme.  This allowance is not paid to participants on VTOS programmes, but VTOS students are provided with all books and materials free of charge, and travel and meal allowances are also payable.</P>

      <P>Courses provided under the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, are full-time and may be of up to two years' duration. These programmes are managed and delivered <Col N="1185" /> locally by the vocational education committees. The courses provided under the scheme focus on the development of employment-related skills, including technological and business skills, and include modules on socio-personal development.</P>
      <P>The programme is provided by the vocational education committees and offers a range of vocational options, from foundation level to level 2 post-leaving certificate.  Participants may also pursue subjects in the junior or leaving certificate or acquire a portfolio of qualifications in line with their needs and interests.  They may follow programmes in discrete VTOS class groups or as individuals dispersed on a range of other programmes. The 10 per cent quota which limited participation of lone parents, those with disabilities and dependent spouses on VTOS has recently been removed.</P>
      <P>Currently 5,000 VTOS places are available nationwide.  The Green Paper, Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning, proposes the introduction of part-time further education options on VTOS and other programmes.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 376 of 24 November 1998, he will outline the way in which £100 million will be spent on the educational technology investments in view of the fact that on 24 November only £19 million had been expended; and the projected expenditure in the remainder of the year in accordance with the information requested in Parliamentary Question No. 376.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Act, 1997, the sum of £100 million is to be paid into the fund in 1998 from moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  To date projects estimated to cost approximately 75 per cent of the fund have been approved by my Department.  These include infrastructure improvements, the provision of skills needs places, research and development and IT-related school based projects.  As a result, <Col N="1186" /> institutions are now proceeding as quickly as possible to implement the planning of these projects and to secure tenders.</P>
      <P>The £19 million expended to date must therefore be viewed in the context of the larger development programme which has been put in place.  One of the features of this scheme is that funding is available and has been set aside for specific projects and the institutions are therefore in a position to proceed with the implementation programme on that basis.</P>
      <P>I am glad to report that excellent progress has been made to date with the implementation of the scheme.  At this stage, detailed estimated cash-flows are being prepared for the projects but initial indications are that in excess of £45 million will have been expended from the fund by the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the very purpose of the fund is to introduce certainty to the planning of the projects and, as such, it is the duration of the programme that matters and not the intended expenditure in 12 months.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 375 of 24 November 1998, he will give the comparative data for 1998 and 1999 on the basis of projected student participation and projected spending; and if he will provide the spending figures according to outruns and estimates as published and on the basis of no change having been made in the timing of payment to local authorities.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the outturn for 1998 is not avail able, the Estimate for 1998 in respect of the higher education grants scheme is £36 million. With the exception of £890,000 representing an accrued expense from 1997, the 1998 Estimate represents the expected recoupment to local authorities in respect of expenditure to be incurred by them on higher education grants in 1998.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I would point out to the Deputy that a payment of £11.2 million was made in December 1997 to enable the local authorities to issue the second instalment of grants due for the 1997-98 academic year, before the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>The Estimate in respect of the higher education grants scheme for 1999 as set out in the Abridged Estimates volume is £43.5 million.  As the Deputy is aware, the Estimates provisions are only the first stage in the process of determining specific allocations, improvements and initiatives across all sectors of education.  This process will extend over the next number of months and I will convey the necessary details as decisions are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If no change had been made in the timing of payments to local authorities and recoupment was still made a year in arrears, the 1998 payments to local authorities would have been for <Col N="1187" /> the amounts expended by them in 1997, i.e. £64 million.  When one attempts to compare year on year expenditure on the higher education grants scheme it is necessary to have regard to the range of factors at play, namely: the payment of the second instalment of grant for the 1997-8 academic year in late 1997; the transfer of fee payments in respect of new entrants previously made by the local authorities to direct payment by my Department under the free fees initiative; the increase in student numbers; and the increase in the level of grant awards.</P>
    <P>A tentative estimate of the number of students benefiting under the scheme in 1998-9 and 1999-2000 is 29,000 and 30,000, respectively.</P>
